The '''''Accra Evening News''''' was a daily newspaper established in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) in 1948 by [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. The paper's appearance marked the foundation of the press in the country as a powerful means to mobilize people, and was followed by publication of the ''Morning Telegraph'' of [[Sekondi]] appeared in January 1949, and then the ''Daily Mail'' of [[Cape Coast]].&lt;ref name=James /&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the ''Accra Evening News'' appeared as a one-sheet paper on 3 September 1948, when Nkrumah was dismissed from his post as General Secretary of the [[United Gold Coast Convention]].&lt;ref name=Addo/&gt;

As [[C. L. R. James]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Evening News sold all copies it could print. It was besieged by news vendors, and the editors of those days claimed that if they had had the facilities to print they would have sold 50,000 copies a day in Accra, a town of 150,000 people, of whom a large proportion was illiterate. Copies were passed from hand to hand.

This was the way Nkrumah mobilized the people of the Gold Coast against British imperialism. This was the birth of African freedom."&lt;ref name=James&gt;C. L. R. James, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3rIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=%22accra+evening+news%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=orJcu2G8CJ&amp;sig=SWTAGjRDdq4Q_Gt_rCOkjfXTO1M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI6O3gqLbVxwIVx20UCh1Gswrv#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accra%20evening%20news%22&amp;f=false "Kwame Nkrumah: Founder of African Emancipation"], in ''[[Black World (magazine)|Black World]]'', July 1972 (pp. 4–10), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The paper became a mouthpiece for the [[Convention People's Party]] until it was banned the following year by the colonial government.&lt;ref name=Bourret/&gt;

The '''Action at Kalmas''' was a battle between the [[British Army]] and a group of [[guerrilla]] fighters in [[Afghanistan]] in 1916.

On 26 September 1916 an action took place at [[Kalmas]], thirty miles north of [[Nasratabad Sipi]], between a small British detachment and some gun-runners moving a convoy of arms towards [[Afghanistan]]. 2nd-Lt [[B. W. Wahl]], with 23 [[sowar]]s of the [[23rd Light Cavalry]] and 36 levies, surprised and attacked the gun-runners. The whole convoy was captured, four of its escort being killed and one taken prisoner. However, Lt Wahl and one sowar of the 23rd Light Cavalry were killed in the cavalry charge which opened the action.

'''Astra''' is the brand name for a number of [[geostationary satellite|geostationary]] [[communication satellite]]s, both individually and as a group, which are owned and operated by [[SES S.A.]], a global satellite operator based in [[Betzdorf, Luxembourg|Betzdorf]], in eastern [[Luxembourg]]. The name is also used to describe the pan-European broadcasting system provided by these satellites, the [[channel (communications)|channels]] carried on them, and even the reception equipment.

At the time of the launch of the first Astra satellite, [[Astra 1A]] in 1988, the satellite's operator was known as '''''Société Européenne des Satellites'''''. In 2001 [[SES Astra]], a newly formed subsidiary of SES, operated the Astra satellites and in September 2011, SES Astra was consolidated back into the parent company, which by this time also operated other satellite families such as [[SES Americom|AMC]], and [[SES World Skies|NSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=SES |date=September 9, 2011 |url=http://en.ses.com/4233325/news/2011/7725000 |title=New logo and brand identity presented at IBC in Amsterdam |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926120837/http://en.ses.com/4233325/news/2011/7725000 |archivedate=September 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SES_Operates_Under_New_Management_Structure_999.html ''SES Operates Under New Management Structure''] Space Daily.

Astra satellites broadcast 2,600 [[Digital data|digital]] [[television]] channels (675 in [[High-definition television|high definition]]) via five main satellite orbital positions to [[household]]s across [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[Africa]], [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[New Zealand]], [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Magan [http://www.satellitetoday.com/broadcasting/2016/01/13/ses-tv-channels-grow-by-11-3-percent-in-2015/ ''SES TV Channels Grow by 11.3 Percent in 2015''] Satellite Today January 13, 2016. Accessed December 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The satellites have been instrumental in the establishment of satellite TV and the introduction of [[digital TV]], [[HDTV]], [[3D TV]], and [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV|HbbTV]] in Europe.

A book, ''[[High Above (book)|High Above]]'', telling the story of the creation and development of the Astra satellites and their contribution to developments in the European TV and media industry, was published in April 2010 to mark the 25th Anniversary of SES.

==Satellites==
There are 16 operational Astra satellites, the majority in five orbital locations - [[Astra 19.2°E]], [[Astra 28.2°E]], [[Astra 23.5°E]], [[Astra 5°E]],  [[Astra 31.5°E]]. Astra's principle of "co-location" (several satellites are maintained close to each other, all within a cube with a size of 150&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref&gt;Bains, Geoff "The [[Failsafe]] Family" ''What Satellite &amp; Digital TV'' April, 2012 pp29&lt;/ref&gt;) increases flexibility and redundancy.

==Manufacture and launch==
Astra satellites have been designed by [[Boeing Satellite Systems]] (formerly [[Hughes Space and Communications]]), [[Airbus Defence and Space]] (formerly [[Astrium]]), [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel Space]], and [[Lockheed Martin]]. The Astra satellites within a family are not identical, for example of the Astra 2 satellites; 2A and 2C are BSS [[601HP]]s, 2B is an Astrium Eurostar E2000+ and 2D is a BSS 376.

The satellites have been launched by [[Arianespace]] [[Ariane (rocket)|rockets]] from [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]], [[International Launch Services]] [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket]]s from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]], and ILS [[Atlas V|Atlas]] rockets from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], USA.  The satellites are launched into an elliptical "temporary transfer orbit" from where they use onboard propulsion to reach their final circular [[geostationary orbit]]s, at nearly {{convert|36000|km}} altitude. Proton rockets fitted with a fourth stage propulsion unit are capable of launching the satellites several thousand kilometres higher (at the closest point of the elliptical orbit) than Ariane rockets. As a result, most satellites launched in this way have to use less fuel to reach their geostationary orbit, increasing their lifetime.

===Sirius and Astra 4A===
The [[Sirius (satellite)|Sirius]] series of satellites (not connected with the North American [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] service) was started in 1993 with the purchase of the [[British Satellite Broadcasting|BSB]] Marcopolo 1 satellite (renamed Sirius 1) by  [[Nordic Satellite AB]] (NSAB) for [[Direct broadcast satellite|direct to home]] broadcasts to the Nordic and Baltic regions from the 5° east orbital position. Subsequent satellites launched to this location include Sirius 2 (1997), Sirius 3 (1998) and Sirius 4 (2007) and the position's coverage has been expanded to include Eastern Europe and Africa.

In 2000, SES (then SES Astra) bought the 50% shareholding in NSAB owned by Teracom and Tele Danmark and in 2003 increased that holding to 75%, renaming the company SES Sirius AB. In 2008 Astra acquired further shares to take its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90% and in March 2010 took full control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=March 5, 2010 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2010/4487003|title=SES ASTRA TAKES FULL OWNERSHIP OF SES SIRIUS | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the affiliate company was renamed SES Astra and the Sirius 4 satellite renamed Astra 4A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2010/4489346|title= SES SIRIUS BECOMES SES ASTRA | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astra 4A designation was originally given in 2005 to part of the NSS-10 craft (33 transponders) owned by another subsidiary of SES, [[SES New Skies]], and positioned at 37.5° west for broadcast, data, and telecommunications into Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA |date=February 17, 2006|url= http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2006/4445997|title= SES Global Africa completes first successful year in African business | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 to part of the Sirius 4 satellite (six transponders of the FSS Africa beam) owned and operated by SES Sirius. From June 2010, the Astra 4A designation has applied to the entire satellite previously known as Sirius 4.

===Failures===
[[Astra 1K]], the largest commercial communications satellite ever built at the time, was ordered by SES in 1997. It was launched by Proton rocket on November 26, 2002. The rocket lifted off as planned and reached its [[parking orbit]] at which point the final stage of the rocket was to initiate a second burn to transfer the satellite to its geostationary orbit. This did not occur and the satellite was released into the parking orbit, making it unusable. The only way to recover the satellite would have been the use of a [[Space Shuttle]], however this was rejected. On December 10, 2002 SES instructed Alcatel Space (the manufacturer) and the French Space Agency [[CNES]] to deorbit the satellite, it broke up on re-entry over the [[Pacific Ocean]].

On January 16, 2009 [[Astra 5A]] at [[Astra 31.5°E|31.5° east]] "experienced a technical anomaly leading to the end of the spacecraft’s mission"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES ASTRA|date=January 16, 2009|url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2009/4468235|title=SES ASTRA Announces End Of ASTRA 5A Spacecraft Mission | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some four years ahead of the spacecraft's expected end of life. Traffic carried by the satellite (especially channels for German cable service, [[Kabel Deutschland]]) was transferred to [[Astra 23.5°E]]. In March 2009, SES (then SES Astra) announced that in April, the [[Astra 2C]] satellite was to be moved from the [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] position to 31.5° east to temporarily take over Astra 5A's mission until Astra 3B is launched to [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5° east]], when another craft currently there can be released to 31.5° east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=SES Astra |date=March 10, 2009 |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2009/4469428|title=SES To Move ASTRA 2C Satellite To 31.5 Degrees East To Support Development Of New Orbital Position | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move of Astra 2C was started in May and completed on May 11&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/headlines.html ''Astra 2C arrived at 31.5 East'']. LyngSat. Retrieved June 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with the first transponders coming into use at the new position in the subsequent two weeks.

==Broadcasting statistics==
At the end of 2015, Astra satellite broadcasts were received in 156 million households in Europe. In all, 35% of all European TV households receive DTH satellite TV, 26% receive cable TV, 12% receive IPTV, and 27% receive terrestrial broadcasts. With provision via DTH, cable and IPTV, 61% of European TV homes receive TV from Astra satellites. 71% of all European homes that receive satellite TV, receive TV from Astra satellites; and 93% of all homes that receive IPTV or cable, receive TV from Astra satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://extranet.ses.com/22068151/SatMo-YE15.pdf ''The year in numbers - SES reach by end of 2015''] www.ses.com.

== Synopsis ==
In this scathing satirical drama that takes place in a village of West Africa, an untutored pig-keeper who has been thrown out of his home falls into a river and has a vision which sends him back to his people to save them for [[Jesus Christ]], introducing himself as Magloire I, “the cousin of Christ.” A little crazy, a little robber, while some think he is a charlatan and others think he is a prodigy, he reigns as an absolute master and pushes his convictions to extremes, like being crucified. This movie recalls with humour the proliferation of pseudo-Christian sects and the outrageous acts they can convey in a continent like [[Africa]], tossed about tradition, modernity and power.

'''Banco Galliano''' was the oldest [[bank]] in the [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].

==History==
In 1855 [[Antonio Luis Galliano]] (1803–1866) and his family, immigrants from [[Genoa]] via [[Cádiz]], established '''A.L. Galliano Bankers''' in Gibraltar, better known as ''Banco Galliano'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or ''Galliano's Bank'' in [[English language|English]]. This family-owned bank was Gibraltar’s oldest bank, though it did not [[incorporation (business)|incorporate]] until August 1978. (Before that it was a partnership.) In 1987 [[Jyske Bank]] acquired Banco Galliano renaming it '''Jyske Bank (Gibraltar) Limited'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecbs.org/banks/gibraltar/jyske-bank-gibraltar-ltd./view-details.html Jyske Bank (Gibraltar) Limited - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the latter half of the 19th century, Galliano's bank started to face competition. The [[Anglo-Egyptian Bank]] (later [[Barclays]]) opened a branch in 1888, and [[Crédit Foncier de France|Credit Foncier]] (later [[Crédit Agricole]]) entered in 1920. There were also, by the start of the 20th century, four other small, family-owned banks - [[Cuby Brothers]], [[Benzecry]] (''El Banquerito''), [[Rugeroni Brothers]], and [[Marrache and Sons]] - but by 1940 these had ceased operating.

A.L. Galliano Bankers survived the [[Great Depression]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and both [[world war]]s, albeit with difficulty. [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] [[Francis Galliano|Francis (Paco) Galliano]] [[OBE]], the last Galliano to own and run the bank, entered the bank in 1944 at the age of 17. He became a [[partner (business rank)|partner]] in 1953 and the senior partner in 1964. His son, [[Frank Galliano]] was General Manager until the takeover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2847">The '''Dale Youth boxing club''' is an amateur boxing club in London that operated from a gym in [[Grenfell Tower]] on the [[Lancaster West Estate]]. It has produced many champions, but lost its premises in the 2017 [[Grenfell Tower fire|fire]] that destroyed the tower.

==History==
Before moving into the [[Grenfell Tower]] the club used a church hall, affectionately called "The Morgue".&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

Since 1999 or 2000 the club had occupied a {{convert|190|sqm|sqyd|adj=on}} gym on the ground floor in the podium of the Grenfell Tower. During the two-year refurbishment it moved into temporary accommodation in a section of the basement garages of the "finger blocks"; in November 2016 it then moved to a new {{convert|287|sqm|sqyd|adj=on}} venue on the walkway level of the tower.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bunce|first1=Steve|title=Lost to the Grenfell Tower flames but the spirit of Dale Youth boxing club lives on|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/grenfell-tower-fire-dale-youth-boxing-club-spirit-perseveres-a7801831.html|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="960664.pdf"&gt;[https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/idoxWAM/doc/Other-960664.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=960664&amp;location=VOLUME2&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;pageCount=1 Grenfell Tower regeneration Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617013611/https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/idoxWAM/doc/Other-960664.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=960664&amp;location=VOLUME2&amp;contentType=application%2Fpdf&amp;pageCount=1 |date=2017-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything was lost in the [[Grenfell Tower fire]] on 14 June 2017, and the club moved back to its former temporary accommodation.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; Volunteers are helping prepare new premises for the gym and a community centre through the television programme ''[[DIY SOS]]''.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-44125296 |title=Duke of Cambridge joins DIY SOS Grenfell crew |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=15 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaches==
There have been many coaches over the club's history. Mick Delaney, who runs the club, has been with it since 1978 and Gary McGuiness since approximately 2000.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

==Notable boxers==
Boxers trained at the club include Olympic gold medal winner [[James DeGale]], super middleweight world champion [[George Groves (boxer)|George Groves]]&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; and heavyweight [[Daniel Dubois (boxer)|Daniel Dubois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Christie |url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/dale-youth-abc-will-rise-again-after-the-grenfell-tower-fire/ |title=Dale Youth ABC will rise again after the Grenfell Tower fire |newspaper=Boxing News |date=16 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danish Red''' cattle, also known as '''Red Danish''' or '''Red Dane''', are a major [[dairy cattle]] breed in northern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/danishred/ Oklahoma State University breeds of livestock]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embryoplus.com/cattle_danish_red.html Embryo Plus cattle breeds - Danish Red]&lt;/ref&gt; There are 42,599 pedigree cows in [[Denmark]]. They can be used as a beef breed once they finish their useful lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vaex.nl/vv/int-eng/cattle/breeding-cattle/dairy-breeds/danish-red.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Breed ==
The breed was developed in [[Denmark]] based on local breeds bred with [[Angeln cattle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/angeln/ Oklahoma State University breeds of livestock- Angeln Cattle]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Angeln]], [[Schleswig]].  Danish Red cattle (and, earlier, Angeln cattle) have been imported to many other countries and have been used to improve and form many local breeds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiho-hannover.de/einricht/zucht/eaap/groups/c4_3.htm EAAP Similar central European breeds ]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Lithuanian Red]], [[Estonian Red]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embryoplus.com/cattle_estonian_red.html Embryo Plus cattle breeds - Estonian Red]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvian Red]], [[Polish Red]], [[Belarus Red]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embryoplus.com/cattle_belarus_red.html Embryo Plus cattle breeds - Belarus Red]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/belarusred/ Oklahoma State University breeds of livestock- Belarus Red Cattle]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tambov Red]] (Russian Red), Bulgarian Red, etc.

The solid red color of these breeds has helped in making them popular for crossbreeding in tropical countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/X6500E/X6500E13.htm Food and agriculture organisation World Animal Review]&lt;/ref&gt;
with red [[Zebu]] dairy breeds like [[Sahiwal cattle|Sahiwal]], [[Red Sindhi cattle|Red Sindhi]] and [[Butana cattle|Butana]].  They are good milk cows, yielding milk with higher butter fat and protein content than the [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein Friesian]] does.

{{Politics of Ghana}}
'''Elections in Ghana''' gives information on election and election results in [[politics of Ghana|Ghana]].

Ghana elects on national level a [[head of state]], the president, and a legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term by the people. The [[Parliament of Ghana]] has 275 members, elected for a four-year term in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
The presidential election is won by having more than 50% of valid votes cast,  whilst the parliamentary elections is won by simple majority, and, as is predicted by [[Duverger's law]], the [[voting system]] has encouraged Ghanaian politics into a [[two-party system]], creating extreme difficulty for anybody attempting to achieve electoral success under any banner other than those of the two dominant parties. Elections have been held every four years since 1992.  Presidential and parliamentary elections are held alongside each other, generally on 7 December.

'''Evidence Informed Policy Network (EVIPNet)''' is a network,  sponsored by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which attempts to improve [[public health]], especially in [[developing country|developing countries]], by coordinating the efforts of policymakers and health researchers.

==History==

EVIPNet grew out of discussions at the Ministerial Summit on Health Research held in [[Mexico City]], November 16–20, 2004. Following the Summit, the [[World Health Assembly]] which governs the World Health Organization passed Resolution 58.2, 4-5 endorsing the "''Mexico Statement On Health Research: Knowledge for better health''" developed during the Summit.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid M, Bustamante-Manaog T, Dung TV, Akkhavong K, Fu H, Ma Y, Zhong X, Salmela R, Panisset U, Pang, T. EVIPNet: translating the spirit of Mexico. The Lancet. 2005. 366(9499): 1758-1760. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67709-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the statement, [[Health minister|Ministers of Health]] and delegates called "for national [[government]]s to establish sustainable programs to support evidence-based public health and health care delivery systems, and evidence-based health related policies." Resolution 58.34 made a call "to establish or strengthen mechanisms to transfer knowledge in support of evidence-based public health and health-care delivery systems, and evidence-based health-related policies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/WHA58_34-en.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422171533/http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA58/WHA58_34-en.pdf|date=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments relevant to EVIPNet are regularly reported to the Advisory Committee on Health Research of the World Health Organization and of its Regional Offices.

In March 2009 the EVIPNet Secretariat presented to WHO’s Advisory Committee on Health Research a capacity building strategy that assesed through a validated tool the knowledge needs with respect to a defined set of skills for EVIPNet teams, allowing a strategic and organized approach to capacity building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/rpc/advisory_committee/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Advisory Committee on Health Research &amp;#124; ACHR |publisher=Who.int |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, WHO Regional Advisory Committees on Health Research monitor progress and provide key guidance to EVIPNet efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1842&amp;Itemid=1654&amp;lang=en |title=Advisory Committee on Health Research (ACHR) |publisher=New.paho.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EVIPNet gained great momentum in Africa where policy briefs soon became available.&lt;ref&gt;Lavis JN, Panisset U. EVIPNet Africa's first series of policy briefs to support evidence-informed policymaking. Int. J. of Tech. Assessment in Health Care. 2010. 26(2): 229-232. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462310000206&lt;/ref&gt;. The enthusiasm had spread also to the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean, and after a coordination [http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/204661 meeting organized by WHO in Addis Ababa in October 2015], it gained traction in the European region as well.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Regional Office for Africa. (2016). EVIPNetAfrica Meeting, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 14–16 October 2015: Final Report. World Health Organization. Regional Office for Africa. http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/204661 &lt;/ref&gt;  By then, the Global Steering Group working with WHO Collaborating Centers (e.g. [http://apps.who.int/whocc/Detail.aspx?cc_ref=CAN-72&amp;cc_title=who%20collaborating%20centre%20for%20evidence-informed%20policy&amp; WHO Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy, at McMaster Universit]y)and specialized centers such as BIREME, the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information - had set up one-stop shops that enabled access to specialized collections of indexed policy briefs, systematic reviews, policy documents and other relevant resources, as one of the shared resources for the global EVIPNet networks. For example, the free access portals (with registration) of [https://www.healthsystemsevidence.org/ Health Systems Evidence] and [https://www.healthevidence.org/ Health Evidence].&lt;ref&gt;Moat K. A., Lavis J. N.. Apoyar el empleo de investigaciones sanitarias de la más alta calidad (evidencias) en las Américas, mediante un servicio de ventanilla única online: el EVIPNet BVS. Cad. Saúde Pública  [Internet]. 2014  Dec [cited  2018  July  27] ;  30( 12 ): 2697-2701. Available from: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-311X2014001202697&amp;lng=en.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00110214.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In October 2016 The World Health Organization published an executive summary and document entitled "[http://www.who.int/evidence/resources/publication/en/ Evipnet 10 years 10 stories]" with a selection of cases describing impacts of EVIPNet at country level.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/250582/1/WHO-HIS-IER-REK-16.03-eng.pdf?ua=1 EVIPNet in action- Executive Summary: WHO. 2016. WHO/HIS/IER/REK/16.03] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;WHO.

In the meanwhile, the platform expanded especially in the European region. &lt;ref&gt;Kuchenmueller T, Bekker M,. Workshop: Mapping the European knowledge translation landscape: Insights from five EVIPNet Europe members. European Journal of Public Health, Volume 27, Issue suppl_3, 1 November 2017, ckx187.642, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckx187.642&lt;/ref&gt;

In November-December 2016, PAHO's [http://www.paho.org/achr/46 46th Advisory Committee on Health Research] convened and its report, issued in 2017, provided updates on EVIPNet and knoweldge translation efforts in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Pan American Health Organization. 46th Session of the Advisory Committee on Health Research. (Washington, D.C., 28-30 November 2016). Washington, D.C.: PAHO; 2017. http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/34305&lt;/ref&gt;. The meeting was informed by a preliminary version of a Report on Strengthening Research Capacities in the Caribbean that described EVIPNet related technical cooperation in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Pan American Health Organization. Report on Strengthening Research Capacities for Health in the Caribbean, 2007-2017. Washington, D.C.: PAHO; 2017. Available at http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/34342.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In July 2018 The [https://www.bmj.com/health-research-americas BMJ published a special series on the policy on research for health]  of the Pan American Health Organization (that applies to the Secretariat and Member States) featuring EVIPNet in the article on [https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k2469 Advancing public health and health systems through evidence-informed policy in the Americas]. &lt;ref&gt;Pantoja T, Barreto JM, Panisset U. Improving public health and health systems through evidence informed policy in the Americas. BMJ 2018;362:k2469.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Operation==

EVIPNet operated by forming [[country]] or [[region]]al-level teams composed of policy makers, researchers and representatives from other sectors (e.g. science &amp; technology, education, civil society organizations, patient advocates, topic experts, local networks, etc.). These teams identify and address country priority topics where a perceived need to strengthen the systematic use of research evidence to inform decisions about policies for health has been identified. EVIPNet therefore includes components relevant to [[research and development]] and claims to help strengthen national health research systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=52A099D7FAD58031 |title=Evipnet |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By providing a common purpose to team members EVIPNet facilitates that different sectors jointly address specific priorities and develop and use specific skills to assess research evidence and integrate it into policies. Frequent outputs of EVIPNet teams are policy briefs that integrate evidence with context and values on succinct and helpful documents that inform decisions by high level decision makers. Several EVIPNet teams have already delivered useful relevant outputs such as Policy Briefs and deliverative dialogues that have informed policy at national and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John N. Lavisa1 and Ulysses Panisseta2 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7527836 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil.evipnet.org/ |title=EVIPNet Brasil |publisher=Brasil.evipnet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To join EVIPNet country health authorities establish a formal commitment with the Secretariat and develop a work proposal. The Secretariat of EVIPNet is composed by staff from the research policy teams of the [[World health organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) in [[Geneva]] and its Regional Offices. The EVIPNet Secretariat supports country teams so that they produce robust proposals. EVIPNet has Steering Groups (in the regional and global network) and resource groups in each region. These groups work with experts and networks to provide feedback and expertise to the country teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evipnet.org/ |title=Evipnet |publisher=Evipnet |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat works with country teams to identify and address skill needs and deliver targeted capacity building activities in collaboration with networks and partners (e.g. SUPPORT Collaboration, McMaster Health Forum, [[Cochrane Collaboration]], etc.)

==Reception and impact==

As EVIPNet expands and develops it has been highlighted as a worthy approach featured in prominent strategy documents addressing development and capacity building for research for health. It remains relevant as reflected in the call to action issued at the Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health in [[Bamako]] in November 2008 by ministers and ministerial representatives from 53 countries.&lt;ref name="WHO's Role"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB124/B124_12Add2-en.pdf|title=WHO's Role and Responsibilities in Health Research|publisher=Apps.who.int|accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; EVIPNet was also featured in at least 12 different presentations at the First Global Symposium on Health Systems Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsr-symposium.org/ |title=Global Symposium on Health Systems Research (HSR) :: Beijing, People's Republic of China, 31 October - 3 November 2012 |publisher=Hsr-symposium.org |date=2012-11-03 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Montreux|Montreux, Switzerland]], 2010), and is frequently featured at Colloquiums of the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations, and Global Forums on Health Research (e.g. Bamako 2008, Havana 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2795&amp;Itemid=931&amp;lang=en |title=Strengthening National Health Research Systems |publisher=New.paho.org |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/events/colloquia |title=Annual Colloquia &amp;#124; The Cochrane Collaboration |publisher=Cochrane.org |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EVIPNet has also allowed for the development of customized resources that have helped advance their work and knowledge about health systems research. For example, the SUPPORT Tools for Evidence Informed Policy Making (available in various languages),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4468&amp;Itemid=931&amp;lang=en |title=SUPPORT Tools for Evidence-Informed Policy-Making (STP): accessible in four languages |publisher=New.paho.org |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Evidence Portal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evidencias.bvsalud.org/php/index.php?lang=en |title=Evidence Portal |publisher=Evidencias.bvsalud.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the McMaster Database on Health Systems Evidence with &gt;1800 systematic reviews on health systems evidence.

==PAHO/WHO technical programs==

EVIPNet has also become a tool for PAHO/WHO technical programs offering an integrated approach to technical cooperation; in PAHO/WHO research focal points in country offices are part of EVIPNet teams, and technical programs have adopted EVIPNet methods to provide an integrated technical cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/researchportal/EVIPNet |title=Update. Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (June 5 2009) |publisher=Paho.org |date=2009-06-05 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balliol arms.svg|thumb|Balliol arms: ''Gules an orle argent'']]
The '''House of Balliol''' (de Bailleul) was a [[nobility|noble]] family originating from the village of [[Bailleul, Somme|Bailleul]] in [[Picardy]].  They held estates in England, granted during the reign of King [[William Rufus]].  Through marriage, they had [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|claims to the Throne of Scotland]].  One member of the family, [[John Balliol]], was named King of Scotland after the disputed succession following extinction of the [[House of Dunkeld|Dunkeld line]].  John was deposed, leading to the [[First War of Scottish Independence]].  His son, [[Edward Balliol]], also briefly controlled the Scottish throne during the [[Second War of Scottish Independence]].  Edward had no issue, and the direct line went extinct with him.

==List of heads of the Balliol estates==
* [[Guy I de Balliol]] (died before 1130 × 1133), established lordship in northern England in 1090s
* [[Bernard I de Balliol]] (died 1154 x 1162), nephew of Guy
* [[Guy II de Balliol]] (died early 1160s x 1167), son of Bernard
* [[Bernard II de Balliol]] (died c. 1190), brother of above
* [[Eustace de Balliol]] (died c. 1209), cousin of above
* [[Hugh de Balliol]] (died 1229), son of above
* [[John I de Balliol]] (died 1268), son of above, the founder of [[Balliol College]]
* [[John II de Balliol]] (died 1314), son of above, ruled from 1292 to 1296, and claimed the throne as great-great-great-grandson of [[David I of Scotland]] of the [[House of Dunkeld]].
* [[Edward Balliol|Edward de Balliol]] (died 1364), eldest son of John, who from 1332 to about 1338 was a pretender to the Scottish throne in opposition to [[David II of Scotland]] with support of the English.

Both Balliols had English support for their claims; both were deposed. Edward died without issue, but the Balliol descent continued through his cousin Christine de Lindsay (granddaughter of John II), who married [[Enguerrand V, Lord of Coucy]], to the lords of [[Château de Coucy|Coucy]] and ultimately the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings of France and Spain.

&lt;!--NOTE: UK bands by convention of British English here are described as WERE. Do not use WAS!--&gt;
'''Jokers Wild''' were an English [[Rock music|Rock]] band formed in Cambridge in 1964.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-3"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Omnibus | isbn = 9781849383707 | last = Mabbett | first = Andy | title = Pink Floyd - The Music and the Mystery | location = London | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atagong.com"&gt;[http://atagong.com/iggy/archives/2012/05/rip-clive-welham-a-biscuit-tin-with-knives.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The line-up included guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]]. Gilmour went on to join the band [[Pink Floyd]] and Parry went on to become a session musician, playing on three Pink Floyd studio albums and one live album.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-3" /&gt; Parry also went on to join [[On an Island Tour|Gilmour's 2006 solo tour]].

==Recording sessions==
Their only releases were a privately pressed, single-sided [[studio album]] (carrying catalogue number RSLP 007) and [[single (music)|single]] (RSR 0031), of which only forty or fifty copies each were made. These were recorded at Regent Sound studio in Denmark Street, London.&lt;ref name="Mabbett-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=toby11&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Toby|title=The Rough Guide to Pink Floyd|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=1-84353-575-0|edition=1st|page=10|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tape recording of the LP is held by the [[British Library]]'s [[British Library Sound Archive]].&lt;ref name="Mabbett-3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reference C-625/1, [http://cadensa.bl.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi/4FR9hTOPPT/WORKS-FILE/293930044/8/114866/Jokers+Wild Cadensa.bl.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with record producer [[Jonathan King]], they recorded what was to have been a UK cover version of [[Sam &amp; Dave]]'s "[[Hold On, I'm Comin' (song)|Hold On, I'm Comin']]", but the original was released in the UK, so Jokers Wild's version was not released.&lt;ref name=toby11/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">Responsibility for maintaining law and order in [[Algeria]] is shared by the 60,000-member [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Algeria)|Gendarmerie Nationale]], under the Ministry of National Defense, and the 30,000-member [[Sûreté Nationale (Algeria)|Sûreté Nationale]], or national [[police]] force, under the Ministry of Interior. The Gendarmerie Nationale is mainly active in rural and remote areas of the country, while the Sûreté Nationale is primarily an urban police force. There are also 94,000 Municipal Guards. They have as primary duty protect the villages and act as an auxiliary force of the law enforcement.

During the [[Algerian Civil War]], the Guards were the primary targets of the terrorists ([[List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Algerian_Civil_War|Armed opposition]]), with 4,000 Guards killed in action since 1994. Algeria’s various security forces have been involved in [[counterterrorism]] operations and have been accused of breaches of [[Human rights in Algeria|Human rights]] and excesses in the battle against [[Islamist]] groups. They also face complaints of harassing journalists. &lt;ref name="LOCprof"&gt;Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf Algeria (March 2006) profile] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Howard Stern Show'' staff}}
{{Original research|date=February 2016}} 
Throughout its run spanning four decades and multiple media, ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' has been home to a number of staff members and contributors.

==Current staff==
These staffers currently work for and appear on the show on a regular, if not hourly basis.
===In-studio===
These people currently sit in the studio throughout the entire broadcast.
====Howard Stern====
{{Main|Howard Stern}}
Howard Stern is the host of the show, which essentially is a discussion of topics that include world affairs, celebrity gossip, [[self-deprecation]], bodily functions, conflicts among his staff, his own personal family matters, and the antics of the show's [[Wack Pack]].&lt;ref name="PrivateParts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stern |first=Howard|title=Private Parts|year=1993|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-671-50100-3|page=688|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTJFsGNJwyYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-proclaimed "King of All Media".

====Robin Quivers====
{{Main|Robin Quivers}}
Robin Ophelia Quivers is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and first met Stern after being assigned as his newswoman at [[WWDC]] in March 1981. She has been his co-host and news reader ever since. She is a former nurse and Captain in the United States Air Force. Quivers briefly left the show towards the end of her time at WWDC when Stern made a deal at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in 1982, and did not realize WNBC initially refused to hire her. Quivers returned to the show at WNBC a month after Stern.&lt;ref name="QuiversOfLife"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quivers|first=Robin|title=Quivers, A Life|year=1995|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-06-039153-7|page=341 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Fj1h-gIbUsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern once said that Quivers is the only person on the show that he allowed to talk freely during the broadcast, although comedian [[Artie Lange]] was allowed this privilege as well during his years on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news07/12-17.htm#wed|title=The History Of Howard Stern Day 3 – Howard Meets Robin In Washington DC. |date=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fred Norris====
{{Main|Fred Norris}}
Of the show's staff, Stern met Norris first, in 1979, when the two worked as disc jockeys at [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Norris worked the overnight slot, after which Stern hosted the morning slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |author2=Larry "Ratso" Sloman|editor=[[Judith Regan]]|title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |edition=1st|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-671-88016-3 |oclc=28968496|page=127|chapter=Mein Kampf "My Struggle"|quote=But there was one good thing about Hartford. I met Fred "Earth Dog" Norris there. Fred was going to college and he was the overnight guy. He was a funny guy and a good writer and he had a knack for doing impressions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Stern left shortly afterwards, Norris stayed at WCCC until joining Stern and Quivers at Washington, D.C.'s [[WWDC]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="PrivateParts" /&gt; The "Earth Dog Fred" nickname originated in Washington, as Norris replaced an engineer nicknamed "Earth Dog Brent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luigi Lucaire|title=Howard Stern A To Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6H9C0Z6EYEC&amp;pg=PT37|accessdate=5 June 2012|date=15 January 1997|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-15144-7|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris is married to Allison (née Furman) and they have one daughter, Tess.

Norris' current role on the show is to provide [[sound effects]], organize and direct commercials and live reads, and occasionally perform writing duties. Norris also provides impersonations of show regulars, celebrities and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/whoswho/fre.htm |title=Who's Who |publisher=MarksFriggin.com |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShowBios2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/bio.hs |title=Stern Show Bios |publisher=Howardstern.com |accessdate=June 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527220953/http://www.howardstern.com/bio.hs |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====George Takei====
{{Main|George Takei}}
[[File:George Takei.jpg|thumb|George Takei]]

George Takei occasionally serves as the show's announcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news10/12-6.htm#tue|title=Monday, January 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the show, Takei became popular among the cast after [[soundbites]] of his audiobook about his career on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' were played on the show. The clips stood out due to his deep [[baritone]] voice and pitch perfect enunciation, and, thus, were frequently played on the show. In 2006, when the show moved to [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius]], Stern announced that Takei was the show's official announcer.

===Outside the studio===
These are the behind-the-scenes personnel, although in the Stern world, many of these staff members appear on air.

====Steve Brandano====
Brandano, previously known as "Steve The Intern," answers Stern's phones, is a contributor on ''[[The Wrap-Up Show]]'', and was formerly the host of the Thursday night intern show.

====Benjy Bronk====
Benjy Bronk (born Sept. 4, 1967)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmz.com/person/benjy-bronk/&lt;/ref&gt; began working on ''The Howard Stern Show'' as an intern in 1998. Bronk eventually earned a paid position conducting pre-interviews of show guests and gathering articles for [[Robin Quivers]]' news. In 2000, Benjy was given an in-studio seat next to writers [[Jackie Martling]] and [[Fred Norris]], writing on-the-spot jokes for Stern as the show transpired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/598 |title=Heeb HQ Benjy Bronk: The Heeb Interview |author=dreidel_hustler |publisher=Heeb Media, LLC |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120051813/http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/598 |archivedate=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Martling left the show in early 2001, Bronk continued as an in-studio joke writer with Norris. When the [[Howard Stern Show]] moved to Sirius satellite radio in January 2006, Bronk continued in his role as an in-studio joke writer. In October 2016, he was banished from the studio indefinitely after arriving late for work, the last in a long history of tardiness.

====Richard Christy====
{{Main|Richard Christy}}
While working as an electrician in Florida and playing as a drummer in a number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands including [[Iced Earth]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]], Christy began calling into the show from October 1999, initially sending voice mails to the show's assistant producer [[K. C. Armstrong]], which were played on-air. From 2001 to 2003, Christy sent song parodies and bits about Armstrong and show co-host [[The Howard Stern Show staff#Robin Quivers|Robin Quivers]] including some like "It's K.C.'s Sausage Party" (a parody of "[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)|It's My Party]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=gKc6NAK3G0M |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Gay Photograph" (a parody of the [[Def Leppard]] song "Photograph")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH3e-GzdEX4 |title=KC posed for gay photographs. |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continue to be played on the show to this day. Christy made his first visit to the show on April 24, 2003, where he played a round of blackjack to win a date with a porn star.

In July 2004, when the show was holding a "Win John's Job" contest following the departure of [[Stuttering John]] from the show, Christy won the position as voted by fans. Since joining the show, Christy has become known for his prank calls, song parodies, unique personality, and "show stunts" he's performed with his writing partner [[Sal the Stockbroker]].&lt;ref name="WinJohn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news04/6-28.htm#thu|title=''Get John's Job'' Elimination Round. |date=July 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy is currently the drummer in the heavy-metal band [[Charred Walls of the Damned]].

====Gary Dell'Abate====
{{Main|Gary Dell'Abate}}
Gary Dell'Abate, aka '''Baba Booey''', serves as the show's head producer. Hired right after graduating from [[Adelphi University]] in 1984 and briefly anglicizing his name to Gary Dell, he has worked for the show ever since. Dell'Abate is mocked on the Stern Show for his appearance, gullibility (he once booked a mentally challenged woman who claimed to be [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s sister), and frequent mispronunciations (for example, insisting that actor [[Nick Nolte]]'s last name was pronounced "Nolt"). He earned the nickname "Baba Booey" after insisting it to be the correct name of the cartoon character [[Baba Looey]].&lt;ref name="BabaBooey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dell'Abate|first=Gary|title=They Call Me Baba Booey|year=2010|publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau|isbn=1-4000-6955-6|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sal Governale====
Salvatore "Sal" Governale, sometimes referred to as '''Sal the Stockbroker''', was originally a frequent caller who worked as a stockbroker. Stern took notice after numerous calls mocking Gary Dell'Abate. Although he came in second in the "Win John's Job" contest to his future writing partner, [[Richard Christy]], Sal was eventually hired as a prank caller/writer for the show, and is now credited as a producer.

====J. D. Harmeyer====
Born in December 1979 in [[Fairborn, Ohio]], Jamie Daniel "J. D." Harmeyer is Stern's head media producer. He records television shows, pulls clips from the internet and edits together highlights from recent happenings in movies and TV. He attended [[Full Sail University]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;https://oceanviewpress.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/j-d-harmeyer-from-the-howard-stern-show/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jon Hein====
{{Main|Jon Hein}}
[[File:Jon Hein by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Jon Hein]]

Jon Hein made his first guest appearances on the show on May 3, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news01/4-30-01.htm |title=Jon Hein From JumpTheShark.com Comes In. |date=May 3, 2001|publisher=MarksFriggin |accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussing television shows that have "[[jumped the shark]]", a term he uses to describe when a show has passed its prime (based on an episode of the show, ''[[Happy Days]]'', where a previously popular and well-done show clearly and memorably began to go downhill). In late 2005, while experimental programming was broadcast on [[Howard 100 and Howard 101]], Hein presented the first edition of ''Superfan Roundtable''. His success in on-air hosting led him to become the co-host of ''[[The Wrap-Up Show]]'' when the show moved to [[Sirius XM]] in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news05/11-14.htm |title=More Letterman Discussions |date=November 18, 2005 |publisher=MarksFriggin |accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hein is also a cohost on the weekly Thursday show, "Jon Hein's TV Show" with [[J. D. Harmeyer]], [[Steve Brandano]], and Jenny Hutt, as well as the weekly Friday show "Geek Time" with Jason Kaplan and Ralph Cirella. The show has since been cancelled.

====Jason Kaplan====
Jason Kaplan is a senior producer for the show. He has many duties, including writing the daily show rundown that appears on the show's website, and taking photos that appear alongside the daily rundown. In September 2007, Jason and [[HowardTV]] director Scott DePace engaged in an intense feud stemming from their political differences.

Jason was married to his girlfriend, Janis on November 8, 2008. Notable guests at the ceremony included Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Gary Dell'Abate, as well as the majority of Stern's staff. The reception featured speeches from fellow staff members, Ronnie Mund and J. D. Harmeyer. Kaplan hosts "Page 69" along with Will Murray. On the wrap-up show on August 19, Kaplan stated that he grew up in Stanhope, NJ and attended [[Rutgers University]].

Kaplan hosted a monthly show called ''The Fat Guy Show,''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/servlet/Satellite?c=SXM_Channel_C&amp;childpagename=SXM/SXM_Channel_C/ChannelProgramList&amp;cid=1282009842244&amp;pagename=SXM/Wrapper&amp;packedargs=tzone%3DPacific |title=Hear the Revolution – Howard Stern – Entertainment – Howard 101 – SiriusXM Satellite Radio – SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan is also a producer of the monthly show ''Geek Time'' that airs on every Friday with Jon Hein and Ralph Cirella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/whoswho/jason.htm|title=Who's Who: Jason Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ronnie Mund====

====Steve Freid====
'''Steve "the Engineer" Freid''' first worked with Ben Stern and later worked with Howard when he arrived at K-Rock. He gained notoriety performing as the character '''Wood Yi''', a parody of actor/director [[Woody Allen]]. Billy West came up with the idea for the character in the early 1990s, and Steve was chosen to play the part due to having a similar-sounding voice. When performing as Wood Yi, Steve read lines supplied to him by the shows' staff, reciting them in a [[deadpan]] manner.

====Gary Garver====

[[File:Artielangesit.jpg|thumb|Artie Lange]]
{{Main|Artie Lange}}

Lange's first appearance on the show was as a guest alongside fellow comedian [[Norm Macdonald]] on January 8, 1998, following a bit involving [[Scott Salem|Scott the Engineer]] and his challenge to perform 17 complete [[push-up]]s. Although appearing with Macdonald to promote the film ''[[Dirty Work (1998 film)|Dirty Work]]'', Lange had been a fan of Stern since the 1980s when he used to listen with his father. In fact, after Lange's father was paralyzed in 1987, show producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]] sent Lange an autographed jacket which Lange auctioned off for $2,000 to help support his family.

Following the departure of the show's writer and comedian [[Jackie Martling|Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling]] in 2001, several comedians "auditioned" for Martling's seat by sitting in for a couple of shows. Lange's first appearance in what became known as "The Jackie Chair" occurred for 2&amp;nbsp;days, on May 7 and 8, 2001. The temporary appearance consisted of being Stern's sidekick along with Quivers, and Lange frequently told personal stories, usually regarding alcohol, drugs, food and prostitutes. On October 29, 2001, Lange joined the show full-time and was voted favorite by Howard's fans in 2009.

Lange left the show in December 2009. At first the leave was thought to be temporary, but in early 2010 he attempted suicide at his apartment in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/01/07/2010-01-07_artie_lange.html |location=New York |work=Daily News |title=Artie Lange used 13-inch kitchen knife in violent suicide try; released from hospital after surgery |first=Cristina |last=Everett |date=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has not been discussed in great detail on the show and for much of 2010, Stern mentioned that Lange would return when he was healthy. However, in 2011 the show and the Howard 100 News began to reference Lange as a "former" staffer. On October 3, 2011, Lange began co-hosting ''[[The Artie Lange Show|The Nick &amp; Artie Show]]'' with comedian Nick DiPaolo. This show aired on Directv. In April 2014, Artie was informed before the show that Directv had cancelled his show. He went on air that night for the last time as a part of the Directv team.

'''M/98''' is the standard [[Norway|Norwegian]] Battle Uniform, used by the [[Norwegian Army|Army]], [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Home Guard (Norway)|Home Guard]].

It is an updated version of the older model M/75, and is used together with different hats according to military branch. The [[uniform]] consists of jacket and trousers and comes in the Norwegian [[Military Camouflage|camouflage]]. The jacket has two breast pockets and two big hand pockets, both with flap and a sewn on velcro above left breast pocket for the name tag.
The trousers have regular pockets for hands - one back pocket and cargo pockets with flap.
In addition to the regular Norwegian camouflage in green, brown and a darker green color, a special desert pattern has also been developed for the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].

The desert pattern consists of light green, brown and dark brown.

The M/98 is commonly used in [[garrison]] and only rarely used in the field. 
   
The Norwegian army has a separate field uniform consisting of olive drab (and also camouflage) pants and a Norwegian camouflage field jacket.

'''New Swabia''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and {{lang-de|Neuschwabenland}}) is a [[cartography|cartographic]] name sometimes given to an area of [[Antarctica]] between [[20th meridian east|20°E]] and [[10th meridian west|10°W]] in [[Queen Maud Land]], which is claimed as a Norwegian [[dependent territory]] under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. New Swabia was explored by Germany in early 1939 and named after that expedition's ship, the {{MS|Schwabenland|1925|2}}, itself named after the [[Germany|German]] region of [[Swabia]].&lt;ref name="McGonigal"&gt;McGonigal, David, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8bFcJgX0lIUC&amp;pg=PA347 Antarctica]'', frances lincoln ltd, 2009, {{ISBN|0-7112-2980-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7112-2980-8}}, p 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=admle&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2008/annekteringen%20av%20dronning%20maud%20land/print_artikler_view |first=Turi |last=Widerøe |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |language=Norwegian |title=Annekteringen av Dronning Maud Land |year=2008 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Like many other countries, [[German Empire|Germany]] sent expeditions to the Antarctic region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of which were scientific. The late 19th century expeditions to the [[Southern Ocean]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], the [[Kerguelen Islands]], and the [[Crozet Islands]] were astronomical, meteorological, and hydrological, mostly in close collaboration with scientific teams from other countries. As the 19th century ended Germany began to focus on Antarctica.

The first German expedition to Antarctica was the [[Gauss expedition]] from 1901 to 1903. Led by Arctic veteran and geology professor [[Erich von Drygalski]], this was the first expedition to use a [[hot-air balloon]] in Antarctica. It also found and named [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]]. The second German Antarctic expedition (1911–1912) was led by [[Wilhelm Filchner]] with a goal of crossing Antarctica to learn if it was one piece of land. As happened with other such early attempts, the crossing failed before it even began. The expedition discovered and named the [[Luitpold Coast]] and the [[Filchner Ice Shelf]]. A German [[whaling]] fleet was put to sea in 1937 and, upon its successful return in early 1938, plans for a third German Antarctic expedition were drawn up.

==German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939)==
[[File:Schwabenland.jpg|thumb|MS ''Schwabenland'' in 1938]]
The third German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939) was led by [[Alfred Ritscher]] (1879–1963), a captain in the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]]. The main purpose was to find an area in Antarctica for a German whaling station, as a way to increase Germany's production of fat. [[Whale oil]] was then the most important raw material for the production of [[margarine]] and [[soap]] in Germany and the country was the second largest purchaser of Norwegian whale oil, importing some 200,000 metric tonnes annually. Besides the disadvantage of being dependent on [[imports]], it was thought that Germany would soon be at war, which was considered to put too much strain on Germany's [[foreign currency reserve]]s. Another goal was to scout possible locations for a German naval base.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/Antartida/Base-Hitler/LaBaseAntarticadeHitler.pdf ''Hitler's Antarctic base: the myth and the reality''], by Colin Summerhayes and Peter Beeching, [[Polar Record]], Volume 43 Issue 1, pp.1–21 Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Emblem of the Nazi German Antarctic Expedition.svg|thumb|1938–1939 expedition logo]]
On 17 December 1938 the New Swabia Expedition left Hamburg for Antarctica aboard the MS ''Schwabenland'' (a freighter built in 1925 and renamed in 1934 after the [[Swabia]] region in southern Germany) which could also carry and catapult aircraft. The secret&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; expedition had 33 members plus the ''Schwabenland'''s crew of 24. On 19 January 1939 the ship arrived at the [[Princess Martha Coast]], in an area which had lately been claimed by [[Norway]] as [[Queen Maud Land]] and began charting the region. Nazi German flags were placed on the sea ice along the coast. Naming the area ''Neu-Schwabenland'' after the ship, the expedition established a temporary base and in the following weeks teams walked along the coast recording claim reservations on hills and other significant landmarks. Seven photographic survey flights were made by the ship’s two [[Dornier Wal]] [[seaplane]]s named ''Passat'' and ''Boreas''.&lt;ref name="McGonigal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boudewijn"&gt;Boudewijn Büch. ''Eenzaam, Eilanden 2'' ('Lonely, Islands 2'), Holland 1994&lt;/ref&gt; About a dozen 1.2 meter-long aluminum arrows, with 30 centimeter steel cones and three upper stabilizer wings embossed with swastikas, were air dropped onto the ice at turning points of the flight polygons (these arrows had been tested on the [[Pasterze glacier]] in Austria before the expedition).&lt;ref name="McGonigal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boudewijn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritscher's expedition report, more information pending&lt;/ref&gt; Eight more flights were made to areas of keen interest and on these trips some of the photos were taken with colour film. Altogether they flew over hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and took more than 16,000 aerial photographs, some of which were published after the war by Ritscher. The ice-free [[Schirmacher Oasis]], which now hosts the [[Maitri]] and [[Novolazarevskaya Station|Novolazarevskaya]] research stations, was spotted from the air by Richardheinrich Schirmacher (who named it after himself) shortly before the ''Schwabenland'' left the Antarctic coast on 6 February 1939.

On its return trip to Germany the expedition made oceanographic studies near [[Bouvet Island]] and [[Fernando de Noronha]], arriving back in Hamburg on 11 April 1939. Meanwhile, the Norwegian government had learned about the expedition through reports from whalers along the coast of Queen Maud Land. Although some, notably Norwegian writer Bjarne Aagaard and German geographer Ernst Herrmann, have claimed that Germany never actually occupied the territory, it is well documented that Germany issued a decree about the establishment of a German Antarctic Sector called New Swabia after the expedition's return in August 1939.&lt;ref name=admle/&gt;

===Geographic features mapped by the expedition===
{{Expand list|date=August 2009}}
Because the area was first explored by a German expedition, the name ''Neuschwabenland'' (''New Swabia'') is still used for the region on some maps, as are many of the German names given to its geographic features.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ''National Geographic Atlas of the World'', Eighth Edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some geographic features mapped by the expedition were not named until the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949–1952), led by [[John Schjelderup Giæver]]. Others were not named until they were remapped from aerial photographs taken by the [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition|Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]] (1958–1959).

===Aftermath===
Germany made no formal territorial claims to New Swabia.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Schön, ''Mythos Neu-Schwabenland. Für Hitler am Südpol'', Bonus, Selent 2004, p. 106, {{ISBN|3-935962-05-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; No whaling station or other lasting bases were built there by Germany until the [[Georg-von-Neumayer-Station]], a research facility, was established in 1981. Germany's current [[Neumayer-Station III]] is also in the region. New Swabia is a [[Cartography|cartographic]] area of [[Queen Maud Land]] which within Norway is administered as a Norwegian [[dependent territory]] under the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] by the Polar Affairs Department of the [[Minister of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]].

'''Thomas Sturge''' (1787-1866) was a British oil merchant, shipowner, cement manufacturer, railway company director, social reformer and philanthropist.

==Family background and early life==

Thomas Sturge was born in 1787, one of at least ten children of [[Thomas Sturge the elder]] (1749-1825), [[tallow]] chandler and oil merchant of [[Newington Butts]], about a mile south of [[London Bridge]]. Thomas the younger joined his father’s business early in the 19th century, as did at least three of his brothers, Nathan, George and Samuel. Thomas Sturge &amp; Sons, oil merchants and [[spermaceti]] processors operated from premises near [[Elephant and Castle]], Newington Butts, until 1840.&lt;ref&gt;London Metropolitan Archives, index to the records of the Sun Fire Assurance Office, 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a first cousin of social reformer and philanthropist [[Joseph Sturge]].

==Oil merchant and shipowner==
[[File:Whaling of sperm whale.jpg|thumb|Hunting the sperm whale]]
{{See also|Whaling in the United Kingdom}}
Thomas Sturge junior had become the senior partner in the business by 1816, when he began to buy ships and send them to the Southern Whale Fishery to obtain [[whale oil]], seal oil and [[spermaceti]] for processing and sale in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bswf.hull.ac.uk/Output.php?OWNER=Thomas+Sturge&amp;Submit2=Submit |website=bswf.hull.ac.uk |title=British Southern Whale Fishery - Voyages}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the principal owner of at least 23 vessels, most of them [[History of whaling#Southern whale fishery|South Sea whalers]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.414.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Quaker]] faith and values were reflected in his business dealings. He tried to choose committed Christians to command his [[whaler|whale ships]] and in his sailing instructions gave his captains detailed advice on how to treat their crewmen.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt; His vessels each seem to have been supplied with a small library and at least five of his vessels carried a "surgeon" or ship's doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.425.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was Dr Thomas Beale who later wrote, ''The Natural History of the Sperm Whale'' (1839), which he dedicated to his employer.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Beale, ''The Natural History of the Sperm Whale'', London, John Van Voorst, 1839; reprinted by The Holland Press, London, 1973, p.ix-x.&lt;/ref&gt; Herman Melville drew on the book for his novel ''Moby Dick'' (1851).&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Vincent, ''The trying-out of Moby Dick'', Houghton Miffin, Boston, 1949, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also inspired three paintings of whaling scenes by [[J.M.W. Turner]], exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1845 and 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Beale (1973) dustjacket.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner tried to sell them to his patron, oil merchant, shipowner and art collector [[Elhanan Bicknell]]. Bicknell was an associate and friend of Sturge at Newington Butts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Hoare]], ‘’Leviathan or, the whale’’, London, 2009, p.250-1, 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social reformer and philanthropist==
Sturge was a member of a committee to assist “distressed seaman” by 1818.&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle'', 9 January 1818.&lt;/ref&gt; His firm donated £15 15 shillings in 1821 toward the cost of a suitable vessel to serve as a [[hospital ship|floating hospital]] for the “assistance and relief of sick and helpless seamen.”&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle'', 15 March 1821.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seamen's Hospital Society]] was established that year, with [[William Wilberforce]] as one of the many vice presidents; Sturge was one of a couple of dozen men on its management committee, along with [[Zachary Macaulay]] and [[William Young (Royal Navy officer, born 1751)|Captain William Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The annual subscription charities and public societies in London|date=1823|page=24|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IR8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] and substantial financial contributor to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;''Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter'', 3, June 1829-December 1830, p.268; William Lloyd Garrison, ''The letters of William Lloyd Garrison; No union with the slaveholders, 1841-1849'', Cambridge, MA, 1974, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member of the society was the historian and poitician [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] (1800-1859) who became friends with Sturge. There were many [[Quakers in the abolition movement]]. Among these was his cousin the prominent [[anti-slavery]] abolitionist and philanthropist [[Joseph Sturge]] (1793-1859).

Thomas also made regular donations to a range of other charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p.480; "''The Times'', 3 May 1826 &amp; 10 June 1823.&lt;/ref&gt; He provided transport to missionaries going to the South Seas on his whaling ships. [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]] and his wife left their children in the care of Sturge and his invalid sister when they were in South Africa in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Robert Moffatt dated 22 June 1861 to Thomas Sturge. Cambridge University Library, Add Ms8830 3/2/101.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas or his father, Thomas senior, was supporting the [[Deaf education#Great Britain|education of the deaf]] by May 1821.&lt;ref&gt;''List of Governors and officers of the asylum for the support and education of the deaf and dumb children of the poor'', London, 1821, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributor to Antarctic exploration==

[[File:Balleny Islands.jpg|thumb|left|The Balleny Islands from a NASA satellite, December 2007. Sturge Island is the lower of the three main islands.]] In 1838 Sturge joined a group of London shipowners to purchase two vessels, the schooner ''Eliza Scott'' (154 tons) and the cutter ''Sabrina'' (54 tons). These were sent to the [[Antarctic]], under the overall command of Captain [[John Balleny]], to search for undiscovered offshore islands that might host seal colonies that could be harvested.&lt;ref&gt;"Discoveries in the Antarctic Ocean, in February 1839. Extracted from the Journal of the schooner Eliza Scott, commanded by Mr John Balleny, communicated by Charles Enderby, Esq., ''Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London'', 9 (1839) pp.526-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discoveries made were a cluster five previously unknown islands. They were given the collective name of the  [[Balleny Islands]] with individual islands named after those who had funded the expedition. [[Sturge Island]] is 23 miles long and 6 miles wide and permantly covered in a mantle of snow and ice.

==Cement producer==
[[File:Knight, Bevan and Sturge cement works, Northfleet.jpg|thumb|right|The Knight, Bevan and Sturge Cement works in the second half of the 19th century.]]

In 1837 and 1838 he purchased two blocks of land on the Thames near [[Northfleet]] at a cost of £9,313.&lt;ref&gt;British Parliamentary Papers, HC 1842, Vol 25, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; On that 74 acre plot he built a [[cement]] works to make [[Portland cement]]. Construction of the [[cement kiln]]s started in 1851 and production began in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cementkilns.co.uk/cement_kiln_bevans.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railway investments==

He was interested in the building of new railways and in 1842 he spoke at a public meeting in favour of the construction of the Dean Forest and Gloucester railway line.&lt;ref&gt;''Berrows Worcestor Journal'', 15 December 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a significanr shareholder in the [[Eastern Union Railway]] Company and a major shareholder and director of the [[West Hartlepool]] Harbour and Railway Company.&lt;ref&gt;Sturge v Eastern Union Railway Co., 2 May - 2 June 1855, Hein online Legal Database, 7 DE G.M. &amp; G. 162; House of Lords Sessional Papers, 1863, Vol.XXXIV, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1842 he moved downriver to [[Northfleet]], where he had purchased Northfleet House, a mansion under construction, for £3900.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p.423.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Sturge the younger died there on April 14, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for Thomas Sturge, England &amp; Wales National Probate Register, 1858-1966.&lt;/ref&gt; He never married and most of his estate, valued at about £180,000, was left to his brother George.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.

'''Usiququmadevu''' is a figure from [[Zulu mythology]].  She is said to be a monstrous [[deity]], [[hunchback]]ed and with a [[beard]], who eats children.  According to legend, one day she came upon the children of a [[tribal chief|chief]]; as they were unguarded, she quickly swallowed them.  The chief discovered what had happened, and instantly set out to find her.  Soon he did, and killed her by stabbing her in the hump; his children emerged unscathed from her mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/mlb/mlb16.htm Usiququmadevu]. Sacred Texts Collection. Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usiququmadevu is said to have a husband of the same name.

Consisted of at least 3 divisions on January 7, 1951, when 2 divisions attacked the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 2nd Infantry Division]] in a frontal attack, while a third division attacked from the northwest against the adjacent [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|ROK 8th Division]]. They were assisted by one of the divisions of the [[II Corps (North Korea)|NKPA II Corps]], which also launched attacks against the neighboring [[III Corps (South Korea)|ROK III Corps]] to the east. The North Koreans managed to force the 2d Division out of [[Wonju]] by the evening of January 7, and all counterattacks failed to retake the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-chinter/chinter.htm| title = The Korean War: The Chinese Intervention| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| first = Richard W. |last = Stewart| id = CMH Pub 19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaduz Cathedral''', or '''Cathedral of St. Florin''' ([[German language|German]]: ''St. Florinskirche in Vaduz'' or ''Kathedrale St. Florin''), is a [[neo-Gothic]] church in [[Vaduz]], [[Liechtenstein]], and the center of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz]].  Originally a [[parish church]], it has held the status of cathedral since 1997.

It was built in 1874 by [[Friedrich von Schmidt]] on the site of earlier medieval foundations.  Its [[patron saint]] is [[Florinus of Remüs]] (Florin), a 9th-century saint of the [[Vinschgau Valley]].

The [[Archdiocese]] of [[Vaduz]] was erected by [[Pope John Paul II]] in the [[apostolic constitution]] ''Ad satius consulendum'' 2 December 1997. Before then it had been the Liechtenstein Deanery, a part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Bishop of Chur|Diocese of Chur]]. The solemn public ceremony took place on December 12, 1997,&lt;!--wrong dates?--&gt; in the parish church of Vaduz, which was then raised to the dignity of a [[cathedral]].

Prince [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Joseph II]] of Liechtenstein and his wife [[Countess Georgina von Wilczek|Princess Georgina]] were both buried in the cathedral in 1989. Princess [[Elisabeth von Gutmann|Elisabeth of Liechtenstein]] (1875-1947) was buried there too.

The '''Vučitrn massacre''' was the mass killing of [[Kosovo Albanian]] [[refugees]] near [[Vučitrn]], during the [[Kosovo War]] on 2-3 May 1999.

==Background==
A column of about 1,000 refugees were travelling in a convoy of about 100 [[tractor]]s, who were fleeing fighting between the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] and Serbian forces east of Vučitrn.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Cabell|title=Serb war criminals seize north Kosovo|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/serb-war-criminals-seize-north-kosovo-1112934.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police of the Republic of Serbia|Serbian Police]] and [[List of Serbian paramilitary formations|paramilitary]] forces caught up with the convoy that traveled south. On 2-3 May between Gornja Sudimlja and Donja Sudimlja ({{lang-sq|Studime e Eperme and Studime e Poshtme}}) near Vučitrn, an estimated one hundred men were killed.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo|year=2001|publisher=Human Rights Watch|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3c2b204a0.pdf|chapter=Vucitrn (Vushtrri) Municipality|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ICTY]] investigator Romeu Ventura stated that 120 civilians were murdered on 2 May by Serb forces and buried two days later in a mass grave five miles east of Vučitrn.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; After the war, ICTY forensic teams discovered 98 bodies in Gornja Sudimlja.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

The Vučitrn case was raised at the trial of Serbian police general [[Vlastimir Đorđević]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vlastimir Đorđević Convicted for Crimes in Kosovo|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10606|newspaper=ICTY|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment against Đorđević says that some 105 Kosovo Albanians were killed in the massacre near the village of Sudimlje on 2 May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=POLICE CRIMES IN VUCITRN|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/police-crimes-in-vucitrn.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=11185|newspaper=SENSE Tribunal|date=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Đorđević was sentenced to 27 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Information Sheet: Vlastimir Đorđević|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf|publisher=ICTY|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
