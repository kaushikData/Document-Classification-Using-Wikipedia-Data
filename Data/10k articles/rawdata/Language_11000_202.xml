      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7521">{{Tort law}}
'''Abuse of process''' is a cause of action in [[tort]] arising from one party making misusing or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action. It is a [[common law]] intentional tort. It is to be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], another type of tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the [[court]]s.

The elements of a valid [[cause of action]] for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Cartwright v. Wexler, Wexler &amp; Heller, Ltd.'', 369 N.E.2d 185, 187 (Ill. App. Ct. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of process can be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of [[Malice (law)|malice]], lack of [[probable cause]] in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious [[prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' ''Liquid Carbonic Acid Mfg. Co. v. Convert'', 82 Ill. App. 39, 44 (Ill. App. Ct. 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;   "Process," as used in this context, includes not only the "service of process," i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court.&lt;ref&gt;''Arora v. Chui'', 664 N.E.2d 1101 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of "process" considered to be capable of abuse.

==Principle==
The principles which led to a finding of an abuse of process in the UK were stated in ''[[Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] UKHL 65; [2002] 2 AC 1, by [[Lord Bingham]] at 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lord Bingham]].

{{cquote|"The underlying public interest is … that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not … Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice."}}

==Distinguished from malicious prosecution==

A cause of action for abuse of process is similar to the action for [[malicious prosecution]] in that both actions are based on and involve the improper use of the courts and legal systems.  The primary difference between the two legal actions is that malicious prosecution concerns the malicious or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced.  In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law.  Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself,&lt;ref&gt;''Neurosurgery &amp; Spine Surgery, S.C. v. Goldman'' 339 Ill. App. 3d 177, 183 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; but in malicious prosecution, the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See also, http://trucounsel.com/index.php/abuse-of-process&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted above, the three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for malicious prosecution.  Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.

==Illustration==

A cause of action for abuse of process may lie in situations where a criminal proceeding is brought against a defendant for improper motives.  For example, in ''Lader v. Benkowitz'',&lt;ref&gt;66 N.Y.S.2d 713 (N.Y. Spec. Term 1946)&lt;/ref&gt; a pleading was held to state a good cause of action for abuse of process when it alleged that defendant hotel owner had threatened to have the plaintiff arrested on a warrant issued at the behest of the defendant on a charge of disorderly conduct.

The allegedly improper motive was the hotel owner's underlying purpose of compelling plaintiff to pay a bill owed for plaintiff's alleged rental of a room in defendant's hotel.  It was claimed that through the unlawful use of the warrant and threat of arrest, the defendant was able to obtain the sum of money allegedly owed by plaintiff. In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court admonished that it was sufficient to show that regularly issued process had been used to accomplish an improper purpose in order to set forth a cause of action for abuse of process.

The fact that the plaintiff had yielded to defendant's threat to have her arrested under the warrant did not diminish the cause of action, because it was clear that the plaintiff actually had been arrested for the purpose of compelling her to pay the cost of the room.

'''Adho Duraso''' (also referred to as '''Dursa Arha )''' (born 1538, died 1651) was a medieval [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani-language]] poet.He was from a renowned charan family of his time. He was ruler of 5 villages which include panchetiya, raipuria and other parts of pali district. He was known for his bravery and great work in poetry. Arha dynasty was originate from him

==Early life==
Duraso was born in 1538 to Mahoji at [[Jaitaran]], in the present-day [[Pali district]] of [[Rajasthan]], India. His father came from the village of Adha, located in the [[Jalore district]] near [[Sanchore]], and from this connection came Duraso's first name.&lt;ref name="Sahitya"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian literature Volume One (A To Devo) |editor-first=Amaresh |editor-last=Datta |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;vq=duraso&amp;pg=PA73 |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a poet==
Duraso was subjected to a childhood of acute poverty but demonstrated a talent for poetry that brought him great wealth. He had two wives and four children and he was a part in many [[Rajput]] royal courts, including those of [[Bikaner (princely state)|Bikaner]] [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]]. He also enjoyed a good relationship with [[Akbar]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]].&lt;ref name="Sahitya" /&gt;

He spent his last days in his son Kisnoji's house at [[Panchetiya]] village, where he died in 1651.&lt;ref name="Sahitya" /&gt;

==Works==
The poems written by Duraso mostly relate the heroism and manliness of the rulers of that time but also chronicle many mundane matters. He treated the achievements of his subjects as individuals even when they were constantly at odds with each other, as in the case of his writings about Akbar and [[Maharana Pratap]]. He expressed his deep faith in the [[Hindu]] religion, appreciated the bravery of Hindu heroes and wrote of the injustice of the Mughals. However, literary analysis of the ''Virud Chihattari'' poem associated with him, including the extremely harsh words used to describe Akbar, suggests that work and also the smaller ''Gajagata'' were at least not all of his own writing.&lt;ref name="Sahitya" /&gt;

His major works are:&lt;ref name="Sahitya" /&gt;

* ''Virud Chihattari'' (in honour of Maharana Pratap)
* ''Doha Solanki Viramdevji ra''
* ''Jhulana Rav Surtan ra''
* ''Marsiya Rav Surtan ra''
* ''Jhulana Raja Mansingh Macchvaha ra''
* ''Jhulana Ravat Megha ra''
* ''Git Raji sri Rohitasji ra''
* ''Jhulana Rav Amarsingh Gajsinghota'' (heroic poetry of Rao Amarsingh of [[Nagaur]])
* ''Kirta Bhavani''
* ''Mataji ra Chhand''
* ''Sri Kumar Ajjaji na Bhuchar Mori ni Gajagat''

The '''bag-of-words model''' is a simplifying representation used in [[natural language processing]] and [[information retrieval]] (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the [[multiset|bag (multiset)]] of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. The bag-of-words model has also been [[Bag-of-words model in computer vision|used for computer vision]].&lt;ref name=sivic&gt;{{cite conference

The bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of [[document classification]] where the (frequency of) occurrence of each word is used as a [[Feature (machine learning)|feature]] for training a [[Statistical classification|classifier]]&lt;ref&gt;McTear et al 2016, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;.

An early reference to "bag of words" in a linguistic context can be found in [[Zellig Harris]]'s 1954 article on ''Distributional Structure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last= Harris
  |first= Zellig
  |authorlink= Zellig Harris

  |quote= And this stock of combinations of elements becomes a factor in the way later choices are made ... for language is not merely a bag of words but a tool with particular properties which have been fashioned in the course of its use}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example implementation ==

The following models a text document using bag-of-words. Here are two simple text documents:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
(1) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
(2) John also likes to watch football games.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Based on these two text documents, a list constructed as follows for each document:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
"John","likes","to","watch","movies","Mary","likes","movies","too"

"John","also","likes","to","watch","football","games"
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Representing each bag-of-words as a [[JSON|JSON object]], and attributing to the respective [[Javascript]] variable:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
BoW1 = {"John":1,"likes":2,"to":1,"watch":1,"movies":2,"Mary":1,"too":1};
BoW2 = {"John":1,"also":1,"likes":1,"to":1,"watch":1,"football":1,"games":1};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Each key is the word, and each value is the number of occurrences of that word in the given text document.

The order of elements is free, so, for example &lt;code&gt;{"too":1,"Mary":1,"movies":2,"John":1,"watch":1,"likes":2,"to":1}&lt;/code&gt; is also ''BoW1''. It is also what we expect from a strict ''JSON object'' representation.

Note: if another document is like a union of these two, 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
(3) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too. John also likes to watch football games.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

its Javascript representation will be:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
BoW3 = {"John":2,"likes":3,"to":2,"watch":2,"movies":2,"Mary":1,"too":1,"also":1,"football":1,"games":1};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

So, as we see in the [[multiset|bag algebra]], the "union" of two documents in the bags-of-words representation is, formally, the [[disjoint union]], summing the multiplicities of each element.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;math&gt;BoW3 = BoW1 \biguplus BoW2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application ==
In practice, the Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation. After transforming the text into a "bag of words", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text. The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text. For the example above, we can construct the following two lists to record the term frequencies of all the distinct words (BoW1 and BoW2 ordered as in BoW3):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
(1) [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
(2) [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Each entry of the lists refers to the count of the corresponding entry in the list (this is also the histogram representation). For example, in the first list (which represents document 1), the first two entries are "1,2":

* The first entry corresponds to the word "John" which is the first word in the list, and its value is "1" because "John" appears in the first document 1 time.
* The second entry corresponds to the word "likes", which is the second word in the list, and its value is "2" because "likes" appears in the first document 2 times

This list (or vector) representation does not preserve the order of the words in the original sentences. This is just the main feature of the Bag-of-words model. This kind of representation has several successful applications, such as [[email filtering]].&lt;ref name="sivic" /&gt;
 
However, term frequencies are not necessarily the best representation for the text. Common words like "the", "a", "to" are almost always the terms with highest frequency in the text. Thus, having a high raw count does not necessarily mean that the corresponding word is more important. To address this problem, one of the most popular ways to "normalize" the term frequencies is to weight a term by the inverse of document frequency, or [[tf–idf]]. Additionally, for the specific purpose of classification, [[Supervised learning|supervised]] alternatives have been developed to account for the class label of a document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
|title = A study of term weighting schemes using class information for text classification
|author = Youngjoong Ko
|year = 2012
|booktitle = [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|SIGIR'12]]
|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, binary (presence/absence or 1/0) weighting is used in place of frequencies for some problems (e.g., this option is implemented in the [[Weka (machine learning)|WEKA]] machine learning software system).

== N-gram model ==
Bag-of-word model is an orderless document representation—only the counts of words mattered. For instance, in the above example "John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too", the bag-of-words representation will not reveal that the verb "likes" always follows a person's name in this text. As an alternative, the [[n-gram]] model can store this spatial information. Applying to the same example above, a '''bigram''' model will parse the text into the following units and store the term frequency of each unit as before.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
[
    "John likes",
    "likes to",
    "to watch",
    "watch movies",
    "Mary likes",
    "likes movies",
    "movies too",
]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Conceptually, we can view bag-of-word model as a special case of the n-gram model, with n=1. For n&amp;gt;1 the model is named [[w-shingling]] (where ''w'' is equivalent to ''n'' denoting the number of grouped words). See [[language model]] for a more detailed discussion.

== Hashing trick ==

A common alternative to using dictionaries is the [[hashing trick]], where words are mapped directly to indices with a hashing function&lt;ref name="Weinberger05"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Weinberger
 | first = K. Q.
 |author2=Dasgupta A. |author3=Langford J. |author4=Smola A. |author5=Attenberg, J.
 | title = Feature hashing for large scale multitask learning,
 | journal = Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Conference on Machine Learning
 | year=2009
 | pages=1113–1120
 | arxiv=0902.2206|bibcode=2009arXiv0902.2206W}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, no memory is required to store a dictionary. Hash collisions are typically dealt via freed-up memory to increase the number of hash buckets. In practice, hashing simplifies the implementation of bag-of-words models and improves scalability.

== Example usage: spam filtering ==
In [[Bayesian spam filtering]], an e-mail message is modeled as an unordered collection of words selected from one of two probability distributions: one representing [[Spam e-mail|spam]] and one representing legitimate e-mail ("ham"). 
Imagine there are two literal bags full of words. One bag is filled with words found in spam messages, and the other with words found in legitimate e-mail. While any given word is likely to be somewhere in both bags, the "spam" bag will contain spam-related words such as "stock", "Viagra", and "buy" significantly more frequently, while the "ham" bag will contain more words related to the user's friends or workplace.

To classify an e-mail message, the Bayesian spam filter assumes that the message is a pile of words that has been poured out randomly from one of the two bags, and uses [[Bayesian probability]] to determine which bag it is more likely to be.

[[File:Assorted bar stock.jpg|thumb|250px|Storage area containing assorted bar stock.]]

'''Bar stock''', also (colloquially) known as '''blank''', '''slug''' or '''billet''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brafield |first=Evans |title=What's Billet? |date=February 2009 |url=http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/tech/term_billet_explained/index.html |accessdate=March 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o0wtK5cn?url=http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/tech/term_billet_explained/index.html |archivedate=2010-03-06 |postscript=. |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a common form of raw purified [[metal]], used by industry to manufacture metal parts and products. Bar stock is available in a variety of extrusion shapes and lengths. The most common shapes are round (circular cross-section), rectangular, square and hexagonal or hex. A bar is characterised by an "enclosed invariant convex cross-section", meaning that pipes, angle stock and objects with varying diameter are not considered bar stock.

Bar stock is commonly processed by a sequence of sawing, turning, milling, drilling and grinding to produce a final product, often vastly different from the original stock. In some cases, the process is partially automated by specialized equipment which feeds the stock into the appropriate processing machine.

==Process and types==
{{OR section|date=October 2015}}
Most metal produced by a [[steel mill]] or aluminium plant is formed (via [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] or [[extrusion]]) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is [[pasta]]-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as [[linguine]] or [[penne]]) to more elaborate extrusions (such as [[rotelle]], [[fiori (pasta)|fiori]], or [[rotini]]). The same is true of metal bar stock. The most common shapes are '''round bar''' (also called '''rod'''), '''rectangular bar''' (including '''square bar''', the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called '''hex bar''' for short). [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|Tube]] and [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called "bar" in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.) Also similar in concept, but not called "bar", are the [[structural steel#Common structural shapes|common structural shapes]] such as angle stock and channel stock. These are commonly available in steel and aluminum; the names "angle iron" and "channel iron" are still commonly used (informally) even though their literal namesake, [[wrought iron]], has been replaced by steel and aluminum for most uses.

In a [[machine shop]], bar stock and [[Plate (metal)|plate]] are often called ''billet'', although in a [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling mill]], that word refers to a piece of metal that has [[Semi-finished casting products#Billet|not yet been rolled into bar]].

A machine shop typically has a storage area containing a large variety of bar stock. To create a metal component, a bar of sufficient volume is selected from storage and brought to the machining area. This piece may then be [[Bandsaw|sawed]], [[Milling machine|milled]], [[Drilling|drilled]], [[turning|turned]], or [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|ground]] to remove material and create the final shape. In turning, for large-diameter work (typically more than {{convert|100|mm}}, although there is no universal threshold), a piece of the bar is cut off using a horizontal bandsaw to create a ''blank'' for each part. The blanks are then fed into a chucking lathe (chucker) which [[chuck (engineering)|chucks]] each one in turn. For smaller-diameter work, the entire length of bar stock is more often fed through the spindle of the lathe. The entire bar rotates with the spindle during the part-machining cycle. When the cycle ends and one part is done, the chuck opens, the bar is pulled or pushed forward ("fed") by any of various automatic means, the chuck closes, and the next cycle begins. The last step of the cycle is to cut off the machined part from the bar, which is called "parting it off" and is achieved with a "cutoff" or "part-off" tool, a [[tool bit]] that grooves the bar all the way down to the centreline, causing the part to fall off. Then the cycle repeats.

The not-yet-cut bar protruding from the back of the spindle, rotating quickly, can present a safety hazard if it is sticking out too far and unconstrained from bending. Thus sometimes long bars must be sawn into shorter bars before being fed as "bar work" (which is the term for such work).

CNC lathes and screw machines have accessories called "[[Metal lathe#Bar_feeder|bar feeders]]", which hold, guide, and feed the bar as commanded by the CNC control. More advanced machines may have a "[[Metal lathe#Bar_loader|bar loader]]" which holds multiple bars and feeds them one at a time into the bar feeder. Bar loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The bar loader is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect if something went wrong and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, [[webcam]]s, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.

==Standard sizes throughout a supply chain==
To [[wikt:stock#Verb|stock]] every possible size of bar stock (every possible fraction of a millimetre or inch in diameter or thickness) is impossible. Thus, bar stock is stocked by metals supply houses in various standard sizes, arrayed in discrete steps. For example, round bar with diameters of even millimetres (or in the USA, on the eighths of an inch) can usually be ordered from standing [[wikt:stock#Noun|stock]]. Bar diameters of nonstandard sizes can also be obtained, but only as a separate mill run from the [[rolling mill]]. Thus they are much more expensive than the standard sizes, can take much longer delivery time, and are not desirable as inventory for the supply house or the machine shop (because the chance of selling or using any particular custom size is slim).

Sometimes it is necessary that the bar not be very much larger than the intended part, because the [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] properties of some metal [[alloy]]s in some finishing processes may vary by how far inside the bar the metal lies. Thus an [[engineering drawing]] will specify a certain size (or a maximum size) that the bar may start out as. These specs face the aforementioned limitation of stocking sizes versus custom mill runs; standard sizes are used wherever possible to avoid wasted expense and needless delays.

==Drill bit==
A drill bit is [[tool steel]] round stock [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|ground]] to a tight [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] diameter; it is usually ±0.0005&amp;nbsp;in (±0.0127&amp;nbsp;mm). In the UK the name "[[silver steel]]" is often [[synonym]]ous and sometimes [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponymous]]. Its origin was in reference to the shiny ground appearance (not to any [[silver]] alloying content). Drill rod diameters range from {{convert|0.0135|to|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}; in the United States diameters smaller than {{frac|27|64}}th of an inch are made in [[letter drill sizes]] and [[number drill sizes]], in addition to fractional sizes. Lengths are usually one or three&amp;nbsp;feet (0.3 or 0.9&amp;nbsp;m). It is commonly used to make [[drill bit]]s, [[tap and die|taps]], [[reamer]]s, [[Punch (tool)|punch]]es, [[dowel pin]]s, and [[Drive shaft|shaft]]s.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite book |last3=Vaccari |first3=John A. |last=Brady |first=George S. |last2=Clauser |first2=Henry R. |title=Materials Handbook |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=322 |edition=15th |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIhvSQLhhMEC&amp;pg=PA322 |isbn=978-0-07-136076-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the numbered sizes are different from the drill numbered sizes starting at 52.

Drill blanks have an undersize tolerance of +0/&amp;minus;0.0002&amp;nbsp;in, while reamer blanks have an oversize tolerance of &amp;minus;0/+0.0002&amp;nbsp;in.

Some mills also sell square stock that is held to the same tolerances under the name "drill rod".&lt;ref name="brady"/&gt;

Commonly available material grades in the U.S. are A2, D2, M2, M42, O1, S7, W1, and [[high speed steel]] (including M2/M7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=McMaster-Carr catalog |publisher=McMaster-Carr |edition=115th |pages=3641–3653 |url=http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/116/3641 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground flat stock==
''Ground flat stock'' is [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] steel that has been [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|ground]] to close tolerances (compare to [[#Drill rod|drill rod]]). There are four types of materials available: [[O-1 tool steel]], [[A-2 tool steel]], [[A-6 tool steel]], and [[1018 steel]] (low-carbon or low-carb steel). Lengths are either {{convert|18|or|36|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} long, various widths up to {{convert|16|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} are available, and thicknesses range from {{convert|1/64|to|2.875|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Burroughs | first = John | title = What You Should Know About Ground Flat Stock | journal = [[Popular Mechanics]] | volume = 129 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–185 |date=March 1968 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-tMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA182 |issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Starrett catalog 32 |page=624 |url=http://www.starrett.com/download/339_p623_625.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vB02DsKE?url=http://www.starrett.com/download/339_p623_625.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-22 |postscript=. |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Starrett catalog 32 |page=634 |url=http://www.starrett.com/download/343_p634_635.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vB07qAS2?url=http://www.starrett.com/download/343_p634_635.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-22 |postscript=. |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biomarker''', or '''biological marker''' is a measurable [[wikt:indicator|indicator]] of some biological state or condition. Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated to examine normal [[biological process]]es, [[pathogenic]] processes, or [[pharmacologic]] responses to a [[therapeutic intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Biomarkers Definitions Working Group | title = Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints: preferred definitions and conceptual framework | journal = Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 89–95 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11240971 | doi = 10.1067/mcp.2001.113989 | type = Review }} as cited in {{cite journal |vauthors=Siderowf A, Aarsland D, Mollenhauer B, Goldman JG, Ravina B |title=Biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Lewy body disorders: Status and relevance for clinical trials |journal=Mov.

==Medicine==
{{Main article|Biomarker (medicine)}}
[[File:CardiacMarkerComparison.JPG|thumb|After a [[Myocardial Infarction|heart attack]] a number of different [[Cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]] can be measured to determine exactly when an attack occurred and how severe it was.]]
In [[medicine]], a biomarker can be a traceable substance that is introduced into an organism as a means to examine organ function or other aspects of health. For example, [[rubidium chloride]] is used as a radioactive isotope to evaluate perfusion of heart muscle.

It can also be a substance whose detection indicates a particular disease state, for example, the presence of an [[antibody]] may indicate an [[infection]]. More specifically, a biomarker indicates a change in expression or state of a protein that correlates with the risk or progression of a disease, or with the susceptibility of the disease to a given treatment.

One example of a commonly used biomarker in medicine is [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA).  This marker can be measured as a proxy of prostate size with rapid changes potentially indicating cancer. The most extreme case would be to detect mutant proteins as cancer specific biomarkers through [[Selected reaction monitoring]] (SRM), since mutant proteins can only come from an existing tumor, thus providing ultimately the best specificity for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Qing|title=Mutant proteins as cancer-specific biomarkers.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=108|issue=6|pages=2444–2449|author2=Raghothama Chaerkady|date=December 2010|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019203108|pmid=21248225|pmc=3038743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomarkers used for personalized medicine are typically categorized as either prognostic or predictive. An example is KRAS, an [[oncogene]] that encodes a [[GTPase]] involved in several [[signal transduction pathways]]. Prognostic biomarkers indicate the likelihood of patient outcome regardless of a specific treatment. Predictive biomarkers are used to help optimize ideal treatments, and indicates the likelihood of benefiting from a specific therapy.  Biomarkers for precision oncology are typically utilized in the molecular diagnostics of [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|chronic myeloid leukemia]], [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Breast cancer|breast]], and [[Lung cancer|lung]] cancer, and in [[melanoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nalejska|first1=Ewelina|year=2014|title=Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers|journal=Molecular Oncology and Genetics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=273–284|doi=10.1007/s40291-013-0077-9|pmid=24385403|pmc=4031398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory validation==

'''Proof of concept'''

Previously used to identify the specific characteristics of the biomarker, this step is essential for doing an ''in situ'' validation of these benefits. A large number of candidates must be tested to select the most relevant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proof-of-concept study of biomarker development in mice provides a roadmap for a similar approach in humans|url = http://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2011/06/biomarker_development_in_mice.html|website = www.fredhutch.org|accessdate = 2015-05-13|date = 2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experimental validation'''

This step allows the development of the most adapted protocol for routine use of the biomarker. Simultaneously, it is possible to confirm the relevance of the protocol with various methods (histology, PCR, ELISA,&amp;nbsp;...) and to define strata based on the results.

'''Analytical performances validation'''

One of the most important steps, it serves to identify specific characteristics of the candidate biomarker before developing a routine test. Several parameters are considered including:

* sensitivity
* specificity
* robustness
* accuracy
* reproducibility&lt;!---&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UCM300731 |url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM300731.pdf|website = www.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2017}}---&gt;

'''Protocol standardization'''

This optimizes the validated protocol for routine use, including analysis of the critical points by scanning the entire procedure to identify and control the potential risks.

==Cell biology==
{{main article|Biomarker (cell)}}
In [[cell biology]], a [[biomarker (cell)|biomarker]] is a molecule that allows the detection and isolation of a particular cell type (for example, the protein [[Oct-4]] is used as a biomarker to identify [[embryonic stem cell]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Biomarkers for Psychiatric Disorders. Publisher: Springer U.S. {{doi|10.1007/978-0-387-79251-4}}
Copyright: 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-387-79250-7}} (Print) 978-0-387-79251-4 (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[genetics]], a biomarker (identified as [[genetic marker]]) is a [[DNA sequence]] that causes [[disease]] or is associated with susceptibility to disease. They can be used to create genetic maps of whatever organism is being studied.

==Geology and astrobiology==
{{main article|Biosignature|Biomolecule|Biomarker (chemicals)}}
A biomarker can be any kind of [[molecule]] indicating the existence, past or present, of living organisms. In the fields of [[geology]] and [[astrobiology]], biomarkers, versus geomarkers, are also known as [[biosignature]]s. The term biomarker is also used to describe biological involvement in the [[Biomarker (chemicals)|generation of petroleum]].

==Ecotoxicology==
{{main article|Biomarkers of exposure assessment}}
{{see also|Bioindicator}}
Biomarkers are used to indicate an [[Exposure assessment#Exposure|exposure]] to or the effect of [[xenobiotics]] which are present in the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and in organisms. The biomarker may be an external substance itself (e.g. [[asbestos]] particles or [[NNK]] from tobacco), or a variant of the external substance processed by the body (a [[metabolite]]) that usually can be quantified.

==History==
The widespread use of the term "biomarker" dates back to as early as 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronson|first1=Jeffrey|year=2005|title=Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=59|issue=5|pages=491–494|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2005.02435.x|pmc=1884846|pmid=15842546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biological marker" was introduced in 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=K.

'''Carlos Drummond de Andrade''' (October 31, 1902 – August 17, 1987) was a Brazilian poet and writer, considered by some as the greatest Brazilian poet of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Garner,Dwight|title= Review:Multitudinous Heart:Newly translated poetry by Carlos Drummond de Andrade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/03/books/review-multitudinous-heart-newly-translated-poetry-by-carlos-drummond-de-andrade.html?_r=0|date=July 3, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has become something of a national cultural symbol in Brazil, where his widely influential poem "Canção Amiga" ("Friendly Song") has been featured on the 50-[[Brazilian cruzado novo|cruzado novo]] bill.

==Biography==
Drummond was born in [[Itabira]], a mining village in [[Minas Gerais]] in the southeastern region of Brazil. His parents were farmers belonging to old Brazilian families of mainly Portuguese origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usinadeletras.com.br/exibelotexto.php?cod=189&amp;cat=Ensaios&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/interior.aspx?content_id=1000399&amp;page=-1 |title=Drummond's Bloodline|publisher=Dn.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to a school of [[pharmacy]] in [[Belo Horizonte]], but never worked as a pharmacist after graduation, as he did not enjoy the career he chose. He worked as a civil servant for most of his life, eventually becoming director of history for the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Service of Brazil.  
Though his earliest poems are formal and satirical, Drummond quickly adopted the new forms of Brazilian modernism that were evolving in the 1920s, incited by the work of [[Mário de Andrade]] (to whom he was not related). He would mingle speech fluent in elegance and derive truth about his surroundings, many times describing quotidian, normal aspects of life while achieving a fluidity of thought and speech. Drummond drifted towards communism at the start of [[World War II]] and took up the editorship of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]]'s official newspaper, ''Tribuna Popular'', but later abandoned the post due to disagreements over censorship, which Drummond staunchly opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zenith |first1=Richard |title=Multitudinous Heart: Selected Poems: A Bilingual Edition |date=2015 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Carlos Drummond is generally divided into several segments, which appear very markedly in each of his books. But this is somewhat misleading, since even in the midst of his ''everyday'' poems or his ''socialist,'' politicized poems, there appear creations which can be easily incorporated into his later ''metaphysical'' canon, and none of these ''styles'' is completely free of the others. There is surely much ''metaphysical'' content in even his most political poems.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}{{dubious|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Carlos Drummond de Andrade e Manuel Bandeira.tif|thumb|Manuel Bandeira and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, 1954. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]|left]]
The most prominent of these later metaphysical poems is ''A Máquina do Mundo'' (The World's Machine). The poem deals with an anti-[[Faust]] referred to in the first person, who receives the visit of the aforementioned Machine, which stands for all possible knowledge, and the sum of the answers for all the questions which afflict men; in highly dramatic and baroque versification the poem develops only for the anonymous subject to decline the offer of endless knowledge and proceed his gloomy path in the solitary road. It takes the renaissance allegory of the Machine of the World from [[Portugal]]'s most esteemed poet, [[Luís de Camões]], more precisely, from a canto at the end of his epic masterpiece ''[[Os Lusíadas]].''

One of those said segments have been found only after his death: deliberately erotic poetry. That type of poetry has been published in only one book "Moça deitada na grama" (woman laid down in the grass) with the authorization and actual intervention by his son-in-law.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
  
Drummond is a favorite of American poets, a number of whom, including [[Mark Strand]] and [[Lloyd Schwartz]], have translated his work. Later writers and critics have sometimes credited his relationship with [[Elizabeth Bishop]], his first [[English language]] translator, as influential for his American reception, but though she admired him Bishop claimed she barely even knew him. In an interview with [[George Starbuck]] in 1977, she said, "I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmArticleID=420 |title=article|publisher=Pshares.org |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Carlos Drummond de Andrade - Papel.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Poem by Drummond de Andrade [[Wall poems in Leiden|on a wall in Leiden]] ]]
Drummond, as a writer of the modernist style, follows the writing mechanic proposed by [[Mário de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]]; making use of free verse, and not depending on a fixed meter. In modernism, the predominant style which Drummond wrote in, styles were divided into lyrical and subjective or objective and concrete, Drummond would be part of the latter, similar to Oswald de Andrade. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Drummond was the first great poet to assert himself after the premiere modernist of Brazil and created a unique style dominated by his beautiful writing. His work displays linguistic freedom and free verse. But it goes beyond that: "The work of Drummond reaches – as [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Jorge de Lima]], [[Murilo Mendes]] and [[Herberto Helder]] – a coefficient of loneliness that detached from the soil of history, leading the reader to an attitude free of references, trademarks or ideological or prospective," said [[Alfredo Bosi]] (1994). {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

His poetry, according to [[Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna]], can be divided into three parts, :

* I, greater than the world – marked by ironic poetry
* I, lower than the world – marked by social poetry
* I, equal to the world – covers the metaphysical poetry

In the late 1980s, his poetry began to become more erotic. ''O Amor Natural'' (''Natural Love''), a collection of erotic poems, was published posthumously.

In [[linguistics]], '''clipping''' is the [[word formation]] process   which consists in the reduction of a word to one of its parts (Marchand: 1969).  Clipping is also known as "truncation" or "shortening".&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

According to [[Hans Marchand|Marchand]] (1969),&lt;ref name=Marchand/&gt; clippings are not coined as words belonging to the standard vocabulary of a language. They originate as terms of a special group like schools, army, police, the medical profession, etc., in the intimacy of a milieu where a hint is sufficient to indicate the whole. For example, ''exam''(ination), ''math''(ematics), and ''lab''(oratory) originated in school [[slang]]; ''spec''(ulation) and ''tick''(et = credit) in stock-exchange slang; and ''vet''(eran) and ''cap''(tain) in army slang. Clipped forms can pass into common usage when they are widely useful, becoming part of standard English, which most speakers would agree has happened with ''math''/''maths'', ''lab'', ''exam'', ''phone'' (from ''telephone''), ''fridge'' (from ''refrigerator''), and various others. When their usefulness is limited to narrower contexts, such as with ''tick'' in stock-exchange slang, they remain outside standard [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]. Many, such as ''mani'' and ''pedi'' for ''manicure'' and ''pedicure'' or ''mic''/''mike'' for ''microphone'', occupy a middle ground in which their appropriate register is a subjective judgment, but succeeding decades tend to see them become more widely used.

Clipping is different from [[back-formation]]&amp;nbsp;– back-formation may change the part of speech or the word's meaning, whereas clipping creates shortened words from longer words, but does ''not'' change the part of speech or the meaning of the word.

According to {{Interlanguage link multi|Irina Arnold|ru|3=Арнольд, Ирина Владимировна}} (1986),&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; clipping mainly consists of the following types:
# Initial clipping
# Final clipping
# Medial clipping
# Complex clipping

==Final clipping, or apocope==
{{main article|Apocope}}
Final (or back) clipping is the most common type, in which the beginning of the prototype is retained. The unclipped original may be either a simple or a composite. Examples are: ''ad'' (advertisement), ''cable'' (cablegram), ''doc'' (doctor), ''exam'' (examination), ''fax'' (facsimile), ''gas'' (gasoline), ''gym'' (gymnastics, gymnasium), ''memo'' (memorandum), ''mutt'' (muttonhead), ''pub'' (public house), ''pop'' (popular music).

==Initial clipping, or apheresis==
{{main article|Apheresis (linguistics)}}
Initial (or fore) clipping retains the final part of the prototype. Examples: ''bot'' (robot), ''chute'' (parachute), ''roach'' (cockroach), ''coon'' (raccoon), ''gator'' (alligator), ''phone'' (telephone), ''pike'' (turnpike), ''varsity'' (university), ''net'' (Internet).

Final and initial clipping may be combined and result in curtailed words with the middle part of the prototype retained, which is the stressed syllable. Examples: ''flu'' (influenza), ''frig'' or ''fridge'' (refrigerator), ''jams'' or ''jammies'' (pajamas/pyjamas), ''polly'' (apollinaris), ''shrink'' ([[Psychiatrist|head-shrinker]]), ''tec'' (detective).

==Medial clipping, or syncope==
{{main article|Syncope (phonology)}}
Words with the middle part of the word left out are equally few. They may be further subdivided into two groups: (a) words with a final-clipped stem retaining the functional morpheme: ''maths'' (mathematics), ''specs'' (spectacles); (b) contractions due to a gradual process of elision under the influence of rhythm and context. Thus, ''fancy'' (fantasy), ''ma'am'' (madam), and [[fo'c'sle]] may be regarded as accelerated forms.

==Complex clipping==
{{main|Clipped compound}}
Clipped forms are also used in [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]. One part of the original compound most often remains intact. Examples are: ''cablegram'' (''cable'' tele''gram''), ''op art'' (''op''tical ''art''), ''org-man'' (''org''anization ''man''), ''linocut'' (''lino''leum ''cut''). Sometimes both halves of a compound are clipped as in ''navicert'' (''navi''gation ''cert''ificate). In these cases it is difficult to know whether the resultant formation should be treated as a clipping or as a [[blend word|blend]], for the border between the two types is not always clear. According to Bauer (1983),&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; the easiest way to draw the distinction is to say that those forms which retain compound stress are clipped compounds, whereas those that take simple word stress are not. By this criterion ''bodbiz, Chicom, Comsymp, Intelsat, midcult, pro''-''am, photo op, sci-fi'', and ''sitcom'' are all compounds made of clippings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">{{Colognian grammar}}
An [[proverb]] in a language is a simple sentence, phrase, or occasionally phrasal expression that is commonly used so as to refer to a well known maxim, narrative, or short termed wisdom. Proverbs are often metaphorical. Proverbial expressions use parts of proverbs or full proverbs in order to refer to their meaning or basic essence in a way understood similar to a reference without complete recitation.

[[Colognian language|Colognian]] has a set of proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;There is a beautifully made documentation of more than 3000 Colognian proverbs and related expressions by Rolly Brings of [[Brings]]. See [[#Literature|literature]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them can be used in proverbial expressions. They often function similar to [[idiom]]s inside sentences &lt;ref&gt;See also [[Colognian idioms]]&lt;/ref&gt; without really being ones. They can also be used standalone, or as complete entities in dialogs. For example, someone missed something because he was not informed and says: ''{{lang|ksh|Wä et hät jewoß…}}''&lt;ref name="jewos"&gt;{{IPA-ksh|ˌvɛ² ət ˌhɛt jəˈvosˑ|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Who had known it…) and gets an answer: ''{{lang|ksh|Wä et hät jedonn.}}''&lt;ref name="jedonn"&gt;{{IPA-ksh|ˌvɛ² ət ˌhɛt jəˈdɔn²|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Who had done it.) in exchange. (See [[#janunjriet|below]] for an explanation)

== Examples ==
* ''{{lang|ksh|Bei ons en der Schtrohß hädd_enne affrekahnesche Lahde opjemaht … un noh drei Woche widder zoh. Woröm? Joh, wat der Buur nit kännt.}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|beɪ ˌʊns ˌendə ˈʃtʁɔs² &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ˈhɛdənə afʁeˈkˑaˌneʃə ˈla²də ˈopˑjəˌmat² &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ʊnˈnɔ² dʁeɪ vɔχə ˈvɪdɐ tso² ‖ voˈʁøm ‖ vatːɛ buʁ² nitˈkɛnt ‖|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (An African shop opened in our street … and closed three weeks later. Why? What the farmer does not know.) - The proverb: ''{{lang|ksh|Wat der Buur nit kännt, dat freß hä nit.}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|vatːɛ buʁ² nitˈkɛnt &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; dat ˈfʁesɛ² nit ‖|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The farmer does not eat what he does not know.) hints that conservative people, and people of lesser education, are unlikely to experiment or try the unknown. Hence an African shop in a residential area of non-Africans is unsuccessful.
* ''{{lang|ksh|Wi'sch jehoot han, wat onse Börjermeister övver et Klüngele jesaat hät, ha'sch bei mer jedaach, wä em Jlahshuus sez, ne.}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|viːʃ jəˈɦot² han &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; vad ˈonzə ˈbøʁjɐˌmeɪstɐ ˈœvəʁət ˈklʏŋələ jəˈzaːt hɛt &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; dɔˈɦaʃ beɪ mɐjəˈdaːχ &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; vɛ em jlas²ˈhuːsets ‖ nə ‖|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Having heard our mayor talk about corruption, I thought: He, who lives in a glass house, isn't it so?) - A proverb "Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones." exists in Colognian as well as in English and conveys the same [[Semantic|meaning]]. The speaker refers to it so as to indirectly voice his belief that the mayor or his office are involved in corruption, too, despite what the mayor said.
* ''{{lang|ksh|Woh der Düüvel hen driiß: Der Fleischouer hädd_ene Mäzehdes jewunne.}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|ˈvɔ² dɐ ˈdyːvəl hen ˈdʁiːs &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; dɐ ˈfleɪʃˌhovɐ ˈɦɛdənə mɛˈtse²dəs jəˈvonə ‖ |pron}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Where the devil shits to: Mr. Fleischhauer [a millionaire car dealer] won a Mercedes-Benz [in the lottery].) - The proverb ''{{lang|ksh|Der Düüvel driiß emmer op der jrühßte Houfe}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|dɐ ˈdyːvəl ˈdʁiːs ˈemɐ ˌop dɐ ˈjʁysˑtə ˈhou²fə|pron}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The devil always shits on the biggest pile.) refers to the observation that wealthy people tend to get richer and richer, while poor ones do not, and attributes the perceived injustice of it to the devil.
* &lt;span id="janunjriet"&gt;The phrase pair ''{{lang|ksh|Wä et hät jedonn.}}''&lt;ref name="jedonn"/&gt; (Who had done it.) and ''{{lang|ksh|Wä et hät jewoß…}}''&lt;ref name="jewos"/&gt; (Who had known it…) refer to the [[Legend of Jan and Jriet|well known narrative]] of a couple who did not marry because she felt they were too poor. He left the city to come back after years as a rich and well respected duke. When they met in the market where she was selling cheap pottery, the beforementioned dialogue happened.&lt;/span&gt;
* The sentence ''{{lang|ksh|Jäk lohß Jäke lahns.}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-ksh|ˈjɛkˌlɔs²ˈjɛɡ̥əˌlans²|pron|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Fool, let fools pass [by].) is often cited as a reminder on various occasions - from the wish not be too concerned with a specific persons snobbish, impatient, or inconsiderate behavior, to the gentle hint that the addressed person could be seen so by others, and many more.

'''David I. Salo''' is a [[linguistics|linguist]] who worked on the languages of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] for the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], expanding the Elvish languages (particularly [[Sindarin]]) by building on vocabulary already known from published works, and defining some languages that previously had a very small published vocabulary. In 2003, he was a graduate student in [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref name="WSJ030119"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Susan Lampert | title=Linguist Is A Specialist In Elvish, The Uw Grad Student Provides Translations For Lord Of The Rings Movies. | url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/madison.com/html/archive_files/wsj/2003/01/19/0301180299.php | date=2003-01-19 | accessdate=2007-11-14 | work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]] | publisher=William K.

==Salo on Tolkien's languages==
David Salo's interest in Tolkien's languages arose when he read Tolkien's works as a boy. As an [[undergraduate]] at [[Macalester College]] he studied Latin, Greek, and linguistics, and used the knowledge gained to improve his understanding of Tolkien's languages.&lt;ref name="ALT2002Spring"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Need an Elvish Translator? We've Got the Right Person for the Job |journal=Artes Liberales Today |url=http://www.ls.wisc.edu/ArtesLibv7n1.pdf |year=2002 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=4 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison|College of Letters &amp; Science, University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |accessdate=2007-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221080323/http://www.ls.wisc.edu/ArtesLibv7n1.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he was among the founders of the Elfling [[mailing list]] for [[Tolkienist]] language enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nellardo.com/lang/elf/faq.html#s0.2 |title=Elfling FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) List |work=nellardo.com |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he published a linguistic analysis of Sindarin: ''A Gateway to Sindarin: A Grammar of an Elvish language from J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings'' ({{ISBN|0-87480-800-6}}). This book was reviewed in 2006 in volume 3 of the journal ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straubhaar | first=Sandra Ballif | title=Gateway to Sindarin (review) | journal=[[Tolkien Studies]] | volume= 3 | year=2006 | pages=166–173 | publisher=[[West Virginia University Press]] | issn=1547-3155 | doi=10.1353/tks.2006.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was further reviewed in the context of Tolkienian linguistics as a whole in volume 4 of ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'' (2007).&lt;ref name="CFH in TS"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hostetter | first=Carl F. | authorlink=Carl F. Hostetter | title=Tolkienian Linguistics: The First Fifty Years | journal=[[Tolkien Studies]] | volume= 4 | year=2007 | pages=1–46 | publisher=[[West Virginia University Press]] | issn=1547-3155 | doi=10.1353/tks.2007.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salo was contracted for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The ''Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] to write all the material in [[Elvish language|Elvish]], [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]], and other languages for the movies, as well as assist with other language-related items such as the [[Tengwar]] and [[Cirth]] inscriptions which appear in the movies. Salo also translated the lyrics for the movie soundtracks.&lt;ref name="Phoenix New Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2001-12-20/culture/talkin-tolkien/1 | title=Talkin' Tolkien | accessdate=2007-11-14 | first=Robert | last=Wilonsky | work=Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Salo provided similar services as the Tolkien language consultant for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2011/09/11/47992-david-salo-linguistic-consultant-for-the-hobbit-speaks-at-geek-kon/ | title=David Salo, Linguistic Consultant for The Hobbit, speaks at Geek Kon | accessdate=2012-12-31 | work=TheOneRing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salo on Conlanging==

Salo also co-administrates one of the larger online forums for [[conlanger]]s, Facebook's Constructed Languages &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/constructedlanguages/ |title=Constructed Languages group |accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; group.

'''Demise''', in its original meaning, is an [[Law French|Anglo-Norman legal term]] (from  [[French language|French]] ''démettre'', from [[Latin]] ''dimittere'', to send away) for the transfer of an [[estate (land)|estate]], especially by [[lease]]. The word has an operative effect in a lease, implying a covenant "for quiet enjoyment."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The phrase "[[demise of the Crown]]" is used in English law to signify the immediate transfer of the sovereignty, with all its attributes and prerogatives, to the successor without any [[interregnum]] in accordance with the maxim "[[the Crown]] never dies." At [[common law]] the death of the sovereign ''eo facto'' dissolved Parliament, but this was abolished by the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]]. Similarly the common law doctrine that all offices held under the Crown were terminated at its demise has been abolished by the [[Demise of the Crown Act 1901]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Origin of word "demise"==
The English word "demise" comes from the Latin word "demissio (see, e.g., [[ex demissione]]), which comes from Latin "demittere," which is a compound of de + mittere, meaning "to send from".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{sfn|Burrill|1850|p=361}}

==Usage==
Through [[euphemism]], "(a person's) demise" is often used as a stilted term for a person's death.  "Demise" can also be used to describe the passing away of some thing, for example: "After 36 years of providing authentic Indian cuisine in Bath, the demise of the Rajpoot restaurant occurred when its owner, Ahmed Chowdhury, retired.  It ceased trading on 24 December 2016".{{cn|date=March 2017}}

'''East Central German''' ({{lang-de|Ostmitteldeutsche Dialekte}}) is the eastern, non-[[Franconian languages|Franconian]] sub-group of [[Central German]] dialects, themselves part of [[High German languages|High German]]. Present-day [[Standard German]] as a [[High German languages|High German]] variant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1205-16 |title=Ethnologue: East Middle German |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; has actually developed from a compromise of East Central (especially [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]] promoted by [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]]) and [[East Franconian German]]. East Central German dialects are mainly spoken in [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] and parts of [[Brandenburg]], and were formerly also spoken in [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]].

==Dialects==
East Central German is spoken in large parts of what is today known as the cultural area of [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] (''Mitteldeutschland''). It comprises:
*[[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] (''Thüringisch'')
*[[Upper Saxon German]] (''Obersächsisch'')

*[[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects|Lausitzisch-neumärkisch]], as distinct from Low German [[Brandenburgisch dialect|Brandenburgish]] (Markish)
**''[[Südmärkisch]]''
**[[Low Lusatian German|Lower]] and [[Upper Lusatia]]n (''Lausitzisch'')
and further:
*[[Silesian German]] (''Schlesisch'') (nearly extinct)
*[[High Prussian dialect|High Prussian]] (''Hochpreußisch'') (nearly extinct)

The '''European Day of Languages''' is 26 September, as proclaimed by the [[Council of Europe]] on 6 December 2001, at the end of the [[European Year of Languages]] (2001), which had been jointly organised by the Council of Europe and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=16954&amp;lang=en |title=Recommendation 1539 (2001) Final version: European Year of Languages|website=assemby.coe.int|date=2001|accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to encourage [[language learning]] across [[Europe]].

==Objectives==
The general objectives of the European Day of Languages are to:
* Alert the public to the importance of language learning and diversify the range of languages learned in order to increase [[multilingualism|plurilingualism]] and [[intercultural communication|intercultural understanding]]; 
* Promote the rich linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] of Europe;
* Encourage lifelong language [[lifelong learning|learning]] in and out of school.

In keeping with these rules, people, young and old, are encouraged to take up a language, or take special pride in their existing language skills. Also, those responsible for providing access to language learning are encouraged to make it easier for people to learn a range of languages, and to support policy initiatives to promote languages. There is also emphasis on learning a language other than English.

On the occasion of the day, a range of events are organised across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecml.at/edl/default.asp?t=database |title=European Day of Languages 2012 / Journée européenne des langues 2012 |publisher=Ecml.at |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;quot;European Day of Languages&amp;quot; |url=https://news.google.com/nwshp?tab=wn&amp;q=%22European+Day+of+Languages%22&amp;ie=UTF-8 |title=European Day of Languages |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those for children, television and radio programmes, language classes and conferences. The events are not organised by the Council of Europe or the European Union nor do they allocate special funding (i.e. apart from their existing language programmes) for the day. Member states and potential partners are given a free hand to organise activities. To coordinate the activities organised at national level, the Council of Europe asks participating countries to nominate "National Relay Persons" for the day. The national relay in the UK used to be CILT, the National Centre for Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl |title=European Day of Languages |publisher=Cilt.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324141035/http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl/ |archivedate=2009-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages of Europe==
{{main|Languages of Europe}}
There are about 225 [[indigenous language]]s in Europe &amp;ndash; roughly 3% of the world's total{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Most of the [[European languages]] are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. Since the end of the 18th century, the most widespread language of Europe (both in terms of geography and the number of native speakers) has been [[Russian language|Russian]], which replaced French. Counting only native speakers, approximately 150 million Europeans speak Russian on a daily basis, followed by [[German language|German]] (approx. 95 mil.), [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (each by 65 mil.), [[Italian language|Italian]] (60 mil.), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] (40 mil. each), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (30 mil.) and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (26 mil.). As far as foreign language studies are concerned, English is currently the most popular foreign language in Europe, followed by German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish

==Multilingualism today==
{{Main|List of multilingual countries and regions#Europe}}
According to the European Union survey "Europeans and their Languages" ("Special [[Eurobarometer]] 243", February 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|title=Europeans and their Languages|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56% of EU [[citizen]]s (25 member states) speak a language other than their [[mother tongue]], but 44% admit to not knowing any languages other than their [[native language]]. However, 28% have knowledge of two foreign languages. Among EU citizens, 38% indicate that they know [[English language|English]], followed by 14% knowing [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]], 7% Russian, 5% Spanish and 3% Italian. The typical multilingual European is a student or someone holding a managerial position or someone born in a country where the language of his/her parents is different from the main language of the country.

With greater numbers of [[immigrant]]s and [[refugee]]s, European cities have become more multilingual.{{when|date=September 2012}} For example: in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] many recent immigrants speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Tatar]], [[Azeri]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or one of many other languages; in [[London]] some 300 languages are spoken ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] etc.).

The European Union adheres to a policy of multilingualism, both in its institutional workings and as an aim for its citizens. At the 2002 [[European Council|EU summit]] in [[Barcelona]], it set a target for children to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/71025.pdf|title=Presidency Conclusions; March 2002|publisher=Ue.eu.int|accessdate=2012-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205041113/http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/71025.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingualism for the EU is linked to [[employment|worker mobility]] and the European economy. The European Union spends more than €30 million a year promoting language learning and linguistic diversity through the ''[[Socrates programme|Socrates]]'' and ''[[Leonardo da Vinci programme|Leonardo da Vinci]]'' programmes, a policy that began with the pioneering ''[[Lingua programme]]'' in 1990.

'''Fluid construction grammar''' ('''FCG''') is an open-source computational [[construction grammar]] formalism that allows computational linguists to formally write down the inventory of lexical and grammatical constructions as well as to do experiments in language learning and language evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steels|first=Luc (ed.)|title=Design Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in a precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing, production and learning. The formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at [https://www.fcg-net.org/fcg-interactive the FCG website].

FCG integrates many notions from contemporary [[computational linguistics]] such as [[feature structure]] and unification-based language processing, but uses them in a novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory. Constructions are considered bi-directional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that FCG provides meta-layer processing for coping with novelty, partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is primarily carried out by [[Luc Steels]] and his teams at the [http://ai.vub.ac.be VUB AI Lab] in Brussels and the [http://biologiaevolutiva.org/lsteels/ Language Evolution Lab] in Barcelona, and the [http://csl.sony.fr Sony Computer Science Laboratories] in Paris. Besides Steels, current and former contributors to the FCG formalism include [https://ai.vub.ac.be/members/katrien Katrien Beuls], [https://ai.vub.ac.be/members/paul Paul Van Eecke], [http://www.remivantrijp.be/ Remi van Trijp], Joris Bleys, Joachim De Beule, Martin Loetzsch, Nicolas Neubauer, Michael Spranger, Wouter Van den Broeck, Pieter Wellens, and others.

==Transient structure==

FCG treats parsing and production as a search problem, in which the FCG engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize a meaning (language production) or the best semantic network (or meaning representation) to analyze an utterance (parsing). Each state representation in the search process is called a Transient Structure. A Transient Structure can be considered as an extended feature structure, as it consists of a (flat) list of "units" that consist of a unit-name (a unique constant symbol) and a unit-body (a set of feature-value pairs). Older versions of FCG (before 2011) used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax, but the current version implements a single representation for all linguistic information.

==Constructions==

FCG constructions (or technically speaking: construction schemas) are treated as the operators of the search process. That is, by applying a construction to a transient structure, a new transient structure (or state representation) in the search space may be created. Just like transient structures, constructions mostly consists of units of feature-value pairs. Constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts:
* A conditional part: This part of the construction specifies the conditions under which the construction may apply. Moreover, units of features that appear in the conditional part are split into a "comprehension lock" and a "formulation lock". This split is important for ensuring the bidirectional application of an FCG construction (see below).
* A Contributing part: This part of the construction specifies information that the construction may add to the transient structure if the conditions for application are satisfied.

==Linguistic processing==

To decide whether a construction can apply, the conditional part is "matched" against the current transient structure using a unification-based algorithm. In production, only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure; whereas in parsing, only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered. If a match is successful, the FCG engine will "merge" all of the units of feature-value pairs with the transient structure in a similar unification-based process.

==Flexibility==

FCG features a meta-layers of diagnostics, repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty, errors and unexpected input during processing. These diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring the (automated) acquisition of new constructions.

The '''Gbaya languages''', also known as '''Gbaya–Manza–Ngbaka''', are a family of perhaps a dozen languages spoken mainly in the western [[Central African Republic]] and across the border in [[Cameroon]], with one language (Ngbaka) in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], with a few small languages in the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Many of the languages go by the ethnic name ''[[Gbaya people|Gbaya]],'' though the largest, with over a million speakers, is called [[Ngbaka language|Ngbaka]], a name shared with the [[Ngbaka languages]] of the [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] family.

==Classification==
The Gbaya languages were once thought to be part of the [[Ubangian languages|Ubangian]] family. However, Moñino (2010), followed by Blench (2012), propose that they may instead be most closely related to the [[Central Gur languages]], or perhaps constitute an independent branch of Niger–Congo, but that they do not form a group with Ubangian.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf Niger-Congo: an alternative view]&lt;/ref&gt; Connections with Bantu are mostly limited to cultural vocabulary, and several Central Sudanic words suggest that the proto-Gbaya were hunter-gatherers who acquired agriculture from the [[Sara languages|Sara]].&lt;ref name="Moñino"&gt;Moñino (2010), [https://iaaw.hu-berlin.de/afrika/linguistik-und-sprachen/veranstaltungen/greenberg-workshop/the-position-of-gbaya-manza-ngbaka-group-among-the-niger-congo-languages The position of Gbaya-Manza-Ngbaka group among the Niger-Congo languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
Moñino (2010)&lt;ref name="Moñino"/&gt; reconstructed proto-Gbaya and proposes the following family tree:

Several of these varieties may be mutually intelligible, such as Ngbaka, Ngbaka Manza, and Manza.

There are one or two other small Gbaya languages scattered in Congo and along the Cameroon border, such as [[Bonjo language|Bonjo]].

==History==
The term goes back at least as far as the Roman tradition of [[rhetoric]]al instruction. [[Quintilian]] (ca. AD 95) recommends teaching students ''ut quotiens exclamandum erit lateris conatus sit ille, non capitis'' ("that when the voice has to be raised the effort comes from the lungs and not from the head," ''Inst.'' 1.11.8, transl. Russell). The first recorded mention of the term in a musical context was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the throat and the chest voice (pectoris, guttoris, capitis — at this time it is likely head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians. Edited by Stanley Sadie, Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund. {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}, Copyright Macmillan 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later adopted within [[bel canto]], the Italian opera singing method, where it was identified as the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, passagio and head registers. This approach is still taught by some vocal pedagogists today.&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;{{cite book

However, as knowledge of human physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists have redefined or even abandoned the use of the term head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the term '''head register''' has become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations that are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term "head voice" over the term "head register." These vocal pedagogists also hold that many of the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the controversy over this terminology. Also, the term head register is not used within [[speech pathology]] and is not one of the four main vocal registers identified by speech pathologists.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;
The following is an overview of the two predominant views on head voice within vocal pedagogy.

==Differing views on head voice==

===Head voice and vocal registration===
One prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "[[chest register]]", "head register", and "[[falsetto register]]" and women's voices into "[[chest register]]", "[[middle register]]", and "[[head register]]". According to this practice, singing in the '''head register''' feels to the singer as if the tone is resonating in his or her head (rather than primarily in the chest or throat). According to an early 20th-century book written by David Clippinger, all voices have a head register, whether [[basso|bass]] or [[soprano]].&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clippinger|first=David A.|title=The Head Voice and Other Problems: Practical Talks on Singing|publisher=Oliver Ditson Company|year=1917|page= 12|isbn =}}[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19493 at Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clippinger claims that [[male]]s and [[female]]s switch registers at the same absolute pitches. He also states that at about E flat or E above middle C the tenor passes from what is usually called open to covered tone, but which might better be called from chest to head voice. At the same absolute pitches the alto or soprano passes from the chest to the middle register. According to Clippinger there is every reason to believe that the change in the mechanism for male voices into head register is the same as that which occurs in the female voice as it goes into the middle register at the same pitches.&lt;ref name="Headv2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clippinger|first=David A.|title=The Head Voice and Other Problems: Practical Talks on Singing|publisher=[[Oliver Ditson Company]]|year=1917|page=24|isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary [[voice pedagogy|vocal pedagogy]] [[teacher|instructor]] Bill Martin seconds the view that the change from chest voice to head voice occurs at around E4 in all voices, including the bass, but Martin states in the coloratura soprano it is more likely to occur at [[Scientific pitch notation|F4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin| first = Bill | title = Pro Secrets Of Heavy Rock Singing| publisher = Sanctuary Publishing| year = 2002| page = 10 | isbn = 1-86074-437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent book by a former teacher at [[Oberlin College Conservatory of Music]] and a [[vocal]] [[pedagogy]] [[teacher]], [[Richard Miller (singer)|Richard Miller]], states that in the "tenore lirico" the higher part of the singing voice above the secondo [[passaggio]] at G4 extending upwards is referred to as "full voice in head," or ''voce piena in testa'', effectively stating the head register begins at G4 in the "tenore lirico," not at E4.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Richard|title=Training Tenor Voices|publisher=Schirmer|date=March 1993|pages=3, 4 &amp; 6|isbn =978-0-02-871397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Singing For Dummies]], the bass changes from chest voice into middle voice around A3 or A{{music|flat}}3 below Middle C and changes into his head voice around D4 or C{{music|sharp}}4 above Middle C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesArticle/id-2014.html| title = Identifying the Fab Four of Singing Voices | accessdate = 18 February 2007 | author = Pamelia S. Phillips| publisher = Wiley Publishing| quote = ''Bass'' is the lowest of the voice types...
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the head register (which is above the chest register), some of the bottom end leaves the voice, but it's still, according to Martin, a voice capable of much power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Martin| first = Bill | title = Pro Secrets Of Heavy Rock Singing| publisher = Sanctuary Publishing| year = 2002| page = 11 | isbn = 1-86074-437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations for the physiological mechanisms behind the head voice can alter from voice teacher to voice teacher. This is because, according to Clippinger, ''"In discussing the head voice it is the purpose to avoid as much as possible the mechanical construction of the instrument"''.&lt;ref name="Headv3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clippinger|first=David A.|title=The Head Voice and Other Problems: Practical Talks on Singing|publisher=[[Oliver Ditson Company]]|year=1917|page=14|isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all vocal teachers agree with this view. Thomas Appell's 1993 book ''Can You Sing a HIGH C Without Straining?''&lt;ref&gt;Appell, Can You Sing a HIGH C Without Straining?: Understanding the Break, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to refute the theory that all singers switch registers at the same absolute pitch. Appell defined chest voice as resonance below the vocal folds and head voice as resonance above the vocal folds. He recorded examples of male and female singers changing from chest voice to head voice at different pitches in an attempt to prove that the transition pitch is a function of the intensity of the vocal tone and is not absolute. At higher vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be higher. At lower vocal cord tension (intensity of singing), Appell shows that the pitch at which a singer transitions from chest to head voice will be lower.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Head voice and vocal resonation===
{{Main|Vocal resonation|Vocal registration}}
This view is that since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in the head are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the term "head voice" over the term register and divide the human voice into four registers: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is more consistent with modern understandings of human physiology and in keeping with stroboscope videos of laryngeal function during vocal [[phonation]].&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;
Tarneaud says, "during singing, the vibration of the [[vocal folds]] impresses periodic shakes on the [[larynx|laryngeal]] cartilage which transmits them to the bones in the [[human thorax|thorax]] via the laryngeal depressors, and to the bony structures in the head via the laryngeal elevators. Singers feel these shakes in the form of thoracic and facial vibrations". These internal phonatory sensations produced by laryngeal vibrations are called "resonance" by singers and teachers of singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Tarneaud
|first= J.
|date=November 1933
|title= Study of larynx and of voice by [[stroboscopy]]
|journal= Clinique (Paris)
|volume= 28
|pages= 337–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are seven parts of the human body that act as resonators and of those seven the three most effective resonators that help amplify and create the most pleasing sounds are all located in the head: the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], and the [[nasal cavity]].&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

===Not falsetto===
Resonances and registration aside, the term "head voice" is commonly used to mean "high notes that are not falsetto or strained". For example, when [[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti]], [[Stevie Wonder]] or [[Bill Withers]] slide from chest voice to a high C5 in full, balanced voice, this is referred to as "head voice".

Beginning singers who have difficulty controlling their vocal break need to be taught to eliminate or control the physiological conditions associated with falsetto or strain in a process called "head voice."&lt;ref&gt;Rock the Stage: Voice Training for Modern Singers&lt;/ref&gt; A strong falsetto is called a reinforced falsetto and a very light head voice is called voce di testa bianca or 'white head voice.'

High notes that are sung with balanced physiology do tend to have better resonance than falsetto or strained notes, so this definition does not usually contradict the other two.

'''Jedek''' is an [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] language from the Austroasiatic family first reported in 2017.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web |title=Language previously unknown to linguists discovered in Southeast Asia |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180206100349.htm |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |date=6 February 2018 |accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jedek speakers describe themselves as ethnic [[Minriq language|Menriq]] or [[Batek language|Batek]] to outsiders, but their language, although very closely related, is distinct from all other Aslian languages.&lt;ref name="Yager2017"&gt;Yager, Joanne and Niclas Burenhult. 2017. [http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2506643:5/component/escidoc:2511374/Yager_Burenhult_2017.pdf Jedek: A newly discovered Aslian variety of Malaysia]. Linguistic Typology. 21(3): 493-545. Retrieved 8 Feb. 2018, from doi:10.1515/lingty-2017-0012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Jedek speakers have no autonym (endonym). Nearby Aslian speakers, particular the [[Jahai language|Jahai]] and Menriq, refer to them as the ''Jdɛk'' [ɟᶽəˈdɛk˺].&lt;ref name="Yager2017"/&gt;

==Sociolinguistics==
Jedek is spoken by about 280 people&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |title=Unknown Language Discovered in Malaysia |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/unknown-language-discovered-malaysia-180968099/ |publisher=Smithsonian |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=10 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sungai Rual, located on the Rual River just south of the town of Jeli in [[Jeli District]], [[Kelantan]] state, northern [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. In the 1970s, the Malaysian government sponsored the resettlement of several bands of former foragers, both [[Jahai language|Jahai]] and Jedek speakers who roamed the middle reaches of the [[Pergau Dam|Pergau]] River, to the Sungai Rual area.&lt;ref name="Yager2017"/&gt; Today, the area comprises around three main hamlets and is inhabited by around seven bands, of which three are primarily [[Jahai language|Jahai]]-speaking, and the other four were primarily "Menriq/Batek", most probably Jedek.

The low number of Jedek speakers could lead it to being considered endangered, but several factors are ensuring intergenerational transmission of the language is not interrupted. Traditionally, Semang communities were highly nomadic and were accustomed to the breakup of groups to suit the particular conditions they were experiencing. The Semang also practice band exogamy, meaning that marriage between speakers of different languages is quite common. Due to frequent contact with surrounding communities, Semang are typically fluent in multiple Aslian languages, and sometimes an adjacent majority language like Malay or Thai. In addition, due to the settlement of multiple bands together, it is common for people born in Rual to marry others from Rual, leading to the intense amount of intermarriage between speakers of Jahai and Jedek, while it is also common for people to relocate to or from Rual for marriage due to the small pool of available adults, most commonly speakers of closely related languages like Jahai or Batek. In addition, the Semang have a strong tradition of maintaining their unique cultural and linguistic identity while undergoing constant contact and social change, so Jedek speakers are accustomed to transmitting their language to children in similar environments. The speaker population of Jedek has grown since the 1970s, and Jedek is used in all environments by speakers of all age groups. Living in such a multilingual environment means that the majority of Rual residents can speak or understand Jedek. 

However, this sustained contact with other Aslian languages means Jedek is undergoing changes in morphology, grammar and structure. In addition, getting a paid job invariably means knowing the national language Malay, which surrounds the Aslian speech area. And although Jedek speakers have a positive attitude towards their language, the language is unrecognized by the Malaysian government, which regards the settlement area as Jahai-speaking. So far there has been very little language development, apart from some linguists attempting to create a Malay-based orthography for the language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Jedek has 9 vowels. All vowels have nasal equivalents, and Jedek demonstrates contrastive nasalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The voiceless bilabial fricative /ɸ/ is a marginal consonant that occurs only in word-final position

Nasals are prestopped in word-final position when preceded by an oral vowel. Nasal consonants also cause progressive nasalization of vowels.

The rhotic consonant varies in pronunciation from the alveolar trill /r/ to the voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/. How the speaker pronounces it is dependent partially on the speaker's age: younger speakers are more likely to pronounce it closer to /r/ while older speakers are more likely to have a pronunciation closer to /ʁ/.

'''Kainuu Sami''' is an [[Extinct language|extinct]] [[Sami languages|Sami language]] that was spoken in [[Kainuu]]. It became extinct in the 18th century when the Kainuu Sami probably assimilated and shifted to speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Kainuu Sami belonged to the Eastern Sami language group.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The original inhabitants of Kainuu were Sami hunter-fishers. In the 17th century, the Governor General of Finland Per Brahe fostered the population growth of Kainuu by giving a ten-year tax exemption to settlers. It was necessary to populate Kainuu with Finnish farmers because the area was threatened from the east by the Russians. The immigrants to Kainuu were mainly from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]], because of which the Kainuu dialect of Finnish is very close to the [[Savo dialect]].

English is the official language and the primary language of public education, though spoken natively by a minority of people as a first language. Spanish is taught in primary and secondary schools as well. Bilingualism is very common. {{cn span|Literacy currently stands at nearly 80%.|date=November 2018}}

==Standard English and Belizean Creole==
English is the official language of Belize, a former British colony. It is the primary language of public education, government and most media outlets. The majority of Belizeans, regardless of ethnicity, speak an [[English-based creole]] called [[Belizean Creole]] (also referred to as ''Kriol'') during most informal, social and interethnic dialogue.

When a Creole language exists alongside its lexifier language, as in Belize, a continuum forms between the Creole and the lexifier language. This is known as [[code-switching]]. It is therefore difficult to substantiate or differentiate the number of Creole speakers compared to English speakers. Belizean Creole might best be described as the [[lingua franca]] of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bzj|title=Belize Kriol English|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish==
{{Main|Belizean Spanish}}
Approximately 50% of Belizeans self-identify as ''[[Mestizo]]'', ''Latino'' or ''Hispanic''.  Spanish is spoken as a native tongue by about 30% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BZ|title=Belize|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught in schools to children who do not have it as their first language. [[Spanglish|"Kitchen Spanish"]] is an intermediate form of Spanish mixed with Belizean Creole, and is spoken in northern towns such as Corozal and San Pedro.&lt;ref name="ambergriscaye.com"&gt;{{cite news | title=Northern Belize Caste War History; Location | url =http://ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/holidays.html| accessdate =21 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over half the population is bilingual, and a large segment is multilingual. Being such a small and multiethnic state surrounded by Spanish-speaking nations, multilingualism is strongly encouraged in the society.&lt;ref name="belize2011"&gt;[http://www.belize.com/belize-2010-census.html 2010 Census of Belize Overview] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120529210225/http://www.belize.com/belize-2010-census.html# |date=2012-05-29 }}. belize.com (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belize2000"&gt;[http://www.belize.com/belize-demographics 2010 Census of Belize Detailed Demographics of 2000 and 2010]. belize.com (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
Belize is also home to three [[Mayan languages]]: [[Q’eqchi’ language|Q’eqchi’]], the [[Endangered language|endangered]] [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] Belizean language of [[Mopan language|Mopan]], and [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/kek|title=Q’eqchi’|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mop|title=Maya, Mopán|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/yua|title=Maya, Yucatec|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Approximately 16,100 people speak the [[Ta-Arawakan languages|Arawakan-based]] [[Garifuna language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cab|title=Garifuna|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6,900 Mennonites in Belize speak mainly [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]] while a minority of Mennonites speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/pdt|title=Plautdietsch|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Ridley was originally from [[Consett]], [[County Durham]].&lt;ref name=LivingNorth/&gt; At the age of six months he was diagnosed with a neurological form of [[cerebral palsy]], brought about by a brain infection that left him in a coma for two months,&lt;ref name=RidleyInterview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6466294/lost-voice-guy-britains-got-talent-winner-ipad-no-friends-childhood/|title=Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy reveals ‘I didn’t have any friends as a child and my iPad saved me’|author=Amy Brookbanks|website=TheSun.co.uk|date=6 June 2018|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which affected his movement and rendered him [[muteness|unable to speak]].&lt;ref name=JonesIndependent/&gt;&lt;ref name=GraunEvans/&gt; His disability in early life made it difficult to communicate with people, until the age of eight when he received his first communication device,&lt;ref name=RidleyInterview/&gt; while his education at a school for disabled children was aided by supportive teachers.&lt;ref name=RidleyInterview/&gt; Between 1999 – 2002, he studied journalism and online journalism at the [[University of Central Lancashire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/education/former-preston-student-lee-ridley-through-to-the-next-round-of-britain-s-got-talent-1-9129001|title=Former Preston student Lee Ridley through to the next round of Britain's Got Talent|access-date=23 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving an undergraduate degree in the former, and a Masters Degree in the latter. In 2006, he worked as a journalist with the BBC and local newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CM Admin|title="Finding My Voice" – Lee Ridley|date=20 November 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tlLNZVIZjQ|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before taking on the role of online content manager for the city of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=GraunMOH&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/15/lee-ridley-bbc-new-comedy-award-2014-disabled-cerebral-palsy Lee Ridley: ‘Disabled people are either inspirational, or benefit cheats’], by Mary O'Hara, at ''[[the Guardian]]''; published 15 April 2015; retrieved 4 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Ridley began performing comedy in 2012,&lt;ref name=PatersonBBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17699744 The stand-up comic who cannot speak], by Colin Paterson; at the [[BBC]]; published 13 April 2012; retrieved 4 July 2015; "two months ago he did his first show"&lt;/ref&gt; having grown up with a love for it, including standup performances.&lt;ref name=RidleyInterview/&gt; His decision to perform standup himself came in the aftermath of a gig conducted by [[Ross Noble]], in which Ridley encountered the comedian and challenged him on the quality of Noble's impersonation of [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref name=GraunEvans/&gt; claiming he could do a far better impersonation of the renowned physicist. To formulate his routines, Ridley purchased an [[iPad]] [[Speech-generating device|voice synthesizer]] app called Speak It!, which he pre-programmed with sentences based on material he created.&lt;ref name=MawsonBBC&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-19179921 Lee Ridley: Stand-up success for 'Lost Voice Guy' comic], by Phil Mawson, at the [[BBC]]; published 9 August 2012; retrieved 4 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/11/lee_ridley_aka_lost_voice_guy.html|title=BBC – The Ouch!

In 2014, Ridley  won the [[BBC Radio New Comedy Awards]],&lt;ref name=Award&gt;[http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/000001677/lost_voice_guy_wins_new_comedy_award_2014 Lost Voice Guy wins BBC New Comedy Award 2014], at British Comedy Guide; published 17 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2015, he began to pursue a professional comedy career,&lt;ref name=Giggle&gt;[http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2015/06/bbc-launches-its-2015-radio-new-comedy-award/ BBC launches its 2015 New Comedy Award], by Andrew Dipper; at GiggleBeats; published 17 June 2015; retrieved 5 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; performing a new show entitled ''Disability for Dunces'', as part of the Edinburgh Fringe that year. The following year, he performed a sequel of the show, entitled "Volume 2", and in 2017, launched a new show entitled ''Inspiration Porn'', which made fun of "inspirational" videos and memes about disability.&lt;ref name="TWR170715"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Lost Voice Guy|url=http://theweereview.com/interview/lost-voice-guy/|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=4 June 2018|publisher=[[The Wee Review]]|last=Peacock|first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the award, he was contacted by [https://www.thesequaltrust.org.uk/meet-the-team The Sequal Trust], who asked him to come on board as a patron of their communication disability charity, a title he still holds today. 

In 2018, Ridley took a starring role on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] [[sitcom]] ''Ability'', which he co-wrote with [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony-nominated]] writer and comedian [[Katherine Jakeways]].&lt;ref name="TWR170715"/&gt; His role involved him playing as the disabled 'Matt', who moves out from his parents' home to share with his best friend from school, who refreshingly treats him as an equal but is not the influence Matt's concerned parents are looking for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-news/lost-voice-guy-lee-ridley-12415474|title=Lost Voice Guy Lee Ridley stars in new BBC Radio 4 sitcom|last=Hodgson|first=Barbara|date=6 January 2017|work=nechronicle|access-date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/ability/ British Comedy Guide: Ability]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Ridley won the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|12th series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' after successfully making it through the audition stages, and winning the show by the public vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's Got Talent's The Lost Voice Guy has everyone in stitches|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/britains-got-talent/news/a855342/britains-got-talent-lost-voice-guy/|date=21 April 2018|accessdate=21 April 2018|publisher=[[ Digital Spy|Digital Spy]]|last=Hegarty|first=Tasha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RidleyBGT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chortle 4 June 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title= Revealed: Just how clear was Lost Voice Guy's victory |url= http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/06/04/40131/revealed%3A_just_how_clear_was_lost_voice_guys_victory| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 4 June 2018 | website= www.chortle.co.uk |publisher= [[Chortle]]| accessdate= 4 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29981">The '''MOGUL framework'''  is a research framework aiming to provide a theoretical perspective on the nature of language. MOGUL (Modular On-line Growth and Use of Language) draws on the common ground underlying various related areas of cognitive science including psycholinguistics, [[theoretical linguistics]], first- and second-language acquisition, [[neurolinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]]; it is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research.

The MOGUL framework's background assumption is that the mind is composed of [[expert systems]] which have evolved over time, one of which is responsible for human linguistic ability. Historically, scientific studies of language have been divided between many sub-disciplines; theoretical linguists focus on the abstract properties of language&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers in other fields investigate how language is used and processed in real time: either in psychological terms or (in the case of neurolinguistics) through a study of the physical systems of neurons in the brain. Each field of study has developed its own research traditions and technical vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate insights across disciplines. The MOGUL Framework represents an attempt to identify common themes and compatible approaches in different (but related fields), and hence to facilitate integration.

==Overview==
MOGUL is designed as a platform for the generation of new hypotheses, with a terminology and a set of interrelated concepts that can be used across more than one discipline. Although not a full-fledged theory in its own right, it sets out various theoretical claims based on the current literature in a range of research domains. As suggested below it is not connectionist in the most widely used sense of that term, although it employs terms and concepts familiar to connectionists such as competition, activation, activation levels and so forth. The same processing perspective also requires the long-established Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance to be viewed in a somewhat different way. [[Linguistic competence]] (knowledge) is not compartmentalised and placed in a separate box in the model, which then forms the object for a processor (or processors) to act on. Rather, it is instantiated and implicit within the processing system. The distinction between mental representation and processing is still valid, but is expressed in a way that ought to allow the abstract properties of linguistic systems in the mind to be more easily investigated in conjunction with real-time linguistic phenomena. The inspiration for this approach is the work of [[Ray Jackendoff]]. Here the architecture of the [[language faculty]] is formulated in such a way as to facilitate statements about competence-related, representational issues and their relationship to real-time language processing within the same model.

==Scope==
Empirical evidence for the claims and assumptions set out in MOGUL rests essentially on the experimental findings of the various fields of research on which it is based. The MOGUL framework queries current solutions and raises new questions based upon this body of evidence, in the hope that answers to such questions will be sought in the related areas by appropriate researchers.

More specifically, MOGUL represents an attempt to provide ways of investigating how first- or second-language processing relates to linguistic development and how language in the monolingual and multilingual language user is situated within human cognitive architecture in general. What exactly happens, even in milliseconds, when someone is exposed to the sights and sounds of a new language? How do we explain what gets noticed and what gets regularly ignored? What about the fixed stages that people seem to pass though? How is it that we have so little conscious control over what we are attempting to acquire? Why do children appear to be worse language learners in the short run and much better in the long run? How can two or more language systems cohabit in one mind? Answers to these questions require an interdisciplinary approach. Two major sources for inspiration for the approach described here are the ideas of [[Generative linguistics|generative linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] on language faculty and modularity and [[Global Workspace Theory]], as advanced by [[Bernard Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars 1988, 1997; Jackendoff 1987, 2002, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first MOGUL publication was released in 2004 and was a keynote article in ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, J &amp; M. Sharwood Smith. (2004). Acquisition by processing: a modular  perspective on language development. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' 7,1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to situate languages within a wider cognitive context, the MOGUL framework is designed to provide a basic architecture that purports to explain how (in general terms) the mind functions. This means that it is not an account of brain function, although it is set out in such a way that might facilitate such accounts.

==Modules, processing units and working memory==
Briefly, MOGUL architecture follows Jackendoff in positing a generic cognitive module (or, in MOGUL, a processing unit) which consists of an integrative processor operating on structural elements (structures) in a memory store. Specifically, it works with activated elements that are raised into working memory from that memory store.

[[File:gen processor.jpg|300px|thumb|MOGUL architecture|alt=Diagram of MOGUL linguistic theory]]Modules are only somewhat generic in structure; the rest is very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of [[working memory]] as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: it is part of the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory "surface" within the same store.  In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley 2007, Cowan 1999, Nairne 2002 and Paradis 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from – and independent of – for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a MOGUL module (based on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see "MOGUL architecture in a nutshell" below).

This functional architecture may be neurally and anatomically instantiated in different ways: the design of systems such as that proposed by Jackendoff and others (including MOGUL) involves no specific claims about the precise nature and location of the neural system. These are two different levels of description. The auditory module (translated into cortical terms) involves several brain regions distributed across the supratemporal plane; activation in MOGUL terms (when translated into neurological terms) may involve both excitatory and inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, functional auditory structure (as described within the MOGUL framework) must be distinguished from anatomical and physiological auditory structure.

==Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT)==
An important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the [[parser]]. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only [[language acquisition]] and [[language attrition]] (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, W. (2005). Syntactic Carpentry: An Emergentist Approach to Syntax. Mahwah, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, the claim is that all development is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated.  Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word "ship" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying "sheep" and "shape" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener).&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The "ship" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic "use it or lose it" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole.

As we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned.

Although the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each module is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant modules (processing units) are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. MOGUL espouses both [[modularity]] of mind and a constrained form of [[connectionism]] with a complex web of expert systems, each with its own particular organising principles. In this way, MOGUL makes claims not only about language abilities but about the mind in general.

==Comprehension and production==
The core modules involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Phonological, syntactic and conceptual processing work in one direction in response to visual and auditory events in the environment (typically in listening to speech or reading a text), but they also work in the other direction to produce speech or writing (or messages in [[sign language]]). Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures.  Meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in [[Writing system|writing]] or signing.

When the basic direction of processing is, say, from conceptual structure to speech, the assembling of an appropriate structural chain is not carried out in a rigid unidirectional sequence; at different levels, different options will be available and compete for selection. In production, some options may be partially formed and then be dropped in favour of a better-fitting rival structure. In this way the ultimate structural chain is built up incrementally, out of the more accessible candidate structures that happen to provide the best overall fit at the time. Comprehension works according to the same principles, with parallel processing and split-second editing and revising until a best-fit interpretation is arrived at. It may be the wrong interpretation but it will be the best fit, given the person's current processing resources at that particular moment in time.

As an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage – in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus [[Syntax|syntactic structure]]) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in "a boy hit the ball", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain.  As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles.  Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure).

==Perception and affect (PopS and AfS)==
One feature of the MOGUL approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of [[perception]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of "a boy hit the ball" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept "boy". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co-activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. MOGUL follows the view that high levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of ''perceptual output structures'' (POpS).

POpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses – or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in MOGUL are ''visual structures'' (VS) and ''auditory structures'' (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word "dog" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully.

Perceptual output structures are strongly interconnected. This enables a coordinated responses to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, since POpS mediate between the external environment and the internal operations of the mind that are inaccessible to awareness, POpS conform closely with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, a hypothetical prerequisite for awareness to occur. It is also reflected in the condition known as [[synaesthesia]]: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. Another example of connection is provided by the experimentally-induced [[McGurk effect]]. Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips).

The main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word "dog" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its ''conceptual structure''(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do ''not'' have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and ''cannot'') achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature.

The affective system works with ''affective structures'' (AfS) that are constructed using primitives such as "fear" and "disgust", which are discussed in [[affective neuroscience]] in the work of [[António Damásio]].&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; AfS are connected to POpS and contribute directly to appropriate responses of the organism to events in the immediate environment, to its chances of survival and to the experience of conscious awareness. Making these aspects of mental life more explicit helps researchers to understand and devise hypotheses about how consciousness and emotion affect online language performance and language acquisition. By the same token, it should help to show how certain aspects of language behaviour are (or might be) immune to such influence.

==Knowing a language==
Language is a vague term and is its widest sense involves a host of different processing units, only some of which are what makes human language unique to this species, that is, the phonological and syntactic expert systems that make up what, in [[generative linguistics]], is called the [[language module]] and whose special properties are often subsumed under the name [[Universal Grammar]]. Closely associated with this core system, but not part of the language module per se, are a rich set of conceptual structures developed over the lifespan, as also b) auditory structures that have been matched up with phonological structures and c) visual structures created for interpreting writing and sign language. In addition, there are the various motor structures involved in the production of language in its different modes. One might lump all of this together and call it ''knowledge of language''. None of it, however, constitutes 'knowledge of language' if, by this term, we rather mean language that we can think and talk about and analyse, in other words ''metalinguistic knowledge'', which, as with all forms of [[metacognition]], is constructed out of conceptual structure and various perceptual output structures. [[File:metaroute.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Linguistic diagram]]To take a simple example, the word "horse" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the  sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning as illustrated in the figure on the right. Not represented in the figure is the additional conceptual structure (over above the meaning of horse itself), consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as ''word, syllable, noun, definition'' and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the language module is not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. In the MOGUL version of metalinguistic processing, the essential chain of connections that are assembled completely bypasses the PS and SS systems. Processing within the language module will always kick in automatically on exposure of language stimuli, but metalinguistic (explicit) activity is processed elsewhere. Following the standard arguments from [[learnability]] theory as applied in [[generative linguistics]], the language module is nevertheless crucial for all other types of linguistic activity and is vital for explaining the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; No amount of activation of auditory and conceptual structure alone can explain the growth of language in the mind following repeated exposure to speech, most obviously in the case of little children and (arguably) adults as well.

Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be "right" or "wrong". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however.  An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.

==MOGUL architecture in a nutshell==
In this figure, the MOGUL version of the cognitive system is sketched in simplified form. The circles or ovals represent specialised processors, and the rectangular boxes each represent the particular memory store of structures which they are designed to handle. Affective structures (AfS) are not differentiated in this figure. Also, for simplicity's sake, only five "senses" are portrayed in the POpS system. All languages are handled by the same syntactic and phonological processors, but different languages will involve both shared and unique ''syntactic structures'' (SS) and ''phonological structures'' (PS) residing in (respectively) their syntactic and phonological memory stores. Mental activity is characterised by the formation of chains or networks of structures across different modules. This is achieved by means of interface processors (the dotted arrows) following Jackendoff (1987). These are bimodular, in that they match elements in two adjacent modules; they can only access and link certain structural elements in one or the other module. Moreover, the matching is not a "translation" of one element into terms (the code) of another system; there is no exchange of information, merely a chaining of elements that can otherwise only be processed within its own particular processing unit or module.

'''Mary Jane Lamond''' (born 1960) is a [[Canadian]] [[Celtic folk]] musician who performs traditional [[Canadian Gaelic]] folk songs from [[Cape Breton Island]].&lt;ref name="Keillor2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elaine Keillor|title=Music in Canada: Capturing Landscape and Diversity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4rf9W02vv0C&amp;pg=PT298|date=18 March 2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-3391-2|pages=298–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her music combines  traditional and contemporary material. Lamond is known as the vocalist on [[Ashley MacIsaac]]'s 1995 hit single "Sleepy Maggie", and for her solo Top 40 hit "Horo Ghoid thu Nighean", the first single from her 1997 album ''Suas e!''.&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians/&gt;  Her 2012 collaboration with fiddler Wendy MacIsaac, ''Seinn,'' was named one of the top 10 folk and americana albums of 2012 by National Public Radio in the United States.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/bestmusic2012/2012/12/07/166570064/top-10-folk-Americana-albums-of-2012 |title=Top 10 Folk &amp; Americana Albums of 2012 |work=NRP Music |publisher=[[NPR]] |location=Washington, DC |date=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the youngest of five children, Lamond moved a number of times during her childhood, to a series of cities and towns in Ontario and Quebec. Her parents were both originally from Nova Scotia, however, and she often visited her father's parents in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] during her summer vacations. There she was first exposed to Celtic culture in general and to Gaelic music and the Gaelic language in particular.&lt;ref name=TCE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/macleans/celtic-music-reels-in-new-fans |last=Turbide |first=Diane |title=Celtic Music Reels in New Fans |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica-Dominion |location=Toronto, Ontario |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamond graduated from [[Westmount High School]] in Montreal, and then returned to Nova Scotia to enroll in the Celtic Studies program at [[St. Francis Xavier University]], where she studied the school's collection of 350 field recordings of traditional Scots-Gaelic songs.&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians/&gt; She graduated with a minor in Music at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] in [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3495100053.html |title=Mary Jane Lamond |work=Contemporary Musicians, 2002 |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While still a student, Lamond recorded an album of traditional material called ''Bho Thir Nan Craobh (From the Land of the Trees)'', which she released independently in 1994. Among the musicians on the album was fiddler [[Ashley MacIsaac]].&lt;ref name=CelticCafe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celticcafe.com/archive/Music/Lukeman/maryjanelamond.html |title=Mary Jane Lamond - September 200 Artist of the Month |work=The Celtic Cafe |publisher= |location= |date= |accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacIsaac had first seen Lamond perform in 1991 with a local band in Antigonish and was impressed with what he saw as her "punk attitude," even as she was singing Gaelic songs.&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians/&gt; MacIsaac and Lamond collaborated again in 1995 on the song "Sleepy Maggie" for his album ''[[Hi™ How Are You Today?]]'', which became a breakthrough recording for both of them.&lt;ref name=TCE/&gt;

Lamond followed this up with a solo album in 1997 called ''Suas e!'' (which in English means, roughly, "Go for it!"). The album was nominated for a Juno Award and an East Coast Music award.&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians/&gt;  She released ''Làn Dùil'' in 1999, which cultural magazine PopMatters said "should establish her as a major talent in Celtic and world music.&lt;ref name=PopMatters&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/lamondmaryjane-lan/|authorlink1=Imre Szeman |last=Szeman |first=Imre |title=Mary Jane Lamond: Làn Dùil |work=PopMatters |publisher=PopMatters Media Inc. |location=Evanston, Illinois |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Orain Ghàidhlig'', most of which was recorded live in North River, Cape Breton Island, followed in 2001.&lt;ref name=ContemporaryMusicians/&gt;

After 2000, Lamond mostly put her solo recording career aside for a variety of other projects, including composition for film and stage, and working with a variety of cultural agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capefarewell.com/seachange/wild-gaelic/  |title=Às an Traigh - From the Shore.

She has been active in the ongoing preservation and revitalization of the [[Scottish Gaelic in Canada|Scottish Gaelic]] culture in Cape Breton as a member of the Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia and the Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council, and as a teacher of Gaelic language and song workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creative.novascotia.ca/mary-jane-lamond |title=Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council |work=novascotia.ca |publisher=Province of Nova Scotia |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaelic.ca/inthenews.html |title=The Council in the News |work=www.gaelic.ca |publisher=The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia |location=Inverness, Nova Scotia |accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Lamond and fiddler Wendy McIsaac released the album ''Seinn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/seinn-mw0002414790|title=Seinn - review|last=Nickson|first=Chris|work=allmusic.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Their guitar-and-fiddle matchup is beautifully balanced, behind butter-smooth vocals and timeless melodies," said a reviewer on [[NPR]], which named the album as one of the year's top 10 folk and Americana albums.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; In November 2013, ''Seinn'' won a Canadian Folk Music Award for traditional album of the year and a Music Nova Scotia award for traditional/roots recording of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkawards.ca/2013/11/canadian-folk-music-awards-winners-announced-jaron-freeman-fox-the-opposite-of-everything-and-the-good-lovelies-lead-the-winners/|title=Canadian Folk Music Awards winners announced|date=November 10, 2013|work=Canadian Folk Music Awards|location=Ottawa, Ontario|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112053805/http://folkawards.ca/2013/11/canadian-folk-music-awards-winners-announced-jaron-freeman-fox-the-opposite-of-everything-and-the-good-lovelies-lead-the-winners/|archivedate=November 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnovascotia.ca/content/music-nova-scotia-music-industry-award-winners-2013|title=Music Nova Scotia Music &amp; Industry Award Winners 2013|author=Lisa Stitt|date=November 10, 2013|work=Music Nova Scotia|location=Halifax Nova Scotia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
In September 2017, Lamond announced a new collaborative project, ''Patchwork'', "a project dedicated to the presentation of traditional song in a contemporary context."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maryjanelamond.com|title=Mary Jane Lamond|website=www.maryjanelamond.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patchwork consists of Lamond and her first cousin, Laurel MacDonald, who perform Gaelic and English language songs. They perform a show entitled "She Sings as She Flies: Revisiting the Helen Creighton Song Collection," and will be joined by Nicole LeBlanc, Kirsten Olivia, and Naomi Dawn Poulette singing songs from the Acadian, African Nova Scotian, and Mi'kmaq communities, respectively.

[[File:ba b757-200 g-bpei closeup arp.jpg|thumb|right|A [[British Airways]] [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] lands. The port wing tip carries a red navigation light.]]
[[File:Dubbel lanterna i fören.jpg|thumb|Combined green and red navigation light at the bow of a sailboat]]
A '''navigation light''', also known as a running or position light, is a source of illumination on a [[Ship|vessel]], [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft]].  Navigation lights give information on a craft's position, [[Direction (geometry)|heading]], and status.  Their placement is mandated by [[international convention]]s or civil authorities.  Navigation lights are not intended to provide illumination for the craft making the passage, only for other craft to be aware of it.

==Marine navigation lights==
In 1838 the [[United States]] passed an act requiring steamboats running between sunset and sunrise to carry one or more signal lights; color, visibility and location were not specified.
In 1848 the [[United Kingdom]] passed regulations that required steam vessels to display red and green sidelights as well as a white masthead light. In 1849 the U.S. Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels.
In 1889 the United States convened the first International Maritime Conference to consider regulations for preventing collisions. The resulting Washington Conference Rules were adopted by the U.S in 1890 and became effective internationally in 1897. Within these rules was the requirement for steamships to carry a second mast head light.
The international 1948 Safety of Life at Sea Conference recommended a mandatory second masthead light solely for power driven vessels over 150 feet in length and a fixed sternlight for almost all vessels. The regulations have changed little since then.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Nautical Rules of the Road'' Llana and Wisneskey&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] established in 1972 stipulates [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea#Part C - Lights and shapes|the requirements for the navigation lights required on a vessel]].

===Basic lighting===
[[File:Propmec50.PNG|right|thumb|300px|Basic lighting configuration. 2=a vessel facing directly towards observer; 4=vessel facing away from the observer.]]
To avoid [[collision]]s, vessels mount navigation lights that permit other vessels to determine the type and relative angle of a vessel, and thus decide if there is a danger of collision. In general sailing vessels are required to carry a '''green''' light that shines from dead ahead to 2 [[Points of the compass|points]] ({{frac|22|1|2}}°) abaft&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[wiktionary:abaft|abaft]]: to the rear/closer to stern/'aft'&lt;/ref&gt; the beam on the [[starboard]] side (the right side from the perspective of someone on board facing forward), a '''red''' light from dead ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side (left side) and a '''white''' light that shines from astern to two points abaft the beam on both sides. Power driven vessels, in addition  to these lights, must carry either one or two (depending on length) white masthead lights that shine from ahead to two points abaft the beam on both sides. If two masthead lights are carried then the aft one must be higher than the forward one.&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea#Part C - Lights and shapes|International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea, Part C, Lights and Shapes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hovercraft at all times and some boats operating in crowded areas may also carry a yellow flashing beacon for added visibility during day or night.

===Lights of special significance===

In addition to red, white and green running lights, a combination of red, white and green Mast Lights placed on a mast higher than all the running lights, and viewable from all directions, may be used to indicate the type of craft or the service it is performing. See "Quick Guide" in external links.

*Ships at anchor display one or two white anchor lights (depending on the vessel's length) that can be seen from all directions. If two lights are shown then the forward light is higher than the aft one.
*Boats classed as "small" are not compelled to carry navigation lights and may make use of a handheld torch.

==Aviation navigation lights==

Aircraft external lights are any [[light]] fitted to the exterior of an [[aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22569|title=AC 20-30B - Aircraft Position Light and Anticollision Light Installations – Document Information|author=|date=|website=www.faa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually used to increase [[visibility]] to others, and to signal actions such as entering an active runway or starting up an engine. Historically, [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulbs]] have been used to provide light, however recently [[Light-emitting diodes]] have been used.

Aircraft navigation lights are placed in a way similar to that of marine vessels, with a red navigation light located on the left wingtip leading edge and a green light on the right wingtip leading edge. A white navigation light is as far aft as possible on the tail or each wing tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-collision lights are flashing lights on the top and bottom of the [[fuselage]], wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as running engines or entering active runways.

In civil aviation, pilots must keep navigation lights on from sunset to sunrise. High-intensity white strobe lights are part of the anti-collision light system, as well as the red rotating beacon.

All aircraft built after 11 March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on for the duration of the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the [[Landing lights|landing lights]] and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing. Landing lights are bright white, forward and downward facing lights on the front of an aircraft. Their purpose is to allow the pilot to see the landing area, and to allow ground crew to see the approaching aircraft.

Civilian commercial airliners also have other non-navigational lights. These include logo lights, which illuminate the company logo on the tail fin. These lights are optional to turn on, though most pilots switch them on at night to increase visibility from other aircraft. Modern airliners also have a wing light. These are positioned on the outer side just in front of the engine cowlings on the [[fuselage]]. These are not required to be on, but in some cases pilots turn these lights on for engine checks and also while passengers board the aircraft for better visibility of the ground near the aircraft.

==Spacecraft navigation lights==
[[File:ISS-45 Cygnus 5 approaching the ISS - crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cygnus 5 approaching International Space Station.  Navigation lights can be observed towards the rear of the spacecraft. A yellow light on bottom of vessel is not visible.]]
[[File:Dragon approaches the ISS (32238998824).jpg|thumb|left|Red and green navigation lights on [[SpaceX Dragon]]]]
In 2011, [[ORBITEC]] developed the first [[Light-emitting diode|Light-emitting diode (LED)]] lighting system for use around spacecraft.  Currently, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus spacecraft]], which are unmanned transport vessels designed for cargo transport to the [[International Space Station]], utilize a navigational lighting system consisting of five flashing high power LED lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitec.com/documents/cygnus.html|title=ORBITEC Delivers First-Ever LED Lighting System for Orbital Science's Cygnus Module Spacecraft Navigation Lighting|accessdate=2013-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820002758/http://www.orbitec.com/documents/cygnus.html|archivedate=2013-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cygnus displays a flashing red light on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side of the vessel, a flashing green on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the vessel, two flashing white lights on the top and one flashing yellow on the bottom side of the [[fuselage]].

The [[SpaceX Dragon]] cargo spacecraft also features a flashing strobe along with red and green lights.

'''Old Georgian''' ({{lang-ka|ძველი ქართული ენა}} ''dzveli kartuli ena'', Old Georgian: ႤႬႠჂ ႵႠႰႧႳႪႨ, ''enay kartuli'') the [[literary language]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n monarchies in the 5th century. The language remains in use as the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. Spoken Old Georgian gave way to what is classified as [[Middle Georgian]] in the 11th century, which in turn developed into the modern [[Georgian language]] in the 18th century.

==Periodization==
Two periods are distinguished within Old Georgian: Early Old Georgian (5th to 8th centuries) and Classical Old Georgian (9th to 11th centuries). Two different dialects are represented in Early Old Georgian, known as Khanmet’i (ხანმეტი, 5th to 7th c.) and Haemet’i (ჱაემეტი, 7th and 8th c.). They are so named after the presence of a second person subject prefix and a third person object prefix ''kh-'' or ''h-'' in the verbal morphology where Classical Old Georgian has ''h-'', ''s-'' or zero.&lt;ref&gt;Tuite (2008:146).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
The corpus of Early Old Georgian texts is limited in size, consisting of a dozen inscriptions and eight manuscripts containing religious texts. The literature in Classical Old Georgian has a wider scope, including philosophical and historiographical works.

==Phoneme inventory==
Old Georgian had 29 phonemic consonants and 5 phonemic vowels. The native spelling also distinguishes the semivowel ''y'', which is an allophone of the vowel ''i'' in postvocalic position.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

This system leaves aspiration unmarked, and marks glottalization with an apostrophe. International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents are included in square brackets when different.

==Script==
{{Main|Georgian scripts}}
Old Georgian was written in its own alphabetic script, known as Asomtavruli "capital letters" or Mrglovani "rounded". The alphabet is very nearly phonemic, showing an excellent "fit" between phonemes and graphemes. It is clearly modelled on the Greek alphabet, showing basically the same alphabetic order, and with letters representing non-Greek phonemes gathered at the end. Apart from letters for nearly all Georgian phonemes, the alphabet also contains three letters representing Greek phonemes not found in Georgian (''ē'', ''ü'' and ''ō''). Most individual letters seem to be entirely independent designs, with only a few based directly on their Greek counterparts (cf. Greek '''Φ Θ Χ''' [pʰ tʰ kʰ], Asomtavruli '''Ⴔ Ⴇ Ⴕ''').

==Orthography==
Old Georgian orthography is quite consistent, in the sense that the same word is usually witten in the same way in all instances. Spelling is nearly phonemic, with almost all phonemes exclusively represented by a single letter. The exceptions are described below.&lt;ref&gt;This section is mainly based on Schanidse (1982:18-33).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Vowel ''u''
The most conspicuous exception to the rule that each phoneme is written with its own letter is the vowel ''u'', which is consistently written with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] '''ႭჃ''' 〈oü〉, for example '''ႮႭჃႰႨ''' 〈p’oüri〉 ''p’uri'' "bread". This usage was evidently adopted from Greek spelling, which writes ''u'' as '''ου'''. In the later Nuskhuri script, the original digraph '''ⴍⴣ''' 〈oü〉 merged into a single letter '''ⴓ''' 〈u〉 (modern Mkhedruli script '''უ'''). A matching Asomtavruli single-letter counterpart '''Ⴓ''' was then divised; this letter was not part of the original alphabet, and was not used in the Old Georgian period.

; Semivowel ''w''
The semivowel ''w'' is written in two ways, depending on its position within the word. When it occurs directly after a consonant, it is written with the digraph '''ႭჃ''' 〈oü〉, for example '''ႹႭჃႤႬ''' 〈choüen〉 ''chwen'' "we", '''ႢႭჃႰႨႲႨ''' 〈goürit’i〉 ''gwrit’i'' "turtledove". The digraph '''ႭჃ''' 〈oü〉 thus represents both ''w'' and ''u'', without differentiation in the spelling, for example '''ႵႭჃႧႨ''' 〈khoüti〉 ''khuti'' "five" vs. '''ႤႵႭჃႱႨ''' 〈ekoüsi〉 ''ekwsi'' "six".

In all other positions, ''w'' is written with the letter '''Ⴅ''' 〈v〉, for example '''ႧႭႥႪႨ''' 〈tovli〉 ''towli'' "snow", '''ႥႤႪႨ''' 〈veli〉 ''weli'' "field", '''ႩႠႰႠႥႨ''' 〈k’aravi〉 ''k’arawi'' "tent".

The two spellings of ''w'' clearly represent an allophonic variation like the one described for modern Georgian,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson (1997:930).&lt;/ref&gt; between [w] in postconsonantal position and [ʋ] or [β] in other positions. In modern Georgian spelling (as standardized in 1879), both [w] and [ʋ/β] are consistently written with '''ვ''' 〈v〉, and spellings with '''Ⴅ''' 〈v〉 instead of the expected '''ჃႭ''' 〈oü〉 are already found in Old Georgian.&lt;ref&gt;Schanidse (1982:26) lists a number of words which are written with '''Ⴅ''' 〈v〉 instead of the expected '''ႭჃ''' 〈oü〉. This seems to be an orthographical convention, as in all cited examples ''w'' is followed by a vowel and ''l'' ('''ႠႣႥႨႪႨ''' 〈advili〉 ''adwili'' "easy", '''ႷႥႤႪႨ''' 〈q’veli〉 ''q’weli'' "cheese", etc.), with just one exception ('''ႰႥႠ''' 〈rva〉 ''rwa'' "eight"). Romanized transcriptions of Old georgian conventionally reflect the different spellings of ''w'', for example ''chwen'', ''gwrit’i'', ''tovli'', ''veli''.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Semivowel ''y''
The initial vowel ''i-'' of a case suffix is realized as ''y-'' after a vowel, and this allophonic ''y'' has its own letter in the alphabet, for example '''ႣႤႣႠჂ ႨႤႱႭჃჂႱႠ''' 〈deday iesoüysa〉 ''deda-y iesu-ysa'' , phonemically /deda-i iesu-isa/ (mother-NOM Jesus-GEN) "the mother of Jesus".

;The "Greek" letters
The Asomtavruli alphabet contains three letters which are not needed for the writing of native words: '''Ⴡ''' 〈ē〉, '''Ⴣ''' 〈ü〉 and '''Ⴥ''' 〈ō〉. These were added to the alphabet in order to make possible a letter-for-letter transliteration of Greek names and loanwords. They were indeed occasionally used to write the Greek vowels ''ē'' (ēta), ''ü'' (ypsilon) and ''ō'' (ōmega). As these vowels are alien to Georgian, they were replaced in actual pronunciation by ''ey'', ''wi'' and ''ow'' respectively, as can be deduced from old variant spellings, and from corresponding modern forms. For example, Greek '''Αἴγυπτος''' is written '''ႤႢჃႮႲႤ''' 〈egüp’t’e〉 ''egwip’t’e'' "Egypt" (cf. modern Georgian '''ეგვიპტე''' ''egvip’t’e'').

In native words, the letter '''Ⴥ''' 〈ō〉 was mainly used to write the vocative particle, for example '''Ⴥ ႣႤႣႨႩႠႺႭ''' 〈ō dedik’atso〉 ''o dedik’atso'' "o woman!"

The letters '''Ⴡ''' 〈ē〉 and '''Ⴣ''' 〈ü〉 on the other hand were frequently used in the spelling of native words, as a short-hand way of representing the sequences ''ey'' and ''wi'', for example '''ႫႤႴჁ''' 〈mepē〉 ''mepey'' "king", '''ႶჃႬႭჂ''' 〈ghünoy〉 ''ghwinoy'' "wine". Spelling can thus vary within a paradigm, for example '''ႱႨႲႷႭჃႠჂ''' 〈sit’q’oüay〉 ''sit’q’wa-y'' "word" (nominative case) vs. '''ႱႨႲႷჃႱႠ''' 〈sit’q’üsa〉 ''sit’q’w-isa'' (genitive).&lt;ref&gt;Schanidse (1982:41).&lt;/ref&gt; The sequences ''ey'' and ''wi'' could also be written out in full however, for example '''ႫႤႴႤჂ''' 〈mepey〉 ''mepey'', '''ႶႭჃႨႬႭჂ''' 〈ghoüinoy〉 ''ghwinoy'' "wine" (also '''ႶჃႨႬႭჂ''' 〈ghüinoy〉, a mixed spelling).

'''Patagonian Welsh''' ({{lang-cy|Cymraeg y Wladfa}}) is the name given to the [[Welsh language]] as spoken in {{lang|cy|[[Y Wladfa]]|italic=no}}, the Welsh settlement in [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]], specifically in the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29611380 |title=Viewpoint: The Argentines who speak Welsh |date=16 October 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2014 |work=[[BBC News Online|BBC News Magazine]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016004955/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29611380 |archive-date=2014-10-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34591803 |title=BBC National Orchestra of Wales first for Patagonia |date=22 October 2015 |accessdate=18 May 2018 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025154945/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-34591803 |archive-date=2018-10-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers are sent to teach the language and to train local tutors in the Welsh language, and there is some prestige of knowing the language, even among those who are not of Welsh descent.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xd52f |title=Patagonia with Huw Edwards |date=29 August 2016 |website=[[BBC One]] |author=Huw Edwards |authorlink=Huw Edwards (journalist) |accessdate=15 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015064930/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xd52f |archive-date=2016-10-15 |dead-url=no |df= }} Television program by Huw Edwards on Patagonia and its Welsh community and culture.&lt;/ref&gt;The Welsh education and projects are mainly funded by the [[Welsh Government]], [[British Council]], [[Cardiff University]] and the Welsh–Argentine Association. In 2005 there were 62 Welsh classes in the area and Welsh was taught as a subject in two primary schools and two colleges in the region of [[Gaiman, Chubut|Gaiman]]. There is also a bilingual Welsh–Spanish language school called {{lang|cy|[[Ysgol yr Hendre]]|italic=no}} situated in {{lang|cy|[[Trelew]]|italic=no}} and a college located in [[Esquel, Argentina|Esquel]]. {{As of|2016}}, there are three bilingual Welsh–Spanish schools in Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cymraeg.llyw.cymru/news/index/ysgol-patagonia?lang=en |title=A new bilingual Welsh and Spanish schools for Patagonia |publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |date=16 March 2016 |access-date=2016-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323135119/http://cymraeg.llyw.cymru/news/index/ysgol-patagonia?lang=en |archive-date=2016-03-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patagonian Welsh has developed to be a distinct dialect of Welsh, different from the several dialects used in Wales itself;{{How|date=May 2014}} however speakers from Wales and Patagonia are able to communicate readily.&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; Toponyms throughout the [[Chubut Valley]] are of Welsh origin.

A total of 1,220 people undertook Welsh courses in Patagonia in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wales.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/welsh_language_project_report_2015.pdf |title=Welsh Language Project Annual Report 2015 |publisher=[[British Council]] |format=PDF |access-date=2016-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918033240/https://wales.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/welsh_language_project_report_2015.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal [[Eisteddfod]] poetry competitions have been revived&lt;ref&gt;news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1622457.stm
&lt;/ref&gt;, although they are now bilingual in Welsh and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;www.eisteddfodpatagonia.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Welsh people first arrived in Patagonia in 1865. They had migrated to protect their native Welsh culture and language, which they considered to be threatened in their native [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml |title=The Welsh language in 19th century education |publisher=[[BBC Wales]] |accessdate=7 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428073446/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml |archive-date=2014-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofWales/The-History-of-Patagonia |title=The History of Welsh Patagonia |website=www.historic-uk.com |accessdate=7 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108035447/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofWales/The-History-of-Patagonia/ |archive-date=2017-11-08 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the use of the language started to decrease and there was relatively little contact between Wales and the Chubut Valley. The situation began to change&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; when many Welsh people visited the region in 1965 to celebrate the colony's centenary; since then the number of Welsh visitors increased.

In 1945 and 1946 the [[BBC World Service]] broadcast radio shows in Patagonian Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/audio.shtml |title=75 Years |publisher=[[BBC World Service]] |access-date=2015-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311151526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/audio.shtml |archive-date=2015-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1982 repatriation of Argentine troops from the [[Falklands war]], British Merchant Navy seamen and [[Welsh Guards|Welsh Guardsmen]] met a Welsh-speaking Argentine soldier.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Allen, J.  ''They couldn't have done it without us'' 2011 Seafarer Books p.168  {{ISBN|9781906266233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detained troops were disembarked at Puerto Madryn.

In 2004 the Welsh speakers in Argentina asked permission from the Welsh government to access Welsh TV programmes to encourage the learning of the language and for the language to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clanjames.com/patagonian_welsh.htm |title=Patagonian welsh |website=clanjames.com |access-date=2011-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320094446/http://www.clanjames.com/patagonian_welsh.htm |archive-date=2012-03-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14349">'''Persian''' belongs to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]], and many words in modern Persian usage ultimately originate from Proto-Indo-European.  The language makes extensive use of word building techniques such as [[affix]]ation and [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] to derive new words from roots. Persian has also had considerable contact with other languages, resulting in many borrowings.

==Native word formation==
Persian is very powerful in word building and versatile in ways a word can be built from combining affixes, stems, nouns and adjectives. Having many affixes to form new words (over a hundred), and the ability to build [[affix]]es and specially [[prefix]]es from nouns,&lt;ref&gt;Such as سگ (dog) in سگ‌مست (stoned, drunk) as well as خر (donkey) in خرمست and سیاه (black) in سیاه‌مست with the same meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian language is also claimed to be&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://js.mshdiau.ac.ir/jpl/index.php?option=com_tfjornal&amp;task=downloadarchive&amp;Itemid=0&amp;id=e0a8567c3334f42da5d9b50babcd633059129c2c3f71fbe12ab61eed46c2f1296b2&amp;doc=pdf |title=Index archive |publisher=Mashad |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2008/06/080602_an-bateni-article.shtml |title=فرهنگ و هنر ; فارسی زبانی عقیم، مقاله ای از دکتر باطنی |publisher=BBC |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lingoistica.com/articles/57/%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%9F  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219124642/http://www.lingoistica.com/articles/57/%D8%B2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B2%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%9F |date=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://195.178.225.22/CSmsl/msl/Kshanovski.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728150528/http://195.178.225.22/CSmsl/msl/Kshanovski.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 July 2013 |title=The Synchronic Data for the History of Azerbaijanian – Persian Language  Contacts |publisher=CS |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sid.ir/fa/VEWSSID/J_pdf/34813894404.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/news-8213.aspx |title=همشهری آنلاین: اهمیت زبان فارسی در عصر دهکده جهانی |publisher=Hamshahrionline.ir |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322223216/http://hamshahrionline.ir/news-8213.aspx |archive-date=2012-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Behnegarsoft.com |url=http://www.ibna.ir/vdcayyn6e49nw61.k5k4.html |title=خبرگزاری کتاب ايران (IBNA) – زبان فارسي زباني اشتقاقي است |publisher=Ibna.ir |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.hammihan.com/thread15609.html |title=Ř˛Ř¨Ř§Ů† Ů Ř§ŘąŘłŰŒ ŮƒŘ§Ů...Ů"Ř§ ŮžŰŒŮˆŮ†ŘŻŰŒ Ůˆ ŘŞŘąŮƒŰŒ 30% ŮžŰŒŮˆŮ†ŘŻŰŒ(Ř§Ů"ŘŞŘľŘ§Ů‚ŰŒ) Ř§ŘłŘŞ! |publisher=Forum.hammihan.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hessaby1"&gt;http://www.hessaby.com/tavanaye_zaban.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fareiran1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fareiran.com/?content=DetailsArticle&amp;id=381 |title=توانمندی زبان فارسی در برابر زبان تازی ( عربی ) |publisher=Fareiran.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iskv.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=1 |title=Deutsch-Iranischer Sozial &amp; Kultur Verein e.V |publisher=Iskv.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[agglutinative language]] since it also frequently uses derivational [[agglutination]] to [[word formation|form new words]] from nouns, adjectives, and verbal stems.

==External influences==
There are also a considerable amount of [[loanword]]s in the Persian language, mostly coming from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]], and the [[Turkic languages]]. Recently some [[English language|English]] loanwords has entered the language too. 

Persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages, especially [[Arabic language|Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/faresiyat |title=FĀRESĪYĀT – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenian language|Armenian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv. Iranian influences in Armenian Language|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgian language|Georgian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-v-|title=GEORGIA v. LINGUISTIC CONTACTS WITH IRANIAN LANGUAGES|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Iranian languages]] and [[Turkic languages]]. Many Persian words have also found their way into the English language.

===Arabic influence===
The [[Arab conquest of Iran]] lasted for two centuries, from the 7th to the 9th CE. [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] gradually replaced [[Middle Persian]] as a official language and Arabic became the language of the Persian intellectuals during [[Golden Age of Islam]]. During this period, many Arabic words were imported into the Persian language, and a number of Persian words found their way into Arabic. Persian words of Arabic origin especially include Islamic terms. Arabic has had an extensive influence on the Persian lexicon, but it has not greatly affected the structure of the language. Although a considerable portion of the lexicon is derived from Arabic roots, including some of the Arabic plural patterns, the morphological process used to obtain these lexical elements has not been imported into Persian and is not productive in the language. 


These Arabic words have been imported and lexicalized in Persian. So, for instance, the Arabic plural form for ''ketāb'' (كتاب) ["book"] is ''kutub'' (كتب) obtained by the root derivation system. In Persian, the plural for the lexical word ''ketâb'' is obtained by simply adding the Persian plural [[morpheme]] ''hā'': ''ketāb+hā'' → ''ketābhā'' (كتاب‌ها). Also, any new Persian words can only be pluralized by the addition of this plural morpheme since the Arabic root system is not a productive process in Persian. In addition, since the plurals formed by the Arabic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] system constitute only a small portion of the Persian vocabulary (about 5% in the [[Shiraz corpus]]), it is not necessary to include them in the morphology; they are instead listed in the dictionary as irregular forms.

In fact, among Iranians there have been sporadic [[Linguistic purism|efforts]] as far back as the [[Safavid Empire]] to revive Persian and diminish the use of Arabic loanwords in their language. Both [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi Shahs]] supported such efforts in the 20th century by creating the [[academy of Persian Language and Literature]]. In 1934, Reza Shah ordered to rebuild [[Tomb of Ferdowsi|tomb]] of [[Ferdowsi]], who is regarded as the savior of Persian language, and set up a ceremony in [[Mashhad]], celebrating a thousand years of [[Persian literature]] since the time of Ferdowsi, titled ''[[Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration]]'' ({{lang-fa|جشن هزاره فردوسی}}). 

Academy of Persian language and literature after the Iranian revolution continued its striving to protect the integrity of the Persian language. However, the attention of the academy has been turned towards the persistent infiltration of Persian, like many other languages, with English words, as a result of the globalization process. Since the 1980s, the academy constantly campaigns for the use of the Persian equivalents of these new English loanwords. It also has the task of linguistically deriving such words from existing Persian roots if no such equivalents exist, and actively promoting the adoption of these new coinages instead of their English equivalents in the daily lives of the [[Persian-speaking people]] in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].

===Turkic influence===
Less noticeable, but also considerable are the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] forms (including Mongolian borrowings) that have entered the Persian language.&lt;ref&gt;Doerfer: G. Doerfer, ''Türkische und mongolische Elemente im Neupersischen''. Vols. I-IV. Wiesbaden 1963–1975&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, the Persian-speaking realm, including the Iranian plateau, was ruled by a succession of dynasties of Turkic origin, notably [[Ghaznavid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]], [[Sultanate of Rum|the Sultanate of Rum]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]], [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] which have patronized Persian culture and literature. Even the Mongol [[Il-Khanate]] brought more Turkic speakers, who constituted the backbone of the Mongol armies, to the Iranian plateau. With the exception of certain official designations within the government, trade and military, many of the Turkic borrowings in Persian have a more informal, homely flavour,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Perry, "Persian in the Safavid Period", ''Pembroke Papers'' 1996 (4), pp. 269–283.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, to many Persian native speakers these words do not feel like foreign: e.g. ''āqā'' 'mister', ''dowqolu'' 'twin', ''komak'' 'help', ''toman'' 'official currency of Iran' (but ''riāl'' &lt; Portuguese), ''yābu'' 'pack nag', ''qeshlāq'' 'village; summer quarters', ''jelow'' 'front; bridle', ''qeychi'' 'scissors'.

===French and other European influences===
Over the past couple of centuries, Persian has borrowed many loanwords from European languages (mainly French). A lot of these loanwords were originally [[French language|French]] and use French pronunciation, also other common words mainly come from English, Italian, German, and Russian (example: samovar) as well.
The table below shows some examples of common French/Persian words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="197180">Most of the '''Portuguese vocabulary''' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]], because [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is a [[Romance language]]. However, other languages that [[language contact|came into contact]] with it have also left their mark. In the thirteenth century,  the lexicon of Portuguese had about 80% words of Latin origin and 20% of pre-Roman [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Arabic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filologia.org.br/viisenefil/02.htm|title=ASPECTOS DA CONSTITUIÇÃO DO LÉXICO PORTUGUÊS|work=filologia.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Roman languages of Portugal (Iberian, Proto-Celtic, Celtic, Basque)==

Traces of the languages of the native peoples of western Iberia ([[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] or [[Conii]]) persist in the language, as shown below. 
Most of the pre-Roman placenames or rivers in Portugal originate from the [[Hispano-Celtic]] [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] languages. There are also a few Lusitanian, Iberian, Basque and Tartessian components in Portuguese.

== List of Portuguese words of Iberian and Basque origin==

===[[Iberian language|Iberian]]===

*''arroio'' "brook, stream"
*''baía'' "bay" (cf. Basque ibai 'river')
*''balsa'' "ferry"
*''barranco'' "ravine"
*''barranceira'' "steep climb or cliff" (normally above water)
* ''barro''  "mud; clay"
*''bizarro'' "quaint, bizarre"

*''cabaça'' "kalabash, gourd"
*''cachorro'' "puppy"
*''carapaça'' "shell, armour"

Projections on Iberian vocabulary, toponyms and derivations in Portuguese, indicate just a few dozen words in total.

===[[Basque language|Basque]]===

A claim of Basque influence in Portuguese is the [[voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant]] [{{IPAlink|s̺}}], a sound transitional between [[Laminal consonant|laminodental]] [{{IPAlink|s}}] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] [{{IPAlink|ʃ}}]; this sound also influenced other [[Ibero-Romance languages]] such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. The apico-alveolar retracted sibilant is a result of [[bilingualism]] of speakers of Basque and [[Vulgar Latin]]. Basque influence is prominent in Portuguese language and entered through Spanish, because aside from it is a result of bilingualism of speakers of Basque and Vulgar Latin, many Castilians (native speakers of Spanish) who took part in the [[Reconquista]] and later repopulation [[military campaign|campaigns]] were of [[Basque people|Basque]] lineage. There are a few words, surnames and forenames:

*''carrasco'' "executioner" or "Portuguese oak", from Basque ''karraska'' "thunder, crash of falling tree"{{sfn|BDELC|1967}}
*''chamorro'' "close-cropped" (cf. Basque ''txamorro'' "grub, subterranean bug or worm" or ''samur'', ''xamur'' "tender, delicate")
*''chaparro'' "dwarf oak" (cf. Basque ''txapar'')
*''esquerdo'' "left" (from Basque ''ezker'' 'left')
*''sarça'' (archaic), "bramble", fr early Basque (Oihenart; 17th century) ''çarzi'' (modern ''sasi'' "bramble", ''sarri'' "bush, thicket") (Trask 1997, 421)
*''sarna'' "scabies" from Medieval Latin (7th century, [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'', 4.8.68), but as ''serna'' attested in [[Theodorus Priscianus]] (Constantinople, 4th century).  {{harvtxt|Trumper|2004}} however, after studying the variants of the word in the Latin medical treatises, proposes a Hispano-Celtic origin; cf. [[Middle Welsh]] ''sarn'' "mess" and ''sarnaf'' "to wreck".{{sfn|Trumper|2004|loc=p. 4, footnote 13}}
*''veiga'' "meadow, grassland", from Basque *baika, ''(i)bai'' "river" + relational suffix ''-ko''

==Celtic==

Although there is not a comprehensive study or wordcount on how much [[Celtic language|Celtic]] ([[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]] or [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]]) survived in Portuguese (and [[Galician language|Galician]]), it is fair to say that after Latin, this ancient language or fragments of several languages; is the second largest component in the Portuguese language. Projections on Celtic vocabulary (excluding more modern French and other loanwords), toponyms and derivations in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], indicate well over 1,500 words. The Celtic component is often overlooked, due to the strong [[Latinisation of names|Latinisation]] of Celtic-derived words in Portuguese.

Placenames: 
 
There are numerous Celtic-derived towns and placenames in Portugal like [[Abrantes]], [[Abrunhosa-a-Velha]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Braga, Portugal|Braga]], [[Bragança, Portugal|Braganza]] (Bragança), [[Bidoeira]], [[Briteiros, Portugal|Briteiros]], [[Menir de Forjães]], [[Menir do Castelo]], [[Cabanas de Viriato]], [[Dólmen da Pedreira]], [[Borba, Portugal|Borba]], [[Bouçã]], [[Bouças]], [[Bouçoães]], [[Brejo]], [[Briteiros]], [[Britelo, Portugal|Britelo]], [[Caminha]], [[Cantanhede, Portugal|Cantanhede]], [[Carvalhos]], [[Carvalhosa]], [[Carvalhal (disambiguation)|Carvalhal]], [[Carvalhais]], [[Carvalha]], [[Carvalheira]], [[Carvalhoa]], [[Cerva]], [[Cervaínhos]], [[Cerval]], [[Cervanha]], [[Cervão]], [[Cervas]], [[Cerveira]], [[Cerveiro]], [[Cervela]], [[Cervelhe]], [[Cervelhos]], [[Cervetelos]], [[Cervicol]], [[Cervinho]] (Latinised 'cervum' from Proto-Celtic *kerbho-&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulgari-istoria-2010.com/Rechnici/Kelt_rechnik.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Casal de Cambra]], [[Coimbra]], [[Coruche]],&lt;ref&gt;http://progael.com/blog/index.php/tag/lingua-celta/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crato, Portugal|Crato]], [[Amieira]], [[Amieiro]], [[Vale do Amieiro]], [[Évora]], [[Gouvães do Douro]], [[Gouveia (disambiguation)|Gouveia]], [[Lagos]], [[Lajeosa do Dão]], [[Lamego]], [[Lapa (Lisbon)|Lapa]], [[Lapa do Lobo]], [[Leiria]], [[Lousã]], [[Luso, Portugal|Luso]], [[Maia, Portugal|Maia]], [[Minho Province|Minho]], [[Nóbrega]], [[St Antão do Tojal]], [[São Julião do Tojal]], [[Setúbal]], [[Sintra]], [[Tojeira]], [[Vale de Cambra]], [[Vargem]], [[Vidoeira]], [[Monte das Vargens]], [[Xabregas]] and many others.

==Germanic languages==
The Germanic influence ([[Suebi]], [[Visigoths]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], [[Vandals]]) in Portuguese is often related to warfare/military topics, but also exists in other vocabulary like animals [[texugo]] (badger), natural world [[orvalho]] (dew), Human qualities like [[franqueza]] (frankness, candour), [[orgulho]] (pride), some verbs like [[ganhar]] (to gain), town and placenames such as [[Aldão]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0807-89672013000200016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alderete]], [[Albergaria-a-Velha]], [[Albergaria-a-Nova]] (from Gothic 'haribergo'), [[Ermesinde]] and [[Esposende]], where ''sinde'' and ''sende'' for instance; are derived from the Germanic "sinths" (military expedition), numerous [[Suebi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenealoxia.org/onomastica/artigos-onomastica/1871-onomastica-sueva La Onomástica Sueva]&lt;/ref&gt; derivations like, [[Freamunde]] (from 'Fredemundus'), [[Vermunde]], [[Amonde]] (Onomondi), [[Samonde]], [[Gimonde]], [[Aldão]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script SciELO – Scientific Electronic Library Online ]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guadramil]], [[Gondomil]], [[Samil, Portugal|Samil]], [[Gosende]], [[Guilhofrei]] (from Geodefredis), [[Esmoriz]], [[Esmeriz]] (toponymics of Hermeric, king of the Suebians), [[Alhariz]] (toponymic of Aliaricus), [[Oriz]], [[Touriz]], [[Roriz (disambiguation)|Roriz]], [[Gondoriz]], [[Gondizalves]], [[Gondar]], [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] (from Gundomarus), [[Gondarém]], [[Gudim]], [[Guimarães]] (from Vimara), [[Torres Vedras]] (from Turres Veteras, 'old tower'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/turris.html DE TURRES VETERAS A TORRES VEDRAS]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sousa (disambiguation)|Sousa]], [[Terras de Sousa]] and [[Terras de Bouro]] (land of the [[Buri people|Buri]]), [[Serra do Bouro]], [[Bouro]], are found mainly in the Minho ([[Braga]]) and Douro ([[Porto]]) regions- these two provinces present the highest concentration of Germanic toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula, as they historically correspond to old the [[Suebic Kingdom]] in the middle-ages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.xenealoxia.org/onomastica/artigos-onomastica/1871-onomastica-sueva&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Germanic words entered the language during the late antiquity, either as words introduced into Vulgar Latin elsewhere, or as words brought along by the [[Suebi]] who settled in Gallaecia (Northern Portugal and Galicia) in the 5th century, and also by the [[Visigoths]] who annexed the Suebic Kingdom in 585 and ruled until the 8th century AD. 
Other words were incorporated to Portuguese during the Middle Ages, mostly proceeding from French and Occitan languages, as both cultures had a massive impact in Portuguese during the 12th and 13th centuries. Some everyday vocabulary, towns and placenames have Frankish-derived etymology, by influence of French in that period. Examples are: 
[[flanco]]- (flank) from Old French flanc, of Germanic origin, probably Frankish *hlanca, from Proto-Germanic *hlankaz (“flexible", "to bend”), from Proto-Indo-European *kleng- (“to bend”). Akin to Old High German hlanca (“loin”), Middle High German lanke (“hip joint”) (German lenken (“to bend, turn, lead”)), Old English hlanc (“loose, slender, flaccid, lank).  
[[Carção]] - a small town in Portugal, from Medieval Portuguese “garçom”, from Old French garçun (“servant”), oblique case of gars, from Frankish *wrakjō (“servant, boy”), from Proto-Germanic *wrakjô (“exile, driven one”), from Proto-Indo-European *wreg- (“to drive”). Cognate with Old High German wrecheo, recko (“exile, warrior, hero”) (Modern German Recke), Old Saxon wrekkio (“a banished person, exile, stranger”), Old English wreċċa (“a wretch, stranger, exile”), and perhaps to Old Norse rekkr (“man, warrior, hero”).

More recently other words with Germanic origin have been incorporated, either directly from English or other Germanic languages, or indirectly through French. Many of these words are shared with [[Galician language|Galician]], sometimes with minor spelling or phonetic differences.

==List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin==
Because they have different Germanic origins, this list is divided into words that come from [[English language|English]], [[Frankish language|Frankish]], [[Lombards|Langobardic]], [[Middle Dutch]], [[Middle High German]], [[Middle Low German]], [[Old English language|Old English]], [[Old High German]], [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], [[Swedish language|Old Swedish]], and [[Gothic language|Visigothic]] and finally, words which come from a [[Germanic (language)|Germanic]] root, where the specific source is unknown or uncertain. Projections indicate over 600 [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words in Portuguese, with a tendency to increase due to [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and other modern influences.
Some of these words existed in [[Latin]] as [[loanword]]s from other [[language]]s.  Some of these words have alternate [[etymology|etymologies]] and may also appear on a list of Galician words from a different [[language]].  Some words contain non-Germanic elements. Any form with an [[asterisk]] (*) is unattested and therefore [[hypothesis|hypothetical]].

==Arabic==

Between the 8th and mid 13th centuries, Portugal was occupied and under the influence of the Islamic [[Emirate of Cordoba]] known as ([[Al-Andalus]]). During that period, although the local populations continued to speak [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]], and further south [[Mozarabic]] dialects; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] being the elite language, lent many new words to Portuguese, thanks to a rich cultural and scientific legacy left in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hispanicmuslims.com/andalusia/andalusia.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the Western world in the [[Middle Ages]].
Words such as 'algebra','algorism (algorithm)', 'alcohol', 'azimuth', 'sugar', 'coffee' and many others were incorporated into Portuguese and are everyday words:

*''Alcova'' (alcove) from ''alkubba'' ( الكبة )
*''Aldeia'' (village) from ''aldaya''  ( الدية )
*''Alface'' (lettuce) from ''alkhass''  ( الخس )
*''Algarismo'' (number, figure) from ''alkarizmi''  ( الكرزم )
*''Algema'' (handcuff) from ''alzhaimar'' (bracelet) (سوار)
*''Almirante'' (admiral) from ''amir'' + ''ar-rahl''  ( امير الرّال )
*''Almofada'' (cushion) from ''almukhadda''  ( المخدّة )
*''Âmbar'' (amber) from ''anbar''  ( انبر )
*''Armazém'' (warehouse; a [[cognate]] of English "[[magazine]]") from ''almahazan''  ( المحزا )
*''Arroz'' (rice) from ''arruz'' (loan from Greek ''óryza'')  ( الروز )
*''Açúcar'' (sugar) from "as-sukkar"  ( السكّر )
*''Azeite'' (olive oil) from ''azzait''  ( الزّيت )
*''Bairro'' (''barri'')
*''Fátima'' (woman's name, and name of a [[Fátima, Portugal|town in Portugal]]) from ''Fāṭimah''  ( فاطمة )
*''Garrafa'' (bottle) from ''garrafā'' ([[cognate]] of English "caraffe")  ( الغرّافة )
*''Girafa'' (giraffe) from ''zurafa''  ( الزرفة )
*''Jasmim'' (jasmine) from ''yasmin'' (loan from Persian ''jasamin'')  ( يسمن )
*''Jarra'' (vase) from ''jarra''  ( الجارة )

Many words from the Islamic period were borrowings from Spanish and Mozarabic dialects from the South. Because Portugal expelled the Moors 300 years earlier than Spain, the Arabic influence in Portuguese was relatively small and left no loanwords in the Portuguese lexicon related to human feelings or emotions. Arabic-derived words are easily identifiable in toponymic names of towns and villages, increasing as you travel south [[Alfama]], [[Alcácer do Sal]], [[Alcoutim]], [[Aljustrel]], [[Algarve]] and in words relating to geography, agriculture, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, chemicals and food. Projections estimate 400 to 800 Arabic-derived words in Portuguese, with a tendency to decrease as many of these words have entered in disuse over time:

In [[printing]], '''Preflight''' is the process of confirming that the digital files required for the printing process are all present, valid, correctly formatted, and of the desired type. The basic idea is to prepare the files to make them feasible for the correct process such as offset printing and eliminate costly errors and facilitate an smooth production. It is an standard prepress procedure in the printing industry (as it is imposition). The term originates from the [[preflight checklist]]s used by pilots. The term was first used in a presentation at the Color Connections conference in 1990 by consultant Chuck Weger, and Professor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer for solutions to preflighting in the 1990s.

==Background==
In a common digital [[prepress]] workflow, a collection of computer files provided by clients will be translated from an application-specific format such as [[Adobe InDesign]] or [[QuarkXPress]] to a format that the [[raster image processor]] (RIP) can interpret. But before this rasterization occurs, workers in the prepress department confirm the incoming materials to make sure they are ready to be sent to the RIP. This is an important step because it prevents production delays caused by missing materials or improperly prepared materials. Once the incoming materials have passed the pre-flight check, they are ready to be put into production and sent to the RIP.

Files were originally printed as [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[PostScript]]; however in modern workflows, PDF files have become the popular file type for submitting data to a RIP. The RIP generates the final [[raster image]] that will be printed directly (as in desktop [[inkjet]] or [[laser printer|laser]] printing), set to photographic [[Photographic film|film]] or [[Photographic paper|paper]] (using an [[imagesetter]]), or transferred [[Computer to plate|direct-to-plate]].

Depending on the hardware and software components and configurations, RIPs can experience problems rasterizing the image data contained in PostScript or PDF files. If there is a failure in rasterizing the image, it can be costly, as output systems (printers, plate-setters, etc.) consume expensive supplies, can require extensive amounts of time to process complex image data, and require skilled labor to operate.

==The preflight process==
The process of preflighting a file helps reduce the likelihood of rasterization problems that cause production delays. Page layout software applications (which allow users to combine images, graphics, and text from a variety of formats) automate portions of the preflight process. Typically, client-provided materials are verified by a preflight operator for completeness and to confirm that the incoming materials meet the production requirements. The pre-flight process checks for:

* transparencies that run on Pantone instead of CMYK
* color corrections wherever required such as rich blacks combinations, color shifts due to overprinting
* trapping requirements for offset printing such as overprints, choke, spreads and knockouts
* images and graphics embedded by the client have been provided and are available to the application
* [[font]]s are accessible to the system
* fonts are not corrupt
* fonts are in a compatible [[file format]]
* image files are of formats that the application can process
* image files are of the correct color format, Pantone or CMYK (some RIPs have problems processing [[RGB]] images, for example)
* image files are of the correct [[Image resolution|resolution]]
* required color profiles are included
* image files are not corrupt
* confirm that the page layout document size, margins, bleeds, marks and page information all fit within the constraints of the output device and match the client specifications
* confirm that the correct [[colour separation]]s or [[Computer to plate|ink plates]] are being output

Other, more advanced preflight steps might also include:
* removing non-printing data, such as non-printing objects, hidden objects, objects outside the printable area and objects on layers below
* flattening transparent objects into a single opaque object
* converting fonts to paths
* gathering embedded image and graphic files to one location accessible to the system
* compressing files into an archive format

The specifics of what checks are made is governed by the features of the preflight application, the formats of the client provided files, and the targeted output device as well as the printing specifications.

A purpose-built software application is not required to preflight a file, although several commercial applications are available. Many desktop publishing applications have some type of preflight capability, however they may not be as robust as commercial applications. Many printers and publishers utilize high-end preflight and file optimization solutions rather than relying on those within desktop publishing apps. They will make sure the preflight settings match their specific production requirements.

==History==
Professor Ron Bertolina was a pioneer of the preflighting concept in electronic publishing. In the mid 1990s, he wrote published technical articles and conducted workshops across the US on preflighting for the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation. His preflight checklist, included in the article "Preflighting Digital Files" for GATFWorld magazine, became a standard for printing companies to follow to help to reduce costly errors and thus was a great benefit to the publishing industry. Eventually, preflighting software entered the marketplace to assist designers and publishers in efficiently publishing electronic files.

Early preflight methods were largely manual, and typically relied on checklists that highly skilled prepress operators would use to verify the production readiness of each incoming job. As desktop publishing and graphics applications, [[Page description language|PDLs]], RIPs, and output devices evolved, the process became more complex. Software [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s and stand-alone applications that supported the major [[desktop publishing]] applications were then developed to meet that need, along with proprietary tools made by hardware manufacturers and commercial printers and service bureaus. The developers of the major applications then began to incorporate functionality in their applications, leveraging their knowledge of their own file formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3451">"Receiving Party Pays" is a payment model set basically in the cellular market, that states that the payment for an incoming call is set on the receiver. That model differs from "Calling Party Pays" in which the caller is the one who pays for the other side receiving it.

The total cost of each call placed by a subscriber of a [[Mobile Network Operator]] (MNO) is split in two parts. The first part is the amount that the caller's provider is charging in order to provide the service to the [[calling party]]. The second part is the mobile [[termination rates]] (MTRs) that the provider of the call-receiver demands to deliver a call. Concerning the MTRs, in North America and some parts of Asia the Receiving party pays (RPP) instead of the [[Calling party pays]] (CPP) principle is applied. In contrast to the CPP principle, in RPP the callee is asked to pay for the termination cost or in some cases to share a part of this cost with the caller. Initially this approach sounds fair, especially in the scope of the callee payment for the call receiving service, while he is mobile and not located in his home network. Furthermore, a subscriber is free to compare termination rates of each MNO and to make his choice before the establishment of a contract with a MNO. Thereby, the mobile termination rates market seems to allow for competition.

However, the question of how a [[called party]] could avoid paying for unwanted calls (e.g., advertisements, tele-sales, or polls) is raised. The answer is that it is the callee's responsibility to distinguish, which call is important and should be accepted and which should be rejected. This is only one of the RPP side effects &lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2010.09.001 | volume=23 | title=Calling party pays or receiving party pays?

The RPP principle may add an extra degree of freedom in the mobile call charges, since the termination rate is not a part of the total cost that the caller has to pay. However, it is also adding a considerably big overhead for consumers such as the provider selection decision, while considering the callee role.&lt;ref name="abacus"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/NetSys.2013.13 | title=Challenging the Monopoly of Mobile Termination Charges with an Auction-Based Charging and User-Centric System (AbaCUS) | year=2013 | journal=2013 Conference on Networked Systems | last1 = Tsiaras | first1 = C. | last2 = Stiller | first2 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southern Bavarian''', or '''Southern Austro-Bavarian''', is a cluster of [[Upper German]] dialects of the [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] group. They are primarily spoken in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] (i.e. the [[Austria]]n federal state of [[Tirol, Austria|Tyrol]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]]), in [[Carinthia]] and in the western parts of [[Upper Styria]]. Due to the geographic isolation of these [[Eastern Alps|Alpine]] regions, many features of the Old Bavarian language from the [[Middle High German]] period have been preserved. On the other hand, the Southern Bavarian dialect area is influenced by [[Carinthian dialect group|Slovene]], [[Italian language|Italian]] Greek and [[Ladin language|Ladin]] minority languages.

The speech area historically included the former linguistic enclaves in [[Carniola]] (present-day [[Slovenia]]) around [[Kočevje]] in the ''[[Gottschee]]'' region ([[Gottscheerish]]), [[Spodnja Sorica|Sorica]] ''(Zarz)'' and [[Nemški Rovt]] ''(Deutsch Ruth)''. The [[Cimbrian language]] still spoken in several language-islands in north-eastern Italy ([[Friuli]], [[Veneto]] and [[Trentino]]) mostly counts as a separate Bavarian language variant. Southern Bavarian is also spoken in the [[Werdenfelser Land]] region around [[Mittenwald]] and [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in German [[Upper Bavaria]].

The [[Tyrolean Unterland]], the Alpine regions of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] ([[Pinzgau]], [[Pongau]] and [[Lungau]]), as well as the adjacent parts of [[Styria]] and southern [[Burgenland]] form the [[dialect continuum]] with the [[Central Bavarian]] language area in the north.

The '''Soyombo''' project, based in the [[Mongolian Republic]], aimed to create a [[Mongolian language]] distribution of [[Linux]] with full support for writing Mongolian both in [[Cyrillic]] and in traditional scripts for Mongolian, including [[Soyombo script]], [[Clear script]], and the classical [[Mongolian script]]. It has been discontinued.

'''Synurbization'''  – adaptation of animal [[wildlife]] to [[urban development]]. Term created by [[Theriology|theriologists]] – [[Ecology|ecologists]]. It denotes an adjustment  animal populations to specific conditions of the urban environment, in  the connection with regular existence there in the wild state. The term is not applied to individual animals which have come to an urban area accidentally and witch live there for limiter time. Synurbization  is related to two other terms used  in the field : [[Synanthrope|synanthropization]] (refers to the adaptation of animal populations to human – created conditions in general )and [[urbanization]] (refers to changes in landscape coursed by urban development).

==The phenomenon==
The phenomenon of synurbization has been described mainly for [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, but it is known also in other animal groups(e.g. [[amphibian]]s).
Examples of synurbization of mammal in European cities are provided by :
*the [[squirrel]] (Sciurus vulgaris)
*the [[rabbit]]
*the [[Striped Field Mouse|striped field mouse]]
*the [[red fox]] (Vulpes vulpes)
*the [[stone marten]] (Martes foina)
*the [[badger]] (Meles meles)
Processes of synurbization  also concern wild populations of birds introduced to cities by man . The best known example is the [[peregrine falcon]] (Falco peregrinus), which has been successfully introduced, in the last two decades, to cities in [[North America]] and in [[Germany]], as well as [[Prague]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Moscow]].

==Changes in the behavior==
Adaptation to urban [[ecological niche]]s requires changes in the behavior and ecology of synurbic populations, in comparison with non – urban ones. 
Several studies indicate that the most characteristic adjustments of synurbic populations are the following:
*Living at much higher [[population density]], connected with a reduction in the size of individual (pair, family) territories -less pressure from [[enemy|enemies]] in the city and the spatial limitations of suitable sites (green island)surrounded by built up areas.
*Reduced migratory behavior connected with better possibilities for wintering in cities.
*Prolonged [[breeding season]], mainly allowed by a sedentary life and favorable [[microclimate]].
*Greater longevity connected with better winter survival due to favorable food and climatic conditions, and a reduction of [[Animal migration|migration]]s, which are more dangerous and more exhausting than sedentary life.
*Prolonged circadian activity – may be connected with [[artificial light]]ing or the tendency to spend the hours of most intense human activity in shelters.
*Changes in [[nest]]ing habits, including the use of a variety of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] objects as shelters, nesting places and material for nests.
*Changes in feeding behavior  - a city  offers rich resources of anthropogenic food, which  are attractive to many bird and mammal species.
*Tameness toward people  - animals often follow people begging for food, or even sit on people.
*Increased intra – specific [[aggression]] is observed in synurbic populations, a tendency connected with the high density of individual territories and spatial limitations.

==Consequences of urban development==
The main consequence of urban development for wildlife is a decrease in its species and [[ecological diversity]]. The growing tendency towards synurbization observed in birds and mammals  is a chance for enriching diversity of [[urban wildlife]]. Synurbization of some species could cause practical problems when their populations grow to high concentrations. An example of such problems is [[Canada goose]] in North American cities.&lt;ref&gt;Luniak , Maciej ,Synurbization[w]: Warsaw wild life:notes,Warszawa, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamang''' ([[Devanagari]]: तामाङ; ''tāmāng'') is a term used to collectively refer to a [[dialect cluster]] spoken mainly in [[Nepal]], Sikkim, West Bengal (Mainly Darjeeling Districts - पश्चिम बङ्गाल राज्यको दार्जीलिङ जिल्लाको बिभिन्न भूभाग), some parts of Assam and North East Region. It comprises '''Eastern Tamang''', '''Northwestern Tamang''', '''Southwestern Tamang''', '''Eastern Gorkha Tamang''', and '''Western Tamang'''. [[Lexical similarity]] between Eastern Tamang (which is regarded as the most prominent) and other Tamang languages varies between 81% to 63%. For comparison, lexical similarity between [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], is estimated at 89%.&lt;ref name=ethes&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/spa Ethnologue report for Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt; Tamang likely split from the Tibetan languages some time before the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeisler|first=Bettina|year=2009|editor-last=Aboh|editor-first=Enoch|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Norval|title=Reducing phonological complexity and grammatical opaqueness: Old Tibetan as a lingua franca and the development of the modern Tibetan dialects.|url=|journal=Complex processes in new languages|publisher=|volume=|pages=75-95|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Resistance to Theory"''' is an essay by [[Paul de Man]] (1919–83), a renowned [[literary critic]] and theorist belonging to the [[Yale School]] of [[Deconstruction]], which appeared in ''[[Yale French Studies]]'' 63 (1982) and was widely anthologized. The essay later became part of the book by the same name. The essay remains a key statement in [[poststructuralist]] approaches to literary studies.

==Committee on the Research Activities==
Paul de Man says that the essay was written at the request of the Committee on the Research Activities of the [[Modern Language Association]] as a contribution to a collective volume entitled ''Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures''. However, the essay was not accepted as it argued that "the main theoretical interest of literary theory consists in the impossibility of its definition."

==Content==
But keeping in view with the proposal the essay discusses the rise of literary theory in America in the twentieth century and the challenges it faces. He points out that, "literary theory can be said to come into being when the approach to literary texts is no longer based on non-linguistic, that is to say historical and  aesthetic considerations." This introduction of linguistic and semiotic terminology into literary studies, according to de Man, gives the language, "considerable freedom from referential restraint" and makes it "epistemologically highly suspect and volatile." Drawing on the ideas of [[Saussure]] and [[Nietzsche]], de Man points out that the rhetorical and tropological dimension of language makes it an unreliable medium for communication of truths. Literary language is predominantly rhetorical and figurative. Therefore, to take for granted that literature is a reliable source of information about anything but itself would be a great mistake.

==Crisis mentioned==
This gives rise to a particular crisis in literary studies because "literariness" is no longer seen as an aesthetic quality nor a mimetic mode. Aesthetic effect, according to de Man, takes place because we tend to mistake the materiality of the signifier with the materiality of the signified by considering language as an intuitive and transparent medium, as opposed to the material and conventional medium that it is. Mimesis, like aesthetic quality, is also an effect of the rhetorical and figurative aspects of language. The assumption of ideological and historical contexts or backgrounds to literary texts becomes problematic if language is no longer seen as a transparent and intuitive guide from the textual material to the historical situation. Consequently, the theorists who uphold an aesthetic approach to literary studies and those who uphold an historical approach both find theory inconvenient and challenging. They are the polemical opponents of theory. 

==Author explanation==
As theory is as much a linguistic construct as literature, it falls prey to the same problematics of literary language. De Man states that the resistance to theory may be "a built-in constituent of its discourse." The real debate of literary theory is henceforth "not with its polemical opponents but rather with its own methodological assumptions and possibilities." (p.&amp;nbsp;358) This is because "the resistance to theory is a resistance to the use of language about language." The resistance to theory is therefore, according to de Man, a resistance to reading: "Nothing can overcome the resistance to theory since theory 'is' itself this resistance."

De Man concludes however by stating that "literary theory is not in danger of going under; it cannot help but flourish, and the more it is resisted, the more it flourishes, since the language it speaks is the language of self resistance." (p.&amp;nbsp;365)
