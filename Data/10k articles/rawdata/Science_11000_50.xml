'''''Akkermansia''''' is a genus in the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]] ([[Bacteria]]).&lt;ref name="classificationac"/&gt; The genus was first proposed in 2004 by Muriel Derrien and others, with the type species ''[[Akkermansia muciniphila]]'' (gen. nov., sp. nov).&lt;ref name="Derrien2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Akkermansia'' derives from:&lt;br /&gt;[[New Latin]] [[grammatical gender|feminine gender]] noun ''Akkermansia'', named after [[Antoon Akkermans|Antoon DL Akkermans]] (28 October 1940 – 21 August 2006),&lt;ref name="Anton_Akkermanns_IM_SR"&gt;

==Species==
Until 2016 the genus contained a single known species,&lt;ref name=main/&gt; namely ''[[Akkermansia muciniphila|A. muciniphila]]'' ( Derrien ''et al''. 2004,  (Type species of the genus).; [[New Latin]] [[grammatical gender|neuter gender]] noun ''mucinum'', mucin; [[New Latin]] adjective ''philus'' from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''philos (φίλος)'' meaning friend, loving; [[New Latin]] [[grammatical gender|feminine gender]] adjective ''muciniphila'', mucin-loving.)&lt;ref name="sgmjournals1"/&gt;
However, de Vos et. al. isolated a novel species in the feces of a reticulated python, [[Akkermansia glycaniphila]].

==Description of ''Akkermansia'' gen. nov.==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Akkermansia'' (Ak.ker.man'si.a. N.L. fem. n. ''Akkermansia'' derived from Antoon Akkermans, a Dutch microbiologist recognized for his contribution to microbial ecology).  Cells are oval-shaped, non-motile and stain Gram-negative. Strictly anaerobic. Chemo-organotrophic. Mucolytic in pure culture.&lt;ref name="Derrien2004"/&gt;{{rp|1474}}

''Akkermansia muciniphila'', the only currently known species within genus ''Akkermansia'', can reside in the human intestinal tract and is currently being studied for its effects on human metabolism.  Recently performed studies in rodents have indicated that ''Akkermansia muciniphila'' in the intestinal tract may reduce obesity, diabetes, and inflammation. Increases in Akkermansia muciniphila have been associated with multiple sclerosis. https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12015 &lt;ref name="EverardBelzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Everard A, Belzer C, Geurts L, Ouwerkerk JP, Druart C, Bindels LB, Guiot Y, Derrien M, Muccioli GG, Delzenne NM, de Vos WM, Cani PD | title = Cross-talk between Akkermansia muciniphila and intestinal epithelium controls diet-induced obesity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 22 | pages = 9066–71 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23671105 | pmc = 3670398 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1219451110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wageningen University and Research Centre (2013, May 15).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">'''Alan H. Cheetham''' is a paleobiologist and retired senior scientist and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]]. 

Born in El Paso, Texas, January 30, 1928, Cheetham grew up in [[Taos, New Mexico]], received B.S. ([[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]], 1950) and M.S. ([[Louisiana State University]], 1952) degrees in geology, and, under the guidance of [[Norman D. Newell]], obtained his Ph.D. in paleontology from [[Columbia University]] in 1959. Until joining the Smithsonian in 1966, Cheetham was a member of the geology faculty at Louisiana State University; during his tenure there, he was also a visiting postdoctoral fellow at the Natural History Museum in London (1961) and a guest professor at the [[University of Stockholm]], Sweden (1964). He retired from the Smithsonian in 2001 and resides in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].

Much of his research includes testing evolutionary models in the fossil record, particularly the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]]. His research is focused on the systematics and morphometrics of late [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] [[bryozoan]]s found in deposits located in the Caribbean, especially the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Venezuela]], and the Gulf coast of the United States, particularly [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]]. He has also worked extensively on Cenozoic bryozoans in [[England]] and southern [[Scandinavia]] and was a contributor to the Deep Sea Drilling Project on Cenozoic bryozoans recovered from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In April 1997 Cheetham was awarded the Raymond C. Moore Medal for Excellence in Paleontology by the Society for Sedimentary Geology. In November 2001 he received the [[Paleontological Society Medal]]; he was, during the same year, honored with a [[festschrift]] titled ''Evolutionary Patterns'', edited by Jeremy Jackson, Scott Lidgard, and Frank McKinney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Science |date=November 2001 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/294/5544/1008  |volume=294 |issue=5544 |page=1008 |first=Richard |last=Bambach |title=PALEOBIOLOGY: Changes in Life Across Many Temporal Scales.

'''Anna Apostolaki''' ({{lang-el|Άννα Αποστολάκη}}, 1880–1958) was a [[Greece|Greek]] archaeologist and museum curator. She was the first woman to work in the field of archaeology in Greece and served as curator and later the director of the [[Museum of Greek Folk Art|National Museum of Decorative Arts]]. One of the first women to graduate with a doctoral degree, she was also the first woman member of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]] and an early member of the [[Christian Archaeological Society]]. She was an expert in ancient textiles and saw preservation of ancient patterns and Greek weaving traditions as a means to not only validate women's works, but bolster Greek nationalism in the interwar period of Greek history.

==Early life==
Anna Apostolaki was born in 1880{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=159}} in Margarites, in the [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno province]], on the island of [[Crete]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and now of Greece.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} Her father was originally from the area near [[Eleutherna]].{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} Regional uprisings against Ottoman rule caused her family to flee to [[Piraeus]] and then to [[Athens]].{{sfn|Florou|2016}} She completed her primary education in the [[Arsakeio]],{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} and then enrolled in the [[Normal School]] of Athens,{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=159}} one of the few occupations available to women in the 19th century, graduating in 1899.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}

==Career==
Apostolaki began her career as a teacher, tutoring other students while she pursued her own educational aspirations.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} In 1903, she entered the [[University of Athens]] studying in the Philosophical School.{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=159}}{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Simultaneously, she began working at the [[Numismatic Museum of Athens]] as an assistant to [[Ioannis Svoronos]], who mentored her education and helped her develop a dedication to scientific investigation.{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Under Svoronos' guidance, she became the first woman admitted to the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]] in 1906.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}{{sfn|Díaz-Andreu|Sørensen|2005|p=239}} In 1909, she became one of the first ten women to graduate from the University of Athens, and the first woman from Crete to earn a degree.{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Headlines in women's newspapers like the ''Ladies' Gazette'' proclaimed the accomplishment of Apostolaki's completion of her doctorate.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}{{sfn|Díaz-Andreu|Sørensen|2005|p=259}} That same year, she became the first woman to join the Greek Folklore Society, which had been founded by [[Nikolaos Politis]] and began giving lectures on folk culture.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}

Turmoil in the first part of the 20th century and [[World War I]], placed many historic sites in jeopardy. Apostolaki, concerned about their deterioration and preservation, joined the Christian Archaeological Society, as one of its first members. She also became one of the Board Members of the [[Lyceum Club of Greek Women]], founded by [[Kalliroi Parren]]. While still tutoring, she took on additional tasks as an advisor to the Department of National Wardrobe. In this role, she was responsible for disseminating information on the preservation on national customs, which allowed her to develop contacts with people like poet [[Georgios Drossinis]] and archaeologist Georgios Kourouniotis, who were also interested in cultural preservation.{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} Intellectuals like these strove to boost national pride by linking contemporary cultural practices with ancient Greek culture,{{sfn|Florou|2016}} through evaluating and comparing the archaeological record of ancient, medieval and modern artifacts.{{sfn|Díaz-Andreu|Sørensen|2005|p=243}} Apostolaki was particularly interested in increasing the visibility of women's participation in society, and along with [[Angeliki Chatzimichali]], Eleni Euclid, and [[Lucia Zygomala]], among others, worked to collect women's handicrafts and exhibit them.{{sfn|Bounia|2017|pp=152–153}}

Women's clubs in Greece at the time were organized by wealth urbanites who set up regional schools for the poor and refugee populations. A part of these schools were focused on the training of girls in handicrafts. Apostolaki was engaged in these clubs and developed an interest in the various patterns which showed a continuous use of artistic motifs from the [[Byzantine period]] to the present day.{{sfn|Bounia|2017|pp=153–154}} She worked on projects with the Lyceum Club to focus attention on Greek contributions, rather than mirroring trends in fashion, which replaced Greek design with foreign elements.{{sfn|Bounia|2017|p=155}} Collecting woven goods and lace, she helped organize three exhibitions—1921, 1922 and 1924—for the Club.{{sfn|Bounia|2017|p=156}}

After the conclusion of the [[Asia Minor Catastrophe]], Drossinis, a member of the Board for the [[Museum of Greek Folk Art|Museum of Greek Handicrafts]] helped reorganize the museum as the National Museum of Decorative Arts and in 1923 hired Apostolaki as his assistant. Initially she began her work by hand-washing all the fabrics, removing the moths, and cataloguing the textile collection,{{sfn|Florou|2016}} which consisted of woven fabrics from the 4th to the 7th century.{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} She then worked to acquire both contemporary and ancient archaeological artifacts, traveling to remote villages in Crete and other places by mule to collect embroidery samples, as well as costumes.{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Apostolaki helped the Lyceum Club prepare an exhibit of Greek textiles as part of the 1925 meeting of the [[Little Entente of Women]].{{sfn|Bounia|2017|p=157}} In 1926, she was made curator of the museum and arranged a display of [[Clothing in the ancient world#Ancient Minoan clothing|Minoan apparel]] for the cultural festival hosted that same year by the [[Lyceum Club of Greek Women]] at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]].{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Arranging the exhibition for a 1927 demonstration of the Lyceum Club, Apostolaki's invitation to potential exhibitors stressed the importance of Greek themes, but announced that submissions could include beadwork, musical instruments, pottery, wooden artifacts and weavings.{{sfn|Bounia|2017|p=160}}

In 1932, Apostolaki published her catalogue of [[Coptic textiles]], ''Τα κοπτικά υφάσματα του εν Αθήναις Μουσείου Κοσμητικών Τεχνών'' (The Coptic Fabrics of the Athenian Museum of Greek Handicrafts), evaluating the continuity of weaving techniques from ancient to modern looming processes.{{sfn|Florou|2016}}{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} The book was one of the first texts published internationally dealing with weaving and the only one at the time in the Greek language.{{sfn|Ladia|2015}} Her expertise in dying techniques, textile history and weaving led [[Antonis Benakis]], the director of the [[Benaki Museum]] to ask her to evaluate and publish on the Benaki's textile collection.{{sfn|Florou|2016}} Her analysis of the Benaki's collection was published in 1937 in the centenary issue of the "most important archaeological journal" in Greece, ''Archaiologiki Ephimeris''.{{sfn|Díaz-Andreu|Sørensen|2005|p=242}} During [[World War II]], to prevent [[Nazi looting]], the exhibits of the Museum of Greek Handicrafts were hidden in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]. In 1944, her home was raided and her manuscripts were confiscated. All that remained of her work was the three books and eleven articles which had been published,{{sfn|Florou|2016}} which included analysis of [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sassanid Persia]]n folk art.{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=160}} Having gained an international reputation, in 1950, she was induced by [[Thomas Whittemore]], to write an essay, ''Κατοπριζομένη επί Υφάσματος'' (Mirrored in Fabric) for the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] on Coptic textiles.{{sfn|Florou|2016}} She retired from the Museum in 1954,{{sfn|Díaz-Andreu|Sørensen|2005|p=239}} but continued working on texts regarding Cretan embroidery until her death.{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=159}}

==Death and legacy==
Apostolaki died in the summer of 1958 and is remembered as one of the first scientists to evaluate and classify the history of Greek textiles.{{sfn|Hatzidakis|1959|p=159}} In 2015, the Public Library of Rethymno, in conjunction with the Lyceum Club of Greek Women and the Benaki Museum, hosted a workshop on Apostolaki and her works, simultaneously exhibiting some of them. The purpose of the workshop was to increase recognition for Apostolaki and raise funds to publish her manuscript on Cretan embroideries.{{sfn|Ladia|2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7770">'''Attenuated total reflection''' ('''ATR''') is a sampling technique used in conjunction with [[infrared spectroscopy]] which enables samples to be examined directly in the [[solid]] or [[liquid]] state without further preparation.&lt;ref name="PE"&gt;{{cite web | year=2005 | title=FT-IR Spectroscopy—Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) | work=Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences | url=http://las.perkinelmer.com/content/TechnicalInfo/TCH_FTIRATR.pdf | accessdate=2007-01-26 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216065646/http://las.perkinelmer.com/content/TechnicalInfo/TCH_FTIRATR.pdf | archivedate=2007-02-16 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATR_path-en.svg|thumb|Light undergoes multiple internal reflections in the crystal of high refractive index, shown in yellow. The sample is in contact with the crystal.]]
[[File:ATR-Halterung.jpg|thumb|An ATR attachment for infrared spectroscopy. The sample is in the steel containers either side of the pink crystal]]
ATR uses a property of [[total internal reflection]] resulting in an [[evanescent wave]]. A beam of [[infrared]] [[light]] is passed through the ATR crystal in such a way that it reflects at least once off the internal surface in contact with the sample. This reflection forms the evanescent wave which extends into the sample. The penetration depth into the sample is typically between 0.5 and 2 [[micrometre]]s, with the exact value being determined by the wavelength of light, the angle of incidence and the indices of refraction for the ATR crystal and the medium being probed.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Mirabella, Jr., Practical Spectroscopy Series; Internal reflection spectroscopy: Theory and applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc.; Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1993, 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reflections may be varied by varying the angle of incidence. The beam is then collected by a detector as it exits the crystal. Most modern infrared spectrometers can be converted to characterise samples via ATR by mounting the ATR accessory in the spectrometer's sample compartment. The accessibility of ATR-[[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]] has led to substantial use by the scientific community.

This evanescent effect only works if the crystal is made of an optical material with a higher [[refractive index]] than the sample being studied. Otherwise light is lost to the sample. In the case of a liquid sample, pouring a shallow amount over the surface of the crystal is sufficient. In the case of a solid sample, it is pressed into direct contact with the crystal. Because the evanescent wave into the solid sample is improved with a more intimate contact, solid samples are usually firmly clamped against the ATR crystal, so that trapped [[air]] is not the medium through which the evanescent wave travels, as that would distort the results. The signal to noise ratio obtained depends on the number of reflections but also on the total length of the optical light path which dampens the intensity. Therefore, a general claim that more reflections give better sensitivity cannot be made.

Typical materials for ATR crystals include [[germanium]], [[Thallium halides|KRS-5]] and [[zinc selenide]], while [[silicon]] is ideal for use in the Far-IR region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The excellent mechanical properties of [[diamond]] make it an ideal material for ATR, particularly when studying very hard solids, but its much higher cost means it is less widely used. The shape of the crystal depends on the type of spectrometer and nature of the sample. With [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] spectrometers, the crystal is a rectangular slab with chamfered edges, seen in cross-section in the illustrations. Other geometries use prisms, half-spheres, or thin sheets.

==Applications==
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy by ATR is applicable to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission method. One advantage of ATR-IR over transmission-IR is the limited path length into the sample. This avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions. For ultraviolet or visible light (UV/Vis) the evanescent light path is sufficiently short such that interaction with the sample is decreased with wavelength. For optically dense samples, this may allow for measurements with UV. Also, as no light path has to be established single shaft probes are used for process monitoring and are applicable in both the near and mid infrared spectrum.

Recently, ATR-IR has been applied to [[microfluidic]] flows of aqueous solutions by engineering microreactors with built-in apertures for the ATR crystal, allowing the flow within microchannels to pass across the crystal surface for characterisation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/Journals/LC/article.asp?doi=c001889a Jesse Greener, Bardia Abbasi, Eugenia Kumacheva, Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform spectroscopy for on-chip monitoring of solute concentrations], Lab Chip, 10 (2010) 1561-1566.&lt;/ref&gt; or in dedicated flow cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/op900305v | volume=14 | title=ReactIR Flow Cell: A New Analytical Tool for Continuous Flow Chemical Processing | year=2010 | journal=Organic Process Research | pages=393–404 | last1 = Carter | first1 = Catherine F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ie901094q | volume=49 | title=Determination of the Dispersion Characteristics of Miniaturized Coiled Reactors with Fiber-Optic Fourier Transform Mid-infrared Spectroscopy | year=2010 | journal=Industrial | pages=5530–5535 | last1 = Minnich | first1 = Clemens B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to passively characterise samples, with no sample preparation has also led to the use of ATR-FTIR in studying [[trace evidence]] in [[forensic science]].

ATR-FTIR is also used as a tool in pharmacological research to investigate protein/pharmaceutical interactions in detail. Water-soluble proteins to be investigated require [[Polyhistidine-tag]]s, allowing the macromolecule to be anchored to a lipid bilayer, which is attached to a Germanium crystal or other suitable optical media. Internal reflection with and without applied pharmaceutical or ligand will produce difference spectra to study conformational changes of the proteins upon binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cphc.201200358 | volume=13 | title=Surface-Attached Polyhistidine-Tag Proteins Characterized by FTIR Difference Spectroscopy | year=2012 | journal=ChemPhysChem | pages=2649–2653 | last1 = Pinkerneil | first1 = Philipp | last2 = Güldenhaupt | first2 = Jörn | last3 = Gerwert | first3 = Klaus | last4 = Kötting | first4 = Carsten| pmc=3531609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Autism: Explaining the Enigma''''' is a book published by [[psychologist]] [[Uta Frith]].

This book provided the first satisfactory psychological account of what happens in the mind of a person with [[autism]]. The book proposed that the key problems for autistic people were an inability to recognize and think about thoughts ([[theory of mind]]),{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and an inability to integrate pieces of information into coherent wholes ("[[weak central coherence theory|weak central coherence]]", WCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frith |first=Uta |authorlink=Uta Frith |chapter=Weak central coherence (p. 90ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=j40SDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Autism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6117">'''Biology data visualization''' is a branch of [[bioinformatics]] concerned with the application of [[computer graphics]], [[scientific visualization]], and [[information visualization]] to different areas of the [[life sciences]]. This includes visualization of [[sequences]], [[genomes]], [[sequence alignment|alignments]], [[phylogenies]], [[macromolecules|macromolecular structures]], [[systems biology]], [[microscopy]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] data. Software tools used for visualizing biological data range from simple, standalone programs to complex, integrated systems.

==State-of-the-art and perspectives==
Today we are experiencing a rapid growth in volume and diversity of biological data, presenting an increasing challenge for biologists. A key step in understanding and learning from these data is visualization. Thus, there has been a corresponding increase in the number and diversity of systems for visualizing biological data.

An emerging trend is the blurring of boundaries between the visualization of 3D structures at atomic resolution, visualization of larger complexes by [[cryo-electron microscopy]], and visualization of the location of proteins and complexes within whole cells and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15952904 |year=2005 |vauthors=Lucić V, Förster F, Baumeister W|title=Structural studies by electron tomography: from cells to molecules |volume=74 |pages=833–65 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.074112 |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18602011 |year=2008 |vauthors=Steven AC, Baumeister W |title=The future is hybrid |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=186–95 |doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2008.06.002 |journal=Journal of Structural Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second emerging trend is an increase in the availability and importance of time-resolved data from [[systems biology]], [[electron microscopy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |pmid=17178466 |year=2006 |vauthors=Plattner H, Hentschel J|volume=255 |pages=133–76 |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(06)55003-X |series=International Review of Cytology |isbn=9780123735997 |chapter-url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-40380 |type=Submitted manuscript |title=A Survey of Cell Biology |chapter=Sub-Second Cellular Dynamics: Time-Resolved Electron Microscopy and Functional Correlation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15450290 |year=2004 |vauthors=Frank J, Schlichting I|title=Time-resolved imaging of macromolecular processes and interactions |volume=147 |issue=3 |pages=209–10 |doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2004.06.003 |journal=Journal of Structural Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cell and tissue imaging. In contrast, visualization of trajectories has long been a prominent part of [[molecular dynamics]].

Finally, as datasets are increasing in size, complexity, and interconnectness, biological visualization systems are improving in [[usability]], [[data integration]] and [[standardization]].

'''''Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists''''',&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in {{lang-de|Heller als tausend Sonnen. Das Schicksal der Atomforscher}} (Stuttgart, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; by Austrian [[Robert Jungk]], is the first published account of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[German atomic bomb project]].

==History==
The book studied the making and dropping of the atomic bomb from the viewpoints of the atomic scientists.  The book is largely based on personal interviews with persons who played leading parts in the construction and deployment of the bombs.

In 1956 the book was published in German by Alfred Scherz Verlag with the title ''Heller als tausend Sonnen''.  [[James Cleugh]] translated it into English, and it was published in 1958 by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace and Company]].

The book's title is based on the verse from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] that [[J. Robert Oppenheimer#Trinity|J. Robert Oppenheimer]] is said to have recalled at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)#Explosion|Trinity nuclear test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1958 | title = Brighter than a thousand suns: a personal history of the atomic scientists | author1=Robert Jungk | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | isbn=978-0-15-614150-5 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oy3KGo-Zq_IC&amp;pg=PR7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oy3KGo-Zq_IC&amp;pg=PA201 p.201]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==  
Later in life, Robert Jungk no longer stood behind some portions of his book.  He accused [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], whom he interviewed for the book, of misleading him, and [[Werner Heisenberg]] of confirming von Weizsäcker's claims:

{{Quote|text=I accuse a few [eyewitnesses], who even today are respected by the public, of conscious distortion of history by means of deliberate misrepresentations and — I do not even hesitate to use this devastating word — the occasional lie. [...] It was Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who described to me very forcefully that the German scientists did not want to build the atomic bomb. At that time he used the expression 'passivists' to describe this circle of people.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Walker, ''Physics and Propaganda: Werner Heisenberg's Foreign Lectures under National Socialism'', Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences,Vol. 22, No. 2 (1992), pp. 339-389 ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/27757685 on JStor]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The English translation of Jungk's book and all subsequent German editions contain an excerpt of a letter from Heisenberg to Jungk that implicitly confirms his stand.&lt;ref&gt;Jungk, ''Brighter than a Thousand Suns'', New York, 1958, pp. 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1967 interview, the military head of the [[Manhattan Project]], General [[Leslie Groves]], said: 
{{blockquote|I wouldn’t place any reliance on anything in that book ''Brighter than the Suns''. For example, he gave quotes attributed to me that were the direct opposite of what I had given him. He did that with everybody he talked to. I’d say that he was thoroughly discredited in the eyes of everybody who knew him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ermenc (ed)  |first= Joseph J |title= Atomic Bomb Scientists: Memoirs, 1939-1945 |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1989 |publisher= Meckler |location= Westport, CT &amp; London |isbn= 0-88736-267-2 |oclc= |page= 249 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Burke and Wills Camp B/CXIX''' is a heritage-listed campsite at Burke and Wills Access Road (Private Road), [[Normanton, Queensland|Normanton]], [[Shire of Carpentaria]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is also known as Walker's Camp. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 14 August 2008.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|16977|Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp, Little Bynoe River|602156|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 11 February 1861, four members of the [[Burke and Wills expedition]] attempting to cross the Australian continent from south to north, established their most northerly campsite adjacent the Bynoe River (west of the [[Norman River]]) in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. Two of the party camped at this location for three days while expedition leader [[Robert O'Hara Burke]] and surveyor [[William John Wills]] ventured further north in an attempt to reach the Gulf coast. During their occupation of the site, the party blazed 15 trees to mark its location. A search party led by [[Frederick Walker (native police commandant)|Frederick Walker]] arrived in the area 11 months later, on 8 January 1862, and also established a camp on a small seasonal lagoon near Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX. Walker's expedition blazed a tree to record the location of their camp approximately {{convert|0.75|mi}} north of Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Inspired by the prevailing interest in the sciences and exploration, the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] established a committee in 1857 to "fit out" an expedition to traverse the Australian continent from "south to north". The Royal Society, a philosophical organisation whose membership came from the highest levels of society, the sciences, the [[squattocracy]] and the government in Victoria, approached the community for donations to fund the exploration. Within two years they raised over {{A£|9,000}} including {{A£|6,000}} from the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian Government]]. The chief aim of the expedition was to build on previous exploration work in order to open up the "centre" of the continent.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Royal Society advertised the position of leader of the Victorian Exploration Expedition and Robert O'Hara Burke, a police superintendent from the [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] District of Victoria, was chosen to lead the expedition - a position he had anxiously and diligently pursued. Burke was born in 1821 in [[County Galway]], Ireland, to Protestant gentry. He was educated at [[Woolwich]] and served as a lieutenant in the Austrian cavalry and later in the Irish Mounted Constabulary before emigrating to Australia in 1853.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Society chose William John Wills as the expedition's surveyor and astronomer and third-in-command behind camel master [[George James Landells]]. Wills was born in [[Devon]], England in 1834 and trained in medicine. He emigrated to Australia in 1853 and after a short stint working as a shepherd at [[Deniliquin]], [[New South Wales]], he assisted in his father's medical practice at [[Ballarat]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The guidance from the Royal Society regarding the details of the expedition were unclear and it appeared from instructions presented to Burke on 16 August 1860, that he could travel in any direction he chose once he arrived at [[Coopers Creek (New South Wales)|Cooper's Creek]]. However, there was pressure on Burke and Wills to hasten to the "centre" ahead of a rival [[South Australia]]n group to be led by [[John McDouall Stuart]], who was instructed to explore to the northwest across the continent.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Burke left [[Melbourne]] ahead of Stuart with a large party of men, stock and supplies. By the time he reached [[Menindee, New South Wales|Menindee]] on the [[Darling River]], it was obvious that the push north was going to be hampered by extreme summer weather and the slow speed of the drays carrying equipment and stores. Burke decided to establish a permanent camp there while waiting for the last of his equipment to arrive. Feeling that he had to continue north as quickly as possible, Burke left a party of men at Menindee and pressed on towards Cooper's Creek with a reduced team of eight men. He arranged to have the rest of the team and stores moved up to Cooper's Creek within three months.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

On arrival at Cooper's Creek, Burke decided to make a dash for the Gulf with Wills, [[Charles Gray (explorer)|Charles Gray]] and [[John King (explorer)|John King]], before the wet season set in. This northern party was made up of Burke as party leader, Wills as second-in-command and astronomer, navigator and meteorologist, King as attendant to the party's camels, and Gray as camp organizer.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Burke and Wills Track.png|thumb|Burke and Wills route map]]
Following a line to the northeast of Stuart's proposed track, Burke and his team arrived at the [[Bynoe River|Little Bynoe River]] on 11 February 1861. They were 57 days out from Cooper's Creek and 13 days over the planned time. Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX became the most northern of their camps as [[mangrove]]s blocked further progress to the Gulf. As they were running low on stores and concerned about meeting the remainder of the exploration party at Cooper's Creek, Burke and Wills left Gray and King at Camp B/CXIX and pushed further north through the mangroves in an attempt to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria coast. However, after three days of difficult travel, they returned south picking up Gray and King at Camp B/CXIX. The explorers left little evidence of their stay on the Gulf except for 15 blazed [[Coolibah]] and [[Gutta-percha]] trees.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Most early Australian explorers marked their route of passage across the continent by blazing trees. Blazed trees identify the routes they travelled and the points along their route where they made important observations. Distinguishing markings were often cut within each blaze. The most common markings included the initials of the explorer, the date the blaze was made, and a unique number related to the progress of the expedition (e.g. the number "1" would be used to signify the location as camp number 1. Explorers were often directed by expedition organisers and sponsors on the configuration of the actual markings to be cut. B/CXIX signifies Burke's 119th camp. It was common for unique markings on blazed trees to be matched with entries made in explorers' diaries and journals. In this manner, it is sometimes possible to gain an understanding of what occurred at a particular location when little physical evidence remains.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Between 14 February and 21 April 1861, the four men, with Gray sickening, struggled back towards Cooper's Creek on short supplies and with failing camels. Gray became ill suffering from pain in his head and limbs. His condition continued to deteriorate until he died on the morning of 17 April 1861.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Travel had been so slow that the team at Cooper's Creek gave up hope after four months of waiting, and after burying messages and food at the foot of a tree, left the camp to go for help hours before Burke, Wills and King returned to the camp. Thinking they were alone and unaware of the buried supplies, the three men attempted to reach the nearest police station at [[Mount Hopeless (South Australia)|Mount Hopeless]] in South Australia. However, the difficult terrain and the health of the explorers and their two remaining camels were so bad they were forced to remain along Cooper's Creek, where both Burke and Wills died in late June. King was cared for by local Aboriginal people and survived until rescued by [[Alfred William Howitt]]'s search party in mid-September 1861.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Apart from Howitt, others were sent to search for the lost explorers. One such person was Frederick Walker, who had already made several prospecting trips on behalf of pastoralists during 1860 and 1861. In late 1861, Walker led a party to find the Burke and Wills expedition. Walker established his own camp on a small seasonal lagoon and, during the subsequent four days, located Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX approximately three quarters of a mile away on the Little Bynoe River. Walker's party left several blazed trees in the vicinity of his campsite beside an overflow of the Little Bynoe River.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the early 1860s, Liddle and Hertzer established Magowra Station, which encompassed Camp B/CXIX and Walker's nearby campsite. The township of [[Normanton, Queensland|Normanton]], {{convert|35|km|mi}} from Camp B/CXIX, was established in 1864 as a port and service centre for the surrounding pastoral ventures and was declared a town in 1868.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp remained "undiscovered" until 1909 when staff from Magowra Station found Walker's blazed trees and the blazed trees at Camp B/CXIX. JP Thomson, of the [[Royal Geographical Society of Queensland|Queensland Geographical Society]], published an article in the [[Queensland Geographical Journal]] 25th Session titled "Expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, 1909-10". Thomson located 15 blazed trees on this visit.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1999, David Hillian revisited the site and was able to relocate 10 blazed trees. Thomson's recorded Tree Number 9 is believed to have vanished in 1997 and Number 1 was destroyed in 1999. Tree Number 6 had also been removed to be housed in the [[Normanton Railway Museum]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Burke and Wills' Camp B-CXIX and Walker's Camp, Little Bynoe River - boundary map (2008).jpg|thumb|Map of Burke and Wills Camp B-CXIX and Walker's Camp]]
Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp are located {{convert|35|km|mi}} south-west of Normanton. They are about {{convert|2|km|mi}} south of the Normanton-[[Burketown, Queensland|Burketown]] Road and close to the Little Bynoe River. The sites are located above the waterline on small, seasonal overflows of the river.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Both campsites are accessible via the Burke and Wills Access Road, which runs south off the Normanton-Burketown Road. Both sites are located on unremarkable, dusty landscapes showing no evidence of the dramatic events that took place there. The Burke and Wills Camp B/CXIX is marked by signs and memorials and enclosed by a graded track. Visitors are able to bring vehicles onto the site via this track.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX is marked by the 10 remaining blazed trees made during the party's three day occupation of the site. These trees are located within the fringe of bush round the site and are not obviously tampered with. The blazing is unimposing but remains present on a number of trees at the camp sites. The fact that the blazes are not readily evident without examination has probably enabled most to survive.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Walker's Camp lies within an overflow of the Little Bynoe River. It is marked by a single blazed tree. A stainless steel plaque which reads "Walker's Camp, 8-12th Jan 1862 DNH 1998" has been fastened to the blazed tree. Visitors to this site need to walk through bush for about {{convert|500|m}} to reach it.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Burke and Wills' Camp B-CXIX and Walker's Camp, Little Bynoe River plaque (2010).jpg|thumb|Plaque at Camp B/CXIX, 2010]]
[[Shire of Carpentaria|Carpentaria Shire Council]] has completed significant signage and site protection work as part of funding received from the Community Memorial Restoration Program. Interpretative signage, bollards that protect the site and help restrict access, a protective shelter and a designated car park and access roads have all been installed on the site. None of these additions or alterations is of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp, Little Bynoe River was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 14 August 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX of 11–14 February 1861 and Walker's Camp of 8–12 January 1862, adjacent to the Bynoe River in the Gulf of Carpentaria, are important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history in that they reflect the nineteenth century interest in scientific exploration and the exploration of central and northern Australia. The Burke and Wills Camp B/CXIX is the most northerly marked camp established during the expedition.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX is important in demonstrating the pattern of exploration designed to "open up" the Australian continent for pastoralism. The process of pastoral expansion into a still largely unknown Gulf region of Queensland commenced soon after the expedition concluded, forever changing the region.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The place is significant to the broader Queensland and Australian community as a symbolic representation of the past in the present, providing tangible evidence of the Burke and Wills Expedition and the search effort by Walker's party that was made to locate the lost explorers. Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX is significant as a landmark.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The camps are also significant tangible evidence of the extent and degree to which the story of the Burke and Wills Expedition has affected the broader Queensland and Australian community.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''

The blazed trees on both the Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp sites, together with the "[[Burke and Wills Dig Tree|Dig Tree]]" at Cooper's Creek, are rare surviving and tangible evidence of the ill-fated Burke and Wills Expedition, and also of Frederick Walker's search for the lost explorers.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The blazed trees are also rare in that they are still identifiable as belonging to an early exploration event and that they have also survived since 1861 in a remote and inhospitable landscape.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.'''

The camps are significant in that they have the potential to yield additional archaeological evidence that may add to our store of knowledge about practices and processes of nineteenth century exploration in northern Queensland and Australia.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The place has research potential, especially if other campsites from the Burke and Wills expedition are located in the future, and therefore may enable a better understanding of the hardships endured on that expedition. The place may also yield information suitable for comparative analysis with camps associated with other exploration events.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp are significant in illustrating a principal characteristic of early exploration in Queensland - the marking of expedition campsites with blazes to record information for future travellers. The earliness, intactness, and rarity of these blazed trees makes this place an outstanding example of its type.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

Burke and Wills' Camp B/CXIX and Walker's Camp sites have a special association with the work of Robert O'Hara Burke, William John Wills and Frederick Walker who were key figures in nineteenth century Australian and Queensland exploration.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Career ==

Overgaard Nielsen was a soil [[ecologist]], specializing in soil [[nematode]]s and [[Enchytraeidae]]. He investigated the role of the soil microfauna in the [[decomposition]] of plant litter and recycling of [[nutrient]]s in [[ecosystem]]s.

He was a visiting scientist with [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1950-1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6C4b1nZfrUwC Crowcroft, Peter (1991) Elton's Ecologists: A History of the Bureau of Animal Population. University of Chicago Press] {{ISBN|0-226-12148-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then employed at the [[Mols Laboratory]] under [[Aarhus University]]. In 1964, he was appointed professor of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, B. (2000) ''Christian Overgaard Nielsen 16. januar 1918 - 26. januar 1999''. [[Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]] - Oversigt over Selskabets Virksomhed 1998-2000: pp. 352-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Editor-in-Chief of the scientific journal [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] (1949-1965).

'''City-Data''' is an [[Illinois]]-based [[social networking]] and information website that presents data and information pertaining to [[United States]] cities, and offers public [[online forum]]s for discussion. US cities, counties, zip codes, and neighborhoods are profiled and compared using governmental data about [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|race]], [[income]], [[education]], [[crime]], [[weather]], [[House|housing]], [[map]]s, [[air pollution]], and [[religion]]s. The site contains information about home value estimates (including recent home sales), local businesses, schools (including their demographics and test scores), hospitals, libraries, tourist attractions, local businesses, restaurant inspection findings, building permits, bridge conditions, hotels, water systems, airports, cell phone towers, property tax assessments, and car accidents.

City-data.com is owned and operated by Advameg, Inc. of [[Hinsdale, Illinois]].  The information on the website includes consumer names and street addresses, obtained via [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] requests and other public records; City-Data has an opt-out feature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/delrequest/list.php|title=Requests to disassociate name from street-level assessment address|work=city-data.com|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to break the web-visible association between names and street addresses, but does not remove the consumer names themselves.

In 2010, because of a post on the [[People Search]] forum, a mother and son reunited 17&amp;nbsp;years after the son was [[kidnap]]ped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/article287206.ece|title=Mother and son reunited 17 years after kidnap |accessdate=2014-10-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204101345/http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/article287206.ece| archivedate=4 February 2010 |date=1 February 2010 |last=Cohen |first=Lauren |work=[[The Times (South Africa)|The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City-data also has an extremely extensive forums section.  This section includes hundreds of thousands of discussion threads on the merits of moving to particular states, cities, towns, and neighborhoods in the United States and all over the world.  There are also non-geographic forum groups covering every conceivable topic such as health, nutrition,  consumer affairs, automotive care, home maintenance, financial advice, sports, pets, gardening, entertainment, travel, religion,  [[environmentalism]], nature, weather, military life, politics, relationships, parenting, caregiving, history, genealogy, and countless other topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">An exhibition curated by [[Rick Poynor]] at the [[Barbican Art Gallery]] (2004) charting over 40 years of [[graphic design]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The first major attempt to reflect on how the smaller independent studios and agencies marked and shaped the way we look at images in our everyday lives: from book and magazines, music covers and promotions, web design, corporate identities, politics and society and self-initiated projects.

The exhibition assembled some of the most iconic pieces produced since the early sixties. From the covers for [[Penguin Books]] by [[Derek Birdsall]] and [[Romek Marber]], the magazines ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' by [[Neville Brody]] and ''[[i-D]]'' by [[Terry Jones]], the memorable ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]] – Here‘s the Sex Pistols'', the Channel4 and [[BBC]]2 TV idents by [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]], the graphic work for [[Pirelli]] by Fletcher/Forbes/Gill.

Other designers and studios included: Lucienne Roberts, [[Malcolm Garrett]], Kate Hepburn, [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], [[Vaughan Oliver]], [[Mark Farrow]], Tomato, Intro, 8vo, [[Richard Hollis]], [[Herbert Spencer (graphic designer)|Herbert Spencer]], [[Ken Garland]], [[Margaret Calvert]], [[Jonathan Barnbrook]], Why Not Associates, [[Trickett &amp; Webb]], [[Graphic Thought Facility]], [[Jannuzzi Smith]], Fuel, Kerr/Noble, Alan Kitching, The Designers Republic, Hi-Res, Paul Elliman, Nick Bell, Phil Baines and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19096">The '''compact city''' or '''city of short distances''' is an [[urban planning]] and [[urban design]] concept, which promotes relatively high residential density with mixed land uses. It is based on an efficient public transport system and has an urban layout which – according to its advocates – encourages walking and cycling, low energy consumption and reduced pollution. A large resident population provides opportunities for social interaction as well as a feeling of safety in numbers and 'eyes on the street'.&lt;ref name = "jj"&gt;[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961) New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-60047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also arguably a more sustainable urban settlement type than [[urban sprawl]] because it is less dependent on the car, requiring less (and cheaper per capita) infrastructure provision (Williams 2000, cited in Dempsey 2010).&lt;ref name = "nd"&gt;Dempsey, Nicola (2010) Revisiting the Compact City? Built Environment 36(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving a compact city does not just mean increasing [[urban density]] ''per se'' or across all parts of the city. It means good planning to achieve an ''overall'' more compact urban form:
{{quote| Governments of sprawling cities can take many actions to seek a more compact form, often also involving higher densities. Other cities, such as Cairo, with large, dense slum areas, are responding by reducing urban densities in core areas. In either case, limiting outward urban expansion can be combined with more efficient use of land resources and more effective protection of natural resources. City growth can be physically limited in this way through legislated urban growth boundaries, non-urban green belts, and the quarantining of development in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==

The term ''compact city'' was first coined in 1973 by [[George Dantzig]] and [[Thomas L. Saaty]],&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, G. B. and Saaty, T. L., 1973, ''Compact City: Plan for a Liveable Urban Environment'', W. H. Freeman, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; two mathematicians whose utopian vision was largely driven by a desire to see more efficient use of resources. The concept, as it has influenced [[urban planning]], is often attributed to [[Jane Jacobs]] and her book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961),&lt;ref name ="jj"/&gt; a critique of [[modern architecture|modernist]] planning policies claimed by Jacobs to be destroying many existing [[inner-city]] communities.

Among other criticisms of the conventional planning and transport planning of the time, Jacobs' work attacked the tendency, inherited from the [[garden city movement]], towards reducing the density of dwellings in urban areas. Four conditions were necessary to enable the diversity essential for [[urban renewal]]: mixed uses, small walkable blocks, mingling of building ages and types, and "a sufficiently dense concentration of people". The 'sufficient' density would vary according to local circumstances but, in general, a hundred dwellings per acre (247 per hectare – high by American standards, but quite common in European and Asian cities) could be considered a minimum.

==The compact city and related concepts==

Although the concept of 'compact city' was coined by American writers, it has been used more in recent years by European and particularly British planners and academics. See, for example, the writings of Michael Jenks.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, M., Burton, E. and Williams, K. (Editors), 1996, ''The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form?'', Spon Press; {{ISBN|0-419-21300-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America the term '[[smart growth]]' has become increasingly common linked to the concept of '[[smart city]]'. The concept of 'smart growth' is very similar to 'compact city', although 'smart growth' carries more strongly normative connotations, implicitly accepting the emphasis in current mainstream debates that growth is necessary and good. The term is often used loosely to accommodate these debates&lt;ref&gt;[ See for example, https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/07/the-countrys-most-ambitious-smart-growth-project/242549/ Kaid Benfield, "The Country's Most Ambitious Smart Growth Project", ''The Atlantic'', July 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognate concepts include 'sustainable urban development' with no presumption that development equals growth.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative concept is 'green urbanism'. [[Steffen Lehmann]] has extensively written about the compact city and green urbanism. His work presents a series of international case studies and outlines 15 core principles for the design of compact, sustainable cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1057; Lehmann, S. (2010) Green urbanism: Formulating a series of holistic principles]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S'' '''3''' (2)''The Principles of Green Urbanism'' (Earthscan, 2010; {{ISBN|978-1-84407-817-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==The compact city, urban sprawl and automobile dependency==

Whether the compact city (or '[[smart growth]]') does or can reduce problems of [[automobile dependency]] associated with [[urban sprawl]] has been fiercely contested over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Petrol use urban density.svg|''Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook'', Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The study's methodology has been criticised&lt;ref&gt;MINDALI, O., RAVEH, A. and SALOMON, I., 2004. Urban density and energy consumption: a new look at old statistics. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 38(2), pp. 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted – although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.

Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense [[suburb]]an and [[exurb]]an residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. FRANK, L. and PIVOT, G., 1994. Impact of Mixed Use and Density on Three Modes of Travel. Transportation Research Record, 1446, pp. 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g910669635 Transport Reviews Volume 29 Issue 3 (2009)] was entirely devoted to this issue&lt;/ref&gt; people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Bagley, M.N. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2002) The impact of residential neighborhood type on travel behavior: A structural equations modeling approach. Annals of Regional Science36 (2), 279.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' Handy, S., Cao, X. and Mokhtarian, P.L. (2005) Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment10 (6), 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paradox of intensification==

Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour, Melia ''et al.'' (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/10555/2/melia-barton-parkhurst_The_Paradox_of_Intensification.pdf Melia, S., Barton, H. and Parkhurst, G. (In Press) The Paradox of Intensification. Transport Policy 18 (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of the compact city. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.

For example, [[Portland, Oregon]], a U.S. city which has pursued [[smart growth]] policies,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainablefreedomlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-Portlanders-View-of-Smart-Growth.pdf|title=A Portlander’s View of Smart Growth|last=O’TOOLE|first=RANDAL|date=2004|website=Sustainable Freedom Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottbeyer/2017/03/29/portlands-urban-growth-boundary-a-driver-of-suburban-sprawl/#1e8bf28d6964|title=Portland's Urban Growth Boundary: A Driver of Suburban Sprawl|last=Beyer|first=Scott|date=29 March 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:
{{quote|[[Ceteris paribus]], urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.}}

At the city-wide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures, to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.

This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development, positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and [[carfree zone]]s.

== Influence in Europe ==
The [[European Commission]] published the [[Green Paper]] ''Towards a new culture for urban mobility''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52007DC0551:EN:NOT Green Paper - Towards a new culture for urban mobility, European Commission, 27 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; on 27 September 2007. Several institutions reacted&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;where=GRP_CITATION:52007DC0551&amp;whereihm=Instruments%20cited:52007DC0551 EU documents mentioning the 2007 European Commission Green Paper – Towards a new culture for urban mobility]&lt;/ref&gt; to the Green Paper among them the European Parliament.

Based on the preparatory work of its Committee on Transport and Tourism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A6-2008-0252&amp;language=EN Draft Report on: Towards a new culture of urban mobility], Motion for a European Parliament resolution, In: 2008/2041(INI). European Parliament, Committee on Transport and Tourism, 27 February 2009, downloaded 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Parliament]] in its Resolution of 9 July 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P6-TA-2008-0356&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A6-2008-0252 European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2008 on "Towards a new culture of urban mobility"]&lt;/ref&gt; called among other things for “drawing up customised sustainable mobility plans and supporting measures for regional and urban planning ('city of short distances'), a process in which all parties concerned should be involved from an early stage”. They referred among others to the EU strategy to combat climate change and other environmental problems.

===Influence in the Netherlands===

The Netherlands' urban planning is highly influenced by the 'compacte stad'. In the 1960s cities expanded in large, top-down planned neighbourhoods using the scarce space available to use as efficiently as possible. Later, cities weren't allowed to expand anyhow, giving way for completely new towns on moderate distances from the main city, in order to keep the new towns influenced mainly by their 'capital', however, giving the towns also some own air. Public transport between the main city and its towns in the rural areas connected them. This policy (''groeikernenbeleid'') resulted in typical commuter towns. Afterwards, in the 1980s, governments decided people need and want to live in this capital city itself and the groeikernenbeleid was rejected. New urban neighbourhoods had to be around a city, as a skin, encircling skins of older neighbourhoods. The new neighbourhoods were cleverly designed, relatively dense and with very good connections to get downtown by public transport or bicycle.

This history results in a lack of urban sprawl, or at least of new urban sprawl. As new neighbourhoods need to be built as an outer skin around existing settlements and as other policies prohibited establishing new settlements outside other towns or villages, no new linear villages could be founded without governmental intervention any more. This in order to keep the rural landscape 'clean' and cities dense and compact.

As a result, in Dutch towns all neighbourhoods are close to city centers, enabling inhabitants to get around quickly and cheaply by bike. Getting out of town doesn't involve driving through ever-ongoing sprawled suburbs, making it easy and popular to visit rural areas. By all these regulations, for instance the [[Groene Hart]] (Green Hart amid the Randstad) is kept green, while buffers around cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] avoids getting the cities grown together entirely.

===Influence in the United Kingdom===

The compact city had a particularly strong influence on planning policy in the UK during the Labour Governments of 1997–2010. The first Labour Government in 1998 set up the Urban Taskforce under [[Richard Rogers|Lord Rogers of Riverside]], which produced the report [[Towards an Urban Renaissance]]. Influenced by this report, the UK Government issued [[PPG 3]] Planning Policy Guidance on Housing which introduced a 60% [[brownfield]] target, a minimum net residential density guideline of 30 dwellings per hectare, a sequential hierarchy beginning with urban [[brownfield land]], maximum parking guidelines replacing the previous minima, and a policy of intensification around public transport nodes. Over the succeeding years, these targets were substantially exceeded, with the brownfield proportion reaching 80% by 2009, and average densities 43 dwellings per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;Land Use Change Statistics (England) 2009 – provisional estimates (July 2010) [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/lucs2009provisionaljuly Department of Communities and Local Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Russia and other ex-Soviet countries ==

Most cities in [[Russia]] such as regional capitals [[Yaroslavl]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Novosibirsk]], etc., as well as cities and towns in other ex [[Eastern Block]] countries (such as [[Trencin]] or [[Zvolen]] in [[Slovakia]]) can be qualified as compact cities, where most people live in residential areas made up of big apartment blocks between 3 to 8 floors, in parks full of trees, flowers, playgrounds, benches, etc. with small shops and cafés on the ground level or in clusters around the main paths. Residents have thus much space to socialize. Cars typically only have limited access to the “inner garden ” that surrounds the apartment blocks and are limited to the main boulevards. The high population density means people have to walk smaller distances to get to the supermarket, school, kindergarten, pub, restaurant, grocery, library, gym, or access the public transportation system – a mix of public buses and tramway and private minibuses. Most people in those cities do not own a car and if they do, they use it only in the summer to drive to their [[dacha]] (cars are typically covered in 2–3 m of snow in winter). Living in apartments also means fewer losses of energy spent on heating, each apartment block having one central heating system in the basement that can be either publicly or privately run.

The '''dwarf galaxy problem''', also known as the '''missing satellites problem''', arises from numerical [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[simulation]]s that predict the evolution of the distribution of [[matter]] in the [[universe]]. [[Dark matter]] seems to cluster hierarchically and in ever increasing number counts for smaller-and-smaller-sized [[galactic halo|halos]]. However, although there seem to be enough observed normal-sized [[galaxy|galaxies]] to account for this distribution, the number of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]]&lt;ref name="Mateo1998"&gt;{{cite journal

There are two main alternatives to resolving this problem. One is that the smaller halos do exist but only a few of them end up becoming visible because they have not been able to attract enough [[baryonic matter]] to create a visible dwarf galaxy. In support of this, [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] observations in 2007 of eight newly discovered ultra-faint Milky Way dwarf satellites showed that six were around 99.9% dark matter (with a [[mass-to-light ratio]] of about 1000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This tidal stripping has been part of the problem in identifying dwarf galaxies in the first place, which is an extremely difficult task since these objects have low surface brightness and are highly diffused, so much that they are virtually unnoticeable.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

The '''Eckfelder Maar''' is a former [[volcano|volcanic]] lake, that was formed during the Middle [[Eocene]] around 44.3 million years ago and is thus the oldest known maar.&lt;ref name=EM/&gt; It lies in the southwestern [[Eifel]] mountains near [[Manderscheid, Bitburg-Prüm|Manderscheid]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=EM&gt;[http://www.eckfelder-maar.de/ ''Das Eckfelder Maar''] at www.eckfelder-maar.de. Retrieved 22 Jul 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an important [[fossil]] site that contains numerous fossil remains of fauna and flora, some of them complete. It has been continuously scientifically researched since 1987. The large number of finds - to date 25,000 fossils have been found&lt;ref name=EM/&gt; - have enabled a very detailed reconstruction of the landscape. This [[maar]], together with the [[Grube Messel]] and the [[Geiseltal]] valley, is one of the foremost palaeontological sites for this geological epoch in Central Europe and worldwide.

'''First appearance datum''' is a term used by [[geologist]]s and [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to designate the first (oldest) appearance of a species in the geologic record.  In other words, FADs represent the geologically oldest fossil of a particular species that has so far been discovered.

FADs are frequently used to designate segments in the [[geologic time scale]]. For example, the beginning of the [[Tremadocian]] Stage of the [[Ordovician]] Period is marked by the first appearance (FAD) of the [[conodont]] ''Iapetognathus fluctivagus'' in the geologic record.  This occurs in [[Stratigraphy|bed]] 23 of the rock formation known as the Green Point section, located in western [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], as well as in geologically correlated [[Stratum|strata]] in many parts of the world.

He, early in life, assumed the name of "Arnold-Bemrose" to distinguish his name from that of his father, Sir [[Henry Howe Bemrose]] (1827–1911) and, upon the death of his father, reverted to the name "Bemrose". Arnold-Bemrose graduated B.A. 1879 from [[Clare College, Cambridge]] and then entered his father's printing firm of Bemrose and Sons, where he remained active for over fifty years.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; Arnold-Bemrose received his M.A. in 1882 and his Sc.D. in 1908 from Clare College, Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BMRS875HH|name=Bemrose, Henry Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Mayor of Derby]] for 1909.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; 

He published over twenty papers dealing mostly with geology, as well as the 1910 book ''Derbyshire'' on the county's geology, history, antiquities, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold-Bemrose, Henry Howe|title=Derbyshire|year=1910|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000112960}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Murchison Medal]] in 1938.

'''HippoDraw''' is a powerful [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] statistical [[data analysis]] [[Software package (installation)|package]] written in [[C++]], with user interaction via a [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]]-based [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] and a [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-scriptable interface. It is being developed by [[Paul Kunz]] at [[SLAC]], primarily for the analysis and presentation of [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]] data, but can be equally well used in other fields where data handling is important.

HippoDraw can read and write files in an XML-based format, astrophysics [[FITS]] files, data objects produced by [[ROOT]] (optional), and through the Python bindings, anything that can be read/written by Python ([[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF5]], for instance, with PyTables).

HippoDraw can be used as a Python extension module, allowing users to use HippoDraw data objects with the full power of the Python language. This includes other scientific Python extension modules such Numeric and numarray, whose use with HippoDraw can lead to a large increase in processing speed, even for ROOT objects.&lt;!--
is this still true?

Both HippoDraw and [[Java Analysis Studio|JAS]] implement the [[AIDA (computing)|AIDA]] interface specifications, and as such can interoperate well.

'''Hugo Erich Meyer von Klinggräff''' (7 June 1820 in [[Klein Watkowitz]], Stuhm &amp;ndash; 3 April 1902 in [[Paleschken]], Stuhm) was a German botanist specialist of [[bryophyte]]s. He was the brother of botanist [[Carl Julius Meyer von Klinggräff]], with whom he often collaborated.

In 1826, he moved with his parents to a homestead located not far from [[Zagreb|Agram]], [[Croatia]]. He later studied at the [[University of Königsberg]], receiving his doctorate in 1846. Following graduation, he returned to Croatia, where he botanized in areas along the [[Adriatic Sea]] and islands within the [[Gulf of Quarnero]]. During this time period, he collaborated with other botanists, that included [[Mutius von Tommasini]]. In 1852 he acquired an estate in Wiszniewo bei Lobau, [[Province of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sdg5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA2 Bericht, Volumes 26-32] by Westpreussischer botanisch-zoologischer Verein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sysbot.biologie.uni-muenchen.de/botsyst/ic/ic-bry-k.htm Bryophytes K] (Collectors Index Herbarium M)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informative modelling''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]  methodological approach 
linking [[information technologies]] with architectural analysis and [[Architectural model|modelling]] 
(at various scales, from architectural elements to [[building]]s and structures). 
Informative modelling aims at improving the way [[information]] and evidences about how architectural objects evolved through time can be visually displayed.

Informative modelling applies to the study of historic architecture, where objects have most often been widely transformed, and consequently where what is known about objects remains partial. As a consequence, whereas in traditional architectural modelling a realistic representation 
of objects is considered as an end, in the informative modelling methodology the representation of architectural objects is used primarily as support for [[scientific visualization|information search and visualisation]], [[reasoning]] and [[cognition]]:
it does not strive for realism.

Abstraction (the ''infovis'' legacy) and figuration (the ''architectural representation'' legacy) are integrated as alternative/mixable modes of representation, allowing partial knowledge to be communicated and important notions in historic sciences such as data [[uncertainty]] to be conveyed graphically.

Informative modelling puts the data about evolutions of architectural artefacts first, 
and provides rules for outputting [[2D computer graphics|2D]]/[[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics thought to become sustainable investigation 
and [[Software visualization|visualization]] tools (knowledge and discovery tools, as J.Bertin says it), striving for the readability 
of a dynamic geographical map. Examples of such rules are accessibility of the underlying documentary 
justification (archives, research material, etc.), information credibility assessment, visual underlining 
of lacking information, relation to an exogenous theoretical model of architectural elements, dynamic visualisation, 
research process progress assessment, etc.

Informative modelling has roots in architectural modelling, [[:Category:3D imaging]], [[:Category:3D computer graphics]], [[Georeference]], [[database]], 
[[scientific modelling]], [[scientific visualization]], [[knowledge visualization]], [[Knowledge management]], [[information retrieval]], [[Information science]], [[Computer graphics]], [[Information graphics]], 
and intersects methods and issues stemming from these disciplines.

==Etymology==
According to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (1975) the origin of the name goes back to the [[Hawke (surname)|surname Hawke]], a historical alternative spelling for the English word [[hawk]], which changed into ''Hawelke'' or ''Hawelecke''.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia astronomii w Polsce'': vol. 1 1975. Jerzy Dobrzycki, Eugeniusz Rybka, Polska Akademia Nauk. (Pracownia Historii Nauk ścisłych), page 256. {{OCLC|2776864}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Poland he is known as ''Jan Heweliusz'',&lt;ref&gt;Older spellings include also Jan Hewelijusz and Jan Hefel, according to Samuel Orgelbrand, ed. 1884. ''Encyklopedyja powszechna S. Orgelbranda:nowe stereotypowe odbicie'', vols 5-6 page 243. {{OCLC|17568522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Patrick Moore]] ''Hevelius'' is a Latinised version of the name ''Hewelcke''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FNfjWKBZx8C&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=johannes+hewelcke&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=VUJXTq7uFtDU4QSh_tnJDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=johannes%20hewelcke&amp;f=false|title=Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy|first1=Patrick|last1=Moore|first2=Robin|last2=Rees|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011|isbn=0521899354|page=63,543|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  other versions of the name include Hewel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gdTgIW-7IMC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=johannes+hewel+hevelius&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=r0NXTtOSL4PSsgbKn7nGCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=johannes%20hewel%20hevelius&amp;f=false|title=Histories of Scientific Insights|first1=Igor|last1=Ushakov|publisher= |date=2007|isbn=978-1-4303-2849-0|page=46|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hevel, Hevelke&lt;ref name=Vaquero&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWkyiEeiyksC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=hewel+hevelius&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=AKZcTtPZKNDTsgaQ7LDEDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hewel%20hevelius&amp;f=false|title=The sun recorded through history|first1=José M.|last1=Vaquero|first2=Manuel|last2=Vázquez|publisher=Springer |date=2009|isbn=9780387927909|page=126|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hoefel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTBIAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=stellaeburgum+hevelius&amp;dq=stellaeburgum+hevelius&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=KENfTteBLdHP4QTZ2yQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ|title=Pieśń o Gdańsku|first1=Wiktor Teofil|last1=Gomulicki|publisher=Wydaw Morskie |date=1978|isbn=|page=80|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Höwelcke, Höfelcke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gx2IFngILiAC&amp;pg=PA998&amp;dq=johannes+h%C3%B6welcke&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=mkVXTo_mH43Osgb2iJGXCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=johannes%20h%C3%B6welcke&amp;f=false|title=Deutsch-polnische Beziehungen in Geschichte und Gegenwart|first1=Andreas |last1=Lawaty|first2=Anna|last2=Domańska|publisher=Deutsches Polen-Institut |date=2000|isbn=|page=998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Feliks Bentkowski]] (1814) during his early years he also signed as Hoefelius,&lt;ref&gt;Bentkowski, 1814. ''Historya literatury polskiey: wystawiona w spisie dzieł drukiem ogłoszonych'', page 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Günther-Fürstenwalde (1903) reports, next to the usage of the Latinised version, Hevelius' signature as ''Johannes Höffelius Dantiscanus'' in 1631 and ''Hans Höwelcke'' in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Günther-Fürstenwalde, [https://archive.org/details/himmelunderde01unkngoog "Johannes Hevelius: Ein Lebensbild aus dem XVII. Jahrhundert"], ''Himmel und Erde: Illustrierte naturwissenschaftliche Monatsschrift '', '''15''' (1903), 529–542.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hevelius' father was Abraham Hewelke (1576–1649), his mother Kordula Hecker (1576–1655). They were German-speaking [[Lutheran]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hevelius.html| title =The Galileo Project | accessdate=24 August 2011 | publisher=Rice University}}&lt;/ref&gt; wealthy [[brewery|brewing]] [[merchant]]s of [[Bohemia]]n origin. As a young boy, Hevelius was sent to [[Gądecz]] (Gondecz) where he studied the [[Polish language]].&lt;ref&gt;Libri Gedanenses, Tomy 23-24, Polska Akademia Naukowa Biblioteka Gdańska Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, page 127, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' (secondary school), where he was taught by [[Peter Crüger]], Hevelius in 1630 studied [[jurisprudence]] at [[Leiden University|Leiden]], then travelled in [[England]] and [[France]], meeting [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. In 1634 he settled in his native town, and on 21 March 1635 married Katharine Rebeschke, a neighbour two years younger who owned two adjacent houses. The following year, Hevelius became a member of the [[beer]]-[[brewing]] [[guild]], which he led from 1643 onwards.

Throughout his life, Hevelius took a leading part in [[municipal]] [[Local government|administration]], becoming [[town council]]lor in 1651; but from 1639 on, his chief interest was [[astronomy]]. In 1641 he built an [[observatory]] on the roofs of his three connected houses, equipping it with splendid instruments, ultimately including a large [[Keplerian Telescope|Keplerian telescope]] of {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[focal length]],&lt;ref name="Clerke 1911"/&gt;  with a wood and wire tube he constructed himself.

This private observatory was visited by Polish Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]] on 29 January 1660.
As a subject of the Polish kings, Hevelius enjoyed the patronage of four consecutive kings of Poland,&lt;ref&gt;Hippolit Skimborowicz: ''Żywot i prace Jana Hewelinsza gdańszczanina żyjacego pod panowaniem czterech królów polskich'', Warszawa 1860. {{OCLC|253951432}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his family was raised to the position of nobility by the King of Poland [[Jan Kazimierz]] in 1660, who previously visited his observatory in 1659.&lt;ref&gt;Kwartalnik historii kultury materialnej, Tom 39, Instytut Historii Kultury Materialnej 1991 (Polska Akademia Nauk), page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; While the noble status was not ratified by the Polish [[Sejm]] Hevelius's coat of arms includes the distinctive Polish royal crown.&lt;ref&gt;On the 300th anniversary of the death of Johannes Hevelius: book of The International Scientific Session, Robert Glȩbocki, Andrzej Zbierski, International Scientific Session, Ossolineum, The Polish Academy of Sciences, page 56, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Polish King]] [[John III Sobieski]] who regularly visited Hevelius numerous times in years 1677–1683 released him from paying taxes connected to brewing and allowed his beer to be sold freely outside the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;Międzynarodowy Rok Heweliusza 1987: dokumentacja obchodów trzechsetnej rocznicy śmierci Jana Heweliusza (1687-1987), page 10, 1990 Zakład Narodowy im Ossolińskich.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1679 the young Englishman [[Edmond Halley]] visited him as emissary of the [[Royal Society]], whose fellow Hevelius had been since 1664.

Halley had been instructed by [[Robert Hooke]] and [[John Flamsteed]] to persuade Hevelius to use [[History of telescopes|telescopes]] for his measurements, yet Hevelius demonstrated that he could do well with only [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[alidade]]. He is thus considered the last astronomer to do major work without the use of a telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QhjRFox0mKYC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;ots=CKygx0mGr0&amp;dq=%2Bhevelius+%2Bdanzig&amp;sig=UFIMY-R_iikjNUN5bIelFzEhwfw#PPA414,M1 Daintith, John, ''Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists'', CRC Books, 1994] {{ISBN|0-7503-0287-9}} at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Hevelius made observations of [[sunspots]], 1642–1645, devoted four years to charting the lunar surface, discovered the [[Moon]]'s [[libration]] in longitude, and published his results in ''[[Selenographia, sive Lunae descriptio]]'' (1647), a work which entitles him to be called "the founder of lunar [[topography]]".&lt;ref name="Clerke 1911"/&gt;

He discovered four [[comet]]s, in 1652, 1661 (probably [[Ikeya-Zhang]]), 1672 and 1677. These discoveries led to his thesis that such bodies revolve around the [[Sun]] in parabolic paths.
[[Image:Hevelius and wife.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Johannes Hevelius and wife Elisabeth making observations]]

A complex [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo phenomenon]] was observed by many in the city [[Sevenfold sun miracle|on 20 February 1661]], and was described by Hevelius in his ''Mercurius in Sole visus Gedani'' the following year.

Katharine, his first wife, died in 1662, and a year later Hevelius married [[Elisabeth Hevelius|Elisabeth Hevelius née Koopmann]], the young daughter of a merchant family. The couple had four children. Elisabeth supported him, published two of his works after his death, and is considered the first female astronomer.

His observatory, instruments and books were destroyed by fire on 26 September 1679. The catastrophe is described in the preface to his ''Annus climactericus'' (1685). He promptly repaired the damage enough to enable him to observe the great comet of December 1680.&lt;ref name="Clerke 1911"/&gt; He named the constellation ''[[Sextans]]'' in memory of these lost instruments.

In late 1683, in commemoration of the victory of Christian forces led by Polish King John III Sobieski at the [[Battle of Vienna]], he invented and named the constellation ''Scutum Sobiescianum'' (Sobieski's Shield), now called [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]]. This constellation first occurred publicly in his star atlas ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum'', that was [[printing press|printed]] in his own house at lavish expense, and he himself engraved many of the [[printing]] plates.&lt;ref name="Clerke 1911"/&gt;

His health had suffered from the shock of the 1679 fire and he died on his 76th birthday, 28 January 1687.&lt;ref name="Clerke 1911"/&gt; Hevelius was buried in St. Catherine's Church in his hometown.

Descendants of Hevelius live in [[Urzędów]] in Poland where they support local astronomy enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janheweliusz.pl/article/9851_Potomkowie_Jana_Heweliusza.htm Potomkowie Jana Heweliusza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201224447/http://www.janheweliusz.pl/article/9851_Potomkowie_Jana_Heweliusza.htm |date=1 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legacy costs''' is a term formed by analogy with the computer industry's [[legacy systems]]. Legacy costs are those incurred by an organization (whether [[corporation]] or [[city]]) in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. While it can refer to other commitments (particularly existing [[infrastructure]]) as well, it primarily refers to obligations to pay health care costs and [[pensions]] under [[defined-benefit pension|defined-benefit]] plans for current employees and retirees, usually incurred during the labor peace era after [[World War II]]. Legacy costs are believed to hinder American jobs, such as [[Automaker|auto manufacturers]] and [[central business district|central cities]], and older [[airline]]s worldwide. This belief leads to the idea that legacy costs will lower the company's competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/legacycosts.asp?lgl=myfinance-layout-no-ads|title=Legacy Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organized labor]] sees such criticisms as part of a desire to abandon any form of [[social contract]] between worker and employer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Newer, less-established entities have few or no problems with legacy costs, because they have less pension and health care liabilities (this applies to new [[suburbs]], for example, as well as new companies), and are therefore able to out-compete (in some cases) the older entities.


==History==
In the 1990s, steel firms were guaranteed pension funds. Workers had health-care benefits through these steel firms; however, there was an issue in funding for the defined benefit pension funds. In 1986, [[PBGC]] took over [[Ling-Temco-Vought|LTV]]'s pension payments after LTV went bankrupt. The main apprehension was the liabilities between the firms with defined benefit plans and the firms with contribution pension plans. After this problem, many workers believed that the old firms had to pay the costs of the pensions, also known as legacy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Economic History of the American Steel Industry|last=Rogers|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0415777605|location=2 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon, OX14 4RN|pages=185-187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has conducted research on how much money is spent on pension plans from state and local government in their published 2012 findings. This research used records from Boston College Center for Retirement Research with a Public Plans Database (PPD). The information needed to be counted for the calculation are age and salary histories of members, retirement ages, asset earnings, etc.  From this article's database, researchers came to the conclusion that pensions are underfunded because governments do not plan enough funds to insure liabilities expenses in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pension Legacy Costs and Local government Finances|journal=Lincoln Institute of Land Policy|date=October 2012|page=2-9|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pension-costs-local-finances-gordon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has no [[List of U.S. state nicknames|official nickname]], although "Heart of Dixie" was strongly promoted by the [[Alabama Chamber of Commerce]] in the 1940s and 1950s, and put on state [[license plate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/Heart_of_Dixie.html | title = The Heart of Dixie | accessdate =2008-01-20 | date=March 30, 2007 | publisher = Alabama Department of Archives and History }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/emblems.html | title =Alabama Emblems, Symbols and Honors| accessdate =2008-01-20 | date=February 5, 2008 | publisher = Alabama Department of Archives and History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''sources that each list metalloids''': elements classified as [[metalloid]]s. The sources are listed in chronological order. Lists of metalloids differ since there is no rigorous definition of metalloid (or its occasional alias, 'semi-metal'). Individual lists share common ground, with variations occurring at the margins. The elements most often regarded as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.{{#tag:ref|Lack of a rigorous definition:
* Goldsmith RH 1982, 'Metalloids', ''Journal of Chemical Education'', vol. 59, no. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;526–527, {{DOI|10.1021/ed059p526}}
* Hawkes SJ 2001, 'Semimetallicity', ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' vol. 78, no. 12, pp.&amp;nbsp;1686–87, {{DOI|10.1021/ed078p1686}}|group=n}} Wikipedia generally categorises these six as metalloids, with the addition of astatine. Other sources may subtract from this list or add a varying number of other elements.

==Chronological list==
This table show which elements are included in each of 194 different lists of metalloids. A parenthesized symbol indicates an element whose inclusion in a particular metalloid list is qualified in some way by the author(s). The 'citations' rows show how many and what percentage of the authorities consider each element to be a metalloid, with qualified citations counted as one-half.
{{Periodic table (list of metalloid lists)}}
There is an average of 7.15 elements per metalloid list.

==Appearance frequency clusters==
[[File:Metalloid cluster frequencies.png|thumb|left|Clusters of elements and their appearance in the sources]]
Elements cited in the listed sources (as of August 2011; ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 194) have appearance frequencies that occur in clusters of comparable values. The diamonds in the graph mark the mean appearance frequency of each cluster. '''Cluster 1''' (93%)&amp;nbsp;= B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te; '''cluster 2''' (44%)&amp;nbsp;= Po, At; '''cluster 3''' (24%)&amp;nbsp;= Se; '''cluster 4''' (9%)&amp;nbsp;= C, Al; '''cluster 5''' (5%)&amp;nbsp;= Be, P, Bi; '''cluster 6''' (3%)&amp;nbsp;= Sn; and '''cluster 7''' (1%)&amp;nbsp;= H, Ga, S, I, Pb, Fl, Mc, Lv, Ts. The resulting geometric trend line has the formula y&amp;nbsp;= 199.47e&lt;sup&gt;−0.7423x&lt;/sup&gt; and an R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.9962.{{#tag:ref|The [[Coefficient of determination|R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] value is a measure of how close a formula fits a set of data points. Values fall between 0.0 and 1.0, with those near 1.0 indicating a good fit.|group=n}}{{clear}}

==Elements regarded as metalloids==
The elements commonly classified as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium.{{#tag:ref|Elements commonly classified as metalloids:

The status of polonium and astatine is not settled. Most authors recognise one or the other, or both, as metalloids; Herman, Hoffmann and Ashcroft, on the basis of relativistic modelling, predict astatine will be a monatomic metal.{{#tag:ref|Polonium and astatine:

{{Wiktionary}}

The '''past''' is the set of all [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] that occurred before a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=past |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/past |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictioary.com |accessdate=25 June 2018 |format=web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past is contrasted with and defined by the [[present]] and the [[future]]. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience [[time]], and is accessed through [[memory]] and [[recollection]]. In addition, human beings have [[recorded history|recorded the past]] since the advent of written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Christian |first1=David |title=Record Keeping and History: How We Chronicle the Past |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/agriculture-civilization/first-cities-appear/a/recordkeeping-and-history |website=www.khanacademy.org |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=25 June 2018 |format=web article}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the word "past" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the [[past participle]] of the [[middle english]] verb ''passen'' meaning "to pass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past |publisher=Merram-Webster.com |accessdate=24 July 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;



__TOC__


== Grammar ==
In [[Grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past ([[past]], [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future ([[future]], [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past tense refers to actions that have already happened. For example, "she is walking" refers to a girl who is currently walking (present tense), while "she walked" refers to a girl who was walking before now (past tense).

The past continuous tense refers to actions that continued for a period of time, as in the sentence "she was walking," which describes an action that was still happening in a prior window of time to which a speaker is presently referring. The past perfect tense is used to describe actions that were already completed by a specific point in the past. For example, "she had walked" describes an action that took place in the past and was also completed in the past.

The past perfect continuous tense refers to an action that was happening up until a particular point in the past but was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is different from the past perfect tense because the emphasis of past perfect continuous verbs is not on the action having been completed by the present moment, but rather on its having taken place actively over a time period before another moment in the past. The verb tense used in the sentence "She had been walking in the park regularly before I met her" is past perfect continuous because it describes an action ("walking") that was actively happening before a time when something else in the past was happening (when "I met her").

Depending on its usage in a sentence, "past" can be described using a variety of terms. [[Synonyms]] for "past" as an [[adjective]] include, "former," "bygone," "earlier," "preceding," and "previous." Synonyms for "past" as a [[noun]] include, "history, "background," "life story," and "biography." Synonyms of "past" as a [[preposition]] include, "in front of," "beyond," "by," and "in excess of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=past |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/thesaurus/past |website=oxforddictionaries.com |publisher=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Uses ==
The word "past" can also be used to describe the offices of those who have previously served in an organization, group, or event such as, "past president," or, "past champions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past?utm_campaign=sd&amp;utm_medium=serp&amp;utm_source=jsonld |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Past" can also refer to something or someone being at or in a position that is further than a particular point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=past |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/past |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |publisher=Cambridge.org |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the sentence, "I live on Fielding Road, just past the train station," the word "past" is used to describe a location (the speaker's residence) beyond a certain point (the train station). Alternatively, the sentence, "He ran past us at full speed," utilizes the concept of the past to describe the position of someone ("He") that is further than the speaker.

The "past" is also used to define a time that is a certain number of [[Minute|minutes]] before or after a particular [[hour]], as in "We left the party at half past twelve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past?utm_campaign=sd&amp;utm_medium=serp&amp;utm_source=jsonld |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also use "past" to refer to being beyond a particular [[biological age]] or phase of being, as in, "The boy was past the age of needing a babysitter," or, "I'm past caring about that problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past?utm_campaign=sd&amp;utm_medium=serp&amp;utm_source=jsonld |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "past" is commonly used to refer to history, either generally or with regards to specific time periods or events, as in, "Past monarchs had absolute power to determine the law in contrast to many European Kings and Queens of today."

Nineteenth-century British author [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Philip |title=Charles Dickens |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Dickens-British-novelist |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; created one of the best-known fictional [[personifications]] of the "past" in his short book, "[[A Christmas Carol]]." In the story, the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] is an apparition that shows the main character, a cold-hearted and tight-fisted man named [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], vignettes from his childhood and early adult life to teach him that joy does not necessarily come from wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=A Christmas Carol |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Christmas-Carol-novel |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of Study ==

'''Polymeric liquid crystals''' are similar to [[monomeric]] [[liquid crystal]]s used in [[Liquid crystal display|displays]]. Both have [[dielectric]] anitroscopy, or the ability to change directions and absorb or transmit light depending on [[electric field]]s. Polymeric liquid crystals form long head-to-tail or side chain [[polymer]]s, which are woven in thick mats and therefore have high [[Viscosity|viscosities]]. The high viscosities allow the polymeric liquid crystals to be used in complex structures, but they are harder to align, limiting their usefulness.  The polymerics align in microdomains facing all different directions, which ruins the [[optical effect]].  One solution to this is to mix in a small amount of photo-curing polymer, which when spin-coated onto a surface can be hardened. Basically, the polymeric liquid crystal and photocurer are aligned in one direction, and then the photo curer is cured, "freezing" the polymeric in one direction.

The '''Saturn IB''' (pronounced "one B", also known as the '''Uprated Saturn I''') was an American launch vehicle commissioned by the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) for the [[Apollo program]]. It replaced the [[S-IV]] second stage of the [[Saturn I]] with the much more powerful [[S-IVB]], able to launch a partially fueled [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) or a fully fueled [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) into [[low Earth orbit]] for early flight tests before the larger [[Saturn V]] needed for lunar flight was ready.

By sharing the S-IVB upper stage, the Saturn IB and Saturn V provided a common interface to the Apollo spacecraft. The only major difference was that the S-IVB on the Saturn V burned only part of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit, so it could be restarted for [[trans-lunar injection]]. The S-IVB on the Saturn IB needed all of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit.

The Saturn IB launched two unmanned CSM suborbital flights, one unmanned LM orbital flight, and the first manned CSM orbital mission (first planned as [[Apollo 1]], later flown as [[Apollo 7]]). It also launched one orbital mission, [[AS-203]], without a payload so the S-IVB would have residual [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel. This mission supported the design of the restartable version of the S-IVB used in the Saturn V, by observing the behavior of the liquid hydrogen in [[weightlessness]].

In 1973, the year after the Apollo lunar program ended, three Apollo CSM/Saturn IBs ferried crews to the [[Skylab]] space station. In 1975, one last Apollo/Saturn IB launched the Apollo portion of the joint US-[[Soviet Union|USSR]] [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP). A backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready for a Skylab rescue mission, but never flown.

The remaining Saturn IBs in NASA's inventory were scrapped after the ASTP mission, as no use could be found for them and all heavy lift needs of the US space program could be serviced by the cheaper and more versatile [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan III family]].

==History==
In 1959, NASA's [[Silverstein Committee]] issued recommendations to develop the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn class]] launch vehicles, growing from the [[Saturn I|C-1]]. When the [[Apollo program]] was started in 1961 with the goal of landing men on the Moon, NASA chose the Saturn I for Earth orbital test missions. However, the Saturn I's payload limit of {{convert|20000|lb|kg}} would allow testing of only the Command Module with a smaller propulsion module attached, as the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] would have a dry weight of at least {{convert|26300|lb|kg}}, in addition to service propulsion and reaction control fuel. In July 1962, NASA announced selection of the [[Saturn V|C-5]] for the lunar landing mission, and decided to develop another launch vehicle by upgrading the Saturn I, replacing its [[S-IV]] second stage with the [[S-IVB]], which would also be modified for use as the Saturn V third stage. The [[S-I]] first stage would also be upgraded to the S-IB by improving the thrust of its engines and removing some weight. The new Saturn IB, with a payload capability of at least {{convert|16000|kg|lb|order=flip}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Charles D. |last2=Faherty |first2=William Barnaby |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |date=1978 |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch17-3.html |chapter=The Apollo-Saturn IB Space Vehicle |access-date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; would replace the Saturn I for Earth orbit testing, allowing the Command/Service Module to be flown with a partial fuel load. It would also allow launching the {{convert|32000|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Excursion Module]] separately for unmanned and manned Earth orbital testing, before the Saturn V was ready to be flown. It would also give early development to the third stage.&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt;

On May 12, 1966, NASA announced the vehicle's name would be changed to the "Uprated Saturn I", at the same time the "Lunar Excursion Module" was renamed the Lunar Module. However, the "Uprated Saturn I" name was reverted to Saturn IB on December 2, 1967.&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt;

By the time it was developed, the Saturn IB payload capability had increased to {{convert|41000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt; By 1973, when it was used to launch three [[Skylab]] missions, the first-stage engine had been upgraded further, raising the payload capability to {{convert|46000|lb|kg}}.

==S-IB stage==
{{Main|S-IB}}
[[File:Saturn IB 1st stage.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Diagram of the S-IB first stage of the Saturn IB rocket]]

The S-IB stage was built by the [[Chrysler]] corporation at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=SIB_final_use/&gt; It was powered by eight [[Rocketdyne H-1]] rocket engines burning [[RP-1]] fuel with [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX). Eight [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] tanks (four holding fuel and four holding LOX) were clustered around a [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter rocket]] LOX tank. The four outboard engines were mounted on [[gimbal]]s, allowing them to be steered to control the rocket. Eight fins surrounding the base thrust structure provided aerodynamic stability and control.

==S-IVB-200 stage==
{{Main|S-IVB}}
[[File:Saturn S-IB SIV-B.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Diagram of the S-IVB second stage of the Saturn IB]]
The S-IVB was built by the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] at [[Huntington Beach, California]]. The S-IVB-200 model was similar to the S-IVB-500 third stage used on the [[Saturn V]], with the exception of the interstage adapter, smaller auxiliary propulsion control modules, and lack of on-orbit engine restart capability. It was powered by a single [[Rocketdyne J-2]] engine. The fuel and oxidizer tanks shared a common bulkhead, which saved about ten tons of weight and reduced vehicle length over ten feet.

==Instrument Unit==
{{Main|Saturn V Instrument Unit}}
[[File:IU-501 From Below.jpg|right|thumb|The Instrument Unit, which controlled the Saturn IB and Saturn V]]

[[IBM]] built the Instrument Unit at the Space Systems Center in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Located at the top of the S-IVB stage, it consisted of a Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC), an inertial platform, accelerometers, a tracking, telemetry and command system and associated environmental controls. It controlled the entire rocket from just before liftoff until battery depletion. Like other rocket guidance systems, it maintained its [[orbital state vectors|state vector]] (position and velocity estimates) by integrating accelerometer measurements, sent firing and steering commands to the main engines and auxiliary thrusters, and fired the appropriate ordnance and solid rocket motors during staging and payload separation events.

As with other rockets, a completely independent and redundant [[range safety]] system could be invoked by ground radio command to terminate thrust and to destroy the vehicle should it malfunction and threaten people or property on the ground. In the Saturn IB and V, the range safety system was permanently disabled by ground command after safely reaching orbit. This was done to ensure that the S-IVB stage would not inadvertently rupture and create a cloud of debris in orbit that could endanger the crew of the Apollo CSM.

==Saturn IB vehicles and launches==
[[File:ASTP Saturn IB.jpg|thumb|Saturn IB mounted on the "milkstool" platform]]

The first five Saturn IB launches for the Apollo program were made from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|LC-34]] and [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 37|LC-37]], [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]].

The Saturn IB was used between 1973 and 1975 for three manned [[Skylab]] flights, and one [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] flight. This final production run did not have alternating black and white S-IB stage tanks, or vertical stripes on the S-IVB aft tank skirt, which were present on the earlier vehicles. Since LC-34 and 37 were inactive by then, these launches utilized [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Kennedy Space Center's LC-39B]].&lt;ref name="West 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=David West|title=Kennedy Space Center: Gateway to Space|year=2006|publisher=Firefly Books Ltd.|location=Richmond Hill, Ontario|isbn=978-1-55407-039-8|pages=154–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile Launcher Platform 3|Mobile Launcher Platform]] No. 1 was modified, adding an elevated platform known as the "milkstool" to accommodate the height differential between the Saturn IB and the much larger Saturn V.&lt;ref name="West 2006" /&gt; This enabled alignment of the Launch Umbilical Tower's access arms to accommodate crew access, fueling, and ground electrical connections for the Apollo spacecraft and S-IVB upper stage. The tower's second stage access arms were modified to service the S-IB first stage.&lt;ref name="West 2006" /&gt;

In [[systems theory]], a [[system]] or a [[Process theory|process]] is in a '''steady state''' if the variables (called [[state variable]]s) which define the behavior of the system or the process are unchanging in time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=46-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[continuous time]], this means that for those properties ''p'' of the system, the [[partial derivative]] with respect to time is zero and remains so:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = 0 \quad \text{for all } t.&lt;/math&gt;
In [[discrete time]], it means that the [[first difference]] of each property is zero and remains so:
:&lt;math&gt;p_t-p_{t-1}=0 \quad \text{for all } t.&lt;/math&gt;
The concept of a steady state has relevance in many fields, in particular [[thermodynamics]], [[Steady state economy|economics]], and [[engineering]].  If a system is in a steady state, then the recently observed behavior of the system will continue into the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[stochastic]] systems, the probabilities that various states will be repeated will remain constant. See for example [[Linear difference equation#Conversion to homogeneous form]] for the derivation of the steady state.

In many systems, a steady state is not achieved until some time after the system is started or initiated. This initial situation is often identified as a [[transient state]], start-up or warm-up period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, while the flow of [[fluid]] through a tube or electricity through a network could be in a steady state because there is a constant flow of fluid or electricity, a tank being drained or filled with fluid is a system in transient state, because its volume of fluid changes with time. 

Often, a steady state is approached [[asymptotically]]. An unstable system is one that diverges from the steady state. See for example [[Linear difference equation#Stability]].

In [[chemistry]], a steady state is a more general situation than [[dynamic equilibrium]]. While a dynamic equilibrium occurs when two or more [[reversible reaction|reversible processes]] occur at the same rate, and such a system can be said to be in a steady state, a system that is in a steady state may not necessarily be in a state of dynamic equilibrium, because some of the processes involved are not reversible.

==Applications==

=== Economics ===
{{main|Steady state economy}}

A ''steady state economy'' is an economy (especially a national economy but possibly that of a city, a region, or the world) of stable size featuring a stable population and stable [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] that remain at or below [[carrying capacity]]. In the [[economic growth]] model of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Trevor Swan]], the steady state occurs when gross [[investment (macroeconomics)|investment]] in [[physical capital]] equals [[depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] and the economy reaches [[economic equilibrium]], which may occur during a period of growth.

=== Electronics ===
{{main|Steady state (electronics)}}

In electronics, ''steady state'' is an equilibrium condition of a circuit or network that occurs as the effects of [[Transient (electricity)|transients]] are no longer important.

Steady state determination is an important topic, because many design specifications of electronic systems are given in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Periodic steady-state solution is also a prerequisite for small signal dynamic modeling. Steady-state analysis is therefore an indispensable component of the design process.

In some cases, it is useful to consider [[constant envelope]] vibration—vibration that never settles down to motionlessness, but continues to move at constant amplitude—a kind of steady-state condition.

=== Chemical engineering ===
{{main|Steady state (chemistry)|Steady state (biochemistry)}}

In [[chemistry]], [[thermodynamics]], and other [[chemical engineering]], a ''steady state'' is a situation in which all [[thermodynamic variable|state variables]] are constant in spite of ongoing processes that strive to change them. For an entire system to be at steady state, i.e. for all state variables of a system to be constant, there must be a flow through the system (compare [[mass balance]]). One of the simplest examples of such a system is the case of a bathtub with the tap open but without the bottom plug: after a certain time the water flows in and out at the same rate, so the water level (the state variable being Volume) stabilizes and the system is at steady state.  Of course the Volume stabilizing inside the tub depends on the size of the tub, the diameter of the exit hole and the flowrate of water in.  Since the tub can overflow, eventually a steady state can be reached where the water flowing in equals the overflow plus the water out through the drain.

A steady state flow process requires conditions at all points in an apparatus remain constant as time changes.  There must be no accumulation of mass or energy over the time period of interest.  The same mass flow rate will remain constant in the flow path through each element of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=J. M. |last2=Van Ness |first2=H. C. |title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=2nd |year=1959 |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=34 |isbn=0-070-49486-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermodynamic properties may vary from point to point, but will remain unchanged at any given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zemansky |first=M. W. |last2=Van Ness |first2=H. C. |title=Basic Engineering Thermodynamics |year=1966 |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=244 |isbn=0-070-72805-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical engineering ===
{{main|Steady state (electronics)}}
Sinusoidal Steady State Analysis is a method for analyzing [[alternating current]] circuits using the same techniques as for solving DC circuits. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic/ee-ac-analysis/v/ee-ac-analysis-intro1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of an electrical machine or [[electric power system|power system]] to regain its original/previous state is called Steady State Stability.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/courses/Webcourse-contents/IIT-KANPUR/power-system/chapter_9/9_1.html#steady Power System Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stability of a system refers to the ability of a system to return to its steady state when subjected to a disturbance. As mentioned before, power is generated by synchronous generators that operate in synchronism with the rest of the system. A generator is synchronized with a bus when both of them have same [[frequency]], [[voltage]] and [[polyphase system|phase sequence]]. We can thus define the power system stability as the ability of the power system to return to steady state without losing synchronicity. Usually power system stability is categorized into '''Steady State, Transient and Dynamic Stability'''

Steady State Stability studies are restricted to small and gradual changes in the system operating conditions. In this we basically concentrate on restricting the bus voltages close to their nominal values. We also ensure that phase angles between two buses are not too large and check for the overloading of the power equipment and transmission lines. These checks are usually done using power flow studies.

Transient Stability involves the study of the power system following a major disturbance. Following a large disturbance in the synchronous alternator the machine power (load) angle changes due to sudden acceleration of the rotor shaft. The objective of the transient stability study is to ascertain whether the load angle returns to a steady value following the clearance of the disturbance.

The ability of a power system to maintain stability under continuous small disturbances is investigated under the name of Dynamic Stability (also known as small-signal stability). These small disturbances occur due random fluctuations in loads and generation levels. In an interconnected power system, these random variations can lead catastrophic failure as this may force the rotor angle to increase steadily.

=== Mechanical engineering ===

When a periodic force is applied to a mechanical system, it will typically reach steady state after going through some transient behavior. This is often observed in [[Vibration|vibrating]] systems, such as a [[Pendulum clock|clock pendulum]], but can happen with any type of [[Stability (disambiguation)#Engineering|stable]] or semi-stable dynamic system. The length of the transient state will depend on the initial conditions of the system. Given certain initial conditions a system may be in steady state from the beginning.

=== Physiology ===
{{main|Homeostasis}}

'''Homeostasis''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὅμοιος, ''hómoios'', "similar" and στάσις, ''stásis'', "standing still") is the property of a system that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable, constant condition. Typically used to refer to a living [[organism]], the concept came from that of [[milieu interieur]] that was created by [[Claude Bernard]] and published in 1865. Multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustment and regulation mechanisms make homeostasis possible.

===Fiber optics===
In [[fiber optics]], "steady state" is a synonym for [[equilibrium mode distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Theophil Joachim Heinrich Bienert was born in [[Kandava]], in the [[Courland Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Latvia]]), and studied in [[Jelgava]] to become an apothecary. In 1858 he moved to [[Tartu]] in present-day Estonia and worked there as an assistant to the head of the [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens|Botanical Garden]] there. In 1858-59 he participated in the [[Russian Geographical Society]]'s scientific expedition to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. He then stayed in Tartu until 1872, when he moved to [[Riga]] and took up a position at [[Riga Technical University]]. The [[genus]] ''Bienertia'' is named in honour of him by [[Alexander Bunge]].&lt;ref name="BBL"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bbld.de/0000000433684736/query/Theophil%20joachim/|title= Bienert, Theophil Joachim Heinrich|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |language= German|website= Baltisches Biographisches Lexikon digital|publisher= Baltischen Historischen Kommission|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry Holmes''' (December 1, 1846 &amp;ndash; April 20, 1933) — known as '''W.H. Holmes''' — was an American [[explorer]], [[anthropologist]], [[archaeologist]], [[artist]], [[scientific illustrator]], [[cartographer]], [[mountain climber]], [[geologist]] and [[museum]] curator and director.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
William Henry Holmes was born on a farm near Cadiz, in [[Harrison County, Ohio]], to Joseph and Mary Heberling Holmes on December 1, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton, "Biographical Memoir of William Henry Holmes, 1846-1933" (PDF). ''Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences'', vol. 17 - Tenth Memoir (PDF online facsimile at the NAS). "Bibliography" compiled by Ella Leary (Presented to the Academy at the Autumn meeting, 1935. ed.). Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences. {{ISSN|0077-2933}}. {{OCLC|37424036}}, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his forebears was the Rev. [[Obadiah Holmes]], who emigrated to Salem, Massachusetts in 1638.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Biography''. "Holmes, William Henry." New York: Scribner, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; William Henry Holmes graduated from the McNeely Normal School, Hopedale, Ohio in 1870 and afterwards briefly taught drawing, painting, natural history, and geology at the school.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William H. Goetzmann. ''William H. Holmes Panoramic Art''. Fort Worth, Tex.: Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 the school awarded him an honorary A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) degree.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1918, Holmes received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from [[The George Washington University]], Washington, D.C. for his work and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U. S. Geological Surveys===

====Hayden Survey====
In 1871, he went to Washington, D.C., to study art under [[Theodore Kaufmann]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; His talent soon came to the attention of the scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, notably [[Fielding Bradford Meek]], and Holmes was employed drawing and sketching fossil shells and shells of live mollusks.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, Holmes became an artist/topographer with the government survey of [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]],&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Thomas Moran]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stegner, ''Beyond the Hundredth Meridian''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; His first trip out West was to the newly established [[Yellowstone National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1870s, Holmes gained a national reputation as a scientific illustrator, cartographer, pioneering archaeologist, and geologist.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 224-237.&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the [[laccolith]] influenced [[Grove Karl Gilbert]]'s own work on the same.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Goetzmann. ''William H. Holmes Panoramic Art'' 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field, Holmes worked closely with the photographer [[William Henry Jackson|William H. Jackson]] and back in Washington he helped produce Hayden's great achievement, the ''Geological and Geographical Atlas of Colorado, And Portions of Adjacent Territory'' (1877, 1881).&lt;ref&gt;William H. Goetzmann. ''William H. Holmes Panoramic Art'' 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutton Survey====
After the [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871|Hayden Survey]] was absorbed into the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] in 1879, Holmes went to [[Munich]], Germany, to further his art studies under [[Frank Duveneck]] and to take lessons in "museum making" from Adolphe B. Meyer of Dresden's Anthropology Museum. On Holmes's return to the U.S., he was hired by the Geological Survey and assigned to [[Clarence Dutton]] as a geologist and illustrator. Holmes illustrated the atlas for Dutton's ''Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon District'' (1882); his triptych panorama of the Grand Canyon from Point Sublime is a masterpiece of American scientific illustration. He was also a noted mountain climber, and a peak in [[Yellowstone National Park]] — [[Mount Holmes]] — was named in his honor. In 1875, Holmes began studying the remains of the [[Ancestral Pueblo]] culture in the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] region of [[Utah]].  His models of ancient Indian ruins were a sensation at the [[Centennial International Exhibition]] in Philadelphia. Holmes became particularly interested in prehistoric [[pottery]] and [[animal shell|shell]] art, producing the published works of "''Art in Shell of the American Indians'' (1883)" and "''Pottery of the Ancient Pueblos (1886)''".  He expanded these studies to include [[textiles]], and he became well known as an expert in both ancient and existing arts produced by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the Southwest. In 1889 he discovered and reported [[Indian Cave Petroglyphs (Good Hope, West Virginia)|Indian petroglyphs in central West Virginia]].

===Smithsonian Institution===
Holmes left the [[United States Geological Survey|Geological Survey]] in 1889 to become an archaeologist with the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Bureau of American Ethnology]].  He left Washington temporarily, from 1894 to 1897, to serve as curator of anthropology at the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, during which time he led an expedition to Mexico.&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haskin |first1=Warren |title=The Allison V. Armour / William Henry Holmes 1895 Expedition to Mexico |url=https://www.archaeologybulletin.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/bha.11202/ |website=UCLA Institute of Archaeology |accessdate=23 July 2018 |quote=The foundation of the (UCLA Institute of Archaeology) Field Museum's reputation as a place where serious science is practiced was laid by Allison V. Armour and William Henry Holmes in 1895, a little more than a year after the Museum was established. Looking back after a career of almost 60 years as an anthropologist, and having twice been honored as the outstanding practitioner in the field, Holmes described the trip to Mexico (the only expedition he led during his brief tenure as the Museum's first Curator of Anthropology) as "one of the most gratifying and important events of my life." It was also one of the most important events in the history of anthropology at the Museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the Smithsonian in 1897 to serve as head curator of anthropology at the U.S. National Museum. From 1902 to 1909 he served as Chief (i.e. director) of the Bureau of American Ethnology, succeeding [[John Wesley Powell]]. During this period he studied the [[Etowah Indian Mounds]] of the [[Mississippian culture]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and in 1903, he published his ''Synthesis of Pottery''. In 1905, Holmes was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, he became chairman of the Division of Anthropology of the U.S.  National Museum. In 1920, Holmes became the director of [[National Gallery of Art]] (now the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]), where he assembled exhibits of Indian arts from the Northwest Coast.  He published many works on archæological and anthropological subjects.  He edited geological publications, including [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden|Hayden's]] ''Atlas of Colorado'' and the eleventh and twelfth reports of the [[United States Geological Survey|Geological Survey]].  His books include: "Handbook of Aboriginal American Antiquities" (1919).

===Later years===
Holmes lived with his son in Royal Oak, Michigan, upon his retirement in 1932 from the position of Director of the National Gallery of Art.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; He died April 20, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Swanton 1935, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In the year of his death, a memorial exhibition of ninety-two of Holmes' artworks was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art.&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by the Late William H. Holmes''. Washington, D.C.: Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teacher, his pupils included [[Susan Brown Chase]].&lt;ref name="susanbrownchaseantiquesandfineart.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/artists/bio.cfm?id=191515|title=Antiques &amp; Fine Art – Susan  Brown Chase – Biography|website=www.antiquesandfineart.com|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Of Holmes's many contributions and accomplishments, he is probably best known for the role he played in the controversy over the antiquity of humans in the Americas.  Holmes insisted that claims for the early presence of humans should be subjected to the most rigorous testing.  His position on this matter had a healthy and conservative influence on what is one of the most fundamental questions in American archaeology.
