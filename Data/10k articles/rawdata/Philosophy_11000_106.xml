It is the flagship Standard of the ANSI/ASIS PSC Standards Series which seek to operationalize the ICoC within a formal structure familiar to businesses. That structure, with both national and international supervision, provides auditable procedures for the development, certification, and monitoring of ongoing compliance. PSC.1 pushes the envelope with regard to business standards as the first to incorporate human rights requirements. The ICoC’s purpose was primarily to commit signatories to human rights principles regardless of whether they were so obligated by law. The PSC Standard Series takes that voluntary commitment a step further and requires companies, in order to be certified, to have adequately incorporated compliance with international human rights principles into their operating policies and procedures. The PSC.1 Standard is currently in the process of being converted into a full international Standard, ISO 18788."&lt;ref&gt;Ralby, Ian, “Accountability for Armed Contractors,” Fletcher Security Review Vol. 2 no.1, 12 January 2015 http://www.fletchersecurity.org/#!ralby/c1iu8 (accessed 18 December 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[software engineering]] and [[computer science]], '''abstraction''' is:

* the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colburn|first=Timothy|last2=Shute|first2=Gary|date=2007-06-05|title=Abstraction in Computer Science|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|journal=Minds and Machines|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=169–184|doi=10.1007/s11023-007-9061-7|issn=0924-6495}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] in the study of objects or [[System|systems]] in order to more closely attend to other details of interest&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Jeff|date=2007-04-01|title=Is abstraction the key to computing?|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1232743.1232745|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=50|issue=4|pages=36–42|doi=10.1145/1232743.1232745|issn=0001-0782}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is also very similar in nature to the process of [[generalization]];
* the [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]] [[concept]]-[[Object (philosophy)|objects]] which are created by keeping common features or attributes to various concrete objects or systems of study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; — the result of the process of abstraction.

[[Abstraction|Abstraction, in general]], is a fundamental concept to computer science and [[software development]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ben-Ari|first=Mordechai|date=1998-03-01|title=Constructivism in computer science education|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=274790.274308|journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|volume=30|issue=1|pages=257, 257–261|doi=10.1145/274790.274308|issn=0097-8418}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as '''modeling''' and is closely related to the concepts of ''[[theory]]'' and ''[[design]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comer|first=D. E.|last2=Gries|first2=David|last3=Mulder|first3=Michael C.|last4=Tucker|first4=Allen|last5=Turner|first5=A.

[[Conceptual model|Models]] can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of [[reality]].

Abstraction in computer science is also closely related to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction in mathematics]] due to their common focus on building abstractions as objects&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, but is also related to other notions of abstraction used in other fields [[Abstraction (art)|such as art]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Abstractions may also refer to vehicles, features, or rules of [[Computation|computational systems]] or [[Programming language|programming languages]] that carry or utilize features of or abstraction itself, such as:

* the process or feature of using [[Data type|data types]] to perform ''data abstraction'' to decouple usage of from working representations of [[Data structure|data structures]] within [[Computer program|programs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liskov|first=Barbara|last2=|first2=|date=1988-05-01|title=Keynote address - data abstraction and hierarchy|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=62138.62141|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|publisher=ACM|volume=23|pages=17–34,|doi=10.1145/62138.62141|isbn=0897912667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;;

==Rationale==
Computing mostly operates independently of the concrete world. The hardware implements a [[model of computation]] that is interchangeable with others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The software is structured in [[software architecture|architecture]]s to enable humans to create the enormous systems by concentrating on a few issues at a time. These architectures are made of specific choices of abstractions. [[Greenspun's Tenth Rule]] is an [[aphorism]] on how such an architecture is both inevitable and complex.

A central form of abstraction in computing is language abstraction: new artificial languages are developed to express specific aspects of a system. ''[[Modeling languages]]'' help in planning. ''[[Computer language]]s'' can be processed with a computer. An example of this abstraction process is the generational development of [[programming language]]s from the [[First-generation programming language|machine language]] to the [[Second-generation programming language|assembly language]] and the [[Third-generation programming language|high-level language]]. Each stage can be used as a stepping stone for the next stage. The language abstraction continues for example in [[scripting language]]s and [[domain-specific programming language]]s.

Within a programming language, some features let the programmer create new abstractions. These include [[subroutine]]s, [[module (programming)|modules]], [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], and [[software component]]s. Some other abstractions such as [[software design pattern]]s and [[software architecture#Architecture examples|architectural styles]] remain invisible to a [[translator (computing)|translator]] and operate only in the design of a system.

Some abstractions try to limit the range of concepts a programmer needs to be aware of, by completely hiding the abstractions that they in turn are built on. The software engineer and writer [[Joel Spolsky]] has criticised these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are ''[[leaky abstraction|leaky]]'' — that they can never completely hide the details below;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html|title=The Law of Leaky Abstractions|last1=Spolsky|first=Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this does not negate the usefulness of abstraction.

Some abstractions are designed to inter-operate with other abstractions - for example, a programming language may contain a [[foreign function interface]] for making calls to the lower-level language.

In simple terms, abstraction is removing irrelevant data so a program is easier to understand.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Language features==

===Programming languages===
{{Main|Programming language}}

Different programming languages provide different types of abstraction, depending on the intended applications for the language. For example:

* In [[object-oriented programming language]]s such as [[C++]], [[Object Pascal]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the concept of '''abstraction''' has itself become a declarative statement – using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s ''&lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;'' (in [[C++]]) or ''&lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;ref name="Oracle Java abstract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html|title=Abstract Methods and Classes|website=The Java™ Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''&lt;code&gt;interface&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;ref name="Oracle Java interface"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/interfaceAsType.html|title=Using an Interface as a Type|website=The Java™ Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). After such a declaration, it is the responsibility of the programmer to implement a [[Class (computer science)|class]] to instantiate the [[Object (computer science)|object]] of the declaration.
* [[Functional programming language]]s commonly exhibit abstractions related to functions, such as [[lambda abstraction]]s (making a term into a function of some variable) and [[higher-order function]]s (parameters are functions). &lt;!-- This has to be merged in the following sections. --&gt;
* Modern members of the Lisp programming language family such as [[Clojure]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Common Lisp]] support [[Macro (computer science)#Syntactic macros|macro systems]] to allow syntactic abstraction. Other programming languages such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] also have macros, or very similar [[metaprogramming]] features (for example, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] has [[Template Haskell]], and [[OCaml]] has [[MetaOCaml]]). These can allow a programmer to eliminate [[boilerplate code]], abstract away tedious function call sequences, implement new [[Control flow|control flow structures]], and implement [[Domain-specific language|Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)]], which allow domain-specific concepts to be expressed in concise and elegant ways. All of these, when used correctly, improve both the programmer's efficiency and the clarity of the code by making the intended purpose more explicit. A consequence of syntactic abstraction is also that any Lisp dialect and in fact almost any programming language can, in principle, be implemented in any modern Lisp with significantly reduced (but still non-trivial in some cases) effort when compared to "more traditional" programming languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

===Specification methods===
{{Main|Formal specification}}

Analysts have developed various methods to formally specify software systems.  Some known methods include:

* Abstract-model based method (VDM, Z);
* Algebraic techniques (Larch, CLEAR, OBJ, ACT ONE, CASL);
* Process-based techniques (LOTOS, SDL, Estelle);
* Trace-based techniques (SPECIAL, TAM);
* Knowledge-based techniques (Refine, Gist).

===Specification languages===
{{Main|Specification language}}

Specification languages generally rely on abstractions of one kind or another, since specifications are typically defined earlier in a project, (and at a more abstract level) than an eventual implementation. The [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] specification language, for example, allows the definition of ''abstract'' classes, which in a waterfall project, remain abstract during the architecture and specification phase of the project.

==Control abstraction==
{{Main|Control flow}}

Programming languages offer control abstraction as one of the main purposes of their use. Computer machines understand operations at the very low level such as moving some bits from one location of the memory to another location and producing the sum of two sequences of bits. Programming languages allow this to be done in the higher level. For example, consider this statement written in a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like fashion:

:&lt;code&gt;a := (1 + 2) * 5&lt;/code&gt;

To a human, this seems a fairly simple and obvious calculation (''"one plus two is three, times five is fifteen"''). However, the low-level steps necessary to carry out this evaluation, and return the value "15", and then assign that value to the variable "a", are actually quite subtle and complex. The values need to be converted to binary representation (often a much more complicated task than one would think) and the calculations decomposed (by the compiler or interpreter) into assembly instructions (again, which are much less intuitive to the programmer: operations such as shifting a binary register left, or adding the binary complement of the contents of one register to another, are simply not how humans think about the abstract arithmetical operations of addition or multiplication). Finally, assigning the resulting value of "15" to the variable labeled "a", so that "a" can be used later, involves additional 'behind-the-scenes' steps of looking up a variable's label and the resultant location in physical or virtual memory, storing the binary representation of "15" to that memory location, etc.

Without control abstraction, a programmer would need to specify ''all'' the register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted to add or multiply a couple of numbers and assign the result to a variable. Such duplication of effort has two serious negative consequences:

# it forces the programmer to constantly repeat fairly common tasks every time a similar operation is needed
# it forces the programmer to program for the particular hardware and instruction set

===Structured programming===
{{Main|Structured programming}}

Structured programming involves the splitting of complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control and interfaces between components, with reduction of the complexity potential for side-effects.

In a simple program, this may aim to ensure that loops have single or obvious exit points and (where possible) to have single exit points from functions and procedures.

In a larger system, it may involve breaking down complex tasks into many different modules. Consider a system which handles payroll on ships and at shore offices:

* The uppermost level may feature a menu of typical end-user operations.
* Within that could be standalone executables or libraries for tasks such as signing on and off employees or printing checks.
* Within each of those standalone components there could be many different source files, each containing the program code to handle a part of the problem, with only selected interfaces available to other parts of the program. A sign on program could have source files for each data entry screen and the database interface (which may itself be a standalone third party library or a statically linked set of library routines).
*Either the database or the payroll application also has to initiate the process of exchanging data with between ship and shore, and that data transfer task will often contain many other components.

These layers produce the effect of isolating the implementation details of one component and its assorted internal methods from the others. Object-oriented programming embraces and extends this concept.

==Data abstraction==
{{Main|Abstract data type}}

Data abstraction enforces a clear separation between the ''abstract'' properties of a [[data type]] and the ''concrete'' details of its implementation. The abstract properties are those that are visible to client code that makes use of the data type—the ''interface'' to the data type—while the concrete implementation is kept entirely private, and indeed can change, for example to incorporate efficiency improvements over time. The idea is that such changes are not supposed to have any impact on client code, since they involve no difference in the abstract behaviour.

For example, one could define an [[abstract data type]] called ''lookup table'' which uniquely associates ''keys'' with ''values'', and in which values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys. Such a lookup table may be implemented in various ways: as a [[hash table]], a [[binary search tree]], or even a simple linear [[List (computing)|list]] of (key:value) pairs. As far as client code is concerned, the abstract properties of the type are the same in each case.

Of course, this all relies on getting the details of the interface right in the first place, since any changes there can have major impacts on client code. As one way to look at this: the interface forms a ''contract'' on agreed behaviour between the data type and client code; anything not spelled out in the contract is subject to change without notice.

==Abstraction in object oriented programming==
{{Main|Object (computer science)}}

In [[object-oriented programming]] theory, '''abstraction''' involves the facility to define objects that represent abstract "actors" that can perform work, report on and change their state, and "communicate" with other objects in the system. The term [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] refers to the hiding of [[state (computer science)|state]] details, but extending the concept of ''data type'' from earlier programming languages to associate ''behavior'' most strongly with the data, and standardizing the way that different data types interact, is the beginning of '''abstraction'''.  When abstraction proceeds into the operations defined, enabling objects of different types to be substituted, it is called [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. When it proceeds in the opposite direction, inside the types or classes, structuring them to simplify a complex set of relationships, it is called [[Delegation (object-oriented programming)|delegation]] or [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]].

Various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction, all to support a general strategy of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in object-oriented programming, which includes the substitution of one [[type in object-oriented programming|type]] for another in the same or similar role. Although not as generally supported, a [[configuration in object-oriented programming|configuration]] or image or package may predetermine a great many of these [[name binding|bindings]] at [[compile-time]], [[link-time]], or [[loadtime]]. This would leave only a minimum of such bindings to change at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]].

[[Common Lisp Object System]] or [[Self (programming language)|Self]], for example, feature less of a class-instance distinction and more use of delegation for [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]]. Individual objects and functions are abstracted more flexibly to better fit with a shared functional heritage from [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]].

C++ exemplifies another extreme: it relies heavily on [[generic programming|templates]] and [[method overloading|overloading]] and other static bindings at compile-time, which in turn has certain flexibility problems.

Although these examples offer alternate strategies for achieving the same abstraction, they do not fundamentally alter the need to support abstract nouns in code - all programming relies on an ability to abstract verbs as functions, nouns as data structures, and either as processes.

Consider for example a sample [[Java (programming language)|Java]] fragment to represent some common farm "animals" to a level of abstraction suitable to model simple aspects of their hunger and feeding. It defines an &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; class to represent both the state of the animal and its functions:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public class Animal extends LivingThing
{
     private Location loc;
     private double energyReserves;

     public boolean isHungry() {
         return energyReserves &lt; 2.5;
     }
     public void eat(Food food) {
         // Consume food
         energyReserves += food.getCalories();
     }
     public void moveTo(Location location) {
         // Move to new location
         this.loc = location;
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
With the above definition, one could create objects of type &lt;tt&gt;Animal&lt;/tt&gt; and call their methods like this:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
thePig = new Animal();
theCow = new Animal();
if (thePig.isHungry()) {
    thePig.eat(tableScraps);
}
if (theCow.isHungry()) {
    theCow.eat(grass);
}
theCow.moveTo(theBarn);
&lt;/source&gt;
In the above example, the class ''&lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;'' is an abstraction used in place of an actual animal, ''&lt;code&gt;LivingThing&lt;/code&gt;'' is a further abstraction (in this case a generalisation) of ''&lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;''.

If one requires a more differentiated hierarchy of animals — to differentiate, say, those who provide milk from those who provide nothing except meat at the end of their lives — that is an intermediary level of abstraction, probably DairyAnimal (cows, goats) who would eat foods suitable to giving good milk, and MeatAnimal (pigs, steers) who would eat foods to give the best meat-quality.

Such an abstraction could remove the need for the application coder to specify the type of food, so s/he could concentrate instead on the feeding schedule. The two classes could be related using [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] or stand alone, and the programmer could define varying degrees of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] between the two types. These facilities tend to vary drastically between languages, but in general each can achieve anything that is possible with any of the others. A great many operation overloads, data type by data type, can have the same effect at compile-time as any degree of inheritance or other means to achieve polymorphism. The class notation is simply a coder's convenience.

===Object-oriented design===
{{Main|Object-oriented design}}

Decisions regarding what to abstract and what to keep under the control of the coder become the major concern of object-oriented design and [[domain analysis]]&amp;mdash;actually determining the relevant relationships in the real world is the concern of [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] or [[legacy analysis]].

In general, to determine appropriate abstraction, one must make many small decisions about scope (domain analysis), determine what other systems one must cooperate with (legacy analysis), then perform a detailed object-oriented analysis which is expressed within project time and budget constraints as an object-oriented design. In our simple example, the domain is the barnyard, the live pigs and cows and their eating habits are the legacy constraints, the detailed analysis is that coders must have the flexibility to feed the animals what is available and thus there is no reason to code the type of food into the class itself, and the design is a single simple Animal class of which pigs and cows are instances with the same functions. A decision to differentiate DairyAnimal would change the detailed analysis but the domain and legacy analysis would be unchanged&amp;mdash;thus it is entirely under the control of the programmer, and we refer to abstraction in object-oriented programming as distinct from abstraction in domain or legacy analysis.

==Considerations==
When discussing [[formal semantics of programming languages]], [[formal methods]] or [[abstract interpretation]], '''abstraction''' refers to the act of considering a less detailed, but safe, definition of the observed program behaviors. For instance, one may observe only the final result of program executions instead of considering all the intermediate steps of executions. Abstraction is defined to a '''concrete''' (more precise) model of execution.

Abstraction may be '''exact''' or '''faithful''' with respect to a property if one can answer a question about the property equally well on the concrete or abstract model. For instance, if we wish to know what the result of the evaluation of a mathematical expression involving only integers +, -, ×, is worth [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', we need only perform all operations modulo ''n'' (a familiar form of this abstraction is [[casting out nines]]).

Abstractions, however, though not necessarily '''exact''', should be '''sound'''. That is, it should be possible to get sound answers from them&amp;mdash;even though the abstraction may simply yield a result of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]]. For instance, we may abstract the students in a class by their minimal and maximal ages; if one asks whether a certain person belongs to that class, one may simply compare that person's age with the minimal and maximal ages; if his age lies outside the range, one may safely answer that the person does not belong to the class; if it does not, one may only answer "I don't know".

The level of abstraction included in a programming language can influence its overall [[usability]]. The [[Cognitive dimensions]] framework includes the concept of ''abstraction gradient'' in a formalism. This framework allows the designer of a programming language to study the trade-offs between abstraction and other characteristics of the design, and how changes in abstraction influence the language usability.

Abstractions can prove useful when dealing with computer programs, because non-trivial properties of computer programs are essentially [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] (see [[Rice's theorem]]). As a consequence, automatic methods for deriving information on the behavior of computer programs either have to drop termination (on some occasions, they may fail, crash or never yield out a result), soundness (they may provide false information), or precision (they may answer "I don't know" to some questions).

Abstraction is the core concept of [[abstract interpretation]]. [[Model checking]] generally takes place on abstract versions of the studied systems.

==Levels of abstraction==
{{Main|Abstraction layer}}

Computer science commonly presents ''levels'' (or, less commonly, ''layers'') of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but with varying amounts of detail. Each level uses a system of expression involving a unique set of objects and compositions that apply only to a particular domain.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Luciano Floridi]], [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/research_reports/ieg_rr221104.pdf ''Levellism and the Method of Abstraction'']
IEG – Research Report 22.11.04&lt;/ref&gt;
Each relatively abstract, "higher" level builds on a relatively concrete, "lower" level, which tends to provide an increasingly "granular" representation. For example, gates build on electronic circuits, binary on gates, machine language on binary, programming language on machine language, applications and operating systems on programming languages. Each level is embodied, but not determined, by the level beneath it, making it a language of description that is somewhat self-contained.

===Database systems===
{{Main|Database management system}}

Since many users of database systems lack in-depth familiarity with computer data-structures, database developers often hide complexity through the following levels:

[[Image:Data abstraction levels.png|thumb|Data abstraction levels of a database system]]

'''Physical level:''' The lowest level of abstraction describes ''how'' a system actually stores data. The physical level describes complex low-level data structures in detail.

'''Logical level:''' The next higher level of abstraction describes ''what'' data the database stores, and what relationships exist among those data. The logical level thus describes an entire database in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures. Although implementation of the simple structures at the logical level may involve complex physical level structures, the user of the logical level does not need to be aware of this complexity. This is referred to as [[physical data independence]]. [[Database administrator]]s, who must decide what information to keep in a database, use the logical level of abstraction.

'''View level:''' The highest level of abstraction describes only part of the entire database. Even though the logical level uses simpler structures, complexity remains because of the variety of information stored in a large database. Many users of a database system do not need all this information; instead, they need to access only a part of the database. The view level of abstraction exists to simplify their interaction with the system. The system may provide many [[view (database)|view]]s for the same database.

===Layered architecture===
{{Main|Abstraction layer}}
The ability to provide a [[design]] of different levels of abstraction can

* simplify the design considerably
* enable different role players to effectively work at various levels of abstraction
* support the portability of [[software artifact]]s (model-based ideally)

[[Systems design]] and [[Business process modeling|business process design]] can both use this. Some [[Software modeling|design processes]] specifically generate designs that contain various levels of abstraction.

Layered architecture partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers).
It is a technique used in designing computer software, hardware, and communications in which system or network components are isolated in layers so that changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others.

'''Alcuin of York''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|w|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/alcuin "Alcuin", Oxford dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus}}; {{circa}} 735 – 19 May 804 AD)—also called '''Ealhwine''', '''Alhwin''' or '''Alchoin'''—was an English scholar, clergyman, poet and teacher from [[York]], [[Northumbria]]. He was born around 735 and became the student of [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Archbishop Ecgbert]] at York. At the invitation of [[Charlemagne]], he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian court]], where he remained a figure in the 780s and '90s.

Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was made Abbot of [[Tours]] in 796, where he remained until his death. "The most learned man anywhere to be found", according to [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni|Life of Charlemagne]]''&lt;ref&gt;Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', §25.&lt;/ref&gt; (''ca.'' 817-833), he is considered among the most important architects of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

==Biography==

===Background===
[[File:AT 13763 Roof figures at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna-8.jpg|thumb|upright|Alcuin, roof figure, Museum of History of Arts, Vienna.]]
Alcuin was born in [[Northumbria]], presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.&lt;ref name="Bullough, Alcuin, p. 164"&gt;Bullough 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In common hagiographical fashion, the ''Vita Alcuini'' asserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,' and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint [[Willibrord]]; and Beornred, abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens, who was more distantly related.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165"&gt;Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Life'' of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a ''paterfamilias'', had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [[Humber]], which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing ''paterfamilias'' ("head of a family, householder") usually referred to a [[churl|ceorl]], [[Donald A. Bullough]] suggests that Alcuin's family was of [[churl|cierlisc]] status: ''i.e.,'' free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2003, pp. 146–7, 165"/&gt; If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [[Deira]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullough 2003, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===York===
The young Alcuin came to the [[cathedral church]] of [[York]] during the golden age of Archbishop [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgbert]] and his brother, the Northumbrian King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.&lt;ref name=RenewAmerica&gt;{{cite web|title=A cure for the educational crisis: Learn from the extraordinary educational heritage of the West |work=RenewAmerica analyst |url=http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |accessdate=2 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602171225/http://www.renewamerica.us/analyses/060601hutchison.htm |archivedate=2 June 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines,&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01276a.htm Burns, James. "Alcuin." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 29 Nov. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; writing a [[codex]] on the trivium, while his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium.

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.

In 781, King [[Ælfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Alcuin, Charlemagne, and the problem of sanctions|first=Henry|last=Mayr-Harting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VwK6qHH81oC&amp;pg=PA207|pages=207–218|title=Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald|series=Studies in Early Medieval Britain|editor-first=Stephen David|editor-last=Baxter|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=9780754663317}}. P.&amp;nbsp;207: "Charlemagne met Alcuin – for the second time – at Parma in 781".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Story (2005) reports that Alcuin had previously been sent to Charlemagne by Ethelbert: {{citation|title=Charlemagne: Empire and Society|first=Joanna|last=Story|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780719070891|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTbvq_8HFPUC&amp;pg=PA137}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlemagne===
Alcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], Rado, and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write that "the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles."

Alcuin became Master of the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] (''Urbs Regale'') in 782.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]] and, most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.

In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, "Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe." His arguments seem to have prevailed – Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Dr. N.R., ''Two Thousand Years of Christ's Power, Part Two: The Middle Ages'', Grace Publications, 2000, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.&lt;ref name=wilmot&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilmot-Buxton|first=E.M.|title=Alcuin|year=1922|publisher=P.J. Kenedy &amp; Sons|location=New York|page=93|url=https://archive.org/stream/alcuin__00wilm#page/92/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Jaegar, ''Enobling love: in search of a lost sensibility'' (University of Pennsylvania, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king’s esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia===
In 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Liébana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]], an [[heresiarch]] according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[Æthelred I of Northumbria|Æthelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.

He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and to [[Æthelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, dealing with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, ''De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii'', provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: "''Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments''."

===Tours and death===
In 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful [[Carolingian minuscule]] script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcuin "Alcuin", ''Ecyclopedia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:
{{quote|Dust, worms, and ashes now&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt; Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,&lt;br /&gt; Pray, reader, for my soul.}}

The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. There are also autobiographical sections in Alcuin's poem on York and in the ''Vita Alcuini'', a ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' written for him at Ferrières in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.

==Carolingian Renaissance figure and legacy==

===Mathematician===
{{Main|Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes}}
The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled ''Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes'' ("Problems to Sharpen Youths")&lt;ref name="propositiones"&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/X/LAT0602.HTM The first few problems of Alcuin's on original Latin] (English: ''Problems to sharpen the young'',  proper title ''Propositiones Alcuini Doctoris Caroli Magni Imperatoris ad Acuendes Juvenes''—''Propositions of Alcuin, A Teacher of Emperor Charlemagne, for Sharpening Youths'')&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.&lt;ref name="Peterson-2005"&gt;[http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_11_21_05.html Ivars Peterson's MathTrek Nov 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson-2005"&gt;Atkinson, L. 2005. 'When the Pope was a mathematician'. ''College Mathematics Journal'' '''36''' (November): 354–362&lt;/ref&gt; In a 799 letter to Charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent "certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness,"&lt;ref&gt;''Epistola'' 172, MGH ''Epistolae'' 4.2: 285: "aliquas figuras arithmeticae subtilitatis laetitiae causa"&lt;/ref&gt; which some scholars have identified with the ''Propositiones.''&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Hélène Jullien and Françoise Perelman, eds., Clavis scriptorum latinorum medii aevi: Auctores Galliae 735–987. Tomus II: Alcuinus. Turnhout: Brepols, 1999, 482–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A more skeptical attitude toward Alcuin's authorship of this text and others is taken by Michael Gorman, "Alcuin Before Migne," ''Revue bénédictine'' 112 (2002); 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [[river crossing problem|river crossings]], including the [[Jealous husbands problem|problem of three anxious brothers]], each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled&lt;ref name="3-brothers"&gt;[http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/alcuin.pdf Latin title and English text of the problem]&lt;/ref&gt; (Problem 17); the [[Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle|problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage]] (Problem 18); and the problem of "the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults" (Problem 19). [[Alcuin's sequence]] is the solution to one of the problems of that book.

===Literary influence===
Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the [[Carolingian minuscule]] based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to [[Charlemagne]]. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulf, the Visigoth]] is preponderant.

Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work – a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. These are written in the form of [[dialogues]], and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', and commentaries on the Bible.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lettersofalcuin00pageuoft#page/14/mode/2up Page, Rolph Barlow. ''The Letters of Alcuin'', p.15, New York 1909]&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [[question mark]], though it didn't resemble the modern symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Truss. ''Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves'', 2003. p. 76. {{ISBN|1-59240-087-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''.

=== Use of homo-erotic language in writings ===
According to David Clark, passages in some of Alcuin's writings display homosocial desire, even possibly homoerotic imagery. However, Clark says it is not possible to determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceA"&gt;David Clark, ''Between Medieval Men: Male Friendship and desire in early medieval english''&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John Boswell]]&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "ReferenceB"&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Bromell | title = Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History | place = London | year = 2000 | publisher = Wotherspoon and Aldrich}}.&lt;/ref&gt; cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized [[homosexual]] feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times "comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires", and this reflects the erotic subculture of the [[Carolingian]] monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where "erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated”.&lt;ref&gt;Lynda L Coon, ''Dark bodies: gender and monastic practice in the early medieval west'' (University of Pennsylvania, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Erotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently "eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends”. Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though David Bromell is of the opinion that Alcuin's relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Alcuin was a close friend of Charlemagne's sister [[Gisela, Abbess of Chelles]], whom he "hailed as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5kABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Gisela,+Abbess+of+Chelles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ugSmeY784T&amp;sig=cxjv-k5bRWPfhYf5XI1AwzW_YPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv0YbHjIbbAhUSON8KHavrBRU4FBDoAQhCMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Gisela%2C%20Abbess%20of%20Chelles&amp;f=false Dales, Douglas. ''Alcuin: His Life and Legacy'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 2012, {{ISBN|9780227173466}} p. 90]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrudis and Bertha that "the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me."{{sfn|Dales, p. 91}} His nickname for Gisela was ''Julia'', for Rotrudis ''Columba''. He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.{{sfn| Dales, p. 91}}

The interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]],&lt;ref&gt;Allen J. Frantzen, ''Before the Closet'', University of Chicago, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;But also Stephen Jaegar, "L'amour des rois", ''Annales 46'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by [[Theodulf of Orleans]]. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia at the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.&lt;ref&gt;Liersch, Karl: [http://www.mgh.de/bibliothek/opac/?wa72ci_url=/cgi-bin/mgh/regsrchindex.pl?wert%3Dgedichte+theodulfs,+bischofs+von+orleans&amp;recnums=195542&amp;index=1&amp;db=opac Die Gedichte Theodulfs, Bischofs von Orleans], Halle, 1880, p. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say "the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship - 'an ordained affection'."&lt;ref&gt;Dales, Douglas, and Williams, Rowan. "The Poet at Work", ''Alcuin: Theology and Thought'', James Clarke &amp; Co, 2013, {{ISBN|9780227900871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for "sinning against nature with men" — a view commonly held by the Church at the time. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be "withered by flames unto eternal barrenness."&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin, "Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin", J.-P. Migne, ed., ''[https://archive.org/stream/patrologiaecurs171unkngoog#page/n276/mode/2up Patrologiae Cursus Completus]'', Vol. 100, col. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In several churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], Alcuin is celebrated on 20 May, the first available day after the day of his death (as [[Dunstan]] is celebrated on 19 May).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchintouraine.org/?page_id=2|title=Why Alcuin – Church in Touraine|website=www.churchintouraine.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcuin College]], one of the [[colleges of the University of York]], England, is named after him.

'''M. Ali Lakhani''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|QC}} (born 1955) is a [[writer]], [[lawyer]], and [[editing|editor]] whose works focus on metaphysics and the perennial principles found in the wisdom traditions of the world.

He is married to Nazlin N. Lakhani and lives in Vancouver, Canada.

==Biography==
Born in England in 1955, Lakhani was educated at [[The King's School, Canterbury]] before receiving his undergraduate and graduate degrees in law from [[Cambridge University]]. He immigrated to [[Vancouver]] in 1973, and was called to the Bar in British Columbia in 1979. He practises law in Vancouver as a trial lawyer. In 2015, he was conferred the designation of "Queen's Counsel" by the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia to recognize his work as a lawyer.

In 1998, he founded the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] journal, ''Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity''. The bi-annual journal has included contributions by many leading traditionalists including [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Ananda K. Coomaraswamy]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Huston Smith]], and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/features/influential/story.html?id=e7c194cf-207c-45c0-92ed-bfbf1e9b7501 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527130327/http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/features/influential/story.html?id=e7c194cf-207c-45c0-92ed-bfbf1e9b7501 |archive-date=2010-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Lakhani was invited to address the International Congress on Imam 'Ali in [[Iran]] where he presented his essay on ''The'' ''Metaphysics of Human Governance''. This essay garnered the First Prize in English at the conferences and awarded at a special ceremony in Tehran in March 2002. A revised version of this essay is included in ''The Sacred Foundations of Justice in Islam''. The anthology has been described by Professo [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], as "among the best writings on this extraordinary figure in Western languages and are obligatory reading for anyone interested in ‘Ali but not familiar with Islamic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/uploads/books/163.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Sacred Foundations of Justice in Islam : The Teachings of Ali ‘ibn Abi Talib|website=Worldwisdom.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, at the invitation of the Temenos Academy, Lakhani presented a talk at the Royal Asiatic Society in London, England, titled ‘The Integral Vision of the Aga Khan’. The talk focused on a question asked by the Aga Khan in 2006: "How, in an increasingly cynical time, can we inspire people to a new set of aspirations - reaching beyond rampant materialism, the new relativism, self-serving individualism, and resurgent tribalism?"

Lakhani's book, ''Faith and Ethics: The Vision of the Ismaili Imamat'' was published by I.B. Tauris in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies in 2018. The book examines how the ideas and actions of the current Ismaili Imam, and fourth Aga Khan, Prince Karim al-Husseini, provide an Islamic response to the challenges that face Muslims in the modern era. The book provides an extensive survey of the Aga Khan's aspirations, showing how the values of integrity and dignity are at the forefront of his work, with the traditional Muslim concepts of cosmopolitanism and social justice guiding his response to the stark challenges of the modern age.

'''Apache SINGA''' is an Apache Incubating project for developing an open source machine learning library. It provides a flexible architecture for scalable distributed training, is extensible to run over a wide range of hardware, and has a focus on health-care applications.

== History ==
The [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/singa/ SINGA project] was initiated by the [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dbsystem/index.html DB System Group] at National University of Singapore in 2014, in collaboration with the database group of Zhejiang University. It focused on distributed deep learning by partitioning the model and data onto nodes in a cluster and parallelize the training.&lt;ref name="singaopen-mm15"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tan|first2=Kian-Lee|last3=Sheng|first3=Wang|last4=Wang|first4=Wei|last5=Cai|first5=Qingchao|last6=Chen|first6=Gang|last7=Gao|first7=Jinyang|last8=Luo|first8=Zhaojing|last9=Tung|first9=Anthony K.

== Software Stack ==
SINGA's software stack includes three major components, namely, core, IO and model. The following figure illustrates these components together with the hardware. The core component provides memory management and tensor operations; IO has classes for reading (and writing) data from (to) disk and network; The model component provides data structures and algorithms for machine learning models, e.g., layers for neural network models, optimizers/initializer/metric/loss for general machine learning models.

'''Biological determinism of human gender roles''' is the view that human sexuality is [[genetic determinism|controlled by an individual's genes]] or some component of their [[physiology]]. This is an aspect of [[biological determinism]], the wider view that human behaviour is determined by biological factors. Both views regard the contribution of learning and other environmental factors in a person's development as being over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Taylor A. | editor-first1 = Verta | editor-last2 = Rupp | editor-first2 = Leila J. | editor-last3 = Whittier | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Feminist frontiers | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6WMkQEACAAJ | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 9780078026621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naiman | first = Joanne | title = How societies work: class, power, and change | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=diypPAAACAAJ | publisher = Fernwood Publishing | location = Halifax, Winnipeg | year = 2012 | edition = 5th | isbn = 9781552664810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of human gender roles==

===Gender assignment===
Lynda Birke's ''In Pursuit of Difference'' argues that the discipline of human biology often presents "clear-cut differences"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birke | first = Lynda | chapter = In pursuit of difference: scientific studies of women and men | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KgcpAAAAYAAJ | title = Feminism and the biological body | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780813528236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between sexes with regards to chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance. However, while obvious physical differences between males and females exist and develop during puberty, hormonal differences are "not absolute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality | work = [[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]|publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] | location = Australia|date=3 June 2015|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a broad range of reproductive anatomy that doesn't necessarily fit the "gender definition" of male or female. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "a person may be born with mosaic genetics", differing in their chromosomal configuration.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Home page | url = http://www.isna.org | website = isna.org | publisher = [[Intersex Society of North America]] |access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{main|Biology and sexual orientation|Neuroscience and sexual orientation}}

Though scientists are unsure as to whether [[homosexuality]] can be attributed to biological or social factors, [[LGBT]] rights activists have used the theories of biological determinism to support their cause. This has become a frequent point of dissension between [[pro-gay]] individuals and [[anti-gay]] individuals. Due to the fact that a single cause has not been determined as the cause of homosexuality, many scholars theorize that a combination of biological and social causes determine one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abramson | first1 = Paul R. | last2 = Pinkerton | first2 = Steven D. | author-link1 = Paul R. Abramson | chapter = Introduction: Nature, nurture, and in-between | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5SUFxfft7zMC&amp;pg=PA4 | title = Sexual nature, sexual culture | page = 4 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780226001821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay rights advocates]] believe that proving that homosexuality has a definite biological basis will prove it to be an unchangeable characteristic, thus allowing homosexuals to be protected under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brookey | first = Robert Alan | title = Bio-rhetoric, background beliefs and the biology of homosexuality | journal = [[Argumentation and Advocacy]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | date = 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research that has been a valuable tool for gay rights activists has been [[Dean Hamer]]'s work studying the "[[Biology and sexual orientation#Chromosome linkage studies|gay gene]]". Another researcher who worked with Hamer in finding evidence for biological influence in male homosexuality was [[Simon LeVay]], a neuroscientist. In 1991, LeVay published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that detailed the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men. His findings in studying the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] implied that "sexual orientation has a biological substrate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spanier | first = Bonnie | title = Biological determinism and homosexuality | journal = [[NWSA Journal]], special issue: Sexual Orientation | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Spring 1995 | jstor = 4316378 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his research showed that there was a biological basis in sexual orientation, LeVay cautioned against people interpreting his article to say that he found that homosexuality is genetic, emphasizing that he did not "locate a gay center in the brain—[as] INAH3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons|first=David|title=Sex and the brain|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw|work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994 | access-date =9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He merely hoped that his work would serve as a catalyst in working towards finding more evidence that homosexuality is at least partly genetic.

===Social construction===
{{main|Social construction of gender}}
{{POV check|section|date=April 2017|talk=Social construction}}

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]] were interested in the way that biological determinism was present in science. They wanted to figure out how much of it was true, and how much of it was socially constructed according to certain beliefs and societal norms and determined gender roles within society. In their book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' they explore the possibilities of biological determinism. In their studies, they found some very interesting evidence that points to the fact that biological determinism in science is actually greatly affected by certain norms and tendencies within society. According to them, biological determinism is more constructed by society than by anything else. In a study that was performed on girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]", biological determinists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fit into the common definition of it, such as clothing preference or using makeup. Although these scientists believed that they were providing evidence to support their definitions of femininity within nature, they fell into the trap of labeling these girls according to Western social standards. As Lewontin points out, this experiment not only embraces the stereotypes that already existed, but it also "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin realize that biological determinism is clouded and, can in fact, be shaped according to the standards and norms of the society one lives in. Therefore, they choose to take a different approach. They decide to look at numbers and statistics instead of simple social experiments which can be easily misinterpreted. When they look at the numbers and statistics of men and women over the years, they discover that the differences between men and women are no longer as pronounced as they had been in the past. All of a sudden, there are more women in the work place holding higher ranking jobs. More women are excelling in areas that used to be male dominant, such as sports. And, even biologically, women are beginning to catch up to men in height while men are beginning to catch up in life expectancy. However, these changes are mostly visible in numbers and statistics, and social differences between men and women are still easily observed. Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin argue, however, that these differences are imposed by society itself.

The [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model]] for the difference between sex/gender states that there is a clear-cut dichotomy between males &amp; females, with no overlap. [[Margaret W. Rossiter]]’s article “Women’s Work in Science” discusses how in the 1880s women were introduced to the science field and hired, but although employed they were still segregated from men in the science field.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rossiter | first = Margaret W. | title = "Women's Work" in Science, 1880-1910 | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 381&amp;ndash;398 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.2307/230118 | jstor = 230118 | date = September 1980 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/230118 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rossiter, segregation started because it was apparent that men and women worked differently and had different "talents" to offer in the field of science.&lt;ref name="Rossiter" /&gt; To add to this, women in the 1880s got paid less than the male worker in the science field. Women got paid an average of "two hundred dollars less" than their male coworkers yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jardins | first = Julie | chapter = To embrace or decline marriage and family: Annie Jump Cannon and the women of the Harvard Observatory, 1880-1940 | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HULGDNDSenYC&amp;pg=PA92 | title = The Madame Curie complex: the hidden history of women in science | page = 92 | publisher = Feminist Press at the City University of New York | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781558616134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this norm there is a historically constructed viewpoint of "average", meaning that society holds the idea that one must be either male or female, feminine or masculine. [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s article "''[[Sexing the Body|Of Gender and Genitals]]''" discusses how this standard model shapes doctors' ideas about gender and what is socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | chapter = Of gender and genitals: the use and abuse of the modern intersexual | chapterurl = https://libcom.org/files/Fausto-Sterling%20-%20Sexing%20the%20Body.pdf | title = Sexing the body | pages = 44&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 9780465077144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that (according to the standard model) "Bodies in the "normal" range are culturally intelligible as males or females, but the rules for living as male or female are strict", meaning that people are culturally "trained" in believing that there is a sexual binary and anything outside of those confines is rejected.

'''Charles Wade Mills''' is a Jamaican philosopher, having been born there in 1951. He is known for his work in social and [[political philosophy]], particularly in oppositional political theory as centered on class, gender, and race. Mills is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center, City University of New York]], in New York City.

==Education and career==

{{strong|Choiceless awareness}} is posited in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[spirituality]] to be the state of unpremeditated, complete [[awareness]] of the [[present]] without [[preference]], effort, or compulsion. The term was popularized in mid-20th century by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], in whose philosophy it signifies a main theme. Similar or related concepts had been previously developed in several religious or spiritual traditions; the term or others like it has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary [[Secularity|secular]] and religious [[meditation]] practices. By {{nobr|early 21st century,}} choiceless awareness as a concept or term had appeared in a variety of fields, including in [[neuroscience]], [[therapy]], sociology, and in art. However, Krishnamurti's approach of the subject was unique, and differs from both prior and later notions.

==Jiddu Krishnamurti==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti to Himself]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
Choiceless awareness is a major topic in the exposition of [[India]]n philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895{{en dash}}1986).{{r|rv2001}} Beginning in the 1930s, he often commented on the subject, which became a recurring theme in his work.{{r|jk-ca}} He is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the concept.{{r|jk-ca-spread}}

Krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of [[choice]] indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness{{spaced en dash}}the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict.{{r|jk-choice}}

He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness;{{nnbsp}}{{r|hr1996-p49}} in his view application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessness{{spaced en dash}}just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-habit}} additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply. According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations.{{r|jk-ca-inhibit}} For true choicelessness to be realized, choice{{spaced en dash}}implicit or explicit{{spaced en dash}}has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, the ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but implies the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or [[Psychology of self|self as a psychological entity]]. Krishnamurti proposed that such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: [[identity (social science)|identity]] is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention.{{r|jk-attention}} Therefore, he asserted that choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called "observation without the observer".{{r|jk-no-observer}}

Accordingly, Krishnamurti advised against following any [[doctrine]], discipline, teacher, [[guru]], or authority, including himself.{{r|jk-no-authority}} He also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience, which he considered integral parts of the observer.{{r|jk1975-p19}} He denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques and methods, but not of meditation itself, which he called "perhaps the greatest" art in life;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk1975-p116}} and stated that insight into choiceless awareness could be shared through open dialogue.{{r|pk2008-p970}}

Krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others, influential [[Hindu]] [[Index of religious honorifics and titles#Teachers|spiritual teacher]] [[Ramana Maharshi]] (1879{{en dash}}1950){{nnbsp}}{{r|ao1996-p70}} and, following wide publication of his books,{{r|jk-books}} they attracted the attention of psychologists and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] in the 1950s;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-psych}} in subsequent decades Krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field.{{r|ml2003-pp206}} His views on the subject have been included in [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scholarly papers]] on [[existential therapy]],{{r|cf2005-p316}} [[education theory]],{{r|dl2014-pp357}} and [[Peace and conflict studies|peace research]],{{r|ljf1994}} but they have also been discussed in less formal or structured settings.{{r|jk-informal}}

In late{{nbsp}}1980, almost half a century after he started discussing it, Krishnamurti included the concept in "The Core of Krishnamurti's Teaching", a pivotal statement of his philosophy: "Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.{{"-}}{{r|jk1980-par3|jk-more}}

==Other representations==
In contrast with Krishnamurti's approach, other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness (or related ideas and terms) as part, or as the hoped-for result, of specific [[Methodology|methodologies]] and meditation techniques.{{r|methodologies}} Similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts,{{r|ca-similar}} and also within secular disciplines such as [[psychotherapy]],{{r|cg2013-p16}} rehabilitation medicine,{{r|c&amp;s2011-ch10}} and counseling.{{r|kcp2010-ho2.8}} Choiceless awareness has been examined within the context of [[philosophy of perception]] and behavior,{{r|ad2006-pp39}} while studies have cited its possible role in [[job performance]].{{r|job-studies}} Other studies have linked meditation based on the concept (among others), with [[Biological neural network|neural activity]] consistent with increased attentiveness, considered a factor of well-being and happiness.{{r|mind-studies}}

One term that is often used as a near-[[synonym]] is [[mindfulness]], which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness.{{r|mindfulness}} Initially part of [[Sati (Buddhism)|Buddhist meditation practice]], it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary [[Mindfulness#Psychology|psychological treatment]],{{r|cg2013-p82}} and has been applied as a component of [[integrative medicine]] programs.{{r|uwh}}

Kindred themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices (such as [[Vipassanā]]) associated with the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jkz2011-pp289}} and also in 20th-century offshoots such as the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].{{r|rhs2013}} Within these and similar fields, for example the [[Shikantaza]] practice in [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]],{{r|ms2004-pp76}} choiceless (or effortless) awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of practice.{{r|practice}}

The concept has been included in the discourse of [[transpersonal]] philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] (b. 1949),{{r|kw1988-pp155}} and also of independent Indian spiritual teacher [[Rajneesh|Osho (Rajneesh)]] (1931{{en dash}}1990).{{r|osho}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa]] (1939{{en dash}}1987), who engaged in dialogue with Krishnamurti,{{r|jk1996-ch?}} used the term to describe the experience of shunyata ([[Śūnyatā]]){{spaced en dash}}in [[Sanskrit]], "emptiness", or "ego-less perception".{{r|ct1994-ch3}}

Among other fields, the term has appeared in [[dispute resolution]] theory and practice,{{r|lr2006}} and has found application in artistic endeavors. In [[dramatic theory]], [[Theatre criticism|theater criticism]],{{r|rl1970}} and [[acting]],{{r|se2010}} it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts; it has additionally appeared in music works.{{r|sm1978-a2}} Author [[J. D. Salinger]] (1919{{en dash}}2010), who was interested in spirituality and alternative religions, was reputedly an adherent of Ramana Maharshi's ideas on choiceless awareness.{{r|ek2010}}

Contrary to press reports published in mid-20th-century,{{r|toi1954}} later interest in practices related to, or influenced by, choiceless awareness, has resulted in unambiguously favorable mentions in the [[Mass media|popular press]].{{r|pop-press}} Additionally, [[mass market]] general interest titles covering the subject have been published.{{r|sa2015-pp110}}

{{Refimprove|article|date=January 2008}}

'''Cognitivism''' is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s and can therefore be [[truth value|true or false]] (they are [[truth-apt]]), which [[non-cognitivism|noncognitivists]] deny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/ | title=Moral Cognitivism vs. Non-Cognitivism | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivism is so broad a thesis that it encompasses (among other views) [[moral realism]] (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions about mind-independent facts of the world), [[ethical subjectivism]] (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions about peoples' attitudes or opinions), and [[error theory]] (which claims that ethical sentences express propositions, but that they are all false, whatever their nature).

==Overview==
Propositions are what meaningful [[declarative sentence]]s (but not interrogative or imperative sentences) are supposed to ''express''. Different sentences, in different languages, can express the same proposition: "snow is white" and "Schnee ist weiß" (in [[German language|German]]) both express the proposition that [[snow]] [[Copula (linguistics)|is]] [[white]].  A common belief among philosophers who use this jargon is that propositions, properly speaking, are what are true or false (what bear [[truth value]]s; they are [[correspondence theory of truth|truthbearers]]).

To get a better idea of what it means to express a proposition, compare this to something that ''does not'' express a proposition.  Suppose someone minding a [[convenience store]] sees a thief pick up a [[candy bar]] and run.  The storekeeper manages to exclaim, "Hey!"  In this case, "Hey!" does not express a proposition.  Among the things that the exclamation does not express are, "that's a thief there"; "thieving is wrong"; "please stop that thief"; or "that thief really annoys me."  The storekeeper isn't saying anything that can be true or false.  So it is not a ''proposition'' that the storekeeper is expressing.  Perhaps it is an ''emotional state'' that is being expressed.  The storekeeper is surprised and angered, and expresses those feelings by saying, "Hey!"

Ethical cognitivists hold that ethical sentences ''do'' express propositions: that it can be true or false, for example, that Mary is a good person, or that stealing and lying are always wrong. Cognitivists believe that these sentences do not just express feelings, as though we were saying, "Hey!" or "Yay for Mary!"; they actually express propositions that can be true or false. Derivatively, a cognitivist or a realist would say that ethical sentences themselves are either true or false. Conversely, if one believes that sentences like "Mary is a good person" cannot be either true or false, then one is a [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitivist]].

==Cognitivism and subjectivism==

[[Ethical subjectivism]] is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:
# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are about the attitudes of people.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt 1959, p. 153: "[Objectivism and subjectivism] have been used more vaguely, confusedly, and in more different senses than the others we are considering. We suggest as a convenient usage, however, that a theory be called subjectivist [[if and only if]], according to it, any ethical assertion implies that somebody does, or somebody of a certain sort under certain conditions would, take ''some specified attitude'' toward something."&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes ethical subjectivism a form of cognitivism. Ethical subjectivism stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all.

The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject". [http://www.iep.utm.edu/r/relativi.htm Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also [[moral universalism|universalist]] forms of subjectivism such as [[ideal observer theory]] (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes a hypothetical ideal observer would hold) and [[divine command theory]] (which claims that moral propositions are about what attitudes God holds).

==Cognitivism and objectivism==

Cognitivism encompasses all forms of [[moral realism]], but cognitivism can also agree with ethical [[irrealism (philosophy)|irrealism]] or [[anti-realism]]. Aside from the [[subjectivist]] branch of cognitivism, some cognitive irrealist theories accept that ethical sentences can be objectively true or false, even if there [[existence|exist]] no natural, physical or in any way [[reality|real]] (or "[[world]]ly") [[entity|entities]] or [[object (philosophy)|object]]s to make them true or false.

There are  a number of ways of construing how a proposition can be objectively true without corresponding to the world:
* By the [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]] rather than the [[correspondence theory of truth]]
* In a figurative sense: it can be true that I have a cold, but that doesn't mean that the word "cold" corresponds to a distinct entity.
* In the way that mathematical statements are true for [[Mathematical anti-realism|mathematical anti-realists]]. This would typically be the idea that a proposition can be true if it is an entailment of some intuitively appealing [[axiom]]—in other words, ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' analytical reasoning.

[[Crispin Wright]], [[John Skorupski]] and some others defend normative cognitivist irrealism. Wright asserts the extreme implausibility of both [[J. L. Mackie]]'s error-theory and [[non-cognitivism]] (including [[Simon Blackburn|S. Blackburn]]'s [[quasi-realism]]) in view of both everyday and sophisticated moral speech and argument. The same point is often expressed as the [[Expressivism#The Embedding Problem (or, the Frege–Geach objection)|Frege-Geach Objection]]. Skorupski distinguishes between receptive awareness, which is not possible in [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] matters, and non-receptive awareness (including dialogical knowledge), which is possible in normative matters.

[[Hilary Putnam]]'s book ''Ethics without ontology'' ([[Harvard]], 2004) argues for a similar view, that ethical (and for that matter [[mathematics|mathematical]]) sentences can be true and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] without [[ontology|there being]] any objects to make them so.

Cognitivism points to the [[semantics|semantic]] difference between [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s and [[declarative sentence]]s in normative subjects. Or to the different meanings and purposes of some superficially declarative sentences. For instance, if a teacher allows one of her students to go out by saying "You may go out", this sentence is neither true or false. It ''gives'' a permission. But, in most situations, if one of the students asks one of his classmates whether she thinks that he may go out and she answers "Of course you may go out", this sentence is either true or false. It does not ''give'' a permission, it states that ''there is'' a permission.

Another argument for ethical cognitivism stands on the close resemblance between ethics and other normative matters, such as [[game]]s. As much as [[morality]], games consist of norms (or [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s), but it would be hard to accept that it be not true that the [[chess]]player who checkmates the other one wins the game. If statements about game rules can be true or false, why not ethical statements?  One answer is that we may want ethical statements to be [[categorical syllogism|categorically]] true, while we only need statements about right action to be [[contingent]] on the acceptance of the rules of a particular game—that is, the choice to play the game according to a given set of rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="838">{{Nihongo|'''Bodhidharma Song'''|達磨歌|daruma uta}}, lit. "a nonsense poem" – a pejorative term for [[Zen]] poetry. It seems that this term was coined in connection with the Zen [[kōan]]'s {{Nihongo|"critical phrases"|話頭|Jp. wa tō; Ch. huà-tóu}} that seemed like unintelligible riddles to ordinary people and other Buddhist schools. 

This term was used by conservative [[waka (poetry)|waka]] poets to refer to the innovative style of [[Fujiwara no Teika]] (1162–1241), the compiler of the ''[[Hyakunin Isshu]]'' and ''[[Shin Kokin Wakashū]]'', notwithstanding the fact that Teika himself had never been a Zen practitioner.

Daruma uta is not the same as the [[shakkyōka]], which stands for Japanese Buddhist poetry in a general sense.

A {{nihongo|'''''dōjō'''''|[[wikt:道場|道場]]|}} is a hall or space for immersive learning or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts, but has been seen increasingly in other fields, such as meditation and software development.  The term literally means "place of the [[Tao|Way]]" in Japanese.

== History ==
[[File:Rokkaku-dou Ikenobou doujou.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ikenobō]] dōjō'' (right) next to [[Rokkaku-dō]], Kyoto]]
Initially, ''dōjō'' were adjunct to temples and were formal training place for any of the Japanese arts ending in "''-dō''", from the Chinese ''[[Tao]]'' (or ''Dao''), meaning "way" or "path". Sometimes meditation halls where [[Zen]] Buddhists practice ''[[zazen]]'' meditation were called ''dōjō''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meditation Hall and the Monk's Life|last=Suzuki|first=D.T.|work=An Introduction to Zen Buddhism|publisher=The Random House Group|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=118-132|author-link=D.T. Suzuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative term ''[[zendo|zen-do]]'' is more specific, and more widely used.  European ''[[Sōtō]] [[Zen]]'' groups affiliated with the International Zen Association prefer to use ''dōjō'' instead of ''zendo'' to describe their meditation halls as did their founding master, [[Taisen Deshimaru]].

In [[Japan]], any facility for physical training, including [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|professional wrestling]], may be called a ''dōjō''.&lt;ref name="Kendo for Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of Dojo|url=http://www.kendo-guide.com/meaning_of_dojo.html|work=Kendo Basics|publisher=Kendo for Life|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], the term ''dōjō'' (when related to physical activity) is used exclusively for [[Japanese martial arts]] such as ''[[Aikido|aikidō]]'', ''[[Judo|judō]]'', ''[[Karate|karate-dō]]'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martial Arts|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e634.html|work=Japan Experience|accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In martial arts ==
[[File:Noma Dojo, 2006.JPG|left|thumb|A ''[[kendō]]'' ''dōjō'']]
A proper [[Japanese martial arts]] ''dōjō'' is considered special and is well cared for by its users. Shoes are not worn in a ''dōjō''. In many styles it is traditional to conduct a ritual cleaning (''sōji'') of the ''dōjō'' at the beginning and/or end of each training session. Besides the obvious hygienic benefits of regular cleaning it also serves to reinforce the fact that ''dōjō'' are supposed to be supported and managed by the student body (or by special students, e.g., [[uchi-deshi]]), not the school's instructional staff. This attitude has become lost in many modern ''dōjō'' that are founded and run by a small group of people or instructors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In fact, it is not uncommon that in traditional schools ([[koryu]]), ''dōjō'' are rarely used for training at all, instead being reserved for more symbolic or formal occasions. The actual training is conducted typically outdoors or in a less formal area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Many traditional ''dōjō'' follow a prescribed pattern with ''shomen'' ("front") and various entrances that are used based on student and instructor rank laid out precisely.  Typically students will enter in the lower-left corner of the ''dōjō'' (in reference to the shomen) with instructors in the upper right corner. Shomen typically contains a [[Shinto|Shintō]] shrine with a sculpture, flower arrangement, or other artifacts. The term ''[[kamiza]]'' means "place of honor" and a related term, ''[[kamidana]]'' refers to the shrine itself. Other artifacts may be displayed throughout the ''dōjō'', such as [[kanban]] that authorize the school in a style or strategy, and items such as ''[[taiko]]'' drums or [[armor]] (''[[O-yoroi]]''). It is not uncommon to find the name of the ''dōjō'' and the ''[[dojo kun|dōjō kun]]'' (roughly "''dōjō'' rules") displayed prominently at shomen as well.  Visitors may have a special place reserved, depending on their rank and station. Weapons and other training gear will normally be found on the back wall.

===''Honbu dōjō''===
A ''honbu dōjō'' is the central training facility and administrative headquarters of a particular martial arts style.

Some well-known ''dōjō'' located in Japan are:
:*[[Kodokan Judo Institute]] ([[Judo]])
:*[[Aikikai Hombu Dojo|Aikikai Hombu Dōjō]] ([[Aikido]])
:*[[Noma Dōjō]] ([[Kendo]])
:*Nakazato Karate Weapons Gym ([[Shōrin-ryū Shōrinkan|Shorin-Ryu Shorinkan]])

===Other names for training halls===
Other names for training halls that are equivalent to "dojo" include the following:

:*[[Akhara]] ([[Indian martial arts])
:*[[Dojang]] ([[Korean martial arts]])
:*Gelanggang ([[silat Melayu]])
:*Heya ([[sumo]])
:*[[Kalari]] ([[kalaripayat]])
:*Sasaran ([[pencak silat]])
:*Wuguan ([[kungfu|wushu]])

== In other fields ==
The term ''dōjō'' is also increasingly used for other forms of immersive-learning space. 

===Zen Buddhism===
The term ''dōjō'' is sometimes used to describe the meditation halls where [[Zen]] Buddhists practice ''[[zazen]]'' meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meditation Hall and the Monk's Life|last=Suzuki|first=D.T.|work=An Introduction to Zen Buddhism|publisher=The Random House Group|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=118-132|author-link=D.T. Suzuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative term ''[[zendo|zen-do]]'' is more specific, and more widely used.  European ''[[Sōtō]] [[Zen]]'' groups affiliated with the International Zen Association prefer to use ''dōjō'' instead of ''zendo'' to describe their meditation halls as did their founding master, [[Taisen Deshimaru]].

'''Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz''' (''[[Married and maiden names|née]]'' '''Cary''') (December 5, 1822 – June 27, 1907) was an [[United States of America|American]] educator, and the co-founder and first president of [[Radcliffe College]]. A researcher of [[natural history]], she was an author and illustrator of natural history texts as well as a co-author of natural history texts with her husband, [[Louis Agassiz]], and her stepson [[Alexander Agassiz]].&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;

==Life==

Elizabeth Cary was born on December 5, 1822 into a [[Boston Brahmin]] family of New England ancestry. She was born at the house of her grandfather, [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]], on Pearl Street in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Her parents were Mary Ann Cushing Perkins Cary and Thomas Graves Cary&lt;ref name="Paton"&gt;Paton, Lucy Allen. ''Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz; a biography.'' Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; (who was a graduate of [[Harvard University]] in 1811). The Cary and Perkins families were from England, and came to Massachusetts during the seventeenth century. Elizabeth Cary was the second of five daughters and seven children and was referred to as “Lizzie” by her immediate family and close friends.&lt;ref name="NAW"&gt;"AGASSIZ, Elizabeth Cabot Cary (Dec. 5, 1822-June 27, 1907)". ''Notable American Women: 1607–1950''. Boston: Harvard University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her fragile health, she was tutored at home in Temple Place, Boston, which included the study of languages, drawing, music, and reading. She additionally received informal history lessons from [[Elizabeth Peabody]].&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;
[[File:Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, 1852 portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth Agassiz in 1852]]
Following the marriage of her older sister Mary to Harvard Professor [[Cornelius Conway Felton]] (later president of Harvard University), she began socializing with a group of intellectuals in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 1846, she met scientist [[Louis Agassiz]] at a dinner with Mary and her husband. Though they wanted to marry, he still had a wife and three children (Pauline, Ida and [[Alexander Agassiz|Alexander]]) in [[Switzerland]]. His wife died in 1848. In December 1849—when socially acceptable to wed—Lizzie's father gave his blessing. They married on April 25, 1850 in Boston, Massachusetts at [[King's Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;

Agassiz organized the household and took care of the finances and the children. She developed strong relationships with her step-children, Alexander, Ida, and Pauline, and her grandchildren. She had no children of her own. She traveled with her husband and family to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] for his professorship in the medical school throughout the winters of 1851-1852 and 1852-1853. She also visited Europe with him in 1859. She worked closely with her husband in his scientific research. Specifically, she accompanied Louis Agassiz as the main writer and record keeper for the Thayer Expedition to Brazil (April 1865–August 1866) and the [[Hassler Expedition]] through the [[Strait of Magellan]] (December 1871–August 1872).&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

After her husband's death in 1873, she continued to devote time to her work and family. She continued to enjoy traveling, and in 1892, Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz ventured with family to the [[Pacific Coast]], specifically California, for three months. She died on June 27, 1907 in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

== Career ==

In 1856 in their home in Cambridge, Agassiz founded a school for girls from Boston. Her husband supported her by giving courses as well as arranging for courses from other Harvard professors. After the closure of the school in 1863 she helped organize and manage The Thayer Expedition with her husband, who she accompanied to [[Brazil]] (1865–1866). This expedition, occurring from 1865-1866, caused the couple to be outside of the country during a significant portion of the [[American Civil War]]. In 1867, she began a correspondence with [[Arnold Guyot]], a [[geologist]] and [[meteorologist]]. She also helped organize and manage the next expedition (the [[Hassler]] Expedition in 1871-1872), which was the first important U.S. government marine exploration, and made transcripts. After her husband's death in 1873, she published several books on natural history for which she had conducted research for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Martha J. (1994). ''American Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary''. ABC-CLIO, Inc. {{ISBN|0-87436-740-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments and recognition==

Agassiz contributed to the founding of the coeducational Anderson School of Natural History. She was (from 1869) one of the first women members of the [[American Philosophical Society]] (with [[Mary Fairfax Somerville]] and [[Maria Mitchell]]); she became a member on October 15. In 1879 she was one of seven female managing directors of the Society for the Private Collegiate Instruction for Women (Harvard Annex). This provided qualified women who intended to pursue an advancement in their education in Cambridge with the opportunity to have private tuition from professors at Harvard College.&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt; Agassiz was essential in ensuring that the "[[Harvard Annex]]" for women's education was transformed in 1894 from Harvard University into [[Radcliffe College]]. From 1894 to 1900 this college was under their direction and from 1900 to 1903 she was honorary president. With her tact and her fundraising skills she promoted the college and contributed significantly to its continuity.

Agassiz became a member of the Ladies' Visiting Committee for the Kindergarten for the Blind, under the [[Perkins Institution for the Blind]]. She acted as treasurer for the Cambridge branch of the committee until an illness in 1904.&lt;ref name="Paton"/&gt;

== Research and published works ==

Her research can be studied throughout her published books in addition to her series of diary entries depicting her global ventures. Her publications include ''A First Lesson in Natural History'' (1859) and ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'' (1865), in which she was assisted by her stepson, [[Alexander Emanuel Agassiz]]. Elizabeth Agassiz originally published ''A First Lesson'' under the pseudonym [[Actaea (plant)|Actaea]]. Additionally, Elizabeth Agassiz co-authored ''A Journey in Brazil'' (1868)&lt;ref&gt;Agassiz, Elizabeth Cabot Cary. ''Diary of Elizabeth Cabot Cary Agassiz, May, 1865. A Journey in Brazil.'' Boston: Ticknor &amp; Co., 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; and edited and published ''Louis Agassiz: His Life and Correspondence'' in 1885. A biography of Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz was later written by her sister Emma F. Cary and Lucy Allen Paton, published in the Spring of 1917 with the assistance of the Council of Radcliffe College.&lt;ref name="Paton" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">In [[database theory|relational database theory]], an '''embedded dependency''' (ED) is a certain kind of constraint on a relational database. It is the most general type of constraint used in practice, including both [[tuple-generating dependency|tuple-generating dependencies]] (TGDs) and [[equality-generating dependency|equality-generating dependencies]] (EGDs).  EDs can express functional dependencies, join dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, inclusion dependencies, foreign key dependencies, and many more besides.  An ED is a sentence in first-order logic of the form:

∀x1 ... xn, P(x1, ..., xn) → ∃z1, ..., zk, Q(y1, ..., ym)

where {z1, ..., zk} = {y1, ..., ym} \ {x1, ..., xn}, and P is a possibly empty and Q is a non-empty conjunction of relational and equality atoms.  A relational atom has the form R(w1, ..., wh) and an equality atom has the form wi = wj where each of the w, ..., wh, wi, wj, are variables or constants.  When all atoms in Q are equalities, the ED is an EGD, and when all atoms in Q are relational, the ED is a TGD.  Every ED is equivalent to an EGD and a TGD.  A TGD is said to be full when the existential quantifier is empty.  An algorithm known as [[Chase (algorithm)|the chase]] takes as input an instance that may or may not satisfy a set of EDs, and, if it terminates (which is a priori undecidable), output an instance that does satisfy the EDs.

'''Eugen Karl Dühring''' (12 January 1833, [[Berlin]] – 21 September 1921, [[Nowawes]] in modern-day [[Potsdam-Babelsberg]]) was a [[German philosopher]], [[positivist]], [[economist]], and [[socialist]] who was a strong critic of [[Marxism]].

==Life and works==
Dühring was born in [[Berlin]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. After a legal education he practised at Berlin as a lawyer until 1859. A weakness of the eyes, ending in total [[blindness]], occasioned his taking up the studies with which his name is now connected. In 1864, he became [[docent]] of the [[University of Berlin]], but, in consequence of a quarrel with the professoriate, was deprived of his licence to teach in 1874.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Among his works are {{lang|de|Kapital und Arbeit}} (1865); {{lang|de|Der Wert des Lebens}} (1865); {{lang|de|Natürliche Dialektik}} (1865); {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie (von ihren Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart)}} (1869); {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der allgemeinen Principien der Mechanik}} (1872), one of his most successful works; {{lang|de|Kursus der National und Sozialokonomie}} (1873); {{lang|de|Kursus der Philosophie}} (1875), entitled in a later edition {{lang|de|Wirklichkeitsphilosophie}}; {{lang|de|Logik und Wissenschaftstheorie}} (1878); and {{lang|de|Der Ersatz der Religion durch Vollkommeneres}} (1883).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He also published {{lang|de|Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage}} (1881, ''The Jewish Question as a Racial, Moral, and Cultural Question''),&lt;ref name="Dühring1881"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dühring|first=Eugen|year=1881|title=Die Judenfrage als Racen-, Sitten- und Culturfrage: Mit einer weltgeschichtlichen Antwort|trans-title=The Jewish Question as a Racial, Moral, and Cultural Question: With a World-historical Answer|url=https://ia800206.us.archive.org/26/items/Duehring-Die-Judenfrage-2/DuehringEugen-DieJudenfrageAlsRacen-Sitten-UndCulturfrage1881167S.Scan.pdf|dead-url=no|format=PDF scan|language=de|edition=1st|publisher=H.

He published his autobiography in 1882 under the title {{lang|de|Sache, Leben und Feinde}}; the mention of {{lang|de|Feinde}} ('enemies') is characteristic. Dühring's [[philosophy]] claims to be emphatically the philosophy of reality. He is passionate in his denunciation of everything which, like [[mysticism]], tries to veil reality. He is, in the words of historian Carlton J. H. Hayes "almost [[Lucretius|Lucretian]] in his anger against religion"&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, ''A Generation of Materialism'', 1941, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; which would withdraw the secret of the universe from our direct gaze. His substitute for religion is a doctrine in many points akin to [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]], the former of whom he resembles in his [[Sentimentalism (philosophy)|sentimentalism]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Dühring's economic views are said to derive largely from those of [[Friedrich List]].&lt;ref&gt;"It would be better to read Herr Dühring's chapter on mercantilism in the 'original', that is, in F. List's National System, Chapter 29..."  ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Eugen Dühring", a lecturer at the university of Berlin, declared that List's doctrines represented 'the first real advance' in economics since the publication of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  (Henderson, William O. Friedrich List: Economist and Visionary (Frank Cass, London 1983) )&lt;/ref&gt; On other matters, particularly their attitudes toward Jews, the two men held very different opinions.&lt;ref&gt;"Up to the time of Philip II... Spain possessed all the elements of greatness and prosperity, when bigotry, in alliance with despotism, set to work to stifle the high spirit of the nation. The first commencement of this work of darkness was the expulsion of the Jews, and its crowning act the expulsion of the Moors, whereby two millions of the most industrious and well-to-do inhabitants were driven out of Spain with their capital." (From List's ''The National System of Political Economy'', p 58.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
Dühring's opinions changed considerably after his first appearance as a writer. His earlier work, {{lang|de|Natürliche Dialektik}} (''Natural Dialectics''), is entirely in the spirit of [[critical philosophy]]. Later, in his later movement towards [[positivism]], beginning with the publication of {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie}} (''Critical History of Philosophy''), he rejects [[Immanuel Kant]]'s separation of [[phenomenon]] from [[noumenon]] and claims that our intellect is capable of grasping the whole reality. This adequacy of thought to things is because the universe contains but one reality, i.e. matter. It is to matter that we must look for the explanation both of conscious and of physical states. But matter is not, in his system, to be understood with the common meaning, but with a deeper sense as the substratum of all conscious and physical existence; and thus the laws of being are identified with the laws of thought. In this idealistic system Dühring finds room for [[teleology]]. The end of [[Nature]], he holds, is the production of a race of conscious beings. From his belief in teleology he is not deterred by the enigma of pain. As a determined optimist, he asserts that pain exists to throw pleasure into conscious relief.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In ethics, Dühring follows [[Auguste Comte]] in making sympathy the foundation of morality. In political philosophy, he teaches an ethical [[communism]] and attacks the Spencer's principle of [[Social Darwinism]]. In economics, he is best known by his vindication of the American writer [[H. C. Carey]], who attracts him both by his theory of value, which suggests an ultimate harmony of the interests of capitalists and labourers; and also by his doctrine of national political economy, which advocates protection on the ground that the morals and culture of a people are promoted by having its whole system of industry complete within its own borders. His patriotism is fervent, but narrow and exclusive. He idolized [[Frederick the Great]], and denounced [[Jews]], [[Greeks]], and the cosmopolitan [[Goethe]]. His writing has been characterized as clear and incisive, "though disfigured by arrogance and ill-temper, failings which may be extenuated on the ground of his physical affliction."&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Dühring, Eugen Karl|author=[[Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington|Henry Sturt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He is chiefly remembered among English-speakers because of [[Engels]]' criticism of his views in {{lang|de|[[Anti-Dühring]]: Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science}}. Engels wrote his ''Anti-Dühring'' in opposition to Dühring's ideas, which had found some disciples among the German [[Social Democrats]]. He is also the most prominent representative of the socialism of that era attacked by Nietzsche in his later works. Most of Dühring's work remains unavailable in English, aside from his work on the [[Jewish question]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dühring|first=Eugen|title=Eugen Dühring on the Jews|year=1997|publisher=Nineteen Eighty Four Press|location=Brighton, England|isbn=0-906879-31-0|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Heroic materialism" characterized Dühring's philosophy. He attacked [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], and organized [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].  Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordis|first=Daniel|title=Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn|year=2016|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=New York, NY|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Dühring's invention of a modern-sounding antisemitism helped persuade [[Theodore Herzl]] that [[Zionism]] was the only answer:

[[File:Cimrman autobusta.jpg|thumb|150px|Jára Cimrman's self-bust]]

'''Externism''' is a [[fiction]]al [[philosophical theory]] proposed by the fictional [[Czech people|Czech]] genius [[Jára Cimrman]]. This character appears in many plays by authors from the [[Jára Cimrman Theatre]] in Prague. The first [[act (theater)|act]] of the theatre performances is usually filled with a lecture on Cimrman's personality, followed by a theatrical play. The theory of externism is described in a monologue by a Cimrmanologist having a lecture on Jára Cimrman's significance in the field of [[philosophy]] in the first act of the theatre play ''[[Akt (theatre play)|Akt]]'' (''The Nude'') by [[Zdeněk Svěrák]], [[Ladislav Smoljak]] and [[Jiří Šebánek]].

This [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory contradicts the traditional theory of [[solipsism]]. While solipsists believe that only their individual self exists and the external world does not, Jára Cimrman confronted them with the idea that it is the external world which exists and the philosopher's individual self does not.

At first this idea was met with huge disagreement among philosophers. Jára Cimrman was invited to defend his theory to the philosophical congress in [[Basel]]. The key [[counterargument]] that he had to face was: How could a non-existing consciousness create a theory?

Jára Cimrman replied that the fact that he does not exist does not mean he is not [[perception|perceptible]]. He compared the world to a space with a small place in the middle, where Jára Cimrman is missing. If we take a piece of paper with a hole in the middle, the paper can be compared to the external world and the hole (which is clearly visible) to the non-existing philosopher. Stretching and contracting the space results in the opposite change in the form of the hole. This movement can be viewed as a process of philosopher's thinking.

Later Cimrman elaborated the theory into more detail, as Cimrmanologists found out when reading [[Albert Einstein]]'s correspondence. He proposed that even other objects in our world do not exist in the way it is usually thought. In fact, an object is located in the place where we think it is not, and it is not in the place where we consider it to be. For example, if you take a piece of chalk, the chalk forms a huge mass all around itself, where the chalk may be, with a small bubble inside, where the chalk is definitely not.

Albert Einstein considered the theory to be "funny", which Cimrmanologists read as an expression of admiration. However, he had some objections as well. "As a physicist, I have to point out that it makes no difference if you call an object 'emptiness' and the emptiness 'object'," he wrote, "It is just ping-pong with words."

Cimrman's rival in the field of philosophy was F. C. Bohlen (another fictitious philosopher). He owned a pharmacy and was known for using exceptionally rude language. According to this vulgar [[materialist]] (which also means "pharmacist" in [[Czech language|Czech]]), the [[truth]] is the basic principle of our [[knowledge]]. In the beginning of the [[cognition|learning process]], the truth is inaccurate and we make it more precise.  Finally, we know everything.

Cimrman stated that in the beginning of every learning process, our knowledge is formed by a [[Error|mistake]], which is precise, and we must disconfirm it.  Finally, we know nothing.  Despite this, Cimrman cannot be considered to be an [[agnostic]] or [[nihilism|nihilist]]. On the contrary, he sees the learning process positively as a process of disproving the initial mistake. Thus, we can finally stand face-to-face with the [[Universe]], having our head clear and empty.

The fact that in the end we know nothing is just a [[logic]]al consequence of Cimrman's externism. The example with the chalk showed that in the learning process, when we try to get nearer to an object, we always reach a place where the object is not. Therefore, in the end of the process, we know nothing but we know it exactly.

The theory can be easily applied to the whole of [[existence]], except for the theory itself. When doing so, we seemingly disprove it: either it is a mistake, or we do not know it. Therefore, Cimrman created  a revolutionary solution: Cimrman's "Step-Aside". Thus he, just for a little while, appeared in the world of vulgar materialism, and could confirm his theory as valid. The [[logical consequence|conclusion]]s of both theories he joined together with a colon: "We know everything: We know nothing."

{{French literature sidebar}}
'''François de La Mothe Le Vayer''' ({{IPA-fr|də la mɔt lə veje|lang}}, August 1588{{snd}}9 May 1672), was a [[France|French]] writer who was known to use the pseudonym '''Orosius Tubero'''. He was admitted to the [[Académie française]] in 1639, and was the tutor of [[Louis XIV]].

==Early years==
Le Vayer was born and died in [[Paris]], a member of a noble family of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]]. His father was an avocat at the [[parlement]] of Paris and author of a curious treatise on the functions of ambassadors, entitled ''Legatus, seu De legatorum privilegiis, officio et munere libellus'' (1579) and illustrated mainly from ancient history. Francois succeeded his father at the parlement, but gave up his post about 1647 and devoted himself to travel and ''[[belles lettres]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Literary career==
His ''Considérations sur l'éloquence française'' (1638) procured him admission to the [[Académie française]], and his ''De l'instruction de Mgr. le Dauphin'' (1640) attracted the attention of [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. In 1649 [[Anne of Austria]] entrusted him with the education of her second son and subsequently with the completion of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s education, which had been very much neglected. The outcome of his pedagogic labors was a series of books comprising the ''Géographie, Rhétorique, Morale, Economique, Politique, Logique, and Physique du prince'' (1651–1658).  
The king rewarded his tutor by appointing him historiographer of France and councillor of state. La Mothe Le Vayer inherited of [[Marie de Gournay]]'s library, itself transmitted from [[Michel de Montaigne]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Modest, sceptical, and occasionally obscene in his Latin pieces and in his verses, he made himself a persona grata at the French court, where [[libertinism]] in ideas and morals was hailed with relish. Besides his educational works, he wrote ''Jugement sur les anciens et principaux historiens grecs et latins'' (1646); a treatise entitled ''Du peu de certitude qu'il y a en histoire'' (1668), which in a sense marks the beginning of historical criticism in France; and sceptical ''Dialogues'', published posthumously under the pseudonym of Orasius Tubero. An incomplete edition of his works was published at Dresden in 1756–1759.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
He was instrumental is popularizing [[Skepticism]] and [[Sextus Empiricus]] in particular whom he called "the divine Sexte" (a near blasphemy in Catholic France at the time of the Sun-King, which cost him a higher office of State).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Molière]] was his close friend and it is rumored that much of the iconoclastic satire of his plays were inspired by Le Vayer's erudite and savage (if carefully hidden) criticism of religious hypocrisy - as expressed in his masterpiece [[Tartuffe]] (1667), which he defended in a violent (and anonymous) ''Lettre sur la comedie de l'Imposteur'' against the religious faction at Court. [[Michel Foucault]] used this work as an important material in his famous essay "[[Governmentality]]."{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

"'''God of the gaps'''" is a [[Theology|theological]] perspective in which gaps in [[Science|scientific]] knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of [[Existence of God|God's existence]]. The "gaps" usage was made by [[Christianity|Christian]] theologians not to discredit [[theism]] but rather to point out the fallacy of relying on [[teleological argument]]s for God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Drummond|title=The Ascent of Man|url=https://archive.org/details/lowelllecture00drumiala|year=1904}} p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleological-arguments/#3.1 "Teleological Arguments for God's Existence"] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some use the phrase as a criticism of theological positions, to mean that God is used as a spurious explanation for anything not currently explained by science.

==Origins of the term==
The concept, although not the exact wording, goes back to [[Henry Drummond (1851–1897)|Henry Drummond]], a 19th-century [[Evangelism|evangelist]] lecturer, from his Lowell Lectures on ''The Ascent of Man''. He chastises those [[Christian]]s who point to the things that science can not yet explain—"gaps which they will fill up with God"—and urges them to embrace all nature as God's, as the work of "an [[immanence|immanent]] God, which is the God of Evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker, who is the God of an old theology."&lt;ref name="Religion p. 45"&gt;See Thomas Dixon ''Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction'' p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Henry Drummond|title=The Ascent of Man|url=https://archive.org/details/lowelllecture00drumiala|year=1904}} p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Ernest Barnes]], the Bishop of Birmingham, used the phrase in a discussion of general relativity's implication of a Big Bang:

{{quote|Must we then postulate Divine intervention? Are we to bring in God to create the first current of Laplace's nebula or to let off the cosmic firework of Lemaître's imagination? I confess an unwillingness to bring God in this way upon the scene. The circumstances with thus seem to demand his presence are too remote and too obscure to afford me any true satisfaction.  Men have thought to find God at the special creation of their own species, or active when mind or life first appeared on earth. They have made him God of the gaps in human knowledge. To me the God of the trigger is as little satisfying as the God of the gaps.  It is because throughout the physical Universe I find thought and plan and power that behind it I see God as the creator.&lt;ref name="Earnest Barnes 1933"&gt;Earnest William Barnes, "Scientific Theory and Religion: The World Described by Science and Its Spiritual Interpretation", Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-73022-8}}. 1933&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During [[World War II]] the German theologian and martyr [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] expressed the concept in similar terms in letters he wrote while in a Nazi prison.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953"/&gt; Bonhoeffer wrote, for example:

{{quote|how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case), then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in what we don't know.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer, letter to [[Eberhard Bethge]], 29 May 1944, pages 310–312, ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' edited by Eberhard Bethge, translated by Reginald H. Fuller, Touchstone, {{ISBN|0-684-83827-3}}, 1997; Translation of ''Widerstand und Ergebung'' Munich: Christian Kaiser Verlag, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his 1955 book ''Science and Christian Belief'' [[Charles Coulson|Charles Alfred Coulson]] (1910−1974) wrote:

{{quote|There is no 'God of the gaps' to take over at those strategic places where science fails; and the reason is that gaps of this sort have the unpreventable habit of shrinking.&lt;ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20"&gt;Charles Alfred Coulson (1955) ''Science and Christian Belief'', Oxford University Press, p. 20, Fontana Books 1958 and later (paperback) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
and
{{quote|Either God is in the whole of Nature, with no gaps, or He's not there at all.&lt;ref&gt;Coulson, Fontana edition, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulson was a mathematics professor at [[Oxford University]] as well as a Methodist church leader, often appearing in the religious programs of [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]. His book got national attention,&lt;ref&gt;The Fontana edition cites reviews from [[The Times Literary Supplement]], [[New Statesman]], and [[Manchester Guardian]],&lt;/ref&gt; was reissued as a paperback, and was reprinted several times, most recently in 1971.
It is claimed that the actual phrase 'God of the gaps' was invented by Coulson.&lt;ref&gt;C. Southgate et al.(1999), ''God, Humanity and the Cosmos: A Textbook in Science and Religion'', T. &amp; T. Clark, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Hough, [http://tjx.sagepub.com/content/109/847/21.citation Not a Gap in Sight: Fifty Years of Charles Coulson's Science and Christian Belief,] ''Theology'' 2006 109: 21−27. Hough writes, p. 24:
:The concept was certainly present, but according to Southgate it was Coulson who devised the actual terminology which we now use and which has been adapted to provide the title of the present article. The idea that Coulson coined this phrase is supported by the fact that he used it without reference or explanation and as a natural self-explanatory part of his argument.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was then used in a 1971 book and a 1978 article, by [[Richard Bube]]. He articulated the concept in greater detail in ''Man come of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response to the God-of-the-Gaps'' (1978). Bube attributed modern crises in religious faith in part to the inexorable shrinking of the God-of-the-gaps as scientific knowledge progressed. As humans progressively increased their understanding of nature, the previous "realm" of God seemed to many persons and religions to be getting smaller and smaller by comparison. Bube maintained that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' was the "death knell" of the God-of-the-gaps. Bube also maintained that the God-of-the-gaps was not the same as the God of the Bible (that is, he was not making an [[argument]] against God per se, but rather asserting there was a fundamental problem with the perception of God as existing in the gaps of present-day knowledge).&lt;ref name=Bube2&gt;[http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/14/14-4/14-4-pp203-220_JETS.pdf ''Man Come of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response to the God-of-the-Gaps'']. [[Richard Bube]]. ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]''. Volume 14. 1971. pp.203–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General usage==
The term "God of the gaps" is sometimes used in describing the incremental retreat of religious explanations of physical [[phenomena]] in the face of increasingly comprehensive scientific explanations for those phenomena.&lt;ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bube2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bube1&gt;Richard Bube (1971) ''The Human Quest: A New Look at Science and the Christian Faith''&lt;/ref&gt;   Dorothy Dinnerstein includes psychological explanations for a person believing in a deity, particularly a male deity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dinnerstein, Dorothy, The Mermaid and the Minotaur.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[R. Laird Harris]] writes of the physical science aspect of this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The expression, "God of the Gaps," contains a real truth. It is erroneous if it is taken to mean that God is not immanent in natural law but is only to be observed in mysteries unexplained by law. No significant Christian group has believed this view. It is true, however, if it be taken to emphasize that God is not only immanent in natural law but also is active in the numerous phenomena associated with the supernatural and the spiritual. There are gaps in a physical-chemical explanation of this world, and there always will be. Because science has learned many marvelous secrets of nature, it cannot be concluded that it can explain all phenomena. Meaning, soul, spirits, and life are subjects incapable of physical-chemical explanation or formation.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, L. L, [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1963/JASA12-63Harris.html "The God of the Gaps"]. ''[[PSCF|JASA]]''. Vol.15.No.4. Dec. 1963. pp.&amp;nbsp;101–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Usage in referring to a type of argument==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Argument from ignorance]] --&gt;
The term ''God-of-the-gaps fallacy'' can refer to a position that assumes an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which is a variant of an [[argument from ignorance]] fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shermer (2003) ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', p 115 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Larmer, "Is there anything wrong with 'God of the gaps' reasoning?" ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion'', Volume 52, Number 3 / December, 2002, p 129 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument is sometimes reduced to the following form:
:*There is a gap in understanding of some aspect of the natural world.
:*Therefore the cause must be supernatural.
One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows:
"Because current science can't figure out exactly how life started, it must be God who caused life to start." Critics of [[intelligent design creationism]], for example, have accused proponents of using this basic type of argument.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mark Isaak (2006) ''The Counter-Creationism Handbook'' pp x, 11–12, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

God-of-the-gaps arguments have been discouraged by some theologians who assert that such arguments tend to relegate God to the leftovers of science: as scientific knowledge increases, the dominion of God decreases.&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Alfred Coulson 1955 p 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dixon "Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction" p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Man Come Of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response To The God-Of-The-Gaps'', [[Richard Bube]], 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The term was invented as a criticism of people who perceive that God only acts in the gaps, and who restrict God's activity to such "gaps".&lt;ref&gt;Larmer, Robert (2002). [http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Larmer/Gaps.htm Is there anything wrong with “God of the gaps” reasoning?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024045851/http://www.newdualism.org/papers/R.Larmer/Gaps.htm |date=24 October 2007 }}. ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. Netherlands. 52: 129–142.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the God-of-the-gaps view is predicated on the assumption that any event which can be explained by science automatically excludes God; that if God did not do something via direct action, that he had no role in it at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/gaps.htm ''God of the gaps — Science &amp; Theology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The "God of the gaps" argument, as traditionally advanced by scholarly Christians, was intended as a criticism against weak or tenuous faith, not as a statement against theism or belief in God.&lt;ref name="Religion p. 45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1953" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Alfred Coulson (1955) Science and Christian Belief, p 20.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2009}}

According to [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]] in ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'', the phrase is generally derogatory, and is inherently a direct criticism of a tendency to postulate acts of God to explain phenomena for which science has yet to give a satisfactory account.&lt;ref name="Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology"&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (Ed. Alan Richardson, John Bowden, 1983), p 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=The+Westminster+Dictionary+of+Christian+Theology+god-of-the-gaps+phrase]&lt;/ref&gt; Habgood also states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is theologically more satisfactory to look for evidence of God's actions within natural processes rather than apart from them, in much the same way that the meaning of a book transcends, but is not independent of, the paper and ink of which it is comprised.&lt;ref name="Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both many theologians and scientists believe that it is a logical fallacy to base belief in God on gaps in scientific knowledge.  In this vein, [[Richard Dawkins]], an atheist, dedicates a chapter of his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' to criticism of the God-of-the-gaps fallacy.  Other scientists holding religious beliefs, such as [[Francis Collins]], reject a God-of-the-gaps while embracing the idea of a God who [[Fine tuned universe|fine tuned the universe]] precisely so human life could exist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://biologos.org/questions/god-of-the-gaps|title = Are gaps in scientific knowledge evidence for God?|date = |accessdate = January 6, 2015|website = Biologos|publisher = The BioLogos Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''''Green gifting''''' is an emerging trend that results in a lower [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] as well as a lower impact on personal [[budget]]s from the gift giving process.  It began with the idea of [[recycling]] the packaging around a gift and has expanded into the mindset that presents themselves can be chosen or created for the purpose of recycling or lowering their environmental and budgetary impact.&lt;ref name="Dunmow Waste Management"&gt;[http://www.dunmowwaste.com/blog/green-gifting-101--the-art-of-gift-giving-and-caring-for-mother-nature-15 Dunmow Waste Management], Green Gifting 101: The Art of Gift Giving And Caring For Mother Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarTribune"&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/yourvoices/78416587.html ''Star Tribune''], Twelve Ways of Green Gifting.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Waste Management"&gt;[http://www.jameswastemanagement.co.uk/news/ James Waste Management], What is upcycling and green gifting?&lt;/ref&gt;

An event that features green gifting encourages those invited to practice the level of green gifting the giver is comfortable with:

# [[Re-gift]] a never used or gently used item.&lt;ref name="MoneyCentral" /&gt;
# Use recycled [[wrapping paper]], bows or gift bags.&lt;ref name="StarTribune" /&gt;

'''Grigori Mints''' (June 7, 1939 – May 29, 2014) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]] who worked in [[mathematical logic]].
He was born in [[Leningrad]], in the Soviet Union (now [[St. Petersburg]], Russia), and received his Ph.D. in 1965 from the [[Leningrad State University]] under [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Shanin]] with a thesis entitled "On Predicate and Operator Variants for Building Theories of Constructive Mathematics". In 1990 he received his D.Sc. from [[Leningrad State University]] with a thesis entitled "Proof Transformations and Synthesis of Programs".&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=41775}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Stanford University]] [[professor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wakefield |first=Tanu |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/june/grigori-mints-obit-061214.html |title=Stanford philosophy Professor Grigori Mints, a world-renowned logician, has died at 74. |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2014-06-12 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, Grigori "Grisha" Mints was a professor of philosophy and, by courtesy, of mathematics and of computer science at Stanford University. Before joining Stanford, Mints held research positions at the Steklov Mathematical Institute, the Leningrad University and the Estonian Academy of Sciences.

Considered one of the most distinguished logicians in the world, Mints was passionate about the applications of logic to philosophy. His expertise was in proof theory – the analysis of the structure of mathematical reasoning. Mints was elected to the [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] in 2008 and to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2010.

Mints was a very active member of the steering committee of the [[WoLLIC]] series of workshops on logic and language, after having been a member of the community in several capacities such as invited speaker, PC member, PC chair, Organising Committee chair, guest editor of proceedings and special issue, and steering committee member.

[[File:Hawkwood_-_geograph.org.uk_-_252607.jpg|thumb|Hawkwood]]
'''Hawkwood College''' is a registered charity and independent centre for education in a 19th-century [[Grade II]] listed building on 42 acres of grounds, including gardens, pastures, woodland and a natural spring overlooking the [[Stroud]] Valley.

==Setting==
The main house, a [[Tudor Gothic architecture|Tudor Gothic]] villa dating back to 1845, is a large gabled residence in the [[Cotswold]] style adjoined by a number of other listed buildings, providing a facility for meetings, conferences and courses.

There are ten acres of woodland bounding the estate, acres of grass land managed by Stroud Community Agriculture; a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] half-walled garden growing fruit, herbs, flowers and vegetables for the house; an award winning pond and [[wetlands]] system processing household output; mature ornamental grounds with a sycamore and beside it the Hawkwood spring. No formal qualifications are needed to participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotswoldlife.co.uk/home/coming_home_to_hawkwood_1_3765410 Coming Home to Hawkwood, Cotswold Life retrieved 2014.09.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The Grove===

First records of the estate go back to 1688 when it was part of the parish of [[Painswick]], was known as The Grove and belonged to a certain John Mayo who died in 1715, leaving it to his daughters. Hestor, one of the daughters, was married to Samuel Capel, a Stroud clothier, who bought out the shares of the other daughters. Over the next years, the Capel family built up an estate of 822 acres in Painswick, [[Slad]] and Stroud, of which The Grove was the centre. At some point before 1842, this house had been badly damaged by fire.

It was William Capel (d. 1883) who engaged [[George Basevi]], architect of the [[Subscription Rooms]] and the wings at [[Painswick House]], to rebuild the house as it stands today, and a descendent, Lt.-Col. William Capel, who sold the bulk of the estate in 1914, the house on its 40 acres being sold four years after his death in 1932 to a Col. Murray. Col. Murray named it "Hawkwood" after the colourful 14th century mercenary [[Sir John Hawkwood]], commander of the legendary [[White Company]], whom he particularly admired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=19042 Painswick Manors and Other Estates, British History Online retrieved 2014.09.16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of Hawkwood College===
In 1947, the house was sold to Roland and Lily Whincop. Mr and Mrs Whincop had become interested in [[Rudolf Steiner]]’s philosophy and, after being deeply moved by a visit to [[Sunfield Children's Home|Sunfield Homes]] at [[Clent]] Grove, Worcester, where they experienced the quality of care and devotion given to the [[Special Needs]] children there, wished to found some kind of retreat for the staff of the home and for others who wished to withdraw for a time to write or study. At a conference in [[Wynstones School]] they shared their intention and someone advised them that the Hawkwood estate was up for sale. On their way to take up residence there, Roland Whincop suffered a stroke and died three days later.

During a conversation a month later with [[Margaret Bennell]], co-founder of Wynstones school at [[Brookthorpe]], whom Lily Whincop had come to know at the Wynstones conferences, the two women found they were both looking for a new direction. Margaret Bennell wanted to branch out into adult education and establish a further education college in accordance with the principles of [[Rudolf Steiner]] – a place where young people could experience an inner awakening and come to an understanding of life. Lily Whincop is reported to have stated, "I have a house, you have a plan," and on that afternoon of 20 November 1947, the initiative was taken. The college started with 12 students, one of them Eileen Brooking, who was later to become vice-principal of the College, at Easter 1948 and on 28 March 1949 opened officially as Hawkwood College.

In the next years students came from many countries of the world, the education changing the lives and outlooks of a large number. Lily Whincop opened her house to them and cared for everyone. She died at the age of 70 in 1957 and Margaret Bennell called the obituary she wrote "The Mother of Hawkwood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.calameo.com/read/000838235fee5eac920e1 BuyLOCAL Autumn 2013 on calméo retrieved 2014.09.16]&lt;/ref&gt;

To begin with the College offered a year’s course including most aspects of anthroposophical endeavour like natural science, social science, agriculture, architecture, medicine, world religions and so on. Soon it began to offer English language courses for foreign students and for English teachers, as well as weekend and week-long courses on anthroposophical topics and enrichment courses for teachers. A group of specialised guest lecturers supported the work as well as people like Benedict Wood, another founding teacher of Wynstones, Armyn Wodehouse and others.

===Further developments===

In 1965 Margaret Bennell asked Bernard Nesfield-Cookson and his wife, Eileen to consider taking over the College from her. This they finally did in 1971. Margaret Bennell died in 1966, with Benedict Wood, Isabel Bruce-Smith from Wynstones and Bernard Williams running the College in the interim. Benedict Wood remained there until his death in 1993.

For 22 years Bernard Nesfield-Cookson and his wife Eileen ran the College as co-principals. Both had attended Steiner schools themselves, Eileen a pupil of Margaret Bennel herself. Both had taught at Wynstones for a number of years. Bernard, a close friend of [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet|Sir George Trevelyan]], had for many years lectured at [[Attingham Park]] and, on the basis of this experience, transformed the Hawkwood into a facility for short-term residential courses. These, by the time he handed over the College to his successors, numbered some 100 per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalstroud.co.uk/landmarks.php?pageid=550&amp;topid=6&amp;pid=332&amp;section=497The Grove/ Hawkwood College, digital Stroud retrieved 2014.09.13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Hawkwood by Bernard Nesfield-Cookson (Principal 1971-1993) February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

On the basis of its founding [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] ethos, Hawkwood still provides a context for short courses on the theme of creative exploration. These include personal and spiritual development, arts &amp; crafts, music, health &amp; well-being as well as nature and sustainability

There are six meeting rooms including a large hall, library and two spacious studios. Overnight accommodation comprises twenty nine bedrooms with original features, looking out over the valley.

Hawkwood College is also home to the Bardic Chair of Hawkwood with the annual Bard of Hawkwood competition being held in the college grounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''Hold come what may''' is a phrase popularized by logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. [[Belief]]s that are "held come what may" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.&lt;ref name="Ney"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alyssa Ney|title=Metaphysics: An Introduction|date=13 August 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-67633-1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what may—in other words, that all beliefs are [[rationality|rationally]] revisable ("no statement is immune to revision"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

Many philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the [[laws of thought]] cannot be revised and may be "held come what may". Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a [[web of beliefs]], in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

A closely related concept is '''hold more stubbornly at least''', also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs.  Examples might be laws of [[logic]], or the belief in an external world of physical objects.  Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs.  It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Willard Van Orman |last=Quine |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |title=From a Logical Point of View |edition=2nd revised |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0674323513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to "hold more stubbornly at least".

A '''house church''' or '''home church''' is a label used to describe a group of [[Christianity|Christians]] who regularly gather for worship in private homes. The group may be part of a larger Christian body, such as a parish, but some have been independent groups that see the house church as the primary form of Christian community.

Sometimes these groups meet because the membership is small, and a home is the most appropriate place to assemble, as in the beginning phase of the [[British New Church Movement]]. Sometimes this meeting style is advantageous because the group is a member of a Christian congregation which is otherwise banned from meeting as is the case in [[House church (China)|China]] and Iran.

Some recent Christian writers have supported the view that the [[Christian Church]] should meet in houses, and have based the operation of their communities around multiple small home meetings. Other Christian groups choose to meet in houses when they are in the early phases of church growth because a house is the most affordable option for the small group to meet until the number of people attending the group is sufficient to warrant moving to a commercial location such as a church building. House church organizations claim that this approach is preferable to public meetings in dedicated buildings because it is a more effective way of building community and personal relationships, and it helps the group to engage in [[Evangelism|outreach]] more naturally.&lt;ref name="Akerson house church"&gt;{{cite web|last= David |first= Stephen | title=Ten Reasons For Small Churches| url=https://ntrf.org/index.php/2016/08/03/ten-reasons-for-small-churches/| website = NTRF|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe small churches were a deliberate apostolic pattern in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]], and they were intended by [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Simson, W: "Houses that Change the World", pages 79–101. Authentic Media, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament precedence ==
Christians who meet together in homes have often done so because of a [[Christian primitivism|desire to return]] to early Church style meetings as found in the [[New Testament]]. The New Testament shows that the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] church exhibited a richness of fellowship and interactive practice that is typically not the case in conventional [[Christian denominations|denominations]]. They believe that Christians walked closely with each other and shared their lives in Christ together.&lt;ref name="Akerson house church" /&gt; Others believe that the early church met in houses due to persecution, and home meetings were the most viable option to the early adopters of Christianity.

Several passages in the Bible specifically mention churches meeting in houses. "The churches of Asia greet you, especially Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, along with the church that is in their house." I Cor 16:19&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&amp;version=ESV&lt;/ref&gt;. The church meeting in the house of Priscilla and Aquila is again mentioned in Romans 16:3, 5. The church that meets in the house of Nymphas is also cited in the Bible: "Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in her house." Col 4:15.

For the first 300 years of Early Christianity, people met in homes until Constantine legalized Christianity, and the assembly moved out of houses into larger buildings creating the current style church seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fenn|first1=John|title=Patrick or Constantine|url=https://churchwithoutwallsinternational.org/2016/08/26/random-thought-patrick-or-constantine/|website=The Church Without Walls International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early house churches==

[[File:DuraEuropos-Church.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dura-Europos house church]], ca. 232, with chapel area on right.]]

The first house church is recorded in {{bibleverse||Acts|1:13}}, where the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples of Jesus]] met together in the "Upper Room" of a house, traditionally believed to be where the [[Cenacle]] is today. For the first three centuries of the church, known as [[Early Christianity]], Christians typically met in homes, if only because intermittent persecution (before the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313) did not allow the erection of [[Church (building)|public church buildings]]. [[Clement of Alexandria]], an early church father, wrote of worshipping in a house. The [[Dura-Europos church]], a private house in [[Dura-Europos]] in [[Syria]], was excavated in the 1930s and was found to be used as a Christian meeting place in AD 232, with one small room serving as a [[baptistry]].&lt;ref name="Filson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Significance of the Early House Churches|author=Floyd V. Filson|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=58|number=2| date=June 1939 |pages=105–112|jstor=3259855|doi=10.2307/3259855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/s06020076.htm ''Assist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220131209/http://www.assistnews.net/Stories/s06020076.htm |date=20 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At many points in subsequent history, various Christian groups worshipped in homes, often due to persecution by the state church or the civil government.

==Modern revival in North America and the United Kingdom==
In North America and the United Kingdom, the recent developments in the house church movement is often seen as a return to a New Testament church [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationist]] paradigm and a restoration of God's eternal purpose and the natural expression of Christ on the earth, urging Christians to return from hierarchy and rank to practices described and encouraged in Scripture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Nathan| title=Discipleship|url=http://www.beyondachurch.com/2017/12/discipleship.html|website=Beyond A Church|accessdate=11 January 2018|ref=Discipleship}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to some proponents, many churchgoers are turning to house churches because many traditional churches fail to meet their relational needs.&lt;ref name="Growing House Church Movement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henning|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Growing House-Church Movement|url=http://ministrytodaymag.com/index.php/ministry-today-archives/66-unorganized/720-the-growing-house-church-movement|website=Ministry Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some that support the house church configuration (associated with Wolfgang Simson, [[Jon Zens]], Milt Rodriguez, Frank Viola and others) consider the term "house church" to be a [[misnomer]], asserting that the main issue for Christians who gather together is not the meeting location (the house), but whether or not Jesus Christ is the functional head of the gathering and face-to-face community is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frankviola.org/2010/10/12/house-church-vs-organic-church/ Frank Viola. House Church vs. Organic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; Other titles which may be used to describe this movement are "simple church," "relational church," "primitive church," "body life," "organic church" or "biblical church."&lt;ref name="Felicity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dale|first=Felicity| title = Starting a simple church can be simple|url=http://simplychurch.com/category/simpleorganic-church-2/| website = Simply Church |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House churches can adopt an organic church philosophy which is not necessarily a particular method, technique or movement but rather a particular church expression that the group takes on when the organization is functioning according to the pattern of a living organism. The church represented in the New Testament is based on this principle, and traditional, contemporary Christianity has reversed this order.&lt;ref name="Viola Organic Movement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viola|first1=Frank|title=Why Organic Church Is Not Exactly a Movement|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2010/januaryweb-only/12.31.0.html|website=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The origins of the modern house church movement in North America and the UK are varied.

Some have viewed as a development and logical extension of the 'Brethren' or [[Plymouth Brethren]] movement both in doctrine and practice where many individuals and assemblies have adopted new approaches to worship and governance, while others recognize a relationship to the [[Anabaptists]], [[Free Christians (Britain)|Free Christians]], [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], [[Mennonites]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]], and the much earlier [[conventicle]]s movement, [[Waldenses]] and [[Priscillianists]]. Another perspective sees the house church movement as a re-emergence of the move of the Holy Spirit during the [[Jesus Movement]] of the 1970s in the USA or the worldwide [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic Renewal]] of the late 1960s and 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Others believe the House Church movement was pioneered by people like the Revd [[Ernest Southcott]] in the 1950s, when he was vicar of St Wilfred's Church in [[Halton, Leeds]] in England. Southcott believed that if people would not come to church, the church must go to the people, and his book ''The parish comes alive'' spread these ideas widely among Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;''The parish comes alive'' by Ernie Southcott, London, Mowbrays, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
Limited financial resources can encourage church leaders to rethink the pattern of ministry and look for ways to forward the outreach of the church with unpaid members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Mark D.|title=Leading a Church in Challenging Financial Times|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Leading-a-Church-in-Challenging-Financial-Times-Mark-Roberts-01-19-2011.html|website=Patheos}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The constant pressure to fill the pews and provide the money to keep the building and programs going is draining to the traditional church. To some of us, churches have become like big monsters that eat up everything we can give them and then constantly ask for more and more."&lt;ref name="Growing House Church Movement" /&gt;

"Disciples may meet in free facilities; they may rent a place of assembly; they may purchase a building in which to worship. Depending upon the circumstances, any of these options could be viable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mayberry|first1=Mark|title=What about Church Buildings?|url=http://www.truthmagazine.com/what-about-church-buildings|website=[[Truth Magazine (religious magazine)|Truth Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==House churches in China==
[[File:People singing chant.JPG|thumb|300px|A house church in Shunyi, Beijing.]]
{{Main article|House church (China)}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), '''house churches''' or '''family churches''' ({{zh|s=家庭教会|p=jiātíng jiàohuì}}) are [[Protestant]] assemblies that operate independently from the state-sanctioned [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] (TSPM) and [[China Christian Council]] (CCC), and came into existence due to the change in religious policy after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the early 1980s. The TSPM was set up after the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] established the PRC in 1949, for Protestants to declare their patriotism and support of the new government. However, by the time of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), all public religious practice came to an end. Due to the changes in religious policy after the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1980, the TSPM was reinstated and the China Christian Council was formed. Protestant congregations that wished to worship publicly registered with the TSPM, but those that did not were eventually termed house churches.&lt;ref name="bays"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bays|first=Daniel|title=A New History of Christianity in China|pages=182, 190–195|location=Malden, MA|date =2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industry funding of academic research in the United States''' is one of the two major sources of funding in academia along with government support. Currently, private funding of research accounts for the majority of all research and development funding in the United States as of 2007 overall.&lt;ref name=CBO2007&gt;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/82xx/doc8221/06-18-research.pdf{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Federal and Industrial sources contribute similar amounts to research, while industry funds the vast majority of development work.&lt;ref name="CBO2007" /&gt; 

While the majority of industry research is performed in-house, a major portion of this private research funding is directed to research in non-profit academic centers.&lt;ref name=NBK215472&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=McGeary |editor2-first=Kathi E. |editor2-last=Hanna |year=2004 |chapter=Sources of Funding for Biomedical Research |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215472/ |title=Strategies to Leverage Research Funding |isbn=0-309-09277-9 |pages=37–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, industrial sources accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion of academic research funding in the US.&lt;ref name=NBK215472/&gt; However, there is little governmental oversight or tracking of industry funding on academic science and figures of the scale of industry research are often estimated by self-reporting and surveys which can be somewhat unreliable.

Much of this industry funding of academic research is directed toward applied research. However, by some accounts, industry may even fund up to 40% of basic research in the United States, with Federal funding of basic research falling below 50%, although this figure does not consider where this research is conducted.&lt;ref name="science.aal0890"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aal0890 |title=Data check: U.S. Government share of basic research funding falls below 50% |journal=Science |year=2017 |last1=Mervis |first1=Jeffrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role for funding of academic research from industrial sources has received much attention both in a historical and contemporary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.1.113 |pmid=12837722 |title=Industry Funding of Clinical Trials: Benefit or Bias? |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=113–4 |year=2003 |last1=Chopra |first1=S. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has received both extensive political praise and scholarly criticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==History==
Research in the US prior to World War II, heavily relied on funding from private sources without major organized federal research programs or either the scientists’ or associates’ personal funds. During World Wa&lt;s&gt;r&lt;/s&gt; II, governmental investment in research was widely regarded as a major contributor to military success and support for research was politically favorable.&lt;ref name=NBK235736&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235736/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following WW2, federal research funding in both Europe and the US increased in terms of relative percent of funding for research and absolute amount.&lt;ref name=NBK235736/&gt; Overall, the growth of industrial research funding has greatly outpaced public research funding growth, with US governmental research funding increasing by an average of 3.4% annually, while industrial research funding increased by an average of 5.4% annually from 1950 to 2004.&lt;ref name=CBO2007/&gt; 

Since WW2, industry funding of science has consistently represented the second largest source of funding for academic science.&lt;ref name=Jahnke&gt;{{cite web |first=Art |last=Jahnke |date=April 6, 2015 |title=Who Picks Up the Tab for Science? |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/ |work=BU Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry funding of academic science did expand during the 1980s and 1990s following the passing of the Bayh-Dohl Act and a variety of both State and Federal proposals to increase funding for joint industry academic partnerships.&lt;ref name=Cohen1994&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wesley |last1=Cohen |first2=Richard |last2=Florida |first3=W Richard |last3=Goe |title=University-Industry Research Centers in the United States: Final Report to the Ford Foundation |publisher=H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Center for Economic Development |year=1994 |oclc=249390310 }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there has been a small retraction of industry funding for academic science while overall industry R&amp;D funding has expanded.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt; ). However, industry funding may be broadening its scope as industry funding of basic science increasing dramatically over that same period, but much of this funding remains in-house.&lt;ref name=science.aal0890/&gt;

Culturally, attitudes towards the industrial funding of academic research have changed over time. Within universities, commercial activities and industry funding were often spurned in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/652016 |pmid=20380344 |title=The Professional and the Scientist in Nineteenth-Century America |journal=Isis |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=699–732 |year=2009 |last1=Lucier |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, commercializing scientific activity is viewed more favorably with extensive political and university support of translating scientific discovery into economic output. However, within the research community and the public, industrial funding of research remains controversial. The universality of this tangled industry, academic, and governmental exchange of funding and research adventures has led researchers to term this model of R&amp;D the Triple Helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00055-4 |title=The dynamics of innovation: From National Systems and 'Mode 2' to a Triple Helix of university–industry–government relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=109–23 |year=2000 |last1=Etzkowitz |first1=Henry |last2=Leydesdorff |first2=Loet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of industrially funded academic research ==
University-industry partnerships can take on a variety of forms. On the smallest scale, individual research labs or researchers can partner with industry sources for funding. The details of such partnerships can differ substantially with any number of motives ranging from the academic lab testing of previously developed products, to performing early stage basic research related to industry research objectives, or even to individual researchers supporting their salary by consulting on related research problems in industry.&lt;ref name=Lucier2008&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3500{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many such partnerships exist, due to their informal nature and resulting lack of record, it is difficult to track how extensive and impactful such relationships are, with most relying on surveys and other self-reporting measures. By closest approximation, according to the Research Value Mapping Survey, 17% of academics at major US research universities report receive grants from industry sources supporting their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.007 |title=Impacts of grants and contracts on academic researchers' interactions with industry |journal=Research Policy |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=694–707 |year=2007 |last1=Bozeman |first1=Barry |last2=Gaughan |first2=Monica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more extensively, in many fields and countries, a narrow majority of academic scientists report having some soft industry relationships, primarily through consulting.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.007 |title=Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university–industry relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=423–42 |year=2013 |last1=Perkmann |first1=Markus |last2=Tartari |first2=Valentina |last3=McKelvey |first3=Maureen |last4=Autio |first4=Erkko |last5=Broström |first5=Anders |last6=d'Este |first6=Pablo |last7=Fini |first7=Riccardo |last8=Geuna |first8=Aldo |last9=Grimaldi |first9=Rosa |last10=Hughes |first10=Alan |last11=Krabel |first11=Stefan |last12=Kitson |first12=Michael |last13=Llerena |first13=Patrick |last14=Lissoni |first14=Franceso |last15=Salter |first15=Ammon |last16=Sobrero |first16=Maurizio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1814 |pmid=19887423 |pmc=3767010 |title=Participation of Academic Scientists in Relationships with Industry |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1814–25 |year=2009 |last1=Zinner |first1=D. E |last2=Bolcic-Jankovic |first2=D |last3=Clarridge |first3=B |last4=Blumenthal |first4=D |last5=Campbell |first5=E. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such informal industry academic relationships have a long-standing tradition as they served as a major source of funding for individual labs prior to WW2. In many cases, it was expected that researchers would pursue such relationships as this was expected to be a major source of funding for researcher’s salaries.&lt;ref name="Lucier2008" /&gt; Despite greatly expanded post-WW2 federal support for research, so called soft money salary support from industry remains a large and growing aspect of academic research salaries.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt;

=== University Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) ===
On a larger scale, there have been numerous attempts to create collaborative University-Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) to jointly host academic and industry researchers to address industry problems with direct, large scale collaborative centers. Early forms of UIRCS started in the 1950s and 1960s with the formation of research parks with industry sponsors. In the 1970s, there were multiple proposals at the federal level in the US to help fund and expand early UIRCs. However, funding fell through at multiple points.&lt;ref name="Berman2012"&gt;https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9619.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first UIRCs experienced difficulties in bridging the differences between academic and industrial culture. One such attempt occurred at Cal Tech where Cal Tech researchers partnered with Xerox and IBM through the Silicon Structures Project.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/capsca_000202
{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both industry and academic partners were concerned about the cultures of the other and found the structure ineffective.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt; With such frustrations, it was difficult to secure partners to continue expanding UIRCs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1970s, RPI created two three new UIRCs: 1) the Center for Integrated Computer Graphics, which received both NSF and industry support 2) the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology Transfer, which was funded entirely by industry support and 3) the Center for Integrated Electronics, which received unprecedented industry support.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; These centers were generally regarded as highly successful and made expansion of governmental support for joint industry and academic ventures more favorable. In the early 1980s, states began contributing funding to UIRCs and other industry-academic partnerships to encourage local economic growth from innovation. By the mid-1980s, the federal government expanded financial support for UIRCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016224399602100303 |jstor=689710 |title=The Emergence of a Competitiveness Research and Development Policy Coalition and the Commercialization of Academic Science and Technology |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=303–39 |year=2016 |last1=Slaughter |first1=Sheila |last2=Rhoades |first2=Gary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With mixed governmental and industry support, the UIRCs were more likely to be successful. Over time successful governmentally funded UIRCs could become independent from government support once having demonstrable successes that could continue to incentivize industry to contribute funding more aggressively.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; UIRCs, coupled to early seeding from both state and federal government, continued to greatly expand during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually receiving nearly 70% of industry funding of academic research and incentivizing a tripling of industry funding of academic research during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1994" /&gt;

=== Contract Research Organizations (CROs) ===
Contract research has also drawn increasing industry funding, particularly to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) from Biotech and Pharmaceutical corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00136504 |jstor=3446795 |title=Contract research, the university, and the academic |journal=Higher Education |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=665–82 |year=1985 |last1=Crawshaw |first1=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract research is a popular form of outsourcing research in industry as industry has more influence over how the study is conducted than in either UIRCs or traditional academic grants. CROs, which are specifically designed for this function have drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away from academia and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23424323 |pmc=3571008 |year=2005 |author1=Carroll |first1=J |title=CRO Crowing About Their Growth |journal=Biotechnology healthcare |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=46–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticisms==
Much discussion has been placed on the effects of industrial research funding on the behavior of academic research scientists. Concerns center on whether researchers can remain impartial when they are being funded by a for-profit and potentially motivated industrial source, if this funding gives private sources an oversized impact on which research directions are pursued, and the potential negative effects of industrial funding on the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00112-2 |title=Unintended consequences of cooperative research: Impact of industry sponsorship on climate for academic freedom and other graduate student outcome |journal=Research Policy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=179–99 |year=2001 |last1=Behrens |first1=Teresa R |last2=Gray |first2=Denis O }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A multitude of studies have found that pharmaceutical studies funded by industry organizations are significantly more likely to publish results in favor of the product being supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.010 |title=How pharmaceutical industry funding affects trial outcomes: Causal structures and responses |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1909–14 |year=2008 |last1=Sismondo |first1=Sergio }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, in part, be due to the fact that usually when an academic accepts industry funding, particularly when working on an existing product, researchers have to sign non-disclosure agreements which often prevent the publication of negative results and inhibit the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public-universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could serve to significantly bias scientific results and diminish public trust of science.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are additionally many scholars who have considered advantages of industrially funded academic research. Generally, increased industry funding may increase academic and industry interaction, prompting greater efficiency in translating and commercializing of science research. This increased commercialization activity from academics could serve as an economic and societal boost as the economy could be bolstered by new products hitting the market, while society could benefit directly from having increased access to the fruits of scientific production. Supporting this, academic science funded by industry sources does result in more patents per dollar, increased licensing of these patents, and even more citations per published paper than research supported by other sources, including federal at the University of California Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507297a |pmid=24654278 |title=Technology transfer: Industry-funded academic inventions boost innovation |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7492 |pages=297–9 |year=2014 |last1=Wright |first1=Brian D |last2=Drivas |first2=Kyriakos |last3=Lei |first3=Zhen |last4=Merrill |first4=Stephen A }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Germany, it also appears that applied research funded by industry sources results in a significant increase in patent citations, which could correspond to a serious increase in translation of applied research.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00519.x |title=Industry Funding of University Research and Scientific Productivity |journal=Kyklos |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=534–55 |year=2011 |last1=Hottenrott |first1=Hanna |last2=Thorwarth |first2=Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such increase in commercialization and translation of research could provide social and economic benefits.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011/&gt; However, it is difficult to determine whether this increase in apparent impact is due to the industry funding itself or is just a read out that industry funds target work that tends to produce more citations per publication as well as more patents.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt;

{{For|the Star Trek: Voyager episode|Infinite Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)}}
An '''infinite regress''' in a series of [[proposition]]s arises if the [[truth]] of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the truth of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires the support of proposition ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on, [[ad infinitum]].

Distinction is made between infinite regresses that are "[[vicious circle|vicious]]" and those that are not.

==Aristotle==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|Aristotle]]
[[Aristotle]] argued that knowing does not necessitate an infinite regress because some knowledge does not depend on demonstration:
{{quote|Some hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the primary premises, there is no scientific knowledge. Others think there is, but that all truths are demonstrable. Neither doctrine is either true or a necessary deduction from the premises. The first school, assuming that there is no way of knowing other than by demonstration, maintain that an infinite regress is involved, on the ground that if behind the prior stands no primary, we could not know the posterior through the prior (wherein they are right, for one cannot traverse an infinite series): if on the other hand – they say – the series terminates and there are primary premises, yet these are unknowable because incapable of demonstration, which according to them is the only form of knowledge. And since thus one cannot know the primary premises, knowledge of the conclusions which follow from them is not pure scientific knowledge nor properly knowing at all, but rests on the mere supposition that the premises are true. The other party agree with them as regards knowing, holding that it is only possible by demonstration, but they see no difficulty in holding that all truths are demonstrated, on the ground that demonstration may be circular and reciprocal.

Our own doctrine is that not all knowledge is demonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate premises is independent of demonstration. (The necessity of this is obvious; for since we must know the prior premises from which the demonstration is drawn, and since the regress must end in immediate truths, those truths must be indemonstrable.) Such, then, is our doctrine, and in addition we maintain that besides scientific knowledge there is its original source which enables us to recognize the definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick Hugh |last=Byrne |year=1997 |title=Analysis &amp; Science in Aristotle |series=SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=9780791433218 |lccn=96037783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grx6qfb5L7AC&amp;pg=PA83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1901 |author=Aristotle |title=Posterior Analytics |publisher=B.H.

==Consciousness==
Infinite regress in [[consciousness]] is the formation of an infinite series of "inner observers" as we ask the question of who is observing the output of the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] in the study of [[subjective consciousness]].

==Optics==
[[File:Blond infinite reflections.jpg|thumb|Infinite reflections between two mirrors]]
Infinite regress is akin to the [[optics|optical]] phenomenon wherein an infinite sequence of receding images is formed between two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] facing [[mirror]]s. A similar process occurs in [[optical feedback]].
{{-}}

==Libertarian free will==
[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] asserts that human actions do not have causes and are chosen [[Consciousness|consciously]] – i.e. are not random. This raises a serious question: what are these conscious decisions based on? Since they can't be based on nothing (as the possibility of decisions being random is excluded), this question can be asked for each subsequent answer or answers to it, thus forming an infinite regress.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papq.12139/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t0PZ3yjTuX0C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=libertarianism+infinite+regress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qla6LiOZCx&amp;sig=nOLQZbiz-rCuY0ROOBrUu0rmTt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU55LF-5XXAhXCYVAKHQ-LB8kQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=libertarianism%20infinite%20regress&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intention''' is a [[mind|mental]] state that represents a commitment to carrying out an action or actions in the [[future]]. Intention involves mental activities such as [[planning]] and forethought.&lt;ref name="Bratman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bratman|first1=M.|title=Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Folk psychology]] explains human behavior on the basis of mental states, including [[beliefs]], [[desires]], and intentions.&lt;ref name="Astington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astington|first1=J.W.|title=The child's discovery of the mind|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perner|first1=J.|title=Understanding the representational mind|date=1991|publisher=Bradford Books/MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental mechanisms, including intention, explain behavior in that individuals are seen as actors who have desires and who attempt to achieve [[goal]]s that are directed by beliefs.&lt;ref name="Malle and Knobe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malle|first1=Bertram F.|last2=Knobe|first2=Joshua|title=The Folk Concept of Intentionality|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=March 1997|volume=33|issue=2|pages=101–121|doi=10.1006/jesp.1996.1314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an intentional action is a function to accomplish a desired goal and is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.&lt;ref name="Malle and Knobe" /&gt;

There is also a theoretical distinction between intentionality (intentional actions), and a mental state of intention for the future.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Searle|first1=J.R.|title=Intentionality: An essay in the philosophy of mind|date=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searle (1983) labeled these as intention-in-action and prior intention respectively. Prior intentions reflect forethought about intentions-in-action; prior intentions do not need to be carried out to be considered intentions.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt; An unfulfilled intention is a prior intention that has no action associated with it.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

Astington (1993)&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; outlined the connections between mental states (desires, beliefs, and intentions) and actions carried out by an individual in order to reach a goal; these connections are referred to as the Intentional Chain.  The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome.  The Intentional Chain maps the linking of a desire to the satisfaction of a goal via the intermediary intention.&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt;

==The development of an understanding of intention==
Psychological research suggests that understanding intentions of others may be a prerequisite for a higher-level understanding of other people's minds or [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Blakemore and Decety"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakemore|first1=SJ|last2=Decety|first2=J|title=From the perception of action to the understanding of intention.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=August 2001|volume=2|issue=8|pages=561–7|pmid=11483999|doi=10.1038/35086023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research attempts to map how children come to understand the mind as a representational device for the world.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=E.A.|title=Young children's representational understanding of intention|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=1996|volume=56|issue=12-B|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/618996982?accountid=14512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has focused on the development of knowledge that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own.  A basic ability to comprehend other people's intentions based on their actions is critical to the development of theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Blakemore and Decety" /&gt;

Understanding intention is thought to be pivotal in understanding social contexts in numerous ways. First, acquiring an understanding of intention is important for development in that it helps children conceptualize how people and animals differ from objects. Much of behavior is caused by intentions, and understanding intentions helps to interpret these behaviors.&lt;ref name=Feinfield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinfield|first1=Kristin A|last2=Lee|first2=Patti P|last3=Flavell|first3=Eleanor R|last4=Green|first4=Frances L|last5=Flavell|first5=John H|title=Young Children's Understanding of Intention|journal=Cognitive Development|date=July 1999|volume=14|issue=3|pages=463–486|doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(99)00015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, intentions are integral to an understanding of morality.&lt;ref name=Shantz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shantz|first1=C.U.|editor1-last=Mussen|editor1-first=P.H.|editor2-last=Flavell|editor2-first=J.H.|editor3-last=Markman|editor3-first=E.M.|title=Handbook of child psychology: Volume III. Cognitive Development|date=1983|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=495–555|edition=4th|chapter=Social cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn to assign praise or blame based on whether actions of others are intentional. Intention is also necessary to understand and predict the plans and future actions of others.&lt;ref name="Bratman" /&gt; Understanding the intentions and motives of others aids in the interpretation of communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=P.|title=How children learn the meanings of words|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention: Social understanding and self-control.|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=63–75|chapter=Having intentions, understanding intentions, and understanding communicative intentions}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the achievement of cooperative goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenkins, J.|author2=Greenbuam, R.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention: Social understanding and self-control|date=1991|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=269–291|chapter=Intention and emotion in child psychopathology: Building cooperative plans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social, cognitive and developmental psychological research has focused on the question: How do young children develop the ability to understand other people's behaviors and intentions?

=== Intentional acts in infancy and childhood ===
From an early age, typically-developing children parse human actions in terms of goals, rather than in terms of movements in space, or muscle movements.&lt;ref name="Malle"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meltzoff, A.N.|author2=Brooks, R.|editor1-last=Malle|editor1-first=B.F.|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=L.J.|editor3-last=Baldwin|editor3-first=D.A.|title=Intentions and intentionality: Foundations of social cognition|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=171–191|chapter="Like me" as a building block for understanding other minds: Bodily acts, attention, and intention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meltzoff (1995)&lt;ref name=Meltzoff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=A.N.|title=Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children|journal=Developmental Moisture
|date=1995|volume=31|issue=5|pages=838–850|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838|pmid=25147406|pmc=4137788}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study in which 18-month-olds were shown an unsuccessful act. For instance, children watched an adult accidentally under or over shoot a target, or attempt to perform an action but his hand slipped. The aim of the study was to determine whether the children were able to interpret the intention of the adult, regardless of the actual action performed.  Young children have a tendency to imitate other people's actions. The outcome measure was what the child chose to re-enact—the actual event (literal motions), or the adult's goal, which was not accomplished.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;  The results of the study suggested that 18-month-olds are able to infer unseen goals and intentions of others based on their actions. Infants who saw unsuccessful attempts at a target act and infants who saw the target act imitated the act at a higher rate than infants who saw neither the act nor an attempt.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;  Similar paradigms were conducted with children 9 months old and 15 months old.  Nine-month-olds did not respond to the unsuccessful attempt demonstrations; however, 15-month-olds acted similarly to the 18-month-olds. This suggests that between 9 months and 15 months of age the ability to infer intentions in other people develops.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;

The development of understanding intention has also been studied in toddlers. As mentioned previously, an intentional action is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; In that case, what was intended can be interpreted as a function of an understanding for what was desired. When outcomes are achieved without the action of the individual directed at the goal, intention is not attributed to the actor; rather, the event is considered an accident.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;  Research by Astington and colleagues (1993)&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; found that 3-year-olds are skilled at matching goals to outcomes to infer intention. If another individual's goals match an outcome, 3-year-olds are able to conclude that the action was done “on purpose.” Conversely, when goals do not match outcomes, the children labeled the individual's actions as accidental.&lt;ref name="Astington" /&gt; Children may come to distinguish between desire and intention when they learn to view the mind as a medium for representations of the world.&lt;ref name="AstingtonII"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astington|first1=J.W.|editor1-last=Malle|editor1-first=B.F.|editor2-last=Moses|editor2-first=L.J.|editor3-last=Baldwin|editor3-first=D.A.|title=Intentions and Intentionality: Foundations of social cognition|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=85–103|chapter=The paradox of intention: Assessing children's metarepresentational understanding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astington argues that initially desire is undifferentiated from intention in that both function as a goal state. Children then develop a more mature command of understanding other's intentions when they are able to represent an action as caused by a prior intention that is separate from desire.&lt;ref name="AstingtonII" /&gt;

Thus, research suggests that by the age of fifteen months, humans are capable of understanding intentional acts in others.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt; The ability to distinguish between intention and desire develops in early childhood. Gestures and object-directed actions have also been studied in connexion with the development of the understanding of intention. The development of the ability to use gestures and object-directed actions in social situations has been studied from numerous perspectives, including the embodiment perspective and the social-cognitive perspective.

===Gestures and object-directed intentions===
Gestures are often recognized as a tool indicative of higher social reasoning. In order to engage in or understand a gesture, an individual has to recognize it as an indicator of an object or event separate from the self or the actor. It is thought that pointing, especially declarative pointing (i.e. pointing intended to direct and share intention rather than request an object), reveals the understanding of others as attentional and intentional agents (e.g. Liszkowski, Carpenter, &amp; Tomasello, 2007&lt;ref name=Liszkowski&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|title=Pointing out new news, old news, and absent referents at 12 months of age|journal=Developmental Science|date=March 2007|volume=10|issue=2|pages=F1–F7|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00552.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This understanding is indicated by object-directed reactions to pointing (rather than focusing on the hand).&lt;ref name="Woodward and G"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=Amanda L.|last2=Guajardo|first2=Jose J.|title=Infants’ understanding of the point gesture as an object-directed action|journal=Cognitive Development|date=January 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1061–1084|doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00074-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing is also thought to denote perspective-taking ability and understanding of intention, as the individual must be able to understand that the actor is attending to the object and, perhaps most importantly, that the actor is attempting to communicate information regarding the referent.&lt;ref name="Woodward and G" /&gt; The development of pointing is thought to reach a critical stage at around 9 to 12 months in normally developing children (e.g. Leung &amp; Rheingold, 1981; Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Schaffer, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Eleanor H.|last2=Rheingold|first2=Harriet L.|title=Development of pointing as a social gesture.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1981|volume=17|issue=2|pages=215–220|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.2.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moll and T"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moll, H.|author2=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Emery|editor1-first=N.|editor2-last=Clayton|editor2-first=N.|editor3-last=Frith|editor3-first=C|title=Social intelligence:  From brain to culture|date=2007|pages=245–260|chapter=Cooperation and human cognition: the Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=H.R.|title=The child's entry into a social world|date=2005|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Liszkowski and colleagues (2004)&lt;ref name="LiszkowskiII"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Henning|first3=Anne|last4=Striano|first4=Tricia|last5=Tomasello|first5=Michael|title=Twelve-month-olds point to share attention and interest|journal=Developmental Science|date=2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=297–307|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00349.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that human children begin to point at around one year of age and do so with a multiple motives, including sharing attention and interest.&lt;ref name="LiszkowskiII" /&gt; Earlier pointing may be different in nature and is thought to develop from a learned association between reaching and adult responsiveness to the child's desire for a referent object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=E.|last2=Benigni|first2=L.|last3=Bretherton|first3=I.|last4=Camaioni|first4=L.|last5=Volterra|first5=V.|title=The emergence of symbols: Cognition and communication in infancy|date=1979|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it seems pointing may be more complex than a straightforward indicator of social understanding. Early pointing may not indicate an understanding of intention; rather it may indicate an association between the gesture and interesting objects or events.&lt;ref name="Barresi and M"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barresi|first1=John|last2=Moore|first2=Chris|title=Intentional relations and social understanding|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2010|volume=19|issue=01|pages=107–154|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00041790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butterworth|first1=George| author-link1=George Butterworth (psychologist)|last2=Jarrett|first2=Nicholas|title=What minds have in common is space: Spatial mechanisms serving joint visual attention in infancy|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|date=1991|volume=9|issue=1|pages=55–72|doi=10.1111/j.2044-835X.1991.tb00862.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moore, C.|editor1-last=Zelazo|editor1-first=P.D.|editor2-last=Astington|editor2-first=J.W.|editor3-last=Olson|editor3-first=D.R.|title=Developing theories of intention|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an understanding of intention may develop as the child develops a theory of mind and begins to use pointing to convey meaning about referents in the world.

=== Embodiment perspective ===

The [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] hypothesis holds that cognition arises out of an individual's physical interactions with the environment.  In this way, environment and behavior are an integral part of cognition and what psychologists conceive of as ‘mental representations’ are indistinguishable from perception and action (e.g. Smith, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|title=Cognition as a dynamic system: Principles from embodiment|journal=Developmental Review|date=2005|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=278–298|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The ontogenetic development of social cognition may be thought of as intertwined with the development pointing actions. According to this perspective, gestures are not just indicators of development but play a key role in how children come to develop advanced social cognition, including understanding of object-directed relations and human intention. In particular, engaging in physical actions oneself may provide insight into the structure of another's actions (eventually leading to a more nuanced understanding of another's mind).&lt;ref name="Meltzoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barresi and M" /&gt;

One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants’ reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions.&lt;ref name="Gerson and W"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerson, S.|author2=Woodward, A.|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=S.P.|title=Neoconstructivism: The New Science of Cognitive Development|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199864072|chapter=Building Intentional Action Knowledge with One’s Hands}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are generally able to produce actions around the same time they are considered to be capable of understanding the actions in others.  For instance, Woodward and Guajardo (2002)&lt;ref name="Woodward and G" /&gt; found a correlation between children's ability to produce points (either during the experience or based on parental report of pointing at home) and their understanding of object-directed pointing (as evidenced by a preference for looking at a new object rather than a new hand path in a habituation paradigm) by 12 months. In addition, Brune and Woodward (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brune|first1=C.W.|last2=Woodward|first2=A.L.|title=Social cognition and social responsiveness in 10-month-old infants|journal=Journal of Cognition and Development|date=2007|volume=8|issue=2|pages=133–158|doi=10.1080/15248370701202331}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that infants who produce object-directed points tended to have an understanding of pointing and infants who engaged in shared attention tended to have an understanding of eye gaze.  Although the findings are correlational, they support the idea that actions may facilitate cognitive understanding. It is unclear whether self-produced pointing gestures causally influence an understanding of pointing as relational; however, there is experimental evidence which suggests that infants supported in a new action skill will subsequently develop an understanding of that action.&lt;ref name="Gerson and W" /&gt; For instance, infants allowed to grasp objects with Velcro mittens gained an understanding of object-directed grasping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=Jessica A.|last2=Woodward|first2=Amanda L.|last3=Needham|first3=Amy|title=Action experience alters 3-month-old infants' perception of others' actions|journal=Cognition|date=May 2005|volume=96|issue=1|pages=B1–B11|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.07.004|pmid=15833301|pmc=3908452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-cultural perspective ===

A social-cultural perspective includes the notion that not just actions, but partaking in social interactions and [[cooperation]] (both observing and acting) are key to both ontogenetic social development and responsible for larger cultural institutions, symbol systems, and other human social abilities (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tomasello2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Carpenter|first2=Malinda|last3=Call|first3=Josep|last4=Behne|first4=Tanya|last5=Moll|first5=Henrike|title=Understanding and sharing intentions: The origins of cultural cognition|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2005|volume=28|issue=05|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000129|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/staff/carpenter/pdf/Tomasello_et_al05sharing_intentions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

This social-cultural perspective is derived from the Vygotskian view that higher cognitive functions originate in relations between individuals. The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized.&lt;ref name=Vygotsky&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vygotsky|first1=L.S.|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=John-Steiner|editor2-first=V.|editor3-last=Scribner|editor3-first=S.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Souberman|editor4-first=E.|title=Mind in society: The development of higher psychological processes|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0674576284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing, according to Vygotsky, starts out as an attempt to grab a desired object. Then, a transitional gesture develops in which the individual reaches toward the object when it is desired as a cue to another to retrieve it. This transitional gesture, says Vygotsky, is an important step toward language in that participation in these social interactions are internalized and become an understanding of the psychological functions of others. Thus, pointing is an example of the internalization process that occurs over a long series of developmental events. These gestures help children to gain an understanding of triadic interactions, as the gestures go from being simply about the objects to being specifically directed at people and conveying intention toward others.&lt;ref name="Vygotsky" /&gt;

Tomasello and colleagues proposed a social-cultural perspective for understanding human affinity for advanced social cognition (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;). This view takes from Vygotsky's theory the idea that social interactions (such as pointing) are not just indicative of higher cognitive functions, such as understanding intention, but play an important role in shaping them. They argue that advanced cognitive abilities are derived from the tendency to cooperate and engage in collaborative activities (e.g. Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;).

It was originally suspected that such foundational cognitive skills leading to advanced social understanding lie in the human ability to understand another's intention. Humans seem to have an affinity for figuring out what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, believing, etc. For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Kruger|first2=Ann Cale|last3=Ratner|first3=Hilary Horn|title=Cultural learning|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2010|volume=16|issue=03|pages=495|doi=10.1017/S0140525X0003123X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, understanding intentions is unlikely to be a species-specific ability.&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;

Tomasello and colleagues argue that it is possible to break down the advanced understanding of shared [[intentionality]] into two developmental pathways that eventually become intertwined:

# The ability to understand others as goal-directed and intentional agents and
# A species-unique tendency to share emotions, events, and activities. Other species, such as great apes, understand the basics of intentionality; however, they do not exhibit behavior that suggests a willingness to engage in shared attention.&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt;

This claim may be further investigated by examining the functional origins of pointing.  It is possible that the pointing exhibited by other species is different in purpose and origin from the pointing said to be indicative of a developing psychological understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cochet|first1=Hélène|last2=Vauclair|first2=Jacques|title=Pointing gestures produced by toddlers from 15 to 30 months: Different functions, hand shapes and laterality patterns|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|date=2010|volume=33|issue=4|pages=431–441|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2010.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former, referred to as imperative pointing, was originally described by Vygotsky (1978)&lt;ref name="Vygotsky" /&gt; as pointing which begins in an attempt to reach for a desired object. When another retrieves the desired object, the individual learns to associate the gesture (typically hand and all fingers extended outward) with a communicated intention to acquire the desired object. However, research suggests not all points develop in this way. A study by Bates, Camaioni and Volterra (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=E.|last2=Camaioni|first2=L.|last3=Volterra|first3=V.|title=The acquisition of performatives prior to speech|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=1975|volume=21|issue=3|pages=205–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished between imperative and declarative gestures. Imperative gestures were described as those directed at an adult in order to obtain an object, while declarative gestures were those simply intended to obtain adult attention. Both types of gestures are social in nature; however, declarative pointing is thought to be linked to more advanced social understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tomasello, M.|editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Dunham|editor2-first=P.J.|title=Joint attention: Its origin and role in development|date=1995|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=080581437X|pages=103–130|chapter=Joint attention as social cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pika|first1=S.|title=Gestures of apes and pre-linguistic human children: Similar or different?|journal=First Language|date=2008|volume=28|issue=2|pages=116–140|doi=10.1177/0142723707080966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declarative gestures may involve more complex social and cooperative skills, linked to the development of communication skills (e.g. Liszkowski et al., 2005&lt;ref name=Liszkowski2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liszkowski|first1=Ulf|title=Human twelve-month-olds point cooperatively to share interest with and helpfully provide information for a communicative partner|journal=Gesture|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135–154|doi=10.1075/gest.5.1.11lis}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For instance, Camaioni and colleagues found that declarative pointing was related to an understanding of adult's intentions, while imperative gestures were not related.&lt;ref name=Camaioni2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camaioni|first1=L.|last2=Perucchini|first2=P.|last3=Bellagamba|first3=F.|last4=Colonnesi|first4=C.|title=The Role of Declarative Pointing in Developing a Theory of Mind|journal=Infancy|date=2004|volume=5|issue=3|pages=291–308|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0503_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a social-cultural perspective, it is not the actions of pointing themselves, but the tendency to engage in cooperative actions (as indicated by elements such as shared intentionality and declarative pointing) that determines the advanced social-cognitive status of normally developing humans. These cooperative actions reveal an understanding of intention and may be for the sole purpose of interacting or cooperating rather than achieving an end. It may be that declarative pointing (typically exhibited by normally developing children but not children with autism), rather than imperative pointing, is indicative of the tendency to engage in the cooperative interactions believed to be important for developing advanced social-cognitive understanding. This fits in with Tomasello and colleagues’ conception that triadic social interactions in which child and adult engage in cooperative actions with shared intention are not only indicative of advanced social-cognitive ability but critical to the development of it.&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello2005" /&gt; During these interactions, children gradually begin to conceptualize both first- and third-person perspectives, gaining a “bird’s eye view” of social interactions.&lt;ref name="Moll and T" /&gt;  Both the embodiment and social cultural perspectives share the principle that gestures are not just indicators of development, but play an important role in how children come to understand object-directed relations and human intention.

==Gaze and attentional acts==
Research suggests that faces are pivotal in offering social cues necessary for children's cognitive, language, and social development. These cues may offer information on another's emotional state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassili|first1=J.N.|title=On-line Cognition in Person Perception|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekman|first1=P.|title=Emotion in the Human Face|date=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus of attention,&lt;ref name=Langton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langton|first1=S.R.|title=The mutual influence of gaze and head orientation in the analysis of social attention direction.|journal=The Quarterly journal of experimental psychology.

Intention may be ascribed to an individual based on where in space that individual is attending. Intention is understood not only through actions and the manipulation of objects, but by tracking eye movements.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt; Research in this area is focused on how humans develop the understanding that eye gaze indicates that the observer may be psychologically connected to the referent.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;

Even as infants, humans are able to follow the gaze of others. Further research has aimed to test whether infants are simply inclined to look in the direction of head movements, without any real understanding of another individual's psychological state.&lt;ref name="Malle" /&gt;  Brooks (1999) found that children do not direct attention simply toward the visual hemisphere of novel head movements; rather, children as young as 15 months attend to object-directed eye gaze, suggesting that children are attending to referents to which others attend, and are not simply gazing in a similar direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=R.|title=Infant understanding of seeing as a referential event|date=1991|publisher=UMI Dissertations Publishing|isbn=0599235667|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304492238?accountid=14512}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results support the idea that infants understand eye gaze as an indicator of another individual's psychological state, which is a basic component of understanding that others may have intentions separate from one's own.

==Biological motion and inferring intention==
Neuroimaging research suggests that biological motion is processed differently from other types of motion. Biological motion is processed as a category in which individuals are able to infer intention.&lt;ref name=Blakemore&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakemore|first1=SJ|last2=Decety|first2=J|title=From the perception of action to the understanding of intention.|journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience|date=2001|volume=2|issue=8|pages=561–7|pmid=11483999|doi=10.1038/35086023}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others. Research on biological motion has found cells in the primate superior temporal polysensory area (STP) that respond specifically to biological motion.&lt;ref name=Baizer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baizer|first1=JS|last2=Ungerleider|first2=LG|last3=Desimone|first3=R|title=Organization of visual inputs to the inferior temporal and posterior parietal cortex in macaques.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=168–90|pmid=1702462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are brain regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, that respond to biological but not non-biological motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oram|first1=MW|last2=Perrett|first2=DI|title=Responses of Anterior Superior Temporal Polysensory (STPa) Neurons to "Biological Motion" Stimuli.|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=1994|volume=6|issue=2|pages=99–116|pmid=23962364|doi=10.1162/jocn.1994.6.2.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=ED|last2=Blake|first2=R|title=Brain Areas Active during Visual Perception of Biological Motion.|journal=Neuron|date=2002|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1167–75|pmid=12354405|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00897-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings suggest that humans may have a biologically-based affinity for spotting and interpreting purposeful, biological motions.

In one experiment, 18-month-olds observed either a human or a mechanical arm attempting to perform actions, but failing to achieve a goal.  The children imitated the action to complete the intended goal when the arm was human, but not when it was mechanical. This suggests that from a young age, humans are able to infer intention specifically as a biological mechanism between motions and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meltzoff|first1=A. N.|title=Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1995|volume=31|issue=5|pages=838–850|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838|pmid=25147406|pmc=4137788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have a tendency to infer intention from motion, even in the absence of other distinguishing features (e.g. body shape, emotional expression). This was demonstrated in a study by Heider and Simmel;&lt;ref name=Heider&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=Fritz|last2=Simmel|first2=Marianne|title=An Experimental Study of Apparent Behavior|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=1944|volume=57|issue=2|pages=243|doi=10.2307/1416950}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had observers view videos of moving triangles, and found that participants tended to attribute intentions and even personality traits to the shapes based on their movements. The movement had to be animate, meaning self-propelled and non-linear.&lt;ref name="Heider" /&gt;

Johansson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Gunnar|title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1973|volume=14|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.3758/BF03212378}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised a way to study biological motion without interference from other characteristics of humans such as body shape, or emotional expression.  He attached dots of light to actors' joints and recorded the movements in a dark environment, so that only the dots of light were visible.  The Johansson figures, as they came to be known, have been used to demonstrate that individuals attribute mental states, such as desires and intentions to movements, that are otherwise disconnected from context.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt;

==Simulation theory==
The [[simulation hypothesis]] holds that in order to understand intention in others, individuals must observe an action, and then infer the actor's intentions by [[estimating]] what their own actions and intentions might be in the situation.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt; Individuals connect their own actions to internal mental states through the experience of sensory information when movements are carried out; this sensory information is stored and connected to one's own intentions. Since internal mental states, such as intention, cannot be understood directly through observing movements, it is hypothesized that these internal states are inferred based on one's own stored representations of those movements.&lt;ref name="Blakemore" /&gt;

This theory is supported by research on [[mirror neuron]]s, or neural regions, including the premotor cortex, and parietal cortex, that activate both when individuals are engaging in an action, and when they are observing the actions of others. This suggests individuals may be simulating the motor movements via internal representations of their own motor movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallese|first1=Vittorio|last2=Fadiga|first2=Luciano|last3=Fogassi|first3=Leonardo|last4=Rizzolatti|first4=Giacomo|title=Action recognition in the premotor cortex|journal=Brain|date=1996|volume=119|issue=2|pages=593–609|doi=10.1093/brain/119.2.593|pmid=8800951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallese|first1=V|title=Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1998|volume=2|issue=12|pages=493–501|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5|pmid=21227300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, research indicates that humans are hard-wired to notice biological motion, infer intention, and use previous mental representations to predict future actions of others.

==Intentions and behaviors==
Although human behavior is extremely complex and still remains unpredictable, psychologists are trying to understand the influential factors in the process of forming intentions and performing actions. The theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior are comprehensive theories that specify a limited number of psychological variables that can influence behavior, namely (a) intention; (b) attitude toward the behavior; (c) subjective norm; (d) perceived behavioral control; and (e) behavioral, normative and control beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., Bandura, A., [[Triandis, H. C.]], Kanfer, F. H., Becker, M. H., &amp; Middlestadt, S. E. (1992). Factors influencing behavior and behavior change (Report prepared for the National Institute of Mental Health).Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[theory of reasoned action]], intention is influenced by people's attitude toward performing the behavior and the subjective norm. However, the level of perceived control is believed to be influential on people's behavioral intention along with their attitude and subjective norms, according to the [[theory of planned behavior]]. Not surprisingly, in most studies, intention is driven by attitudes to a greater extent than by subjective norms.&lt;ref name="Eagly, A. H. 1993"&gt;Eagly, A. H., &amp; Chaiken, S. (1993). The psychology of attitudes. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

The predictive validity of the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a .63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of .76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I. | last2 = Fishbein | first2 = M. | year = 1973 | title = Attitudinal and normative variables as predictors of specific behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 41–57 | doi=10.1037/h0034440}}&lt;/ref&gt; With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of .53 and .62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of .66 and .68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppard | first1 = B.

R. | year = 1988 | title = The theory of reasoned action: A meta-analysis of past research with recommendations for modifications and future research | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–343 | doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Putte, B. (1991). 20 years of the theory of reasoned action of Fishbein and Ajzen: A meta-analysis. Unpublished manuscript. University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; All these studies have reflected the strong correlation that exists between people's attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations do not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people's life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the action in question if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people's perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to perform certain actions.&lt;ref name="Eagly, A. H. 1993"/&gt; Research has also shown that people are more likely to perform an action if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the action appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = B. T. | last3 = Fishbein | first3 = M. | last4 = Muellerleile | first4 = P. | year = 2001 | title = Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior as models of condom use: A meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 142–161 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.142 | pmid=11271752 | pmc=4780418}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and enjoy your time can greatly influence your attitude towards drinking after work. The next factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention to drink after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitudes towards drinking and whether society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically how much confidence you have in controlling how much you will drink. If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and more consistent your original intention will become. As a result, the greater the likelihood you will have some drinks in the future.

How people think about and verbally communicate their own intentions also impacts these intentions. For example, asking a question about prior behaviors using the imperfective aspect of language seems to be able to bring out stronger intentions to perform such a behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conner | first1 = M. | last2 = Godin | first2 = G. | last3 = Norman | first3 = P. | last4 = Sheeran | first4 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Using the question-behavior effect to promote disease prevention behaviors: two randomized controlled trials | doi = 10.1037/a0023036 | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 300–309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''World Atlas of Language Structures'', "[[Imperfective Aspects]]" refers to a specific form of language structure used for reference to the present and the future but also for ongoing and habitual events in the past. For example, ‘He writes/is writing/wrote/was writing/will write letters.’&lt;ref&gt;Östen Dahl, Viveka Velupillai. 2013. Perfective/Imperfective Aspect. In: Dryer, Matthew S. &amp; Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Retrieved from http://wals.info/chapter/65 on 2015-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; People are more likely to interpret the event as ongoing, and likely to resume the action in the future when it has been described with the imperfective verb aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Madden | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Zwaan | first2 = R.A. | year = 2003 | title = How does verb aspect constrain event representations? | doi = 10.3758/BF03196106 | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 663–672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Liroz, F. (2010). Web created by F. Liroz Professor in Spanish Language Department at American School of Madrid, Spain, (date Feb. 6, 2012), http://fernando.liroz.es/m/estverbo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research has showed that both information on past behavior and their attitude towards such behavior play crucial roles in predicting people's future behavioral tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I., &amp; Fishbein, M. (2000). Attitudes and the attitude-behavior relation: Reasoned and automatic processes. In W. Stroebe &amp; M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (pp. 1-33).

When participants described a past episode using the present tense, they consistently used the more concrete past behavior as a basis for their intentions. In contrast, when participants described a past episode using the past tense, they consistently used the more abstract attitude as a basis for their intentions.&lt;ref name=VerbIntention&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carrera | first1 = P. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = The present projects past behavior into the future while the past projects attitudes into the future: How verb tense moderates predictors of drinking intentions | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2012.04.001 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume =  48| issue = | pages =  1196–1200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jalal Al-e-Ahmad''' ({{lang-fa|جلال آل‌احمد}}; December 2, 1923 – September 9, 1969) was a prominent [[Iran]]ian novelist, short-story writer, translator, philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;Sena Karasipahi, ''Muslims in Modern Turkey: Kemalism, Modernism and the Revolt of the Islamic Intellectuals'', I.B.Tauris (2008), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; socio-political critic, [[sociologist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[William O. Beeman]], ''The Great Satan Vs. the Mad Mullahs: How the United States and Iran Demonize Each Other'', University of Chicago Press (2008), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who was "one of the earliest and most prominent of contemporary Iranian [[ethnography|ethnographers]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nematollah Fazeli]], "Politics of Culture in Iran", Routledge (2006), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the term ''[[gharbzadegi]]'' – variously translated in English as "westernstruck", "westoxification", and "Occidentosis" –,&lt;ref name=brumberg/&gt; producing a holistic ideological [[Anti-Western sentiment|critique of the West]] "which combined strong themes of [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]".&lt;ref&gt;Emory C. Bogle, ''Islam: Origin and Belief'', University of Texas Press (1998), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jalal was born in [[Tehran]], into a religious family – his father was a cleric – "originally from the village of Aurazan in the [[Taleqan County|Taliqan district]] bordering [[Mazandaran]] in [[northern Iran]], and in due time Jalal was to travel there, exerting himself actively for the welfare of the villagers and devoting to them the first of his anthropological monographs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hamid Algar]], "Introduction" in Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Occidentosis: A Plague From the West'', Mizan Press (1984), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He was a cousin of [[Mahmoud Taleghani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1395/06/18/1181564/%D9%87%D9%85%D9%87-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%DA%A9%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%86%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%D8%AA%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%AF | title=All written relics of Jalal / the author  who is not tired of writing | publisher=Tasnim | accessdate=20 September 2016 | author=8  September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After elementary school Al-e-Ahmad was sent to earn a living in the Tehran bazaar, but also attended Marvi Madreseh for a religious education, and without his father's permission, night classes at the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Fonun]]. He went to Seminary of [[Najaf]] in 1944 but returned home very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MP6qCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=jalal+al+ahmad+najaf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SszTZwd710&amp;sig=crxE6ZTjCcxxb2gPvzgivQvjxkM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT743fwJ3PAhXpD8AKHW88DmMQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jalal%20al%20ahmad%20najaf&amp;f=false | title=Shi'i Reformation in Iran: The Life and Theology of Shari’at Sangelaji | publisher=Routledge | author=Ali Rahnema | pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became "acquainted with the speech and words of [[Ahmad Kasravi]]" and was unable to commit to the clerical career his father and brother had hoped he would take, describing it as "a snare in the shape of a cloak and an [[Abaya|aba]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.288&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his family as a religious family in the autobiographical sketch that published after his death in 1967.&lt;ref name="ĀL-E AḤMAD, JALĀL"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/al-e-ahmad-jalal-1302-48-s | title=ĀL-E AḤMAD, JALĀL | publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=11 September 2016 | author=J. W. Clinton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he earned an M.A. in [[Persian literature]] from Tehran Teachers College&lt;ref&gt;Boroujerdi, Mehrzad. Iranian Intellectuals and the West: The Tormented Triumph of Nativism. 1996. p.187&lt;/ref&gt; and became a teacher, at the same time making a sharp break with his religious family that left him "completely on his own resources."&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued academic studies further and enrolled in a doctoral program of [[Persian literature]] at [[Tehran University]] but quit before he had defended his dissertation in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Boroujerdi, Mehrzad. Iranian Intellectuals and the West: The Tormented Triumph of Nativism. 1996. p.65&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he married [[Simin Daneshvar]], a well-known [[Persian people|Persian]] [[novelist]]. Jalal and Simin were infertile, a topic that was reflected in some of Jalal's works.

He died in Asalem, a rural region in the north of Iran, inside a cottage which was built almost entirely by himself. He was buried in Firouzabadi [[mosque]] in [[Ray, Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photograph of Jalal Al-e-Ahmad's grave|url=http://www.mehrnews.com/fa/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=1205024|publisher=[[Mehr News Agency]]|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commons and his wife, Simin, believe he was poisoned by [[Savak]].&lt;ref name="chamber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bashiri"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Authors/AAhmad.html | title=Al-i Ahmad, Jalal | publisher=angelfire | accessdate=22 September 2016 | author=Iraj Bashiri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Tehran Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Department bought the house in which both Jalal Al-e Ahmad and his brother Shams were born and lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1216574 l-e Ahmad patrimony in Tehran obtained] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013051043/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/newsdetail.aspx?NewsID=1216574 |date=October 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Al-e-Ahmad is perhaps most famous for using the term [[Gharbzadegi]], originally coined by [[Ahmad Fardid]] and variously translated in English as weststruckness, westoxification and occidentosis - in a book by the same name ''Occidentosis: A Plague from the West'', self-published by Al-e Ahmad in Iran in 1962. In the book Al-e-Ahmad developed a "stinging critique of western technology, and by implication of Western `civilization` itself". He argued that the decline of traditional Iranian industries such as carpet-weaving were the beginning of Western "economic and existential victories over the East." &lt;ref name=brumberg&gt;Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of Western technology and mechanization was influenced, through [[Ahmad Fardid]], by [[Heidegger]], and he also considered [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] as another seminal philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mehrzad Boroujerdi, ''Iranian Intellectuals and the West: The Tormented Triumph of Nativism'', Syracuse University Press (1996), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; There was also [[Ernst Jünger]], to whom Jalal ascribe a major part in the genealogy of his famous book, and he goes on to say "Junger and I were both exploring more or less the same subject, but from two viewpoints. We were addressing the same question, but in two languages."&lt;ref&gt;Jalal Al-e Ahmad, ''Occidentosis: A Plague From the West'', Mizan Press (1984), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

His message was embraced by the Ayatollah [[Khomeini]], who wrote in 1971 that &lt;blockquote&gt;"The poisonous culture of [[imperialism]] [is] penetrating to the depths of towns and villages throughout the Muslim world, displacing the culture of the [[Qur'an]], recruiting our youth en masse to the service of foreigners and imperialists..."&lt;ref&gt;"Message to the Pilgrims" (Message sent to Iranian pilgrims on Hajj in Saudi Arabia from Khomeini in exile in Najaf) February 6, 1971, ''Islam and Revolution: Writings and Declarations of Imam Khomeini'', (1981), p.195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and became part of the ideology of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] which emphasized [[nationalization]] of industry, independence in all areas of life from both the Soviet and the Western world, and "self-sufficiency" in economics.

He's also one of the main influences of [[Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;Avideh Mayville, "The Religious Ideology of Reform in Iran" in [[J. Harold Ellens]] (ed.), ''Winning Revolutions: The Psychosocial Dynamics of Revolts for Freedom, Fairness, and Rights [3 volumes]'', ABC-CLIO (2013), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse of authenticity==

Ali Mirsepasi believes that Jalal is concerned with the discourse of authenticity along with Shariati. According to Mirsepasi, Jalal extended his critiques of the hegemonic power of west. The critique is centered on the concept of westoxication. Al Ahamad attacks to secular intellectual with the concept. He believes that the intellectuals could not construct effectively an authentically Iranian modernity. In this occasion, he posed the concept of “return” to an Islamic culture which is authentic at the same time. Jalal believed for avoiding the homogenizing and alienating forces of modernity it is necessary to return to roots of Islamic culture. Of course the discourse by Jalal was a few complicated politically. In fact, Al Ahmad wanted to reimagine modernity with Iranian-Islamic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZ7Hmo5_7cgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intellectual+discourse+and+the+politics+of+modernization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE5r_T4ZTSAhWDFJoKHf67B_wQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intellectual%20discourse%20and%20the%20politics%20of%20modernization&amp;f=false|author=Ali Mirsepasi|title=intellectual discourse and the politics of modernization|year=2000|page=96|publisher=Cambridge  University|isbn=0521650003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activism===
Al-e-Ahmad joined the communist [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party]] along with his mentor [[Khalil Maleki]] shortly after World War II. They "were too independent for the party" and resigned in protest over the lack of democracy and the "nakedly pro-Soviet" support for Soviet demands for oil concession and occupation of Iranian Azerbaijan. They formed an alternative party the Socialist Society of the Iranian Masses in January 1948 but disbanded it a few days later when Radio Moscow attacked it, unwilling to publicly oppose "what they considered the world's most progressive nations." Nonetheless, the dissent of Al-e-Ahmad and Maleki marked "the end of the near hegemony of the party over intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.290&lt;/ref&gt;

He later helped found the pro-[[Mossadegh]] Toilers Party, one of the component parties of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]], and then in 1952 a new party called the Third Force. Following the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]] Al-e-Ahmad was imprisoned for several years and "so completely lost faith in party politics" that he signed a letter of repentance published in an Iranian newspaper declaring that he had "resigned from the Third Force, and ... completely abandoned politics."&lt;ref&gt;Mottahedeh, Roy, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'', One World, Oxford, 1985, 2000, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; However, he remained a part of the Third Force political group, attending its meetings, and continuing to follow the political mentorship of Khalil Maleki until their deaths in 1969.In 1963, visited Israel for two weeks, and in his account of his trip stated that the fusion of the religious and the secular he discerned in Israel afforded a potential model for the state of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Shatz, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n04/adam-shatz/israels-putinisation 'Israel’s Putinisation,'] [[The London Review of Books]] Vol. 38 No. 4 · 18 February 2016 pages 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his relationship with the secular Third Force group, Al-e-Ahmad became more sympathetic to the need for religious leadership in the transformation of Iranian politics, especially after the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/04/homa-katouzian-on-khalil-maleki-part-2-debunking-conspiracy-theory.html |title=Homa Katouzian on Khalil Maleki &amp;#124; Part 2: Debunking Conspiracy Theory - Tehran Bureau |publisher=PBS |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary life==


Al-e-Ahmad used a colloquial style in prose. In this sense, he is a follower of avant-garde Persian novelists like [[Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh]]. Since the subjects of his works (novels, essays, travelogues and ethnographic monographs) are usually cultural, social and political issues, symbolic representations and sarcastic expressions are regular patterns of his books. A distinct characteristic of his writings is his honest examination of subjects, regardless of possible reactions from political, social or religious powers.

On invitation of [[Richard Nelson Frye]], Al-e-Ahmad spent a summer at [[Harvard University]], as part of a Distinguished Visiting Fellowship program established by [[Henry Kissinger]] for supporting promising Iranian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard Nelson|title=Greater Iran: A 20th-century Odyssey|date=2005|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9781568592893|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-e-Ahmad rigorously supported [[Nima Yushij]] (father of modern [[Persian poetry]]) and had an important role in acceptance of Nima's revolutionary style.

In "a short but prolific career", his writings "came to fill over thirty-five volumes."&lt;ref&gt;Dr Stephanie Cronin, ''Reformers and Revolutionaries in Modern Iran: New Perspectives on the Iranian Left'', Routledge (2013), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jizang''' ({{zh|c=吉藏|p=Jízàng|w=Chi-tsang}}. Japanese: {{Nihongo|吉蔵|kichizō}}) (549–623) was a Persian-[[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] [[bhikkhu|monk]] and scholar who is often regarded as the founder of [[East Asian Mādhyamaka]]. He is also known as Jiaxiang or Master Jiaxiang ({{zh|t=嘉祥|w=chia hsiang}}) because he acquired fame at the Jiaxiang Temple.

==Biography==
Jizang was born in Jinling (modern [[Nanjing]]). Although his father had emigrated from [[Parthia]], he was educated in the Chinese manner. He was quite precocious in spiritual matters, and became a monk at age seven.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sourcebook, vol. II, p. 292; cited in Allen Fox, "Jizang", ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Ian McGreal, ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was young, he studied with [[Falang (Buddhist)|Falang]] (法朗, 507-581) at the Xinghuang Temple (興皇寺) in Nanjing, and studied the three [[Madhyamaka]] treatises ([[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā|The Treatise on the Middle Way]], The Treatise on the Twelve Gates, and The One-Hundred-Verse Treatise) which had been translated by [[Kumarajiva]] more than a century before, and it is with these texts that he is most often identified. He became the head monk at Xinghuang Temple upon Falang's death in 581. At age 42, he began travelling through China giving lectures, and ultimately settled at Jiaxing Temple, in modern [[Shaoxing]] (紹興), [[Zhejiang]] province.

In 597, Yang Kuang, later [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]], the second son of [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Sui Dynasty]], ordered four new [[List of Buddhist temples|temples]] in the capital [[Chang'an]], and invited Jizang to be in charge of one of them, called Huiri Temple (彗日寺).&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E., Lopez, Donald S. Jr. (2014). The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, Princeton: Princeton University Press; p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; Jizang accepted, despite the fame of Yang's harshness. [[Zhiyi]] (538–597 CE), a respected figure of the [[Tiantai]] school, had accepted to become monk at another one of the new temples, and Jizang sought to visit him, but unfortunately he died before Jizang was able to meet him.&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;Lin Sen-shou, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090705114116/http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/2004wi/qw8.htm Chi Tsang], The Tzu Chi Vol. 11 No. 4, Winter 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, able to correspond with him regarding the [[Lotus Sutra]].&lt;ref name="soka"&gt;{{Cite book | last = The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism | publisher = Soka Gakkai | year = 2002 | location = Tōkyō | pages = | url = http://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/C/58#para-0 | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-4-412-01205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he moved to another new temple, Riyan Temple (日嚴寺). When the Sui Dynasty was succeeded by the Tang Dynasty in 617, he gained the respect and support of the new emperor, [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Gaozu]] as well, and became head abbot of four temples.

Between ages 57 and 68, he sought to make more copies of the Lotus Sutra so that more people could be familiar with it. He produced 2,000 copies of the sutra. He also made copies of some of his own commentaries.&lt;ref name="lin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soka"/&gt;

Jizang was a prodigious writer, producing close to 50 books in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="lin"/&gt; He specialized in commentaries on the three treatises as well as texts from other Buddhist traditions, such as the Lotus and [[Nirvana Sutra|Nirvana]] sutras.&lt;ref name="soka"/&gt; His students included [[Ekan]], Korean by nationality, who brought the Three Treatise School to Japan.

==Philosophy==
The general outlook of the Madhyamaka school is that commitments or attachments to anything, including a [[logic]]al viewpoint, lead to ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering).&lt;ref&gt;Allen Fox, "Jizang", ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Ian McGreal, ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; In commenting on Buddhist treatises, Jizang developed a general methodology of ''poxie xianzheng'' ("refuting what is misleading, revealing what is corrective"), by-passing the pitfalls of asserting the truth or falsehood of certain propositions in a final or rigid sense, but using them if they pragmatically lead to the ability to overcome the commitment to dichotomy. He noted that the tendency of many Buddhists to become committed to becoming unattached (''[[shunyata]]'' or "emptying") is also itself a commitment that should be avoided. One can avoid this by engaging in the same deconstruction that allowed liberation in the first place, but applied to the false dichotomy between attachment and non-attachment (''shūnyatā shūnyatā'', or "emptying of emptiness").

Applying this to the traditional two levels of discourse inherited from the Madhyamaka tradition (the conventional, regarding everyday thoughts, and the authentic, which transcends this by analyzing the metaphysical assumptions made in the conventional thinking), Jizang developed his ''sizhong erdi'' ("four levels of the two kinds of discourse"), which takes that distinction and adds [[meta]]distinctions on three more levels:
# The assumption of [[existence]] is conventional, and the idea of nonexistence is authentic.
# The commitment to a distinction between existence and nonexistence is now considered conventional, and the denial of this duality is authentic.
# The distinction between committing to a distinction between existence and nonexistence is now conventional, and the denial of the difference between duality and non-duality is authentic.
# All of these distinctions are deemed conventional, and the authentic discourse regards that any point of view cannot be said to be ultimately true, and is useful only so far as it is corrective in the above sense.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Fox, "Jizang", ''Great Thinkers of the Eastern World'', Ian McGreal, ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. Page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the attachment to any viewpoint is considered detrimental, and is a cause of life's [[suffering]]. To repudiate the misleading finality of any viewpoint, on any level of discourse, is thus corrective and helps overcome destructive attachment.

{{Jainism}}
The '''Jīva''' or '''Atman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ən}}; {{lang-sa|आत्मन्}}) is a philosophical term used within [[Jainism]] to identify the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref name=britjivajain/&gt; As per the [[Jain cosmology]], ''jīva'' or soul is the principle of [[sentience]] and is one of the ''[[tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]]'' or one of the fundamental substances forming part of the universe. The Jain metaphysics, states Jagmanderlal Jaini, divides the universe into two independent, everlasting, co-existing and uncreated categories called the ''jiva'' (soul) and the ''ajiva'' (non-soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagmanderlal Jaini|title=Outlines of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7sKgdtJcisC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-61567-0|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic premise of Jainism makes it a dualistic philosophy.{{sfn|Jaini|2013|p=1}} The ''jiva'', according to Jainism, is an essential part of how the process of [[karma]], [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] and the process of liberation from rebirth works.&lt;ref name=long93/&gt;

== Soul substance ==
Jains regard soul as one of the six fundamental and eternal substances (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravyas]]'') which forms the universe. The two states of soul substance are mentioned in the Jain texts. These are — Svābhva (pure or natural) and Vibhāva (impure or unnatural state). Souls in transmigration are in impure state and liberated ones are said to be in natural or pure state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wnoRAQAAIAAJ|p=16|title=Ācārya Kundakunda's Pañcāstikāya-sāra|author1=Kundakunda|first1=Acharya|last2=Chakravarti|first2=Appaswami|last3=Upādhye|first3=Ādinātha Neminātha|year=2001|isbn=978-81-263-1813-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jain philosophy]] is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates matter from the soul.&lt;ref name=britjivajain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya - Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Theosophist'', "some religionists hold that Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are identical, while others assert that they are distinct ; but a Jain will say that Atman and Paramatman are identical as well as distinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEEcAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA553|year=1609|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|pages=553|quote=For instance, some religionists hold that Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are one, while others assert that they are distinct; but a Jain will say that Atman and Paramatman are one as well as distinct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five vows of Jain practice are believed in Jainism to aid in freeing the ''jīva'' from karmic matter, reduce negative karmic effects and accrue positive karmic benefits.&lt;ref name=long93&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|year=2009|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-625-5|pages=93–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Souls and rebirth ===
[[File:Atman.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the concept of soul (in transmigration) in Jainism. Golden color represents ''nokarma'' – the quasi-karmic matter, Cyan color depicts ''dravya karma''– the subtle karmic matter, orange represents the ''bhav karma''– the psycho-physical karmic matter and White depicts ''sudhatma'', the pure consciousness.]]
[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (Transmigrating Souls) as per Jainism.]]

According to Jain philosophy, rebirth occurs through soul. Depending on the karmic particles attached to a soul, Jain theology states a being is reborn in one of four ''gatis'' (states of existence), namely, heavenly being (''[[Deva (Jainism)|deva]]''), human (''manushya''), hell being (''naraki'') and animals and plants (''[[triyancha]]'').{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=108}} Besides this there also exist a sub-microscopic life form, [[Nigoda]], possessing only one sense, i.e., of touch.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=109}}

In Jain beliefs, souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain [[moksha]] (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] style [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or [[Madhyamaka|Advaya]] style nondualism of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"/&gt;

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient [[Ajivika]], but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=228}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S. Jaini|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1691-6|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from ''Saṃsāra''.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's {{IAST|Saṃsāra}}.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen&gt;[[Lambert Schmithausen]] (1991), Buddhism and Nature, Studia Philologica Buddhica, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo Japan, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece (1999), Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1990), Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition, in ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4612-4458-5}}, pages 168-177;&lt;br&gt;L Alsdorf (1962), Beiträge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, F. Steiner Wiesbaden, pages 592-593&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real Self ==
According to the Jain text, [[Samayasāra]]:
{{quote|Know that the ''Jiva'' (soul) which rests on pure faith, knowledge, and conduct, alone is the Real Self. The one which is conditioned by the karmic matter is to be known as the impure self. – Verse 1-2-2}}

According to Vijay Jain, the souls which rest on the pure self are called the Real Self, and only ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' and ''Siddhas'' are the Real Self.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=3}}

== Stages of spiritual development==
{{Main|Gunasthana}}
Jain texts explain that there are fourteen stages of spiritual development called ''[[Gunasthana]]''.

The '''Legend of Saint Margaret''' ({{lang-hu|Szent Margit legendája}}) is an important piece of [[Mediaeval]] [[Hungarian literature]]. The only specimen of the text was preserved in the Margaret Codex, copied by [[Lea Ráskay]] in 1510. The legend tells the life and deeds of [[Saint Margaret of Hungary]]. 

==The Margaret Codex==
The Margaret Codex is a copy of a lost earlier book. The legend was originally denoted in [[Latin language|Latin]] in the 14th century, and soon was translated to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The document was copied in 1510 by the famous early 16th century [[Hungary|Hungarian]] nun, [[Lea Ráskay]]. Ráskay is also valued by posterity for saving a number of other [[History of Hungarian#Old Hungarian|Old Hungarian]] works.

She did not simply copy the book, but also applied her own [[orthography]], and added several [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es.

==Significance==
The legend reveals many less known parts of the life of [[Saint Margaret of Hungary|Saint Margaret]],  and provides a true picture about the lives of the monasteries of [[Mediaeval]] [[Hungary]]. It also gives an insight to the days of [[Buda]] and [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 13th century. 
==Sample==
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]:
:''"Nyulak szigetében, másképpen Bódogasszony szigetében, hol nyugoszik Szent Margit asszonynak teste, hogy ott megtudakoznának nagy erős bizonság alatt Szent Margit asszonynak szentséges életéről, csodatételéről, kit ez jámbor doktorok és kananokok híven mind megtőnek és mend végig elvégezék és híven megírák, pápának bevivék, nékönk és írva hagyák, miképpen jól látjátok, az ő legendáját."''
*[[English language|English]]:
:''"In the [[Margit-sziget|Island of the Hares]], or in other words, in the island of the [[Blessed Mary]], where the body of the holy lady Margaret reposes, they enquired with being strongly sure about the sacred life and miracles of Saint Margaret, whom these guileless doctors and canons all devotedly testified, verified and faithfully described, and took the text to the [[pope]], so they, as you can see, left the legend of her to us and in a written form."''

'''Meaning''' in [[existentialism]] is ''descriptive''; therefore it is unlike typical, ''prescriptive'' conceptions of "the [[meaning of life]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Due to the methods of existentialism, prescriptive or declarative statements about meaning are unjustified.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. The root of the word "meaning" is "mean", which is the way someone or something is conveyed, interpreted, or represented. Each individual has his or her own form of unique perspective; meaning is, therefore, purely subjective. Meaning is the way something is understood by an individual; in turn, this subjective meaning is also how the individual may identify it. Meaning is the personal significance of something physical or abstract. This would include the assigning of value(s) to such significance.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/existentialism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Steven|last=Crowell|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=16 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2012}}

==Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
{{blockquote|What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die. (...) I certainly do not deny that I still accept an imperative of knowledge and that through it men may be influenced, but then it must come alive in me, and this is what I now recognize as the most important of all.|Søren Kierkegaard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|title=Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers, Part 1: Autobiographical, 1829--1848|editor=Howard V. Hong &amp; Edna H Hong|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyNryDj1gAYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22What+I+really+need+is+to+get+clear+about+what+I+must+do%22&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jcrvUKiYHseR0QHJ0IGgCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What%20I%20really%20need%20is%20to%20get%20clear%20about%20what%20I%20must%20do%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Kierkegaard, meaning does not equal knowledge, although both are important. Meaning, for Kierkegaard, is a lived experience, a quest to find one's values, beliefs, and purpose in a meaningless world. As a Christian, Kierkegaard finds his meaning in the Word of God, but for those who are not Christian, Kierkegaard wishes them well in their search.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S. ''The Essential Kierkegaard'', Eds. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton, 2000. P. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, it is noted that Kierkegaard was not a friend to the church so to claim him as a man of prayer is neglectful. He in fact hated the governance of the church and is religious in the sense that he attempted to understand happiness through his three stages of existence, marking himself on the second stage.

==Sartre==
{{Main|Existence precedes essence}}
"Existence precedes essence" means that humans [[existence|exist]] first before they have meaning in life. Meaning is not given, and must be achieved.
With objects—say a knife for example, there is some creator who conceives of an idea or purpose of an object,  and then creates it with the essence of the object already present. The essence of what the knife will be exists before the actual knife itself. Sartre, who was an [[Atheism|atheist]], believed that if there is no God to have conceived of our essence or nature, then we must come into existence first, and then create our own essence out of interaction with our surroundings and ourselves. With this come serious implications of self-responsibility over who we are and what our lives mean. For this reason, meaning is something without representation or bearing in anything or anyone else. It is something truly unique to each person{{spaced ndash}}separate, independent.&lt;ref&gt;''Existentialism is a humanism'', [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], (L'existentialisme est un humanisme) 1946 Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frankl==
{{Main|Logotherapy}}
Logotherapy is a type of psychological analysis that focuses on a '''will to meaning''' as opposed to a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]]'''/'''[[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] doctrine of "[[will to power]]" or Freud's "[[Pleasure principle (psychology)|will to pleasure]]".&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankl also noted the barriers to humanity's quest for meaning in life. He warns against "...[[affluence]], [[hedonism]], [and] [[Economic materialism|materialism]]..." in the search for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/tenets.html "Tenets"]. [[Logotherapy Institute]].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324160012/http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/tenets.html |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list of tenets represents Frankl's basic principles of Logotherapy:
{{blockquote|
* Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
* Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
* We have inalienable freedom to find meaning.
|About Logotherapy&lt;ref name="logotherapy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/About_Logotherapy.html|title=Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy|website=www.logotherapyinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
We can find meaning in life in three different ways:
{{blockquote|
#by creating a work or doing a deed;
#by experiencing something or encountering someone;
#by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
|About Logotherapy&lt;ref name="logotherapy" /&gt;}}
Logotherapy was developed by psychiatrist and [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]].

==Life==
Mohsen Fayz Kashani was born in Kashan to a scholarly family renowned for its learning,&lt;ref name="IranicaAlgar"/&gt; Fayz started his education his father, Shah Morteza.  His father  owned a rich library which benefited Fayz.  When he reached the age of twenty, he travelled to [[Isfahan]] for further study.  However, after a year in [[Isfahan]], he moved to [[Shiraz]] to study Hadith and Fiq (Jurisprudence) under Majid Bahrani, one of the leading [[Shi'ite]] scholars of his time.  Bahrani died a few months later, and Fayz returned to [[Isfahan]] where he joined the circles of great scholar [[Shaikh Bahai]] and studied [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] under [[Mir Damad]]. After performing the [[hajj]], he stayed a short time before returning to Persia.

Upon his return he found a new master, Qom Molla Sadra who taught him in different disciplines. Sadra taught him for eight years, studying ascetic exercises and learning all of the sciences. Sadra gave Fayz one of his daughters to marry, they later had a son named, Muhammad Alam  al-Huda, who followed in his fathers footsteps. Fayz is said to have produced works that mixed Islamic scriptual moral concerns with Aristotelian, Platonic schemas and illunminationist mysticism- a rationalist gnostic approach.(Rizvi) Some of his works brought him bad attention, he was criticized by Unlama for not using the Idjma in questioning jurisprudence, such as the legitimacy of music and the definition of impurity. One of Fayz students later blames him for encouraging his students to listen to music.(Chittick)Fayz taught at the Molla'Ábd-Allah madrasa and led Friday prayer in Isfahan. After an unknown period of time Fayz returned to Kasan where he later died in the year 1680.&lt;ref name=IranicaAlgar /&gt;

Before his death, an earthquake struck the city of Sherwan in Iran. During the same year, the town of Mashad was also victim to an earthquake of high intensity. The rule at the time had happened to be traveling through Kashan and became greatly worried over the loss of life and infrastructure that had occurred. He soon began to seek answers from among those who were claimed to be the wisest in the city. Eventually he came across Mohsen Fayz Kashani and asked for an answer. Kashani is reported to have said, "There is a spate of earthquakes because of you. You may not know, but it is proven through the traditions of the Infallibles that frequent earthquakes will come when bribery is practiced in the courts of law."&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Moulana S. "Mohammed Mohsin Faiz Kashani." Islamic-laws. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Aug. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He was a prolific writer in both [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], with a bibliography of more than a hundred and twenty titles. One of his famous work is ''Mohjat-al-Beyza'' which is entirely rewritten of the ''Ihya' ulum al-din'' (Revival of Religious Sciences), the great work by [[al-Ghazali]], from the [[Shia]] point of view. Another of his great works, 'Ayn al-yaqin, The Certitude of the Eye-witness, is a personal synthesis which complements his great commentary on the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p.344&lt;/ref&gt;

His other works include ''Abwab-ol-Jenan'' (the doors of the Paradise), ''the comment of Safi'', ''the comment of Asfi'', ''Wafi'' (on exposition  of  [[Usul Kafi]]), ''Shafi'', (the thing which cures), ''Mafati'h al-Sharayi''' (The Keys of Islamic Law), ''Asrar-o-ssalat'' (the secrets of  the prayers), ''Elm-ol yaghin'' (certain knowledge) on the principles of the religion, ''Kalimát al-Maknúnah'' (Hidden Words) The exposition on [[astronomy]], ''Safina-to-nejat'' (the ship of relief), the exposition on the [[Al-Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya]], ''Tarjomat-ol salat'' (the translation of  prayer) (in [[Persian language|Persian]]), ''The translation of [[Taharat]]'' (the purification mentally and physically), Translations of the ideas, The "list of the sciences" and Divan of poems. There are some 13000 lines of poems in his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irib.ir/occasions/Feiz%20Kashani%5Cfeiz%20kashani.en.HTM Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was one of the first to present the revolutionary idea that Islamic prayer does not necessarily have to be in Arabic.

A thorough bibliographic study has shown that Fayz wrote 122 works for a total on over 550,000 lines; of these, about forty have been published. He wrote some 20,000 verses of Persian poetry, mostly in Sufi style, and thirty Persian prose works.

==Philosophy==

===Archetypal Images===
One of Fayz Kashani's most well known contributions to Islamic philosophy is his discourse on the archetypal images. Borrowing heavily from Platonic ideas of universals and particulars, Fayz seeks to articulate the relationship between the spiritual and material worlds and how their interaction fulfills divine will. From the beginning of creation, God entrusted Spirits to govern matter. However, because both spiritual and material substances possess distinct and separable essences, the power of the spiritual world alone is insufficient to establish a connection between the spiritual and the material. There must be an intermediary world which allows this interaction to take place. The archetypal world is a spiritual universe and yet also maintains characteristics of the material world. It is capable of manifesting itself in space and time and so can be perceived by the senses. At the same, it is formed from pure light beyond which the eyes can interpret, and so it transcends space and time as well. In this sense, the archetypal world is neither completely material or spiritual. It merely functions as a realm of existence by which the spiritual and the divine can interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=Corbin|title=Spiritual Bodies and Celestial Earth|year=1977|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=176–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having established the need for the existence of the archetypal world, Kashani expands upon the manner in which the spiritual and the material worlds come to interact with another. It is through the material world and the properties which define it that allow the spiritual world to manifest itself within it and become corporeal. This new corporal reality should not be construed to mean a change of essence. The archetypal world merely allows the spiritual to be embodied and symbolized in the material. As Fayz points out, when Gabriel appeared before Maryam, his spiritual substance was "typified" when he took on a body. The perfection of the spiritual substance was maintained but was also symbolized by his material form and rendered him visible before Maryam. However, just as spirits are corporealized in this intermediary world, so too does the body become spiritualized. Because material and spiritual properties are all connected by archetypes, the material substance itself becomes reflected in the spiritual substance. This allows the perfect soul to transfer itself from its physical form into its spiritual form upon death. In sum, the beings in world of archetypal images are particular forms that are separate from matter, but these forms still are intimately connected to matter.&lt;ref&gt;Dabashi, Hamid, and Seyyed V. Nasr. "Mulla Muhsin Fayd Kashani." Shi'ism: Doctrines, Thoughts, and Spirituality. Ed. Seyyed H. Nasr. Albany: State University of New York, 1988. 307-08. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gnosis===
In his work Kalimāt-i Maknūnah, Fayz provides a theoretical understanding of knowledge and its impact on the relationship between the individual and his apprehension of divine mystery. His first claim is that the individual's pursuit of truth is an impossible task because the truth encompasses all things. Everything is its manifestation but those whom he calls the "elite" are capable of discerning it from everything that it embodies. Being is a kind of light. Since darkness is not a thing in itself but merely the absence of light, all knowledge of being depends upon the individual's ability to perceive different degrees of light. God represents the highest degree of light and so represents the highest degree of being. God's light is so bright that a veil is placed over all things which seek Him. Since the source of spiritual knowledge is God, this veil acts as a barrier to the individual who wishes by his own power to apprehend divine knowledge. But humans have being as well and so possess a smaller degree of this light and the spiritual knowledge that comes with it. Fayz concludes that God is Being and subsists in Himself while everything else subsists in it and is a reflection of Him.

Fayz later expands on this relationship in his discussion of divine attributes. The divine attributes are identical with the divine substance and yet they remain distinct from it. Each being subsists by its relationship to one of these divine attributes or names. The divine names can be understood in two ways: In the first way, they are hidden but are mirrors which reflect the truth and manifest the truth into the world. In the second way, they are apparent and the truth mirrors them but in the process the truth becomes hidden. Fayz argues that the perfect gnostic is one who contemplates both of these mirrors. He sees the material world as a mirrored reflection of divine truth while also his own essence as being a mirrored reflection of the material world and the divine. The self cannot by his own power apprehend divine truth. Indeed, the self is ultimately the barrier to obtaining it. Thus, viewing one's essence as a mirror of the material world and the divine eliminates the essence of the self and grants the person this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;"Sadr Al-Din Shirazi."

===Ethics===
Kashani insists upon the importance of Murâbtatah, or vigilance, as a kind of relationship that one may develop with his own soul. The virtue of vigilance can be divided into five stages.

====Preconditioning====
Borrowing from the works of al Ghazzali, Fayz likens the relationship between man and the soul to a business venture between two partners. Man and the soul are the partners while life is the capital that is used for investment. In this case, man spends his life refining and purifying the soul in order to reap the eternal benefits from doing so. Like a contract, conditions must be set forth and agreed upon by both partners before investment can take place. Thus, conditions must be placed on the soul by man in order to begin the process of its purification.

====Self-Supervision====
Self-supervision is defined by Kashani as a concentrated effort to discover if the conditions set forth are in accordance with the will of God. This stage of vigilance is characterized by a change in the heart that prompts a person to gain satisfaction when occupied with thoughts of heeding divine instruction. Ultimately, the result of achieving this state is a type of knowledge which produces a greater awareness of God as He who observes the action of His servants.

====Self-Accounting====
Kashani describes this stage as a state in which the person reviews his actions and strives to know if the conditions set forth for the soul are being met. It involves any kind of consideration of the frequency and order of actions performed and the positive and negative results which follow from them. It is in this stage that a person begins to understand the importance of repentance. Only when a person accounts for the negative consequences of his actions can he begin to repent. Conversely, only when a person accounts for the positive consequences of his actions can he gain satisfaction and joy.

====Self-Punishment====
Kashani characterizes this stage as a dedication to keep the soul from further disobedience. It is a means of preventing the soul from obtaining the pleasure it would have possessed if man had not sinned. In order to make sure that the soul does not sin again, the individual must be willing to accept the consequences of their sinful actions. Acts of penance are meant to inflict pain on the soul so that the requirements of divined justice are fulfilled. At the same time, this self-caused pain begins the slow process of purifying the soul of the effects caused by sin.

====Self-Fighting====
According to Kashani, there is a tendency of man to avoid the responsibility associated with investing in the soul. Man does not like forcing himself to perform good actions. He desires to do what his will is habitually inclined to do. To keep himself from becoming lazy in his dedication toward refining the soul, the individual must constantly urge himself to do difficult acts of worship and duty so as to compensate for his laziness. Over time, this constant urging will produce in the person a habit that lessens the struggle to always perform good actions.&lt;ref&gt;Saghaye-Biria, M. N. "Al-Fayd Al-Kashani's Self-supervision and Self-accounting." Thesis. McGill University, 1997. Al- Fayz Al-Kashani's Self-supervision and Self-accounting. National Library of Canada. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==

===The Perfect Man===
According to Kashani, the Perfect Man is one who has manifested within himself one of the divine attributes and has overcome the barrier between the Absolute and the mundane. Further, the Perfect Man is the focal point of mediation and connection by which the unknowable aspects of the Absolute come down into the realm of knowable existence. The attributes of God enter into and become one with man while retaining their essence. At the same time, essential relations are established between man and himself which allow him to participate with the divine but remain distinct from it. While the Perfect man remains alive in this world, he draws upon and continually preserves the self-manifestations of the divine. Because the Perfect man exists as a unity between the material and the divine, the reflection of the divine attributes within him permit change in the material world that he is a part of. More crucial for Fayz is establishing how this connected state of being in the Perfect Man connects to the practice of the Imam. God and his attributes are eternal. By manifesting his attributes into man, God is connecting creation with the divine. Since the Perfect Man manifests the connection of creation to God, the dependency of creation upon God for its existence is also connected to the Perfect Man. In this sense, The world would cease to be without the existence of the Perfect Man. The Imam represents the Perfect Man who functions as an intermediary. Therefore, the Imam is essential for the continuation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Takim, Liyakat. "The Concepts of the Absolute and Perfect Man in Mulla Fayd Al-Kashani." Liyakat Takim. University of Denver, Colorado, Aug. 2008. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four Major Groups of Muslims===
According to Fayz, those that comprise the Muslim community are divided into four groups: the philosophers, the mystics, the theologians, and the deviates. Although none of these groups fall within the category of infidel, each in some manner has gone astray in their respective pursuits. Philosophers engage in the search for truth, but their approach is so based in rationalism that it fails to fully comprehend the truth. Their tendency to invoke a priori proofs ignores the importance of tradition and scripture in the effort to gain spiritual knowledge. Mystics and theologians claim to be acting from within the school or tradition they are a part of, but often fall into the trap of pure speculation. Any kind of theological speculation and mystical speculation which is not traceable to the Qur'an and the Hadith is to be immediately discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver. "The School of Isfahan."

'''Ṣadr ad-Dīn Muḥammad Shīrāzī''', also called '''Mulla Sadrā''' ({{lang-fa|ملا صدرا}}; also spelled '''Molla Sadra''', '''Mollasadra''' or '''Sadr-ol-Mote'allehin'''; {{lang-ar|صدرالمتألهین}}) (c. 1571/2 – 1640), was an [[Iranian philosophy|Iranian]] [[Shia]] [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Kalam|theologian]] and [[Ulema|‘Ālim]] who led the [[Iran]]ian cultural renaissance in the 17th century.  According to [[Oliver Leaman]], Mulla Sadra is arguably the single most important and influential philosopher in the Muslim world in the last four hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2007), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)] by  John Cooper&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not its founder, he is considered the master of the Illuminationist (or, Ishraghi or [[Illuminationist philosophy|Ishraqi]]) school of Philosophy, a seminal figure who synthesized the many tracts of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] philosophies into what he called the [[Transcendent Theosophy]] or ''al-hikmah al-muta’liyah''.

Mulla Sadra brought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9 &amp; 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his [[existentialism]] should not be too readily compared to Western existentialism. His was a question of existentialist cosmology as it pertained to God, and thus differs considerably from the individual, moral, and/or social, questions at the heart of Russian, French, German, or American Existentialism.

Mulla Sadra's philosophy ambitiously synthesized [[Avicennism]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]'s [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Ibn Arabi]]'s [[Sufi metaphysics]], and the [[Kalam|theology]] of the [[Ash'ari]] school and [[Twelvers]].&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2007), pp.146 and 147&lt;/ref&gt;

His main work is ''The Transcendent Theosophy in the Four Journeys of the Intellect'', or simply ''Four Journeys''.

===Infant===
Born in [[Shiraz]], in what is now [[Iran]], to a notable family of court officials in 1571 or 1572,&lt;ref name="RizviSajjad"&gt;Rizvi, Sajjad (2002), ''Reconsidering the life of Mulla Sadra Shirazi'', Pembroke College, pp. 181&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Mulla Sadra's time, the Safavid dynasty governed on [[Iran]]. [[Safavid]] kings granted independence to [[Fars Province]] which was ruled by the king's brother. Mulla Sadara's father, khwajah Ibrahim Qavami, was a knowledgeable and extremely faithful politician. His father was a rich man and held a high position, but had no children. However, after a lot of prayers and supplications to divine portal, God gave him a son whom they named Muhammad but called Sadra. Later he was nicknamed as Mulla, that is, great scientist. He was the only child of the minister of the ruler of the vast region of [[Fars Province]]. In that time it was prevalent that aristocrats' children were educated by private teachers in their own palace. Sadra was a very intelligent, strict, energetic, studious and curious boy and mastered all the lessons related to Persian and Arabic literature as well as the art of calligraphy, during a very short time. Following to old traditions of his time, he had to learned  horse riding, hunting and fighting techniques, mathematics, astronomy, medicine to some extent, jurisprudence, Islamic law. The young Sadra, who had not reached the age of puberty, had acquired  some of all those fields of knowledge however, he was mainly attracted on philosophy and particularly gnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi Hamid Reza|2005|p.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulla Sadra moved first to [[Qazvin]] in 1591 and then to [[Isfahan]] 1597 to pursue a traditional and institutional education in philosophy, theology, [[Hadith]], and hermeneutics. Each city was a successive capital of the [[Safavid dynasty]] and centers of [[Twelver]] [[Shi'ite]] seminaries at that time. His teachers included [[Mir Damad]] and [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/molla-sadra-sirazi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachers===
Mulla Sadra was a master of all science of his time. In his own view, the most important of these was philosophy. In [[Qazvin]], Sadra studied under two prominent teachers, namely [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili]] and [[Mir Damad]]. He accompanied them when the capital transmitted from Qazvin to Isfahan in 1006 A.H/1596. Mulla sadra acquired most of his scholarly knowledge from [[Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili]] and [[Mir Damad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi Hamid Reza|2005|p.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaykh Baha was not only an expert in Islamic sciences but also a master of astronomy, theoretical mathematics, engineering, architecture, medicine and some secret supernatural fields of knowledge; it seems that Ameli for his  sophis Ideas, didn't deal with philosophy more. also Miradamad as genius of his time,  although knew the all science of his time but limited his domain to jurisprudence, hadith and mainly philosophy. Mir Damad was a master of both Peripatetic and illuminationist schools of Islamic philosophy. Also, Mulla Sadra obtained most of his knowledge of philosophy and gnosis from [[Mir Damad]] and always introduced him as his true teacher and spiritual guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ayatollahi|2005|p.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had finished his studies Sadra began to explore unorthodox doctrines and as a result was both condemned and excommunicated by some Shi'i ʿulamāʾ. He then retired for a lengthy period of time to a village named Kahak near qom, where he engaged in contemplative exercises. While in Kahak, he wrote a number of minor works, including the Risāla fi 'l-ḥashr and the Risāla fī ḥudūth al-ʿālam .&lt;ref name="brillonline"&gt;MacEoin, D. "Mullā Ṣadrā S̲H̲īrāzī Ṣadr al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Ibrāhīm Ḳawāmī S̲h̲īrāzī." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-5490&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1612, Mulla Sadra was asked to abandon his retirement by the powerful governor of Fārs, [[Allahverdi Khan|Allāhwirdī Ḵhān]]&lt;ref name="brillonline" /&gt; and invited back to Shiraz to teach and run a new [[madrasa]] devoted to the intellectual sciences.&lt;ref name="RizviSajjad" /&gt; He died in [[Basra]] after the [[Hajj]] and was buried in present-day [[Iraq]].
He is buried in the city of [[Najaf]], Iraq.

During this time in Shīrāz, Ṣadrā began writing treatises that synthesized wide-ranging strands of existing Islamic systems of thought. The ideas of this school, which may be seen as a continuation of the School of Iṣfahān of Mīr Dāmād and Shaykh-i Bahāʾī, were promulgated after Sadrā's death by his pupils, several of whom would become sought-after thinkers in their own right, such as, [[Mohsen Fayz Kashani|Mullā Muḥsin Fayḍ Kāshānī]] (the Mulla Sadra's son in law), and [[Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji|ʿAbd Razzāḳ Lāhidjī]]. Although Ṣadrā's influence remained limited in the generations after his death, it increased markedly during the 19th century, when his ideas helped inspire a renewed Akhbārī tendency within Twelver Shīʿism. In recent times, his works have been studied in Iran, Europe, and America.&lt;ref name="brillonline" /&gt;

==Philosophical ideas==

===Existentialism===
According to Mulla Sadra, "existence precedes the essence and is thus principal since something has to exist first and then have an essence." It is notable that for Mulla Sadra this was a question that specifically applied to God and God's position in the universe, especially in the context of reconciling God's position in the Qur'an verses cosmological philosophies of Islam's Golden Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Razavi|1997|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulla Sadra metaphysics gave priority "[[Ab initio]]" to existence, over [[quiddity]]. That is to say, essences are determined and variable according to existential "intensity", (to use Henry Corbin's definition), and as such essences are not immutable.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 342 and 343&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to this schema is that it is acceptable to the fundamental statements of the Qur'an, even as it does not necessarily debilitate any previous Islamic philosopher's Aristotelian or Platonic foundations.

Indeed, Mulla Sadra provides immutability only to God, while intrinsically linking essence and existence to each other, and God's power over existence. In so doing, Mulla Sadra simultaneously provided for God's authority over all things, while also solving the problem of God's knowledge of particulars, including those that are evil, without being inherently responsible for them&amp;nbsp;— even as God's authority over the existence of existences that provide the framework for evil to exist. This clever solution provides for Freedom of Will, God's Supremacy, the Infiniteness of God's Knowledge, the existence of Evil, and a definition of existence and essence which leaves two inextricably linked insofar as Man is concerned, but fundamentally separate insofar as God is concerned.&lt;ref name="SayyedHussein"&gt;Sayyed Hussein Nasr, Persian Sufi Literature, Lecture, George Washington University, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most importantly, the Primacy of Existence solution provides the capacity for God's Judgement without God being directly, or indirectly, affected by the evil being judged. God does not need to possess Sin to know Sin: God is able to judge the intensity of Sin as God perceives Existence.&lt;ref name="SayyedHussein" /&gt;

One result of this Existentialism is "The unity of the intellect and the intelligible" (Arabic: ''Ittihad al-Aaqil wa l-Maqul''. As [[Henry Corbin]] describes:{{quote|All the levels of the modes of being and perception are governed by the same law of unity, which at the level of the intelligible world is the unity of intellection, of the intelligizing subject, and of the Form intelligized&amp;nbsp;— the same unity as that of love, lover and beloved. Within this perspective we can perceive what Sadra meant by the unitive union of the human soul, in the supreme awareness of its acts of knowledge, with the active Intelligence which is the Holy Spirit. It is never a question of an arithmetical unity, but of an intelligible unity permitting the reciprocity which allows us to understand that, in the soul which it metamorphoses, the Form—or Idea—intelligized by the active Intelligence is a Form which intelligizes itself, and that as a result the active Intelligence or Holy Spirit intelligizes itself in the soul's act of intellection. Reciprocally, the soul, as a Form intelligizing itself, intelligizes itself as a Form intelligized by the active Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 343 and 344&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Substantial motion===
Another central concept of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the theory of "[[Substance theory|substantial]] [[Motion (physics)|motion]]" (Arabic:''al-harakat al-jawhariyyah''), which is "based on the premise that everything in the order of [[nature]], including [[celestial spheres]], undergoes substantial change and transformation as a result of the self-[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] (''fayd'') and penetration of [[being]] (''sarayan al-wujud'') which gives every concrete individual entity its share of being. In contrast to [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]] who had accepted change only in four [[Categorization|categories]], i.e., [[quantity]] (''kamm''), [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (''kayf''), [[wikt:position|position]] (''wad’'') and [[wikt:place|place]] (''‘ayn''), Sadra defines change as an all-pervasive [[reality]] running through the entire cosmos including the category of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''jawhar'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ibrahim|last=Kalin|contribution=Sadr al-Din Shirazi (Mulla Sadra) (b. 1571-1640)|url=http://www.cis-ca.org/voices/s/sadra.htm|title=Resources on Islam &amp; Science|editor1-first=Muzaffar|editor1-last=Iqbal|editor1-link=Muzaffar Iqbal|editor2-first=Ibrahim|editor2-last=Kalin|date=March 2001|accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence as reality===

Mulla Sadra held the view that Reality is Existence. He believed that an essence was by itself a general notion, and therefore and does not, in reality, exist.&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman, ''The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra'' State University of New York Press, 1975, pp 27 and 28&lt;/ref&gt;

To paraphrase Fazlur Rahman on Mulla Sadra's Existential Cosmology: Existence is the one and only reality. Existence and reality are therefore identical. Existence is the all-comprehensive reality and there is nothing outside of it. Essences which are negative require some sort of reality and therefore exist. Existence therefore cannot be denied. Therefore, existence cannot be negated. As Existence cannot be negated, it is self-evident that it Existence is God. God should not be searched for in the realm of existence but is the basis of all existence.&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman, ''The Philosophy of Mulla Sadra'' State University of New York Press, 1975, pp 125&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that Reality in Arabic is "Al-Haq", and is stated in the Qur'an as one of the [[Names of God]].

To paraphrase Mulla Sadra's ''Logical Proof for God'':&lt;ref&gt;Rizvi, Sajjad ''Mulla Sadra and Metaphysics'', 2009, pp126&lt;/ref&gt;
#There is a being
#This being is a perfection beyond all perfection
#God is Perfect and Perfection in existence
#Existence is a singular and simple reality
#That singular reality is graded in intensity in a scale of perfection
#That scale must have a limit point, a point of greatest intensity and of greatest existence
#Therefore, God exists

===Causation===
Sadra argued that all contingent beings require a cause which puts their balance between existence and non-existence in favor of the former; nothing can come into existence without a cause. Since the world is therefore contingent upon this First Act, not only must God exist, but God must also be responsible for this First Act of creation.

Sadra also believed that a causal regress was impossible because the causal chain could only work in the matter that had a beginning, middle, and end:

1) a pure cause at the beginning
2) a pure effect at the end
3) a nexus of cause and effect

The [[Causality|Causal Nexus]] of Mulla Sadra was a form of Existential Ontology within a Cosmological Framework that Islam supported. For Mulla Sadra the Causal "End" is as pure as its corresponding "Beginning", which instructively places God at both the beginning and the end of the creative act. God's capacity to measure the intensity of Existential Reality by measuring Causal Dynamics' and their Relationship to their Origin, as opposed to knowing their effects, provided the Islamically-acceptable framework for God's Judgement of Reality without being tainted by its Particulars. This was an ingenious solution to a question that had haunted Islamic philosophy for almost one thousand years: How is God able to judge sin without knowing sin?&lt;ref name="SayyedHussein" /&gt;

===Truth===
For Mulla Sadra a true statement is a statement that is true to the concrete facts in existence. He held a metaphysical and not a formal idea of truth, claiming that the world consists of mind-independent objects that are always true and truth is not what is rationally acceptable within a certain theory of description. In Mulla Sadra's view one cannot have access to the reality of being: only linguistic analysis is available. This theory of Truth has two levels: the claim that a proposition is true if it corresponds to things in reality; and that a proposition can be true if it conforms with the actual thing itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rizvi, Sajjad ''Mulla Sadra and Metaphysics'', 2009, pp59-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===

Dr. [[Janan Izadi]] believes that Hikmat Muta’aliyah is of a [[metalanguage]] according to [[Mehdi Haeri Yazdi|Mehdi Haeri]] Yazdi. That approach could evaluate the power of [[epistemology]] in Mulla Sadra’s philosophical views. However, there are two primarily groups on Mulla Sadra’s [[methodology]]. One group basically disagreed with any kind of systematizing of knowledge and methodological approach in Hekmat Muta’aliyyah. The other group believe in being structured of Mulla Sadra’s view. They maintain that there is a consistency and methodological approach for Mulla Sadra. In fact, the [[metalanguage]] approach could be considered in latter not the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.noormags.ir/view/fa/articlepage/588624/%c2%ab%d8%b2%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%aa%d8%b1%c2%bb--%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%b1%db%8c%d9%87-%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%af%d8%b1-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b4-%d8%b4%d9%86%d8%a7%d8%b3%db%8c-%d8%ad%da%a9%d9%85%d8%aa-%d9%85%d8%aa%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%84%db%8c%d9%87?q=%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86%20%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B2%D8%AF%DB%8C&amp;score=81.080376&amp;rownumber=4|author=Janan Izadi|title=Meta language as a theory for methodology of Hikmat Muta'aliyeh|magazine=Kherad nameh Sadra|pages=21–22|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of known works==
* ''[[Hikmat Al Muta'alyah (book)|Hikmat Al Muta'alyah]] fi-l-asfar al-‘aqliyya al-arba‘a'' [The Transcendent theosophy in the Four Journeys of the Intellect], a philosophical encyclopedia and a collection of important issues discussed in Islamic philosophy, enriched by the ideas of preceding philosophers, from Pythagoras to those living at the same time with Mulla Sadra, and containing the related responses on the basis of new and strong arguments. In four large volumes; also published several times in nine smaller volumes.  He composed this book gradually, starting in about 1015 A.H. (1605 A.D.); its completion took almost 25 years, until some years after 1040 A.H. (1630 A.D.). Book is also tranlated in Urdu by Indian scholar Abul Ala Maududi by the name of Asfar e Arba&lt;ref&gt;https://quranwahadith.com/product/asfar-e-arba/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''[[al-Tafsir]]'' (A commentary upon the Qur'an)
* ''Diwan Shi’r'' (Collection of Poems), a number of scholarly and mystic poems in Persian.

* ''al-Mabda‘ wa’l-ma‘ad'', also called ''al-Hikmat al-muta‘aliyyah'', considered to be a summary of the second half of Asfar. He called this book the Beginning and the End, since he believed at heart that philosophy means the knowledge of the Origin and the Return.
* ''al-Mazahir''  This book is similar to al-Mabda‘ wa’l-ma‘ad, but is shorter than it. It is, in fact, a handbook for familiarizing readers with Mulla Sadra's philosophy.

* '' Mutashabihat al-Qur'an'', a treatise consists of Mulla Sadra's interpretations of those Qura’nic verses which have secret and complicated meanings. It is considered as one of the chapters in [Mafatih al-ghayb].
* ''Isalat-i Ja’l-i wujud'', on existence and its principality as opposed to quiddities.

This book can familiarize the readers with subtleties of Mulla Sadra's nature. These notes were compiled in two different collections, and it is likely that the smaller collection was compiled on one of his journeys.
* ''Letters'': except for a few letters exchanged between Mulla Sadra and his master, Mir Damad, none of his letters has survived. These letters have been presented at the beginning of the 3-volume

The '''North American Union''' ('''NAU''') is a theoretical economic and political [[continental union]] of [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States|United States]] (sometimes [[Greenland]] and [[Cuba]] are included). The concept is loosely based on the [[European Union]], occasionally including a common currency called the [[North American monetary union|Amero]] or the North American Dollar. A union of the North American continent, sometimes extending to Central and South America, has been the subject of academic concepts for over a century, as well as becoming a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in [[science fiction]]. One reason for the difficulty in realizing the concept is that individual developments in each region have failed to prioritize a larger union.

Some form of union has been discussed or proposed in academic, business, and political circles for decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/NorthAmerica_TF_final.pdf Building a North American Community - Council on Foreign Relations] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Building NAC"&gt;

{{Main|North American integration}}
Since at least the mid-19th century, numerous concepts for a union among [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and the [[United States of America]], some including the [[Caribbean]], the [[Central American]] and the [[South American]] countries, have been proposed, such as the North American [[Technate]].

During an interview for ''[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy]]'' in 2001, after he was elected president, Fox said that he sought with the United States a "convergence of our two economies, convergence on the basic and fundamental variables of the economy, convergence on rates of interest, convergence on income of people, convergence on salaries." He suggested this might take as long as 20 years to be realized, but the ultimate "convergence" he saw between the United States and Mexico would allow them to "erase that border, open up that border for [the] free flow of products, merchandises, [and] capital as well as people". Fox cited the success he claimed countries [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Spain]] had in modernizing their economies and raising the standard of living for their citizens by joining what is now the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=FoxPBS /&gt; Vicente Fox also proposed a plan to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] that he said would move the North American continent towards an economic union based on the example of the European Union. Fox's proposal was rejected by President Bush, with Fox later alleging in his book ''Revolution of Hope'' that the White House wanted him to "stop raising hackles" by talking about a North American Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Vicente|authorlink=Vicente Fox|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bLDDf9vi-esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Revolution of hope: the life, faith, and dreams of a Mexican president|publisher=Viking|page=101|year=2007|isbn=978-0-670-01839-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, amid a push for greater integration and concerns about the impact of heightened security on trade relations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, an effort was organized in 2003 by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, U.S. [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and the [[Mexican Council on Foreign Relations]] called the [[Independent Task Force on North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/current.php?artType=view&amp;EntryNo=10209|title=The Task Of Today's CCCE: Moving Multilateral Trade Forward|publisher=The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel|date=2009-10-04|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks before a meeting of North American leaders on March 23, 2005 the Task Force issued a press release and a statement from the Task Force's chairmen calling for deeper integration of NAFTA to form a North American Economic and Security Community by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Trinational Call for a North American Economic and Security Community by 2010|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=2005-03-14|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7914/|accessdate=2009-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627132255/http://www.cfr.org/publication/7914|archivedate=2009-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2005 diplomatic cable that was [[United States diplomatic cables leak|released]] by [[WikiLeaks]] in 2011 includes discussion by U.S. government officials about the best approach to [[North American integration]] based on an assessment of Canadian views. The cable suggested a new "North American Initiative" that would address goals in the areas of "security" and "prosperity" through incremental measures, saying such a proposal would get the most support from Canadian policymakers. It notes many Canadian economists supported "ambitious" goals like a [[single market]], with some supporting a [[monetary union]], but that they believed the incremental approach was more appropriate at the time. Canada's [[Bank of Canada|central bank]] governor is quoted in the cable as having said that a monetary union is "an issue that should be considered once we have made more progress towards establishing a single market."&lt;ref name=Wikileaks /&gt; The ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s Robert Hiltz described the cable in June 2011 as discussing "the obstacles surrounding the merger of the economies of Canada, the United States and Mexico in a fashion similar to the European Union."&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt;

Two months later at the March meeting of North American leaders, the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]] (SPP) was formed. It was described by the leaders of Canada, Mexico and the United States as a dialogue to provide greater cooperation on security and economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/03/20050323-2.html Joint Statement by President Bush, President Fox, and Prime Minister Martin&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; In response to later concerns, a section was put up on the initiative's site clarifying the SPP was not a legal agreement, that the initiative "does not seek to rewrite or renegotiate NAFTA",  and that the partnership itself "creates no NAFTA-plus legal status."&lt;ref name="spp faq" /&gt; A number of academics and government officials at the time viewed the SPP as moving North America towards greater integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ia/cnas/pdfs/workingpaper2_celorio.pdf |title=The Current Debate Regarding the SPP: Security and the Integration of North America |publisher=Center for North American Studies |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2009-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924130136/http://www1.american.edu/ia/cnas/pdfs/workingpaper2_celorio.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the Task Force published a report praising the SPP initiative and pushing for greater economic integration by 2010.&lt;ref name="urban legend" /&gt; They repeated their call for the "establishment by 2010 of a North American economic and security community, the boundaries of which would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/NorthAmerica_TF_final.pdf |title=83799$CH2A |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report the Task Force said that a North American Community, which would be similar to the [[European Community]] which preceded the EU, should not rely on "grand schemes of confederation or union" and did not suggest a supranational government or a common currency. The Task Force’s recommendations included developing a North American common market and security perimeter, among other common goals.

The SPP initiative was officially ended on August 2009 though the [[North American Leaders' Summit]] and most of the working groups set up under the initiative remain active. Several advocates of integration saw the SPP as being insufficient. One criticism was that the governments lacked a "vision of what North America might become" and as such did not provide the proper context that would allow the initiative to deal with barriers to deeper integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldthinkernews.com/documents/SPP%20and%20the%20Way%20Forward%20for%20North%20American%20Integration.pdf|title=SPP and the Way Forward for North American Integration|publisher=[[Lubin School of Business]]|date=March 2006|accessdate=2010-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010205950/http://oldthinkernews.com/documents/SPP%20and%20the%20Way%20Forward%20for%20North%20American%20Integration.pdf|archive-date=2010-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of implementation==
In 2005, claims emerged from critics of [[North American integration]] that a "North American Union" was not only being planned, but was being implemented by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. These critics cited the formation of the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]] and claimed it was an attempt to dramatically alter the economic and political status quo between the countries outside of the scrutiny of the respective national legislatures, a critique heightened by the subsequent publication of the [[Independent Task Force on North America]] report which praised the SPP initiative and called for greater economic integration by 2010.&lt;ref name="urban legend"/&gt;

While a broad spectrum of observers criticize the secrecy of the SPP and its dominance by business groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pam Woolridge |url=http://canadians.org/integratethis/backgrounders/guide/index.html |title=Behind Closed Doors: What they're not telling us about the Security and Prosperity Partnership |publisher=Canadians.org |accessdate=2011-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101105434/http://canadians.org/integratethis/backgrounders/guide/index.html |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the specific claim that its true aim was to expand NAFTA into a North American Union analogous to the [[European Union]] (EU), with [[open borders]] and a common currency among other features, was being made by the fall of 2006, when conservative commentators [[Phyllis Schlafly]], [[Jerome Corsi]] and [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]] started a website dedicated to quashing what they perceived as the coming North American "Socialist mega-state".&lt;ref name="amero conspiracy"/&gt;

The belief that a North American Union was being planned and implemented in secret became widespread, so much so that the NAU was a topic of debate during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 American presidential campaigns]] and the subject of various U.S. [[United States Congress|Congressional]] resolutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/gpoxmlc110/hc40_ih.xml|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/gpoxmlc109/hc487_ih.xml|title=Congress.gov - Library of Congress|website=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to thwart its implementation. Prominent critics such as [[Lou Dobbs]], then an employee of [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/21/ldt.01.html|title=North American Union?|publisher=CNN |date=2006-06-21|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2006/tst082806.htm A North American United Nations?&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.house.gov&lt;/ref&gt; denounced the concept, joined by left-wing nationalist groups in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/petition1.html Call for a Referendum on the SPP&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120082332/http://www.canadianactionparty.ca/petition1.html |date=2008-01-20 }} at www.canadianactionparty.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blogs, and widely viewed videos and films such as "[[Zeitgeist, the Movie|Zeitgeist]]". Corsi's 2007 book ''The Late Great USA: The Coming Merger with Mexico and Canada'' also helped bring the NAU discussion into the mainstream. These beliefs are the latest example of a long line of erroneous [[conspiracy theories]] which suggest that the United States’ sovereignty is being eroded by a cabal of foreign and domestic players.&lt;ref name="urban legend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amero conspiracy"/&gt;

=== Amero ===
{{Main|North American monetary union}}
The "amero" is the appellation given to what would be the North American Union's counterpart to the [[euro]]. It was first proposed in 1999 by Canadian economist [[Herbert G. Grubel]].&lt;ref name="amero conspiracy" /&gt;  A senior fellow of the [[Fraser Institute]] think-tank, he published a book entitled ''The Case for the Amero''&lt;ref name="case for amero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="case for amero2" /&gt; in September 1999, the year that the euro became a virtual currency. [[Robert Pastor]], vice-chairman of the [[Independent Task Force on North America]], supported Grubel's conclusions in his 2001 book ''Toward a North American Community'', stating that: "In the long term, the amero is in the best interests of all three countries."&lt;ref name="Toward a NAC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Toward a North American Community: Lessons from the Old World for the New |last=Pastor |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Pastor |year=2001 |publisher=[[Peterson Institute]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-88132-328-3 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Canadian think-tank, the conservative [[C.D.

Cross border trade costs are likened to that of a tariff roughly equivalent to 170%.  Forty-four percent of that "tariff" is attributed to "border related trade barriers" which breaks down as follows, "a 8% policy barrier, a 7% language barrier, a 14% currency barrier (from the use of different currencies), a 6% information cost barrier, and a 3% security barrier."&lt;ref name="trade costs"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Trans-Texas Corridor]] was first proposed by [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] in 2002.

In 2001, [[President of Mexico]] [[Vicente Fox]] said in an interview for ''[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy]]'' that in the long term he sought with the United States a "convergence of our two economies, convergence on the basic and fundamental variables of the economy, convergence on rates of interest, convergence on income of people, convergence on salaries." He suggested this might take as long as 20 years to be realized, but the ultimate "convergence" he saw between the United States and Mexico would allow them to "erase that border, open up that border for [the] free flow of products, merchandises, [and] capital as well as people".&lt;ref name=FoxPBS/&gt; After leaving office, he continued to support the concept, while expressing his disappointment with the changed American political situation which made it seem more difficult to come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/gh4fp4/vicente-fox|title=The Daily Show with Trevor Noah|website=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online discussion of his book ''Revolution of Hope: The Life, Faith, and Dreams of A Mexican President'' Fox cited the process of European integration and asked a question, "Why can't we be not only partners in the long term, but a North American Union?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/11/05/DI2007110501135.html|title=Book World: Vicente Fox's 'Revolution of Hope'|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-11-06|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partner dances''' are [[dance]]s whose basic choreography involves coordinated dancing of two partners, as opposed to [[Solo dance|individuals]] dancing alone or individually in a non-coordinated manner, and as opposed to [[Group dance|groups of people]] dancing simultaneously in a coordinated manner.

== German dance history ==
In 1023, the German poet [[Ruodlieb]] referred to a couple dance with a basic motif of a boy wooing a girl, and the girl repulsing his advances. Men and women dancing as couples, both holding one hand of their partner, and "embracing" each other, can be seen in illustrations from 15th-century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Folk Dance of Europe. Nigel Allenby Jaffé. 1990. Folk Dance Enterprises. pages 148, 149. {{ISBN|0-946247-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 13th century and during the 14th century, nobles and wealthy patricians danced as couples in procession in a slow dignified manner in a circle. Farmers and lower classes of society danced turning in a lively, springing fashion. The relatively new burgher [[middle class]] combined the dances with the processional as a "fore dance", and the turning as an "after dance".&lt;ref&gt;Folk Dance of Europe. Nigel Allenby Jaffé. 1990. Folk Dance Enterprises. pages 155, 156. {{ISBN|0-946247-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danse de Paysans' (Peasant's Dance) by [[Théodore de Bry]] (1528–1598) shows a couple with a man lifting his partner off the ground, and the man pulling the woman towards him while holding her closely with both arms. His Danse de Seigneurs et Dames (Dance of the Lords and Ladies) features one Lord with his arms around the waist of his Lady.&lt;ref&gt;Folk Dance of Europe. Nigel Allenby Jaffé. 1990. Folk Dance Enterprises. page 150. {{ISBN|0-946247-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syncopated and "dotted" rhythms gained widespread popularity for dancing in the last two centuries, although usually less complex and more regular than previous music.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Dance of Europe''. Nigel Allenby Jaffé. 1990. Folk Dance Enterprises. page 166. {{ISBN|0-946247-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old couple dance which can be found all over Northern Europe is known as "Manchester" or "Lott is Dead". In Bavaria words to the music include "One, two, three and one is four, Dianderl lifts up her skirt And shows me her knees", and in Bavaria one verse invites the girl to leave her bedroom window open to allow a visit from her partner.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Dance of Europe''. Nigel Allenby Jaffé. 1990. Folk Dance Enterprises. page 163, 164. {{ISBN|0-946247-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance partners stay together for the duration of the dance and, most often, dance independently of other couples dancing at the same time, if any.

Although this kind of dancing can be seen, for instance, in ballet, this term is usually applied to various forms of [[social dance]], [[ballroom dance]], [[folk dance]], and similar forms.

== Group dances ==
Partner dance may be a basis of a [[formation dance]], a [[Round dance (ballroom)|round dance]], a [[square dance]] or a [[sequence dance]].  These are kinds of [[group dance]] where the dancers form couples and dance either the same choreographed or called routines or routines within a common choreography—routines that control  both how each couple dances together and how each couple moves in accord with other couples.  In square dance one will often change partners during the course of a dance, in which case one distinguishes between the "original partner" and a "situational partner".

== Leader and follower ==
In most partner dances, one, typically a man, is the '''leader'''; the other, typically a woman, is the '''follower'''. As a rule, they maintain connection with each other. In some dances the connection is loose and called [[Handhold (dance)|dance handhold]]. In other dances the connection involves body contact. In the latter case the connection imposes significant restrictions on relative body positions during the dance and hence it is often called [[Frame (dance)|dance frame]]. It is also said that each partner has his own ''dance frame''. Although the handhold connection poses almost no restriction on body positions, it is quite helpful that the partners are aware of their dance frames, since this is instrumental in [[Lead and follow (dance)|leading and following]].

In [[Western promenade dance|promenade-style]] partner dancing there is no leader or follower, and the couple dance side-by-side maintaining a connection with each other through a promenade handhold.  The man dances traditionally to the left of the woman.

Some peoples have folk partner dances, where partners do not have any body contact at all, but there is still a kind of "call-response" interaction.

A popular form of partner dancing is [[slow dance]].

==History of same-sex partner dancing==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Generally, partner dance has taken place between a man and a woman. Before the 1950s, however, if there was not a sufficient number of partners of the opposite sex available, couples formed into pairs of the same sex.

Sometimes this is also done as part of a dance tradition. In traditional partner dances done within certain conservative cultures, such as in traditional [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] partner dance, dancing is often done with the same sex as a matter of respect for the conservative culture. 

At [[Modern Jive]] and [[West Coast Swing]] events, females will regularly partner each other. Men dancing with each other is also common, though less frequent.

Typically, in ballroom competitions today, same-sex partnerships are allowed up to the silver level ''(the third level in competition, after newcomer and bronze)''. However, these are comparatively rare.

It is thought{{By whom|date=October 2018}} that some partner dances actually developed with more relaxed gender roles. Prior to adoption by the mainstream, these dances did not actually normalize the man-lead/woman-follow paradigm.

==Double partner dancing==
This kind of dance involves dancing of three persons together: one man with two women or one woman with two men. In [[Social dance|social dancing]], double partnering is best known during times when a significant demographic disproportion happens between the two sexes. For example, this happens during wars: in the army there is a lack of women, while among civilians able dancers are mostly women.

Since the 1980s, double partner dance is often performed in [[Ceroc]], [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] and [[Swing (dance)|Swing]] dance communities, experienced leaders leading two followers.

There are a number of folk dances that feature this setup. Among these are  the Russian [[Troika (dance)|Troika]] and the Polish [[Trojak]] folk dances, where a man dances with two or more women.  A [[Cajun dance]] with the name ''Troika'' is also known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13653">{{Marxism|philosophy}}

'''Philosophy in the Soviet Union''' was officially confined to [[Marxist–Leninist]] thinking, which theoretically was the basis of objective and ultimate philosophical truth. During the 1920s and 1930s, other tendencies of [[Russian philosophy|Russian thought]] were kicked (many philosophers emigrated, others were kicked). [[Joseph Stalin]] enacted a decree in 1931 identifying [[dialectical materialism]] with Marxism–Leninism, making it the official philosophy which would be enforced in all [[Communist state]]s and, through the [[Comintern]], in most [[Communist parties]]. Following the traditional use in the [[Second International]], opponents would be labeled as "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]]s".

From the beginning of [[Bolshevik]] government, the aim of official Soviet philosophy (which was taught as an obligatory subject for every course[source?]), was the theoretical justification of Communist ideas. For this reason, "[[Sovietologist]]s", among whom the most famous were [[Józef Maria Bocheński]], professor of philosophy at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Gustav Wetter]], have often claimed Soviet philosophy was close to nothing but [[dogma]]. However, since the 1917 [[October Revolution]], it was marked by both philosophical and political struggles, which call into question any monolithic reading. [[Evald Ilyenkov|Evald Vasilevich Ilyenkov]] was one of the main philosophers of the 1960s, who revisited the 1920s debate between "mechanicists" and "dialecticians" in ''Leninist Dialectics and Metaphysics of Positivism'' (1979). During the 1960s and 1970s [[Western philosophy|Western philosophies]] including [[analytical philosophy]] and [[logical positivism]] began to make a mark in Soviet thought.

==Philosophical and political struggles in the Soviet Union==

[[Dialectical materialism]] was initially expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]; one of the early works on the subject is Engel's 1878 polemic ''[[Anti-Dühring]]''. It was elaborated by [[Vladimir Lenin]] in ''Materialism and Empiriocriticism'' (1908) around three axes: the "materialist inversion" of [[Hegelian dialectic]]s; the [[historicity]] of ethical principles ordered to [[class struggle]]; and the convergence of "[[evolutionism|laws of evolution]]" in physics ([[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]), biology ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]) and political economy (Marx). Lenin hence took position between a [[historicism|historicist]] Marxism ([[Antonio Labriola|Labriola]]) and a [[determinism|determinist]] Marxism, close to what was later called "[[social Darwinism]]" ([[Karl Kautsky|Kautsky]]). Lenin's most important philosophical rival was [[Alexander Bogdanov]] (1873–1928), who tried to synthesize Marxism with the philosophies of [[Ernst Mach]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[Richard Avenarius]] (which were harshly criticized in Lenin's ''Materialism and Empiriocriticism''). Bodganov wrote a treatise on "[[tectology]]" and was one of the founders of [[Proletkult]] after the First World War.

Following the 1917 [[October Revolution]], Soviet philosophy divided itself between "dialecticians" ([[Abram Moiseyevich Deborin|Deborin]]) and "[[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanists]]" ([[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], who would detail Stalin's thesis upheld in 1924 concerning "[[socialism in one country]]", was not a "mechanist" per se, but was seen as an ally.) The mechanists (A.K. Timartizev, Timianski, Axelrod, Stepanov...), came mostly from scientific backgrounds, claimed that Marxist philosophy found its basis in a causal explanation of Nature. They upheld a [[positivism|positivist]] interpretation of Marxism which asserted that Marxist philosophy had to follow the natural sciences. Stepanov thus wrote an article flatly titled "The Dialectical Understanding of Nature is the Mechanistic Understanding". To the contrary, "dialecticians", whose background was Hegelian, insisted that dialectics could not be reduced to simple mechanism. Basing themselves mainly on Engels' ''Anti-Dühring'' and ''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'', they maintained that the laws of dialectics could be found in nature. Taking support from the [[theory of relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], they responded that the mechanists' conception of nature was too restricted and narrow. Deborin, who had been a student of [[Georgi Plekhanov]], the "father of Russian Marxism", also disagreed with the mechanicists concerning the place of [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The latter maintained that he was an idealist metaphysician, while Deborin, following Plekhanov, saw Spinoza as a materialist and a dialectician. Mechanism was finally condemned as undermining dialectical materialism and for vulgar evolutionism at the 1929 meeting of the Second All-Union Conference of Marxist–Leninist Scientific Institutions. Two years later, Stalin settled by fiat the debate between the mechanist and the dialectician tendencies by issuing a decree which identified dialectical materialism as the philosophical basis of Marxism–Leninism. Henceforth, the possibilities for [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|philosophical research independent]] of official dogmatics virtually vanished, while [[lysenkoism]] was enforced in the scientific fields (in 1948, [[genetics]] were declared a "[[bourgeois pseudoscience]]"). However, this debate between "mechanists" and "dialecticians" would retain importance long after the 1920s.

Otherwise, [[David Riazanov]] was named director of the [[Marx-Engels Institute]], which he had founded, in 1920. He then created the MEGA (''Marx-Engels-Gesamt-Ausgabe''), which was supposed to edit Marx and Engels' complete works. He also published authors authors, such as [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] or Hegel. Riazanov was however excluded from any political functions in 1921 for defending trade unions' autonomy.

During the Fifth [[Comintern]] Congress, [[Grigory Zinoviev]] condemned for "revisionism" the works of [[Georg Lukács]], ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923) and of [[Karl Korsch]], ''Marxism and Philosophy''. ''History and Class Consciousness'' was disavowed by its author, who made his [[self-criticism]] for political reasons (he thought that, for a revolutionary, being part of the party was the priority). It became however a leading source of [[Western Marxism]], starting with the [[Frankfurt School]], and even influenced [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Sein und Zeit]]'' (1927). Lukács then went to Moscow in the beginnings of the 1930s where he would continue his philosophical studies, and returned to Hungary after [[World War II]]. He then took part to [[Imre Nagy]]'s [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|government in 1956]], and was closely watched afterwards.

[[Lev Vygotsky]]'s (1896–1934) studies in [[developmental psychology]], which opposed themselves to [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s works, would be expanded in the [[activity theory]] developed by [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko]] (a member of [[Kharkov School of Psychology]]), and [[Alexander Luria]], a [[neuropsychologist]] who developed the first [[lie detector]].

==After the 20th Congress of the CPSU==

Nevertheless, the conditions for creative philosophical work began to emerge in the mid-1950s, after the [[20th Congress of the CPSU]] in 1956, albeit only on the 'outskirts' of philosophy: the philosophy of the natural [[science]] ([[B. Kedrov]], [[I. Frolov]]), theory of perception and [[gnoseology]] ([[P. Kopnin]], [[V. Lektorsky]], [[Merab Mamardashvili|M. Mamardashvili]], [[Evald Vassilievich Ilyenkov|E. Ilyenkov]]), the history of philosophy ([[V. Asmus]], [[Alexei Losev|A. Losev]], [[I. Narski]]), ethics ([[O. Dobronitski]]), [[aesthetics]] ([[M. Kagan]], [[Leonid Stolovitsh|L. Stolovitsh]]), [[logics]] ([[Georgy Shchedrovitsky|G. Shchedrovitsky]], [[Aleksandr Zinovyev|A. Zinovyev]]) and [[semiotics]] and system theories ([[Yuri Lotman|Y. Lotman]], who set up the [[Sign Systems Studies]] journal, the oldest semiotics periodical; [[V. Sadovsky]]). The works of the young Marx, such as the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'', which had been first published in 1932 but suppressed under Stalin because of its incomplete break with [[German Idealism]], also started being discussed.

==Others==

1) [[Vasily Nalimov]] (1910-1997) was interested mainly in the philosophy of probability and its biological, mathematical, and linguistic manifestations. He also studied the roles of [[gnosticism]] and [[mysticism]] in science. Nalimov is usually credited with proposing the concept of [[citation index]].

2) The so-called "communist morality" was an important part of Soviet Union philosophy. According to Lenin and Stalin, morality should be subordinated to the ideology of proletarian revolution. Denying the validity of religion-based morality, they wrote: what is useful to us (the Soviet people) is moral, what is harmful to us is immoral. Morality is a weapon in class struggle. Party and Komsomol members were drilled to accept that position, and to act accordingly.

==Publications and propaganda==
The USSR published voluminous materials to disseminate its philosophical ideals and justifications. These took the form of academic or professional journals or notes in the pattern of peer-reviewed material. For example, the book below challenges the idea of a medical [[deontology]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} or ethics based on moral rules, versus ethics based on [[utilitarian]] rules decided on the best outcome for the greatest number of people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25438">'''Reciprocal altruism in humans''' refers to an individual behavior that gives benefit conditionally upon receiving a returned benefit, which draws on the economic concept – ″gains in trade″.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. In Barkow, J., Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (ed.), ''The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture'' (pp. 163-228). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Human reciprocal altruism would include the following behaviors (but is not limited to): helping patients, the wounded, and the others when they are in crisis; sharing food, implement, knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Trivers, L. R. (1971). The evolution of Reciprocal Altruism. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', 46(1), pp. 35-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The concept of ″altruism″ was firstly coined by the French philosopher Auguete Comte in the 19th century, which was derived from the French word ″''altruisme''″.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Comte believed that ″altruism″ is a moral doctrine, which is the opposite of egoism, emphasizing the noble morality of sacrificing themselves and benefiting others. Human beings have both selfish and altruistic motivations, and altruism is used to restrain the egoistical instinct.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. (1858). ''The catechism of positive religion''. London: John Chapman Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte’s altruism describes the nature of human and ethical significances, but it’s completely different from the altruism in biological sciences. In evolutionary biology, altruism is an individual behavior that benefits another individual’s fitness but reduces their own fitness in population&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, B. (2008). ''Selection: the mechanism of evolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 367-368.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ″altruism″ in biology arose from the debate of ″the Problem of Altruism″ in Natural Selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Charles Darwin suggested that animals behave in the ways that can increase their survival and reproductive chances while competing with others. However, altruistic behavior – the act of helping others even if it accompanies with a personal cost – is common in the animal kingdom, like the Vampire Bat&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, G. (1988). Reciprocal Altruism in bats and other mammals. ''Ethology and Sociobiology''. 9 (2–4): pp. 85–100.&lt;/ref&gt; and pariousrprimates.&lt;ref&gt;Seyfarth, R. M. &amp; Cheney, D. L. (1984). Grooming, alliances and reciprocal altruism in vervet monkeys. ''Nature''. 308 (5959): pp. 541–543.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Charles Darwin regarded ″the Problem of Altruism″ as a potential fatal challenge to his concept of natural selection. In ″The Descent of Man″, Darwin (1859) wrote:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Darwin, C. (1859). ''On the origin of species by means of Natural Selection''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1=He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature.}}

In 1964, William Hamilton&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hamilton, D. W. (1964). The genetic evolution of social behavior, I and II. ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'', 7, pp. 1-52.&lt;/ref&gt; developed mathematical model and put forward to his theory – ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory. ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory reveals that an altruistic gene evolved by natural selection. The gene can be only shared with relatives, and reduces the individuals own fitness but boots the fitness of their relatives and off-springs. In this way, this behavior increases the proportion of altruistic gene in population. Hamilton’s rule provides mathematical inequality to state that an altruistic gene spread by natural selection only if the following condition can be satisfied: r B &gt; C, where C is the cost to the individual performing the altruistic act, B is the benefit gained by the recipients of the altruistic act, r is the genetic relatedness between individual and recipients.

Hamilton's &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ″Kin selection″ theory or ″Inclusive fitness″ theory expands the Darwinian definition of ″fitness″ and continues the same Darwinian framework that allows the spread of not only selfish genes but also altruistic genes. Nevertheless, Hamilton’s theory did not support an appropriate explanation with unrelated members of other species. In order to solve this problem, Robert Trivers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; developed the original theory of reciprocal altruism into an attempt to explain the altruism behaviors among unrelated organisms. The idea of reciprocal altruism is straightforward: an altruistic behavior is probably selected only if a return would be obtained in the future. It is similar to the Tit-for-Tat strategy &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; from the game theory explained later in the paper.

The theory of reciprocal altruism in humanity, based on the biological characteristics of human beings and the realistic society, explicates the interdependence and cooperation between people, as well as its rationality. It also demonstrates the original motivations and the internal mechanisms of the human cooperation, revealing the inevitability and social significance ranging from kin altruism to un-relative altruism in the human population. As a result, the subjective guess and emotion of human cooperation can be refined to a theory, and is gradually become one of the most popular explanations to a variety of social behaviors. In addition, cooperation is the most deep-seated foundation for the formation and existence of human society. Therefore, the proposition of reciprocal altruism is undoubtedly a great theoretical advance in human cognition history.

Human reciprocal altruism seems to be a huge magnetic field to interweave different disciplines closely. New exploration has been made by these disciplines at different levels from different points. Generally, the core of Human reciprocal altruism is located in the puzzle: How to overcome short-term self-interest and achieve cooperation. Ultimately, it reveals that altruistic individuals are more competitive than selfish individuals, on either improving individual fitness or resolving conflicts. The compatibility and complementarity of different theoretical perspectives lay the basis of human reciprocal altruism, and help with exploring human different viewpoints of human reciprocal altruism. The debate of human reciprocal altruism has been the focus of biology, sociology, economics and culture.

== Scientific viewpoints==

=== Biology===
In 1902, Peter Kropotkin&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, P. (1902). ''Mutual aid: a factor of evolution''. New York: Alfred A. Knope.&lt;/ref&gt; published his monograph – ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'', and demonstrates the survival mechanisms of cooperation, based on various examplesm of animal and human societies. He attempted to reveal that the law of biological evolution is mutual aid rather than survival competition. Mutual aid and cooperation are the principles of all species’ biological evolution including human beings’, and the concepts resulting in a profound influence upon biological evolution. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E. O. (1975). ''Sociobiology: the new synthesis''. New York: Harvard University press.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the term of ″sociobiology″ as an attempt to explain social behavior of insect and thus explored the evolutionary mechanism of other animals including human such as the social behavior, altruism. He argued that human altruistic behavior, as one of the human nature characteristics, is the result of the genetic inheritance.

In 1971, Trivers published one of the most important biological articles of the 20th century -  ''The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and introduced the term of ″reciprocal altruism″ to explain the evolution of cooperation. The idea of reciprocal altruism is almost the same as kin selection, except to put emphasis on reciprocation instead of the need for genetic relatedness. It described that an altruistic trait or behavior may be selected, because the recipient will very likely to return benefits to the altruistic sender. If the reproductive benefit that the altruistic sender receives in return is larger than the cost initially incurred by the altruistic action, individuals who engage in this kind of reciprocal altruism will outbreed those who do not. Therefore, a seemingly altruistic trait can spread in a population. The reciprocation can be delayed as long as the individuals stay in the trade, and, so to speak, have sufficient long-term memory. This explains many features of human social life, for example, we do a favor for someone with the expectation that the favor would be remembered, and lead to a return in the future.

As Trivers supported the foundation for reciprocal altruism, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. (1981). The evolution of cooperation. ''Science'', 211, pp. 1390-1396.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the Game Theory to study the mechanism of reciprocal altruism, and attempted to answer the key question: How altruism spreads when cheating is an all-win strategy used by members of the population. In this paper, Axelrod and Hamilton &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; revealed that reciprocating the assistance from another individual is stable in evolution as long as there are enough altruists in the population.  They also demonstrate that a population of altruists can initially emerge through inclusive fitness, helping and receiving help among genetically related individuals. Subsequent work indicates that only a few altruists are initially needed for the emergence of reciprocation in a heterogeneous population.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (1992). Tit for Tat in heterogeneous population. ''Nature'', 355, pp.250–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evolutionary biologists, like Richard Dawkins, wholly endorse Axelrod and Hamilton’s work in individual selection. In describing genes as being selfish, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976). ''The selfish gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the organisms act altruistically against their individual interests in order to help copies of themselves in other bodies to replicate. Essentially, reciprocal altruism is the individual behavior behind selfish motivations. The bird is a prime example in the narrative of Dawkins:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; those altruistic birds who sacrifice their own interests by reproducing late or less during hard times would not have been able to pass their altruistic genes to the future generations, which will be dominated by the selfish genes from birds who take advantage of the situation by using up others’ food supply to reproduce their own offspring. Nevertheless, some scholars such as K. Lorenz and W. Edwards have been strongly opposed to the individual selection. In contrast, they spearhead the campaign of group selection.

The debate whether individuals/gene or group/species are the basic level/unit of selection has occurred since the 1960s. The major idea of group selection is that individuals may sacrifice their own reproductive interests for the benefit of the survival of the group to which they belong. W. Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, W. V. C. (1962). ''Animal dispersion in relation to social behavior''. Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd.&lt;/ref&gt; builds this argument mainly on birth related behaviors of birds. He points out that many bird species with small clutches have prolonged periods before reaching reproductive maturity, and have long breeding seasons sometimes in excess of one year. Other group selection supporters also argue that these behaviors must be social and altruistic in that, for example, when food supply is abundant, clutches are bigger than when food supply is more scarce. Birds thus can regulate their population densities below starvation levels through social conventions. All of these characteristics run contrary to the idea that fitness is defined by individual organisms attempting to selfishly reproduce. However, it soon became clear that group selection was losing the battle. In 1966, George Williams&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G. C. (1966). ''Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published the influential ''Adaptation and Natural'' ''Selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. By the end of the 1960s, a Neo-Darwinian interpretation of the modern synthesis had taken hold and it has become almost a gold standard that the unit of evolutionary analysis is at the individual's and the gene’s level. Dawkins, Hamilton, and Trivers represent the mainstream view of individual selection.

=== Sociology===
Some scholars, such as Michael Taylor, Anatol Rapoport, Robert Keohane, Arthur Stein, Helen Milner and Kennth Oye, point out that reciprocal altruism widely spread in international relations and human society, and international reciprocity is the foundation of the international community. States act in the confidence that their cooperative actions will be repaid in the long term instead of seeking for the immediate benefit, so reciprocal altruism can be seen as generally accepted standards in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, R. O. (1986). Reciprocity in international relations. ''International Organization'', 40(1), pp. 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal scale, some scholars believe that reciprocal altruism derives from the subjective feeling of individuals and compliance with social rules. Smith put forward an alternative based on the idea of sympathy and indicates that altruistic behavior is the product of the measure of gains and losses, emphasizing that people are easy to compare with others when measuring the gains and losses. Due to this, the subjective sense of fairness exerts an effect on people's altruistic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil, E. L. (2001). Adam Smith and three theories of altruism. ''Louvain Economic Review'', 67(4), pp.421-435.&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, social norms can be argued to reduce individual level variation and competition, thus shifting selection to the group level, so human behavior should be consistent with social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2008). Evolution ″for the good of the group″. ''American Scientist'', 96 (5): pp. 380–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Altruistic behavior is the result of learning and internalizing these social norms by individuals.

=== Economy===

==== Economic model ====
The economic model of reciprocal altruism includes direct reciprocity and indirect reciprocity. Direct reciprocity is an immediate collaborative exchange that benefits everyone. Direct reciprocity was introduced by Robert Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ) as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. The direct reciprocal is typically one-for-one: I incur the cost today to benefit you, you incur the cost at some point later on to benefit me. There is little negotiation and the exchange is simple. The strategy of ″the prisoner dilemma″ is the common direct reciprocity.

The Prisoners Dilemma requires that:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:temptation to defect (T=+5) &gt; reward for mutual cooperation(R=+3) &gt; being a sucker (S=-2)

and that:

:reward for mutual cooperation (R=+3) &gt; (T+S)/2.

There is immediate and obvious benefit from direct reciprocity and relatively little need for trust into the future. Cheating is a critical question and may happen at some time.

In the context of Indirect reciprocity, two players are randomly selected in a population, one is donor while the other is recipient. Each player can play many times, but never with the same partner twice. Thus it is impossible that a cheat is held to account by the victim. Obviously, trigger strategies can ensure a cooperative Nash equilibrium. If all players use these strategies, no player would have deviated.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Nowak, M. &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. ''Nature'', 437, pp.1291-1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In many situations, cooperation is favored and it even benefits an individual to forgive a defection but cooperative societies are always unstable because mutants which are inclined to defect may lose any balance.&lt;ref&gt;Tbomas, R. (2012). Does it pay to be nice? – the math of altruism. Retrieved from April 23, 2017:&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Indirect reciprocity typifies two forms: ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the description of "Figure1. Direct and indirect reciprocity", Nowak and Sigmund provided the explicit identifications of ″Upstream reciprocity″ and ″Downstream reciprocity″:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Upstream reciprocity is based on a recent positive experience. A person who has been at the receiving end of a donation may feel motivated to donate in turn. Individual B, who has just received help from A, goes on to help C. ‘Downstream reciprocity’ is built on reputation. Individual A has helped B and therefore receives help from C. Mathematical investigations of indirect reciprocity have shown that natural selection can favor strategies that help others based on their reputation. Upstream reciprocity is harder to understand but is observed in economic experiments. In both cases, the decision to help can be interpreted as a misdirected act of gratitude. In one case recipients are thanked for what another did; in the other case they are thanked by someone who did not profit by what they did".(p.&amp;nbsp;1292.)

==== Utility function====
Utility function&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072915/what-utility-function-and-how-it-calculated.asp|title=utility Function|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an important concept in economy that measures preferences over a set of goods and services using mathematics. In general, a utility function U (X, Y) will represent a consumer’s preferences for different goods if the following condition holds:

:U(A) &gt; U(B) if and only if A is preferred to B.

Economists, such as Gary S. Becker, use the theory of utility function and establish the hypothesis of altruism model. Becker&lt;ref&gt;Becker, S. G. (1976). ''The economic approach to human behavior''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the donor's utility function includes the utility of potential recipients. That is, the donor would donate a resource if the vicarious enjoyment of watching the pleasure of others exceeds at the margin the donor's satisfaction from consuming the resource himself. He indicates that all human behaviors are the maximization of different utility functions, and attempts to establish all human behaviors on the basis of generalized utility theory with resource constraints. He also puts the human irrational behavior into the framework of this analysis, emphasizing that human altruistic behavior can be defined by the generalized utility function appropriately.

==== Game theory====
Game theory, especially the prisoner’s dilemma, is originally introduced by Trivers&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to explain the mechanism of reciprocal altruism. Unlike Hamilton’s inclusive fitness where the selection of an altruistic allele is ″secured″ by the extent of genetic relatedness between the donor and recipient, reciprocation is no guarantee and, in fact, cheating or not reciprocating is evolutionarily stable because cheaters are doubly rewarded reproductively. That is, they receive a benefit from helpers and, at the same time, helpers bear a cost for the cheaters, although the cost is smaller than the benefit.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Smith, J. M. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory of games. Cambridge'': Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The relationship between donor and recipient in reciprocal altruism is exactly analogous to the situation of the prisoner’s dilemma. In Triver’s narrative,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the prisoner’s dilemma can be characterized by the following payoff matrix:
{| class="wikitable"
|
|A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|R, R
|S, T
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|T, S
|P, P
|}

Where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the individuals’ altruistic acts and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the cheating acts, and where T represents the temptation to defect, R represents the reward for mutual cooperation and S stands for being a sucker.

And the following inequality must hold for reciprocal altruism:

:S &lt; P &lt; R &lt; T.

The Prisoner's dilemma becomes the classical example to understand the reciprocal altruism. Combining the theory of biological evolution with classical game theory, Maynard Smith&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and George. R. Price explained how selfish individuals can achieve cooperation and develop the basic equilibrium concept in evolutionary - Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). Evolutionarily Stable Strategy is a strategy and adopted by a population in a given environment. An ESS is an equilibrium refinement of the Nash equilibrium that once it is fixed in a population, natural selection alone is sufficient to prevent alternative strategies from invading successfully. Simultaneously, the collaboration between Axelrod and Hamilton is also significant for applying game theory to evolutionary issues. Their paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the book ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games'',&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, J. (1982). ''Evolution and the theory'' ''of games.'' London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; written by John Maynard, illustrate that the process of natural selection can be mathematically modeled using game theory. In essence, natural selection entails differential replication of genes. That is, different traits and attributes are selected for or against because of the different effects they have on their ″own″ genetic reproduction or replication. The differential replication process, independent of its underlying nature being biological, physiological, or psychological, can be approximated by game theory. Different game-theoretical strategies have imbedded probabilistic functions that result in their winning or losing a game, similar to the selecting - for or selecting - against of genes.

The strategy of game theory discussed in Axelrod and Hamilton's paper&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; is called Tit for Tat. Tit for Tat represents such a strategy that, in a repeated game, the player starts by not telling on the other player or cooperates and subsequently reciprocates the same action undertaken by the other player. That is, the player cooperates if the other player cooperates and defects if the other player defects. As a game theoretical strategy, Tit for Tat essentially entails the same concept as Trivers' reciprocal altruism. Unlike Trivers' original publication which provides conceptual explanations and examples, Axelrod and Hamilton's paper provides more rigorous mathematical proofs of the viability or ESS of reciprocal altruism.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, L. R. (2002). ''Natural selection and social theory: Selected papers of Robert Trivers''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal altruism has since become one of the major theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology and game theory, and the repeated prisoner's dilemma game has also become popular tools by which to derive and test evolutionary psychological concepts. Social interactions similar in form to Tit for Tat are prevalent in our daily lives. When someone does you a favor, you feel you owe that person. If you fail to return the favor, you are likely to feel guilty and may try to find ways to overcompensate for your friend. Generally, when you do favors for another person, you are also likely to expect something in return. When that person fails to reciprocate, you may feel cheated and may seek revenge by not being generous to the person in the future. On the other hand, when someone gives you a large gift for which you did not do anything, you may feel uncomfortable and even resentful because you do not want to owe the person a debt. These behaviors and emotions that have clearly been selected for are consistent with the Tit for Tat game theoretical strategy and reciprocal altruism.

=== Culture ===
D. S. Wilson and E. O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. S. &amp; Wilson, E. O. (2007). Rethinking the theoretical foundation of sociobiology. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'', 82(4), pp. 327-348.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the speed and function of "gene evolution" in human society is far less than that of "cultural evolution", but these two elements interact, thus they achieve the evolution of human altruism. To further illustrate this mechanism, Dawkins&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; proposed the concept of ″Meme″ in his book ''The selfish gene.'' ″Meme″{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} refers to ″an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture″. It is seen as the basic unit of culture that can be transmitted from one mind to another. Susan Blackmore is one of the scholars that has made contributions to the theory of ″Meme″. Blackmore&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. (1999). ''The Meme machine''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that memes are the medium of the spread of altruism. The transmission of altruism has been carried out through memes. Memes are true evolutionary replicators like genetics and undergo evolutionary change.

{{for|the Reconstruction-era political coalition in the United States|Redeemers}}
The '''redemption movement''' is a debt repudiation and [[tax evasion]] movement active primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="meads"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Meads v. Meads|vol=2012|reporter=ABQB|opinion=571|pinpoint=¶ 529 ''et seq.''|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html|accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the movement rely on the belief that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim this fund to pay bills. Common redemption schemes include '''acceptance for value''' (A4V), '''Treasury Direct Accounts''' (TDA) and '''secured party creditor''' kits.

Although the movement has maintained a small following since the 1990s, its theories are false and meritless. Those who participate in redemption schemes, and especially those who promote them to other people, can face criminal charges and imprisonment. Several government institutions have issued stern warnings about the fraudulent character of redemption schemes.

==History==
The redemption movement is an offshoot of [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]], an American [[right-wing populist]] organization established in 1969 by leaders of the white-supremacist [[Christian Identity]] sect. The Posse denounced [[income tax]], [[credit theory of money|debt-based currency]] and [[debt collection]] as tools of [[antisemitism|Jewish control]] over the country.&lt;ref name="balleck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balleck|first1=Barry|title=Allegiance to Liberty: The Changing Face of Patriots, Militias, and Political Violence in America|date=2014|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-1-4408-3095-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_k7BQAAQBAJ|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found an audience among farmers hit by an [[farm crisis|agricultural recession]] during the 1970s and 1980s. One such supporter was Roger Elvick, a former North Dakota farmer who had lost his farm in a business deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bye v.

Debt cancellation schemes and prosecutions similar to Elvick's continued through the 1990s, including [[Family Farm Preservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine militia members indicted in checks scam|date=May 18, 1996|work=The Journal Times|url=https://journaltimes.com/news/local/nine-militia-members-indicted-in-checks-scam/article_a9b93ea0-68f8-5427-9922-b978c968300b.html|accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Montana Freemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Brooke|title=Officials Say Montana 'Freemen' Collected $1.8 Million in Scheme|date=March 29, 1996|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/29/us/officials-say-montana-freemen-collected-1.8-million-in-scheme.html|accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elvick resumed his activities after his release in 1997, giving seminars around the country, and the use of redemption schemes surged.&lt;ref name="splc2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|title=New Multi-Million Dollar Scam Takes off in Antigovernment Circles|journal=Intelligence Report|date=Winter 2002|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/new-multi-million-dollar-scam-takes-antigovernment-circles|accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Ohio charged him with corrupt business activity in 2005 and sentenced him to four years in prison.&lt;ref name="splc2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|title=His 'Straw Man' Free, a Scammer Finds the Rest of Him Isn't|journal=Intelligence Report|date=Summer 2005|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2005/his-straw-man-free-scammer-finds-rest-him-isnt|accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s, the belief in a secret bank account had become a fixture of redemption schemes. The origin of this idea is not clear, but elements of it appeared in ''Lodi v. Lodi'' (1981). In that case, plaintiff Oreste Lodi sued "Oreste Lodi, Beneficiary," produced a [[birth certificate]] as evidence that the defendant controlled his [[estate (law)|estate]], and served his complaint upon the IRS. The [[Shasta County]] Superior Court dismissed plaintiff Lodi's case for [[failure to state a claim]] and an appeals court upheld the dismissal.&lt;ref name="Lodi"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Lodi v. Lodi|vol=173|reporter=Cal.App. 3rd|opinion=628|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/173/628.html|accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purported redemption methods==
The details of redemption schemes vary, but they typically rest on the same assumptions: (1) a distinction between a living individual and a corresponding [[legal person]] or "[[strawman theory|straw man]]," (2) valuable property possessed by the legal person, but rightfully belonging to the individual, and (3) a supposed procedure by which the individual can claim the property to pay debts. Promoters justify these assumptions with elaborate historical tales. The most common explanation claims that the United States went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] when it abandoned the [[gold standard]] in 1933 and started using its citizens as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] so that it could borrow money.&lt;ref name="meads"/&gt;

Supposed procedures for using the nonexistent "straw man" funds include:

* Filing a [[UCC-1 financing statement]] or UCC-3 amended statement against the straw man&lt;ref name="RevRul2004-31"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rev.

Aside from the risk of criminal charges, redemption processes also fail to discharge debts. In a frequently-cited 2007 foreclosure case, a debtor attempted to pay her home mortgage with a redemption "bill of exchange" at the suggestion of promoter Barton Buhtz. The United States District Court concluded that "the legal authorities Plaintiff cites and the facts she alleges suggest that she did not tender payment, but rather a worthless piece of paper. Other courts addressing claims nearly identical to Plaintiff's have found likewise."&lt;ref name="BryantvWaMu"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bryant v. Washington Mutual Bank|vol=524|reporter=F.

To caution people away from redemption schemes, several U.S. agencies have issued warnings against them.

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

==Greek philosophers==
&lt;small&gt;
{| align="right" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| LOGIC || ARISTOTLE || GRAMMAR
|-
| subject || onoma || noun
|-
| predicate || rhema || verb
|-
| proposition || logos || sentence 
|-
|}&lt;/small&gt;

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} page 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Septuagint usage==
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} page 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

'''Scientific realism''' is the view that the universe described by science is [[reality|real]] regardless of how it may be interpreted. 

Within [[philosophy of science]], this view is often an answer to the question "how is the success of science to be explained?" The discussion on the success of science in this context centers primarily on the status of [[unobservable|unobservable entities]] apparently talked about by scientific [[theory|theories]]. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same [[Ontology|ontological]] status) as observables, as opposed to [[instrumentalism]].

==Main features==

Scientific realism involves the two basic positions. First, it is a set of claims about the features of an ideal scientific theory; an ideal theory is the sort of theory science aims to produce.  Second, it is the commitment that science will eventually produce theories very much like an ideal theory and that science has done pretty well thus far in some domains.  It is important to note that one might be a scientific realist regarding some sciences while not being a realist regarding others.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

According to scientific realism, an ideal scientific theory has the following features:
*The claims the theory makes are either true or false, depending on whether the entities talked about by the theory exist and are correctly described by the theory. This is the [[semantic]] commitment of scientific realism.
*The entities described by the scientific theory exist objectively and mind-independently.  This is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] commitment of scientific realism.
*There are reasons to believe some significant portion of what the theory says. This is the  [[epistemology|epistemological]] commitment.

Combining the first and the second claim [[logical consequence|entails]] that an ideal scientific theory says definite things about genuinely existing entities. The third claim says that we have reasons to believe that many scientific claims about these entities are true.

Scientific realism usually holds that science makes progress, i.e. scientific theories usually get successively better, or, rather, answer more and more questions.  For this reason, many people{{who|date=November 2013}}, scientific realist or otherwise, hold that realism should make sense of the progress of science in terms of theories being successively more like the ideal theory that scientific realists describe{{whose quote}}.

===Characteristic claims===
The following claims are typical of those held by scientific realists.  Due to the wide disagreements over the nature of science's success and the role of realism in its success, a scientific realist would agree with some but not all of the following positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Scientific Realism|author=Jarrett Leplin|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=0-520-05155-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFCpopYlB9EC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The best scientific theories are at least partially true.
*The best theories do not employ central terms that are [[Theory of reference#Sense without reference|non referring expressions]].
*To say that a theory is approximately true is sufficient explanation of the degree of its [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictive]] success.
*The approximate truth of a theory is the only explanation of its predictive success.
*Even if a theory employs expressions that do not have a reference, a scientific theory may be approximately true.
*Scientific theories are in a historical process of progress towards a true account of the physical world.
*Scientific theories make genuine, existential claims.
*Theoretical claims of scientific theories should be read literally and are definitively either true or false.
*The degree of the predictive success of a theory is evidence of the referential success of its central terms.
*The goal of science is an account of the physical world that is literally true.  Science has been successful because this is the goal that it has been making progress towards.

==History==

Scientific realism is related to much older philosophical positions including [[rationalism]] and [[metaphysical realism]]. However, it is a thesis about science developed in the twentieth century. Portraying scientific realism in terms of its ancient, medieval, and early modern cousins is at best misleading.

Scientific realism is developed largely as a reaction to [[logical positivism]]. Logical positivism was the first philosophy of science in the twentieth century and the forerunner of scientific realism, holding that a sharp distinction can be drawn between observational terms and theoretical terms, the latter capable of semantic analysis in observational and logical terms.

Logical positivism encountered difficulties with:
*The [[verificationist]] theory of meaning—see [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]] (1950).
*Troubles with the analytic-synthetic distinction—see [[W.V. Quine|Quine]] (1950).
*The theory-ladenness of observation—see [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]] (1970) and Quine (1960).
*Difficulties moving from the observationality of terms to observationality of sentences—see [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] (1962).
*The vagueness of the observational-theoretical distinction—see [[Grover Maxwell|Maxwell]] (1962).
These difficulties for logical positivism suggest, but do not entail, scientific realism, and lead to the development of realism as a philosophy of science.

Realism became the dominant philosophy of science after positivism.{{citationneeded|date=February 2018}} [[Bas van Fraassen]] in his book ''The Scientific Image'' (1980) developed [[constructive empiricism]] as an alternative to realism.  Responses to van Fraassen have sharpened realist positions and lead to some revisions of scientific realism.

==Arguments for and against scientific realism==
=== No miracles argument ===
One of the main arguments for scientific realism centers on the notion that scientific knowledge is progressive in nature, and that it is able to predict phenomena successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Cappelen|Cappelen, H.]], [[Tamar Gendler|Gendler, T. S.]], &amp; [[John Hawthorne|Hawthorne, J.]], eds., [http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199668779 ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodology''] ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2016), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=oaakDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT401#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.401-402].&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific realists (e.g., [[Ernan McMullin]], [[Richard Boyd]]) think the operational success of a theory lends credence to the idea that its more unobservable aspects exist, because they were how the theory reasoned its predictions. For example, a scientific realist would argue that science must derive some [[Ontology|ontological]] support for atoms from the outstanding phenomenological success of all the theories using them.

Arguments for scientific realism often appeal to [[abductive reasoning]] or "inference to the best explanation" (Lipton, 2004). For instance, one argument commonly used &amp;ndash; the "miracle argument" or "no miracles argument" &amp;ndash; starts out by observing that scientific theories are highly successful in predicting and explaining a variety of phenomena, often with great accuracy. Thus, it is argued that the best explanation &amp;ndash; the only explanation that renders the success of science to not be what [[Hilary Putnam]] calls "a miracle" &amp;ndash; is the view that our scientific theories (or at least the best ones) provide true descriptions of the world, or approximately so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/scientific-realism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Anjan|last=Chakravartty|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=10 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bas van Fraassen]] replies with an evolutionary analogy: "I claim that the success of current scientific theories is no miracle. It is not even surprising to the scientific (Darwinist) mind. For any scientific theory is born into a life of fierce competition, a jungle red in tooth and claw. Only the successful theories survive—the ones which in fact latched on to actual regularities in nature." (''The Scientific Image'', 1980)

=== Pessimistic induction ===
[[Pessimistic induction]], one of the main arguments against realism, argues that the history of science contains many theories once regarded as empirically successful but which are now believed to be false. Additionally, the history of science contains many empirically successful theories whose unobservable terms are not believed to genuinely refer. For example, the effluvial theory of static electricity is an empirically successful theory whose central unobservable terms have been replaced by later theories.

Realists reply that replacement of particular realist theories with better ones is to be expected due to the progressive nature of scientific knowledge, and when such replacements occur only superfluous unobservables are dropped. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]] showed that the concept of the [[luminiferous ether]] could be dropped because it had contributed nothing to the success of the theories of [[mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]]. On the other hand, when theory replacement occurs, a well-supported concept, such as the concept of [[atom]]s, is not dropped but is incorporated into the new theory in some form. These replies can lead scientific realists to [[Structuralism (philosophy of science)|structural realism]].

=== Constructivist epistemology ===
[[constructivist epistemology|Social constructivists]] might argue that scientific realism is unable to account for the rapid change that occurs in scientific knowledge during periods of revolution. Constructivists may also argue that the success of theories is only a part of the construction. However, these arguments ignore the fact that many scientists are not realists. In fact, during what is perhaps the most notable example of revolution in science—the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s—the dominant philosophy of science was [[logical positivism]]. The alternative realist [[Bohm interpretation]] and [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics do not make such a revolutionary break with the concepts of [[classical physics]].

=== Underdetermination problem ===
Another argument against scientific realism, deriving from the [[underdetermination|underdetermination problem]], is not so historically motivated as these others. It claims that observational data can in principle be explained by multiple theories that are mutually incompatible. Realists might counter by saying that there have been few actual cases of underdetermination in the history of science. Usually the requirement of explaining the data is so exacting that scientists are lucky to find even one theory that fulfills it. Furthermore, if we take the underdetermination argument seriously, it implies that we can know about only what we have directly [[observation|observed]]. For example, we could not theorize that [[dinosaur]]s once lived based on the [[fossil]] evidence because other theories (e.g., that the fossils are clever hoaxes) can account for the same data.

'''Terrell Ward Bynum''' (born 1941) is an American [[philosopher]], writer and editor. Bynum is currently director of the Research Center on Computing and Society at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], where he is also a professor of philosophy, and visiting professor in the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility in [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/?p=471|title=Biography|publisher=[[Southern Connecticut State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as a pioneer and historian in the field of [[Computer ethics|computer]] and [[information ethics]]; for his achievements in that field, he was awarded the [[Barwise Prize]] of the [[American Philosophical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ia-cap.org/awards-barwise.php|title=Barwise Prize|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312214212/http://www.ia-cap.org/awards-barwise.php|archivedate=2007-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Weizenbaum Award]] of the International Society for Ethics and Information Technology,&lt;ref&gt;See his biography in Who's Who in America 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2011 [[Covey Award]] of the [[International Association for Computing and Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iacap.org/awards/|title=Awards|publisher=[[International Association for Computing and Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Bynum was the founder and longtime editor-in-chief of the philosophy journal ''Metaphilosophy'' (1968 to 1993);&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Ward Bynum, "Creating the Journal Metaphilosophy", ''Metaphilosophy'', Vol. 42, No. 3, pp. 186&amp;ndash;191.&lt;/ref&gt; a key founding figure (1974–1980) and the first executive director (1980–1982) of the [[American Association of Philosophy Teachers]]; biographer of the philosopher/ mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]], as well as a translator of Frege's early works in [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege, Conceptual Notation and Related Articles, Translated and Edited with a Biography and Introduction by Terrell Ward Bynum, The Clarendon Press, 1972 (Reprinted as an Oxford Scholarly Classic, 2002) {{ISBN|0-19-824359-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bynum's most recent research and publications concern the ultimate nature of the universe and the impact of the [[information revolution]] upon philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See the list of Selected Publications in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

As a teenager with a home [[chemistry]] set, Bynum became interested in the ultimate nature of the universe, an interest that was reinforced by a high school chemistry teacher who taught "the new chemistry" of the 1950s, and also by an English teacher who assigned philosophical writing exercises to her students. After high school, Bynum studied chemistry at the [[University of Delaware]] (1959 to 1963), where, in 1961, philosopher Bernard Baumrin created the Delaware Seminars in Philosophy of Science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_science.html?id=_QgDSwAACAAJ|title=Philosophy of science|publisher=[[Interscience]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring lectures by world-famous philosophers of science, such as [[Carl Hempel]], [[Adolph Grunbaum]], and [[Ernest Nagel]].  Impressed by the Delaware Seminars, Bynum added philosophy as a second field of study, and Baumrin became his logic teacher and mentor. At that time, Bynum developed a strong interest in the life and work of philosopher/ mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. As an undergraduate at the [[University of Delaware]], Bynum was surprised to learn that, although [[Gottlob Frege]] was considered by many to be "the greatest logician since [[Aristotle]]", very little was known about Frege's life, and some of his most important logical writings had never been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Ward Bynum, Preface, in Gottlob Frege, Conceptual Notation and Related Articles, Translated and Edited with a Biography and Introduction by Terrell Ward Bynum, The Clarendon Press, 1972 (Reprinted as an Oxford Scholarly Classic, 2002) {{ISBN|0-19-824359-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bynum vowed to write Frege's biography and translate Frege’s most important logical works, if the opportunity arose to do so.

In 1963, Bynum graduated from Delaware with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with Honors and Distinction and a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy with Honors and Distinction. His senior thesis derived a complex acid-base algorithm from the laws of thermodynamics using symbolic logic. In 1963&amp;ndash;64, he was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] at the [[University of Bristol]], England, studying philosophy of science with [[Stephan Körner]]. From 1964 to 1967 he was a graduate student, with a [[Danforth Fellowship]] and a [[Woodrow Wilson Fellowship]], in [[Princeton University]]'s Program in the History and Philosophy of Science. In that program, he took courses that included, among others, history of science with [[Thomas Kuhn]], philosophy of science with Carl Hempel, logic with [[Alonzo Church]], and analytic philosophy with [[Richard Rorty]]. In 1966, he was awarded an MA in philosophy by Princeton. While still at Princeton, Bynum began writing a manuscript on Frege, which originally was to be a doctoral dissertation, but developed, instead, into the "Frege project".

To complete his university education, Bynum entered the PhD Program in philosophy at the Graduate Center of the [[City University of New York]] in 1982. He was granted an MPhil in philosophy from CUNY in 1984 and a PhD in philosophy in 1986. His doctoral dissertation was entitled ''Aristotle's Theory of Human Action'', and it was written under the direction of Bernard Baumrin.

==Frege Project (1962 to 1972)==

As a graduate student in Princeton's Program in History and Philosophy of Science, Bynum chose to make Frege's philosophy of mathematics and groundbreaking logical achievements the center of his graduate school research. This "Frege project" began to flourish in summer 1965 when Bynum was in Europe. He interviewed [[Bertrand Russell]], who had discovered the famous "[[Russell's paradox]]" in Frege’s logical foundation for arithmetic; and he also interviewed [[Rudolf Carnap]], who had been a student of Frege's. Of special importance was a meeting that Bynum had with Ignacio Angelelli, who recently had visited [[Jena University]] in Germany where Frege spent his entire academic career. While in Jena, Angelelli had secured a photograph of Frege and a wealth of materials about Frege’s career and personal life. He generously shared those materials with Bynum. During 1966 and 1967, Bynum completed the bulk of the work on his biography of Frege, his English translation of Frege's ''Begriffsschrift'' and related articles, and his extensive annotated Frege bibliography. In 1972 the resulting Frege book was published by the Clarendon Press branch of Oxford University Press. In 2002, it was republished as an Oxford Scholarly Classic,&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Ward Bynum, Preface, in Gottlob Frege, Conceptual Notation and Related Articles, Translated and Edited with a Biography and Introduction by Terrell Ward Bynum, The Clarendon Press, 1972 (Reprinted as an Oxford Scholarly Classic, 2002) {{ISBN|0-19-824359-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to the editors of that Oxford series, is a "great academic work" containing "some of the finest scholarship of the last century".&lt;ref&gt;See the blurb on the back cover of the 2002 Oxford Scholarly Classic Edition of Terrell Ward Bynum, Preface, in Gottlob Frege, Conceptual Notation and Related Articles, Translated and Edited with a Biography and Introduction by Terrell Ward Bynum&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Metaphilosophy'' ==

In the mid 1960s, while he was a graduate student at Princeton, Bynum attended Richard Rorty's seminar on the history of analytic philosophy, where Rorty was trying out various articles for possible inclusion in his forthcoming book The Linguistic Turn. According to Bynum, he and his fellow graduate students "were amazed at Professor Rorty's ability to 'stand back' from philosophy and describe how one branch of philosophy relates to another, how one school or method of philosophy compares to other schools and methods, how philosophy relates to other disciplines, and so on... [Rorty] had a remarkable ability to explain and compare an impressive diversity of philosophical movements, schools, methods and trends."&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Ward Bynum, "Creating the journal Metaphilosophy", in ''Metaphilosophy'', Vol. 42, No. 3, April 2011, pp. 186–190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bynum believed that there should be a philosophy journal specializing in the publication of such metaphilosophical articles, and he was surprised to discover that no such journal existed. He vowed, at that time, to create such a journal himself in a decade or two after he had established his career in philosophy. Surprisingly, he created such a journal, instead, in 1968, just a year after leaving Princeton. This happened because he sustained a serious eye accident in August 1968 that left him flat on his back in bed for a number of weeks. As a result, he quickly became bored and tried to think of something constructive to do. He hit upon the idea of creating the journal ''Metaphilosophy'', and sought the advice of his undergraduate mentor, Bernard Baumrin. Baumrin suggested that Bynum should persuade a number of famous philosophers to serve on a Board of Consulting Editors, then send a journal proposal to the publisher Basil Blackwell, who already published several important philosophy journals, such as ''Mind''. Bynum followed Baumrin's advice and sent a proposal to Blackwell in late 1968. Blackwell accepted Bynum's proposal, and the first issue of ''Metaphilosophy'' was published in January 1970. The journal flourished, and in 1977 the librarians' magazine Choice described it as "one of the top English-language philosophy journals". Bynum remained Editor-in-Chief of ''Metaphilosophy'' until 1993, when he turned it over to his colleague, Armen Marsoobian, at Southern Connecticut State University, because he had become very busy creating and running the Research Center on Computing and Society.

== American Association of Philosophy Teachers ==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, during the [[Vietnam War]], university students across America demanded that their university courses should be "relevant" to their lives and to the solution of urgent social problems. In this environment, as the Editor-in-Chief of ''Metaphilosophy'', Bynum had begun (in 1969) to accept articles on topics, such as "applied philosophy" and philosophical analyses of social unrest, as well as articles on the improvement of the teaching of philosophy. By 1974, Bynum was convinced that there should be a national conference on the teaching of philosophy, not only to improve the teaching of traditional philosophy courses, but also to create new courses in applied philosophy in new environments, such as elementary schools, high schools, technical colleges, public libraries, prisons and "old folks' homes". He organized and headed a conference planning committee consisting of scholars and teachers from universities, colleges, technical schools, high schools, elementary schools, and a representative of the American Philosophical Association. The resulting conference was called The National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy, and it occurred on the campus of [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]] in August 1976. It lasted five days and attracted over 300 attendees from the United States, Canada and Japan. At the closing session, the attendees asked Bynum and his committee to put together a similar conference to be held two years later.

In August 1978, the Second National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy, again headed by Bynum, occurred for a second time on the Union College campus. At the closing session, attendees asked Bynum and his committee to put together a professional organization to run such a workshop-conference every two years. Bynum appointed and headed a steering committee to create the new organization, which was to be called the American Association of Philosophy Teachers. In 1979, with advice from the steering committee, Bynum wrote the constitution and articles of incorporation and filed legal papers to make AAPT an official non-profit educational membership corporation of the State of New York. In August 1980, on the campus of the [[University of Toledo]], the Third National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy became the first official conference of AAPT, and Bynum was selected as the first executive director, a position that he held for four years. He remained on the AAPT's board of officers until 1994, serving as vice-president in 1989 to 1990, president in 1991–1992, and past-president in 1993&amp;ndash;1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyteachers.org/history.shtml|title=History of the AAPT|publisher=[[American Association of Philosophy Teachers]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727175404/http://www.philosophyteachers.org/history.shtml|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, AAPT has continued to run Workshop-Conferences in August every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophyteachers.org/past_conferences.shtml|title=Past Conferences|publisher=[[American Association of Philosophy Teachers]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727175757/http://www.philosophyteachers.org/past_conferences.shtml|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Center on Computing and Society ==

In 1978, Bynum attended a workshop on the topic of computer ethics conducted by Walter Maner, who was a member of the Philosophy Department of Old Dominion University. Maner had recently coined the name "computer ethics" and was teaching an experimental course on that subject at Old Dominion. That workshop was a career-changing event for Bynum, who became convinced by Maner that computer ethics was a vital subject that should be advanced and expanded. Bynum set himself the goal of spreading knowledge of computer ethics across America. With advice from Maner, he began to incorporate computer ethics components into his university courses, and he also started conducting workshops of his own. He encouraged Maner to publish his booklet, "A Starter-Kit on Teaching Computer Ethics", with the help of a small publishing company, Helvetia Press, that Bynum and his Swiss wife had created to disseminate applied-philosophy teaching materials generated by National Workshop-Conferences on Teaching Philosophy. (See the discussion of AAPT above.) Maner's "Starter Kit" was acquired by scores of schools and colleges across America in the early 1980s.{{cite book |last= Maner |first= Walter | title= [[A Starter Kit on Teaching Computer Ethics]] |publisher= [[Helvetia Press]] |year= 1980}}

Also in the early 1980s, to demonstrate to fellow philosophers that computer ethics was an important and viable new branch of applied ethics, Bynum decided to create an entire computer ethics issue of the journal ''Metaphilosophy'' (he was editor-in-chief of the journal at the time). To generate papers for the special issue, he arranged an essay competition on the topic of computer ethics, with a $500 first prize plus publication in the special issue for the best half-dozen submitted papers. Professor James Moor of Dartmouth submitted the prize-winning paper "What is Computer Ethics?" which became the lead article in the special issue. The issue had its own title (Computers and Ethics) and "book cover", and it was published as the October 1985 issue of ''Metaphilosophy''. It quickly became the widest-selling issue of the journal and remained so for many years. {{cite book |last= Bynum |first= Terrell | title= [[Computers and Ethics]] |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |year= 1985 |volume= 15}}

In 1986 Bynum decided to find a university that would enable him to create a world-class research center on computer ethics. The following year he joined the faculty at Southern Connecticut State University, where he created, in 1988, the Research Center on Computing and Society. To generate a "critical mass" of scholars with whom his Center could work, Bynum decided to organize a national conference to which he would invite philosophers, computer scientists, and other academics, as well as public policy makers and journalists. He and Walter Maner decided to work together to plan the conference. In 1989, the National Science Foundation provided a conference-planning grant (grant # DIR-8820595) enabling Bynum and Maner to form a committee of 16 distinguished scholars and computer science leaders to plan the National Conference on Computing and Values (NCCV). In August 1991, NCCV (funded by NSF grant # DIR-9012492) was held at Southern Connecticut State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalhumanities.org/humanist/Archives/Virginia/v04/1016.html |title= Computing and Values }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included 400 attendees from 32 states of the USA plus 7 other countries. It generated a wealth of computer ethics materials, including six printed monographs, six videotapes, and a set of computer ethics syllabi. After the conference, the staff of the Research Center on Computing and Society spent three years editing the NCCV materials and disseminating them to more than 300 universities worldwide.

'''''The Savage Mind''''' ({{lang-fr|La Pensée sauvage}}) is a 1962 work of [[structural anthropology]] by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. The English translation appeared in 1966.

== Contents ==

=== "The Savage Mind" ===

Lévi-Strauss makes clear that "la pensée sauvage" refers not to the discrete mind of any particular type of human, but rather to 'untamed' human thought: "In this book it is neither the mind of savages nor that of primitive or archaic humanity, but rather mind in its untamed state as distinct from mind cultivated or domesticated for the purpose of yielding a return." (219)

Savage thought, Lévi-Strauss argues, continually gathers and applies structures wherever they can be used. If scientific thought is represented by the engineer who asks a question and tries to design an optimal or complete solution, savage thought resembles the [[bricoleur]], who constructs things using whatever materials are at hand.

One of Lévi-Strauss's many examples is the relationship between two Australian groups, the Aranda and the Arabanna. The Aranda have a complex system for intermarriages that divides all people into two groups and then four stages within each group. The system specifies where the children will live and how they will marry. The Arabanna use a different system for marriages, but somehow use the Aranda's marriage system for determining the sex and affiliation of reincarnated spirits. The structure has been borrowed and transposed, appropriated because of its ability to generate a certain economy independently of its substrate.

=== Critique of totemism ===

Lévi-Strauss (continuing the argument in ''Totemism'', his previous work) criticizes the concept of [[totemism]] for arbitrarily prioritizing a particular structural relation. He admits the reality of totemism, in which, within a larger group, smaller groups distinguish themselves through identification with a plant or animal. He denies, however, that totemic societies differ fundamentally from societies that divide people on the basis of caste. Totems, he argues, are just another way to create necessary distinctions within a larger group. These distinctions may have greater or lesser practical significance, but ultimately:

:Totemism, which has been rendered amply formal in 'primitive language', could at the cost of a very simple transformation equally well be expressed in the language of the regime of castes which is quite the reverse of primitive. This is already sufficient to show that we are here dealing not with an autonomous institution, which can be defined by its distinctive properties and is typical of certain regions of the world and certain forms of civilization but with a ''modus operandi'' which can be discerned even behind social structures traditionally defined in a way diametrically opposed to totemism. (129)

In other words, the operation of identifying with a totem is secondary to the underlying process of re-appropriating structure (for example, observed differences between animals) for the purposes of society.

== Significance ==

''The Savage Mind'' was one of the earliest works of [[structural anthropology]] and had a large influence on the field of [[anthropology]].

The book also played a role within the larger currents of [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]]. The application of [[bricolage]] to social structure provided the inspiration for [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay [[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|"Structure, Sign and Play"]]. The idea that social structures can be transposed and recontextualized also plays a large role in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''.

==Biography==
Knox was born in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], England, on 28 November 1900, the son of Scottish [[Congregationalist]] minister. Rev James Knox MA and his wife, Isabella Marshall. 

He was educated at [[Bury Grammar School]] and the [[Liverpool Institute]], and then at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] where he obtained a first-class degree in [[Literae Humaniores]] in 1923.  He then worked as secretary to [[Lord Leverhulme]] at [[Lever Brothers]] before running the business interests of Lever Brothers in West Africa.  His first wife died in 1930 and in the following year he became Bursar-[[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and lecturer in philosophy at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], later becoming a Fellow and Tutor.  His interests did not fit in with those then prevailing at Oxford and so he moved to [[St Andrews University]] as Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1936, serving also as deputy principal and head of department.  He was thus the natural choice as acting principal in 1952 on the death of [[James Irvine (chemist)|James Irvine]], and was confirmed in position in 1953.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Malcolm Knox &amp;ndash; Former Principal of St Andrews University|work=[[The Times]]|date=17 April 1980|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox was widely known to philosophers for his translations and commentary of the works of [[Hegel]] and for editing the works of [[R.G. Collingwood]]. His scholarship was recognised with the award of an Hon. D. Litt. from the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=Archives&gt;{{cite web|title=UR-SF 51 Sir Thomas Malcolm Knox|url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=3&amp;dsqSearch=((text)=%27thomas%20malcolm%20knox%27)|work=Archive Services Online Catalogue|publisher=[[University of Dundee]]|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[David Jack (scientist)|David Jack]], [[Edward Thomas Copson]], [[David R. Dow]] and [[William Marshall Smart]]. He served as the Society's Vice President 1975 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst Principal of St Andrews, his main task reconcile the interests of the section of the university based in St Andrews with those of the section based in [[Dundee]], Queen's College.  However, he later concluded that separation of the two could not be avoided and then decided that it would not be proper to continue in his position as his stated policy had changed. In 1967 Queen's College separated from St Andrews to become  the [[University of Dundee]].  In retirement, he continued to write books, articles and reviews, including translations with commentary upon the writings of Hegel.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Sir Malcolm was critical of the creation of new universities in Scotland in the 1960s, arguing that universities should have medieval roots and have faculties including divinity. While he reserved judgement on the proposed [[University of Dundee]] and [[University of Stirling]], he was critical of the transforming of technical colleges into the [[University of Strathclyde]] and [[Heriot-Watt University]].&lt;ref name="Herald66"&gt;{{cite news|title=SIR MALCOLM KNOX SETS CAT AMONG PIGEONS - University Status for Colleges Criticised|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=1 March 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his papers are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee.&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt;

He died at 19 Victoria Terrace, [[Crieff]], [[Perthshire]], on 6 April 1980.

==Family==

He married three times: firstly to Margaret Normana MacLeod Smith then following her death in 1930 he married Dorothy Ellen Jolly who died in 1974. Finally he married Joan Mary Winifred Sumner, who outlived him.

'''Wojciech Oczko''' (also known as ''Ocellus'') (1537, [[Warsaw]] – 26 December 1599 [[Lublin]]) – philosopher, doctor, [[Royal Secretary]] to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]], and court physician to kings Sigismund II Augustus, [[Stephen Báthory]], and [[Sigismund III Vasa]]. One of the founders of Polish medicine, [[syphilology|syphilis]] and medical writers.

== Life ==
Oczko's father was the Warsaw cartwright, Stanisław Oczko. Wojciech began his education at the town and [[cathedral|cathedral school]] schools in Warsaw. In 1559 he began entered the [[University of Cracow|Jagiellonian University]], earning his [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureus]] in 1562. He returned to Warsaw for a time and taught at the cathedral school there. In 1565 he left the Polish capitol to study at the Universities of [[Padua|University of Padua]] and [[Bologna|University of Bologna]], where he earned a [[doctorate]] in medicine. He travelled to Spain and France, where he spent time in [[Montpellier]] In  1569 Oczko returned to [[Warsaw]] and began to practice medicine at the St. Martin's Hospital. He then served for a time as personal physician to the Cracow bishop [[Franciszek Krasiński]], and from 1576–1582 (with some breaks) as the court physician to Stephen Báthory. On the king's recommendation, Oczko studied the mineral springs at [[Shklo|Szkło (now Shklo, Ukraine)]] and [[Yavoriv|Jaworów (now Yavoriv, Ukraine)]]. At the end of his career, Oczko served as personal physician to Sigismund III Vasa. In 1598 Oczko moved to Lublin, where he died a year later.

In 1574 Oczko married Elżbieta Obrąpalska (widow of Stanisław Obrąpalski), and after her death, married again, this time to  Jadwiga Umięcka in 1596. Neither marriage produced any children.

== Works ==
Oczko wrote two major works in Polish about anatomy and surgery, as well as dietetics, in the process formalizing a number of terms in Polish medical terminology. The publication date of ''Cieplic'' (1578) is symbolically considered to be the foundation of the sanatorium at [[Iwonicz-Zdrój]], whose mineral waters are described in the work.
