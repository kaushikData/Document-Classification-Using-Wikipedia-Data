==Reception==

''Reference Reviews'' wrote a review for the site in 2013, stating that it "certainly has its place among the librarians' quick reference websites" but that " the authoritativeness of the site entries is not completely evident. There are no external references available to verify entry reliability. While I would recommend this site to all librarians, it would certainly be a cautionary recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapranos|first=Aubrey|date=2013-06-07|year=|title=Abbreviations.com (review)|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/RR-02-2013-0037|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=27|issue=5|pages=13–13|doi=10.1108/RR-02-2013-0037|issn=0950-4125|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' was also critical of the site, writing that "Unfortunately it falls short compared to other online and print sources" and noted that the site had errors, which they contributed to the site seeming to allow user generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Abbreviations.com (review)|journal=Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|date=2007|volume=45|issue=4|page=599|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/225765050|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Aswang''' (or '''Asuwang''') is an [[umbrella term]] referring to a shapeshifting [[anito|evil spirit]] in [[Filipino folklore]], [[Manananggal|vampire]], a [[ghoul]], a [[mangkukulam|warlock/witch]], or different species of [[werebeast]]. It is the subject of a wide variety of myths and stories. Spanish colonists noted that the Aswang was the most feared among the mythical creatures of the Philippines, even in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book | last=Scott | first=W.H. | title=Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year=1994 | isbn=978-971-550-135-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC | access-date=18 July 2018 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of the aswang is well known throughout the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tan |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Tan|title=Aswang! Aswang! |newspaper=Sunday Inquirer Magazine |date=2008-10-26 |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081026-168528/Aswang-Aswang |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201094639/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20081026-168528/Aswang-Aswang |archivedate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is especially popular in the [[Visayas]], southern parts of [[Luzon]], and parts of [[Mindanao]]. Other regional names for the aswang include "tik-tik", "wak-wak", "sok-sok" and "kling-kling".&lt;ref name=Jordan/&gt;

== About ==

Anthropologists postulate that the Aswang belief came from the myth-making of the Spaniards intent on keeping the population under control.&lt;ref name="Nadeau"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nadeau |first1=Kathleen |title=Aswang and Other Kinds of Witches: A Comparative Analysis |journal=Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society |date=December 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=250–266 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23719118 |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, a town was arranged into easy-to-manage layers, and those who lived too far away were labelled ''tulisans'' (dissenters).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} To frighten the Filipinos and discourage mobility, stories of ''Aswangs'' living on the outskirts of the forests were spread in towns to keep everyone in groups and maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/technology/535657/the-aswang-diaspora-why-philippine-lower-myths-continue-to-endure/story/|title=The Aswang Diaspora: Why Philippine lower myths continue to endure|last=Montenegro|first=Bea|date=4 September 2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/aswang-in-capiz/|title=The truth about the ASWANG in Capiz|last=Clark|first=Jordan|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/supreme/2015/05/30/1460087/theres-aswang-terrorizing-mindanao-and-yes-please-take-seriously|title=There’s an ‘aswang’ terrorizing Mindanao&amp;nbsp;– and yes, please take this seriously|last=Pineda|first=DLS|date=30 May 2015|website=Philippine Star|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern investigation links the prevalence of the aswang myth in the Capiz province of the Philippines to the genetic disease [[X-linked dystonia parkinsonism]] ([[X-linked dystonia parkinsonism|XDP]]) or [[X-linked dystonia parkinsonism|Dystonia of Panay]] ([[X-linked dystonia parkinsonism|Lubag Syndrome]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Quintessinal of these versions is the "bal-bal" or [[ghoul]] (''maninilong'' in [[Catanauan, Quezon]]), which replaces the cadaver with banana tree trunks after consumption.  Aswang stories and definitions vary greatly from region to region and person to person, and no particular set of characteristics can be ascribed to the term. Another common and very popular version is the [[manananggal]] which are usually female.&lt;ref&gt;File:Carljames|thumbnail&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance and activities ==
The wide variety of descriptions in the aswang stories makes it difficult to settle upon a fixed definition of aswang appearances or activities. However, several common themes that differentiate aswangs from other mythological creatures do emerge: Aswangs are typically described as [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifters]].&lt;ref name="Nadeau"/&gt; Stories recount aswangs living as regular townspeople that are quiet, shy and elusive. At night, they transform into creatures such as a bat, bird (usually a crow), wild boar, black cat, or most often, a big black dog.

They love to eat unborn fetuses and small children, favoring livers and hearts. Some have long [[proboscis]]es, which they use to suck the children out of their mothers' wombs when they are sleeping in their homes. Some are so thin that they can hide themselves behind a bamboo post. They are fast and silent. Some also make noises, like the Tik-Tik, (the name was derived from the sound it produces) which are louder the farther away the aswang is, to confuse its potential victim; and the Bubuu, an aggressive kind of aswang that makes a sound of a laying hen at midnight. They may also replace their live victims or stolen [[cadaver]]s with [[doppelganger]]s made from tree trunks or other plant materials. This facsimile will return to the victim's home, only to become extremely sick and then die. An aswang will also have bloodshot eyes, the result of staying up all night searching for houses where [[funeral|wakes]] are held to steal the bodies.

Aswangs are physically much more like humans at daytime; they only change their appearance at night when they feel they are hungry. It has been said that if an aswang married a human, upon their wedding, his or her mate would become an aswang as well but rarely can they reproduce. The couple may hunt together at night but will most often go in separate directions, either to avoid quick detection or because they do not like to share their food.

== Behavior ==
Unlike [[vampires]] and other similar creatures, they are not harmed by sunlight. They are daywalkers. Aswangs can also be befriended, they can talk to you like any normal human: they laugh and/or cry, get angry/sad, get hurt/humiliated and feel shy and envious. These creatures do not harm their friends and neighbors, and were said to be exempted from their target victims for food, hence the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] saying, "Mas mabuti ang aswang kaysa sa isang magnanakaw" (English: "An aswang is better than a thief").

They search for food in faraway places that it would not be too obvious for them. Aswangs are said to be vulnerable during daytime because during that time they do not have the excessive superhuman strength that they have in their nighttime prowl (aswangs only transform at night because they believe that God is sleeping). When people know of their identity, they are hunted down and killed immediately.

== Countermeasures against aswangs ==
Like vampires, aswangs are repelled or killed by using garlic, salt and religious artifacts/weapons (e.g. [[Holy water]], [[crucifix]], [[rosary]], prayers and religious verses). They are also killed using a whip made entirely of a stingray's tail ([[buntot pagi]]), which may also be used to repel the creature (aswangs are said to be scared of the sound made by the whip's cord slashing through the air). It is also said that they cannot step on holy consecrated ground (i.e. churches, mosques, temples, etc.). [[Decapitation]] is also a way to destroy an aswang.

Certain [[agimat]]s (native Philippine amulets) and special prayers posted on doors and entrances may also repel aswangs. A good example of which is the red and black bead bracelets worn by newborn babies.

It is said that to spot an aswang at daytime, look straight at their eyes. The person in front of you is an aswang if your reflection is upside-down. Another way of knowing is looking in a ''tuwad'' manner; that is, bending over and looking at the person from between your legs, upside-down. The person is an aswang if the image of the person is different. It is said that a person without a [[philtrum]] is an aswang. Hintura  is a kind of oil made by [[albularyo]]s, used to detect if an aswang is near the premises. It is said that the oil will boil and bubble if an aswang is near.

The documentary was also the first to uncover the origin of why the [[Western Visayas|Western Visayan]] province of [[Capiz]] is suspected as the aswang's home.&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;Clark, Jordan (2011) ''The Aswang Phenomenon'' Documentary, High Banks Entertainment Ltd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ePhqoyLpXQ&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Babylon''' is a [[Dictionary-based machine translation|computer dictionary and translation]] program developed by the [[Israel]]i company Babylon Software Ltd. based in the city of [[Or Yehuda]]. The company was established in 1997 by the Israeli entrepreneur Amnon Ovadia. Its [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] took place ten years later. It is considered a part of Israel's [[Download Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/.premium-1.542896 Game over in Download Valley?] Haaretz, Inbal Orpaz, Orr Hirschauge, 22 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304547704579563281761548844 Conduit Diversifies Away From 'Download Valley'] Wall Street Journal, Orr Hirschauge, updated 15 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; a cluster of software companies monetizing "free" software downloads through [[adware]]. Babylon includes in-house proprietary dictionaries, as well as community-created dictionaries and glossaries. It is a tool used for translation and conversion of currencies, measurements and time, and for obtaining other contextual information. The program also uses a [[text-to-speech]] agent, so users hear the proper pronunciation of words and text. Babylon has developed 36 English-based proprietary dictionaries in 21 languages. In 2008–2009, Babylon reported earnings of 50 million [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] through its collaboration with [[Google]].

Between 2010 and 2013, Babylon became infamous for demonstrating questionable behavior typical of malware: A ''Babylon Toolbar'' bundled with Babylon and other software, has been widely identified as a [[browser hijacker]] that is very easy to install inadvertently and unnecessarily difficult to remove.&lt;ref name="Babylon Search Hijacker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Remove Babylon Search Toolbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Come-Uppance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Getting rid of Babylon" /&gt; This eventually lead to Google terminating its agreement with Babylon Ltd. in 2013.&lt;ref name="Google says enough!" /&gt;

==History==
In 1995, [[Israel]]i entrepreneur Amnon Ovadia began a project for an online English–[[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]] dictionary which would not interrupt the reading process. As a result, Babylon Ltd. was founded in 1997 and launched the first version of Babylon. On 25 September 1997, the company filed a patent for text recognition and translation.&lt;ref name="EKsIAAAAEBAJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=EKsIAAAAEBAJ |title=Recognition and translation system |work = [[Google Patents]] |publisher=Google |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a year following its launch date, Babylon had two million users, mostly in Germany and Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/11/02/babylon/index.html |title=Babble on |publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc |date=2 November 1999 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213181936/http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/11/02/babylon/index.html |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; growing from 420,000 to 2.5 million users in the course of that year. In the same year, [[Formula Systems]], headed by [[Dan Goldstein]], acquired Mashov Computers and became the largest shareholder in the company. By 2000, the product had over 4 million users. In the spring of 2000, Babylon Ltd. failed to raise $20 million in a private placement and lost [[Israeli new sheqel|NIS]] 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackburn |first=Nicky |title=By The Users of Babylon |accessdate=18 September 2011 |date=May 2002 |url=http://www.formulavision.com/News-innews/INNEWS-19052002BABYLON.htm?gotobtn=7 |work=Jerusalem Post via Formula Vision |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020346/http://www.formulavision.com/News-innews/INNEWS-19052002BABYLON.htm?gotobtn=7 |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further stress came with the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble]]. In 2001, Babylon Ltd. continued shedding money, with the company costing its parent company Formula Vision NIS 4.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/tech/themarker/10011432.html Formula Vision lost NIS 33.6 million in 2001]. TheMarker.com (3 April 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Babylon Ltd. ({{TASE|BBYL}}) has been a publicly traded company. Its [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] took place in February 2007; Israeli businessman [[Noam Lanir]] purchased controlling interests in the company for $10.5 million, sharing management with second majority shareholder [[Reed Elsevier]]&lt;ref&gt;Malichi, Asaf (12 August 2007) [http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3480305,00.htm Noam Lanir buys into Babylon], YNet&lt;/ref&gt; and the Company founder Amnon Ovadia. According to [[Globes]] magazine in January 2011, Lanir received an offer for his stake from a foreign private equity fund that valued the company at [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 248 million (approximately 70 million dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackerman |first=Gwen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-19/babylon-shareholder-gets-offer-for-majority-stake-globes-says.html |title=Babylon Shareholder gets offer for majority stake, Globes says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008–2009, Babylon reported earnings of NIS 50 million through its collaboration with Google. In 2010, Google Ireland signed an extended cooperation agreement with Babylon to provide it with online search and pay-per-click advertising services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000610889&amp;fid=1725 Babylon extends deal with Google], Globes, 26 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Babylon was named the seventh most popular website in Libya, the eighth in Algeria and the eleventh in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Shoshanna (11 December 2011) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-11/babylon-says-arab-world-brazil-to-boost-language-software-sales.html Israel’s Babylon Says Arab World to Boost Sales of Translation Software]. bloomberg.com&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Globes]] magazine, Noam Lanir, who acquired control of Babylon for NIS 20 million, made a paper profit of NIS 200 million on his investment in 2012.&lt;ref name="globes.co.il"&gt;Tsipori, Tali (19 April 2012) [http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000742428&amp;fid=1725 Noam Lanir makes NIS 200m profit on Babylon]. globes.co.il&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alexa, Babylon's website was once ranked 45th most popular website in the world.&lt;ref name="globes.co.il"/&gt; It is now ranked 494th.

Babylon has a patented{{Specify|date=December 2012}} [[optical character recognition|OCR]] technology and a single-click activation that works in any [[Microsoft Windows]] application, such as [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Adobe Reader]]. When activated, Babylon opens a small popup window that displays the translation or definition.To solve the incompatibility problem of Babylon OCR browsers extension; users can benefit from Capture2Text free app version 3.9 (only 3.9v) which is compatible with Babylon 8 or another version. While dragging its capture box in any text from any browsers then a pop-up box appears and Babylon could easily grasp it. Babylon provides full text [[translation]], full [[Web page]] and full document translation in many languages and supports integration with [[Microsoft Office]].  Babylon enables the translation of [[Microsoft Word document]]s and [[plain text]] files. It offers results from a database of over 1,700 sources in over 75 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Babylon&amp;nbsp;– Simply Translate |url=http://www.babylon-software.com/about |publisher=Babylon Ltd |accessdate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dictionaries and encyclopedias===
Babylon includes its in-house proprietary dictionaries, community-created dictionaries and glossaries ([[User-generated content|UGC]]), which include general and technical dictionaries, language and monolingual dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedias and lexicons in a multitude of languages. They are indexed in 400 categories covering the arts, business, computers, health, law, entertainment, sports and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babylon-software.com/define/ Free Dictionary Lookup by Babylon]. Babylon-software.com (2 August 2001). Retrieved on 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program also uses a [[text-to-speech]] agent so users hear the proper pronunciation of words and text. Babylon Ltd. has developed 36 English-based proprietary dictionaries in 21 languages (English, Arabic, [[Simplified Chinese]], [[Traditional Chinese]], Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish) that are free of charge to users of the software. These dictionaries comprise between 60,000 and 200,000 terms, phrases, acronyms and abbreviations and are enabled with a morphological engine which facilitates recognition of all inflected forms of single words and phrases, provides all forms of terms that include prefixes and extensions and supplies a solution for all formats of writing. Babylon's [[Linguistic]] Department is responsible for the extensive content and information database which is a significant component of Babylon's Product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jobs-israel.com/content.aspx?Category=605 |title=Babylon&amp;nbsp;– There's Nothing Like Experience |first=Shuki |last=Stauber |publisher=Jobs-israel.com |accessdate=16 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121052/http://www.jobs-israel.com/content.aspx?Category=605 |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2010, Microsoft antivirus products identified the software application as [[adware]] (identified as "Adware: Win32/Babylon") due to potentially intrusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, [[Download.com]] started bundling the Babylon Toolbar with open-source packages such as [[Nmap]]. [[Gordon Lyon]], the developer of Nmap, criticized the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/download_nmap_toolbar_row_latest/ Download.com sorry for bundling Nmap with crapware] The Register 9 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/12/06/popular-security-tool-nmap-at-the-middle-of-a-security-brouhaha/ Popular network tool Nmap in CNET security brouhaha] ''Naked Security'' 6 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The vice-president of Download.com, Sean Murphy, released an apology: "The bundling of this software was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the user and developer communities for the unrest it caused."&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-57338809-12/a-note-from-sean-regarding-the-download.com-installer/ A note from Sean regarding the Download.com Installer] Download.com 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Babylon search toolbar was identified as a [[browser hijacker]] that, while very easy to install inadvertently, is unnecessarily difficult to remove afterwards.&lt;ref name="Babylon Search Hijacker"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/babylon-search-hijacker.html|title=Babylon Search Hijacker|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012|publisher = im-infected.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Remove Babylon Search Toolbar"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2418379,00.asp | title=How to Remove Babylon Search Toolbar | work=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | date=2 May 2013 | accessdate=19 August 2013 | last=Rashid |first=Fahmida}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Come-Uppance"&gt;{{cite news|title=Babylon's Come-Uppance|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2013/10/30/babylons-come-uppance/|accessdate=24 November 2013|newspaper=[[Jewish Business News]]|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The toolbar is listed as an unwanted application by anti-spyware software such as [[Stopzilla]] or [[Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/6754-instructions-to-remove-babylon-toolbar What is Babylon Toolbar and how to remove it?] pcrisk.com  9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Many users, trying to uninstall Babylon, have searched for help on different support forums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/from-under-the-rug/lesson-learned-the-hard-way-pay-attention-to-the-source-of-your-downloads.html Lesson Learned the Hard Way: Pay Attention to the Source of Your Downloads] Don Tennant, IT Business Edge, 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The toolbar tends to install itself onto computers as an add-on with other software and changes users' home page to the Babylon search engine, adds the search engine to the computer and sets itself as the default.&lt;ref name="Getting rid of Babylon"&gt;Lee, Jay (25 July 2012) [http://blog.chron.com/helpline/2012/07/getting-rid-of-babylon/ Getting rid of Babylon], The Houston Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; It changes browser preferences such as the user's home page and search engine, changes that can be very difficult to reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techtalk.pcpitstop.com/2012/10/11/kill-zombie-babylon-and-fbi-virus-dead/#comment-27533 Remove FBI &amp; Babylon Zombie Virus] PCPitstop.com, author Steve Hogan, 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, Martin (17 August 2011) [http://www.ghacks.net/2011/08/17/how-to-uninstall-the-babylon-toolbar-completely/ How To Uninstall The Babylon Toolbar Completely], ghacks.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2013, [[Google]] notified Babylon that it did not intend to renew its cooperation agreement between the two companies, which terminated on 30 November 2013. Google said that complaints had been received from [[Google Chrome]] users, claiming that the Babylon toolbar damages the browser's user experience. According to Babylon, Google may have reconsidered the decision during 2014.&lt;ref name="Google says enough!"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/30/babylon-google-idUSL5N0IK24420131030 Shares in Israel's Babylon dive as Google ends contract] Reuters, 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1045">In '''''Carelse v Estate De Vries''''', an important case in [[South African succession law]], Carelse was [[seduction|seduced]], on the promise of [[marriage]], by the deceased (who was already married with children). Carelse and the deceased continued their relationship, which produced seven children, before the deceased died [[intestate]].

At that time, the [[Intestate succession|Intestate Succession]] Act said that [[illegitimate child]]ren could not [[Inheritance|inherit]] from their deceased parents. The [[court of law|court]] held, however, that this was no longer the proper position, and awarded [[child support|maintenance]] to the children. Although the deceased died intestate, the principle is the same for persons who die [[testacy|testate]].

A '''chalice''', also known as a '''wisdom chalice''' or '''[[chillum (pipe)|chillum]] chalice''', is a type of [[Cannabis smoking|cannabis smoking pipe]] used most often by members of the Jamaican [[Rastafari movement]]. It is a sort of [[bong|water pipe]] with a hose, or drawtube, for inhaling; the water cools and filters the smoke and the hose provides additional airspace for cooling. A screen embedded in the crater protects against drawing in burning particles to clog the interior.

The word ''chalice'' (along other permutations such as ''chalwa'', ''chali'', etc.) is often used to refer to [[marijuana]] itself, which certain Rastafari consider to be of specific religious importance as they believe it is a gift from [[Jah]]. The term "lick the chalice" refers to Rasta communing with [[Jah]].&lt;ref name="Murrell1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Samuel Murrell|title=Chanting Down Babylon: The Rastafari Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iesWzLHb_GUC&amp;pg=PA75|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-584-7|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Price2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Price|title=Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OC399TZD2BwC&amp;pg=PA193|date=1 September 2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6768-9|pages=193–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of practitioners gather, a prayer is said, and the chalice lit and passed counter-clockwise among the group.&lt;ref name="Scher2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip W.

A [[bong]]-like chillum equipped with a water filtration chamber is sometimes referred to as a '''chalice''', based on a quote from the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Deuteronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080605225407/http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/anthro2003/godkings/rastafari.html The Rastafari by Maria Baptist]&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks and praises are offered to [[Jah]] before [[cannabis smoking|smoking]] the chillum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit1.shtml The Rastafarians by Leonard E.

'''Chicken Soup for the Soul''' is a publishing, consumer goods and media company based in Cos Cob, CT. It is known for the ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' series of books. The first book, like most subsequent titles in the series, consisted of inspirational true stories about ordinary people's lives. The book became a major best-seller and something of a social phenomenon. Today Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC continues to publish about a dozen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_pg_1?rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Achicken+soup+for+the+soul%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A2656022011%2Cp_lbr_books_series_browse-bin%3AChicken+Soup+for+the+Soul&amp;sort=date-desc-rank&amp;keywords=chicken+soup+for+the+soul&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410307428|title=Amazon.com: chicken soup for the soul - Chicken Soup for the Soul / Paperback: Books|work=amazon.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; new books per year.

==History==
Motivational speakers [[Jack Canfield]] and [[Mark Victor Hansen]] collaborated on the first ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' book, compiling inspirational, true stories they had heard from their audience members. Many of the stories came from members of the audience of their inspirational talks. The book was rejected by major publishers in New York but accepted by a small, self-help publisher in Florida called HCI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=161159913X|title=Chicken Soup for the Soul 20th Anniversary Edition: All Your Favorite Original Stories Plus 20 Bonus Stories for the Next 20 Years: Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, Amy Newmark: 9781611599138: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the first book, Canfield and Hansen, with HCI, published additional, similar ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' titles.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=chicken+soup+for+the+soul|title=Results for 'chicken soup for the soul' [WorldCat.org]|work=worldcat.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they published ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' books for specific demographics, such as ''Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul'', which came out in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/chicken-soup-for-the-teenage-soul/oclc/733779771&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul|work=worldcat.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a major best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/bsp/paperadvicecompare.html|title=Independents/Chain Bestseller List|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' titles and sequels to existing books have been published on a regular basis since the first book came out in 1993.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt; As of late 2013, the series included more than 200 titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickensoup.com/newsroom.asp?cid=about.facts|title=Facts &amp; Figures|work=chickensoup.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the founders, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, sold the company to a new ownership group led by William J. Rouhana and Robert D. Jacobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20090202/11989-serving-up-a-new-chicken-soup-.html Serving Up A New Chicken Soup], ''Publishers Weekly'', 2 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then all new titles have been published by Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC and distributed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name="chickensoup.com"/&gt;

Under the new ownership group, Chicken Soup for the Soul has expanded into other products besides books. The company markets pet foods under the brand Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul and a line of soups, sauces and other prepared foods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickensoup.com/foods/|title=Home - Chicken Soup for the Soul Foods|work=chickensoup.com|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227065443/http://www.chickensoup.com/foods/|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the brand Chicken Soup for the Soul.

In 2009, author [[Adeline Lee Zhia Ern]] was found to have plagiarized the story "Happiness" by Sarah Provençal from Jack Canfield's ''Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul IV''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverfishbooks.com/adeline_apology.html Adeline Lee's apology on Silverfish Books website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108110616/http://www.silverfishbooks.com/adeline_apology.html |date=January 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company announced plans to produce a television series and movie with [[Alcon Entertainment]]. Chicken Soup for the Soul has produced television programming with other partners, including [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egaOwgEH6OE|title=Chicken Soup for the Soul: Food &amp; Family - August 2014 on PBS|date=3 July 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment now owns owns Screen Media Ventures, LLC, a leading global independent television and film distribution company, and Popcornflix, an ad-based online video service.

==Awards==
The original series held a spot on the New York Times Best Seller list continuously from 1994 - 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicken Soup for the Soul Awards, Announcements, and Recognition|url=http://original.chickensoup.com/cs.asp?cid=awards|website=Chicken Soup for the Soul|publisher=Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken Soup for the Soul: What I Learned From the Dog was named "Best Anthology" of 2010 by the Dog Writers Association of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicken Soup for the Soul Awards, Announcements, and Recognition|url=http://original.chickensoup.com/cs.asp?cid=awards|website=Chicken Soup for the Soul|publisher=Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ProgLangCompare}}

[[List comprehension]] is a [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntactic]] construct available in some [[programming language]]s for creating a list based on existing lists.  It follows the form of the mathematical ''[[set-builder notation]]'' (''set comprehension'') as distinct from the use of [[Map (higher-order function)|map]] and [[Filter (higher-order function)|filter]] functions.

== Examples of list comprehension ==
=== Boo ===
{{further2|[[Boo (programming language)|Boo]] for .NET/Mono}}

List with all the doubles from 0 to 10 (exclusive)
&lt;source lang="boo"&gt;
doubles = [i*2 for i in range(10)]
&lt;/source&gt;

List with the names of the customers based in [[Rio de Janeiro]]
&lt;source lang="boo"&gt;
rjCustomers = [customer.Name for customer in customers if customer.State == "RJ"]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C# ===
{{further|C Sharp (programming language)#C.23 3.0 new language features|l1=C# 3.0 Language Integrated Query}}

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
var ns = from x in Enumerable.Range(0,100)
         where x*x &gt; 3
         select x*2;
&lt;/source&gt;

The previous code is [[syntactic sugar]] for the following code written using lambda expressions:

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
var ns = Enumerable.Range(0, 100)
        .Where(x =&gt; x*x &gt; 3)
        .Select(x =&gt; x*2);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Ceylon ===
{{further2|[[Ceylon (programming language)|Ceylon]], [https://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/current/tour/comprehensions/ Ceylon comprehensions]}}

Filtering numbers divisible by 3:

&lt;source lang="ceylon"&gt;
value divisibleBy3 = { for (i in 0..100) if (i%3==0) i };
// type of divisibleBy3 is Iterable&lt;Integer&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Multiple "generators":

&lt;source lang="ceylon"&gt;
value triples = { for (x in 0..20) for (y in x..20) for (z in y..20) if (x*x + y*y == z*z) [x,y,z] };
// type of triples is Iterable&lt;Integer[3]&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Clojure ===
{{further|List comprehension#Clojure}}

An infinite lazy sequence:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (for [x (iterate inc 0) 
       :when (&gt; (* x x) 3)]
   (* 2 x))
&lt;/source&gt;

A list comprehension using multiple generators:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (for [x (range 20)
       y (range 20)
       z (range 20)
       :when (== (+ (* x x) (* y y)) (* z z))]
   [x y z])
&lt;/source&gt;

=== CoffeeScript ===
{{further|CoffeeScript}}
&lt;source lang="coffeescript"&gt;
largeNumbers = (number for number in list when number &gt; 100)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Lisp ===
{{further|Common Lisp}}

List comprehensions can be expressed with the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; macro's &lt;code&gt;collect&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Conditionals are expressed with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, as follows:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(loop for x from 0 to 100 if (&gt; (* x x) 3) collect (* 2 x))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Cobra ===
{{further|Cobra (programming language)|l1=Cobra}}

List the names of customers:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
names = for cust in customers get cust.name
&lt;/source&gt;

List the customers with balances:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
names = for cust in customers where cust.balance &gt; 0
&lt;/source&gt;

List the names of customers with balances:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
names = for cust in customers where cust.balance &gt; 0 get cust.name
&lt;/source&gt;

The general forms:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
for VAR in ENUMERABLE [where CONDITION] get EXPR
for VAR in ENUMERABLE where CONDITION
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that by putting the condition and expression ''after'' the variable name and enumerable object, editors and IDEs can provide [[autocompletion]] on the members of the variable.

=== Elixir ===
{{further|Elixir (programming language)|l1=Elixir}}
&lt;source lang="elixir"&gt;
for x &lt;- 0..100, x * x &gt; 3, do: x * 2
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Erlang ===
{{further|Erlang (programming language)|l1=Erlang}}
&lt;source lang="erlang"&gt;
L = lists:seq(0,100).
S = [2*X || X &lt;- L, X*X &gt; 3].
&lt;/source&gt;

=== F# ===
{{further|F Sharp (programming language)|l1=F#}}

Lazily-evaluated sequences:

&lt;source lang="fsharp"&gt;
seq { for x in 0 .. 100 do if x*x &gt; 3 then yield 2*x }
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, for floating point values

&lt;source lang="fsharp"&gt;
seq { for x in 0. .. 100. do if x**2. &gt; 3. then yield 2.*x }
&lt;/source&gt;

Lists and arrays:

&lt;source lang="fsharp"&gt;
[ for x in 0. .. 100. do if x**2. &gt; 3. then yield 2.*x ]
[| for x in 0. .. 100. do if x**2. &gt; 3. then yield 2.*x |]
&lt;/source&gt;

List comprehensions are the part of a greater family of language constructs called computation expressions.

=== Groovy ===
{{further|Groovy (programming language)|l1=Apache Groovy}}

&lt;source lang="groovy"&gt;
(0..100).findAll{ x -&gt; x * x &gt; 3 }.collect { x -&gt; 2 * x }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Haskell ===
{{further|Haskell (programming language)|l1=Haskell}}
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
[x * 2 | x &lt;- [0 .. 99], x * x &gt; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of a list comprehension using multiple generators:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
pyth = [(x,y,z) | x &lt;- [1..20], y &lt;- [x..20], z &lt;- [y..20], x^2 + y^2 == z^2]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Io ===
By using Range object, Io language can create list as easy as in other languages:
&lt;source lang="io"&gt;
Range 0 to(100) asList select(x, x*x&gt;3) map(*2) 
&lt;/source&gt;


=== ISLISP ===
{{further|ISLISP}}

List comprehensions can be expressed with the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; special form. Conditionals are expressed with &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, as follows:

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(for ((x 0 (+ x 1))
      (collect ()))
     ((&gt;= x 100) (reverse collect))
     (if (&gt; (* x x) 3)
         (setq collect (cons (* x 2) collect))))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Java 8 ===
{{further|Java (programming language)}}

Java 8 introduces a new Streams API&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/lambda_api_jdk8.html:jdk8_streams New and Enhanced APIs That Take Advantage of Lambda Expressions and Streams in Java SE 8]&lt;/ref&gt;, which includes the IntStream interface&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/IntStream.html:jdk8_intstream Interface IntStream]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows operations like the following:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
List&lt;Integer&gt; ns = IntStream.range(0,100)
        .filter(x -&gt; x*x&gt;3)
        .map(x -&gt; x*2)
        // can be reduced with another operator or returned as a list:
        .boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());
&lt;/source&gt;

=== JavaScript ===
{{further|JavaScript}}

Borrowing from Python, JavaScript has array comprehensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:array_comprehensions Array Comprehesions], ECMAScript Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this feature has been proposed for inclusion in the sixth edition [[ECMAScript]] standard, Mozilla is the only implementation that currently supports it.

&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
/* There is no "range" function in JavaScript's standard
   library, so the application must provide it
  using a Python-inspired generator function */
function* range(n) {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
    yield i;
}

[2 * x for (x of range(100)) if (x * x &gt; 3)]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Julia ===
{{further|Julia (programming language)|l1=Julia}}

Julia supports comprehensions using the syntax:

&lt;source lang="julia"&gt;
 y = [x^2+1 for x in 1:10]
&lt;/source&gt;

and multidimensional comprehensions like:

&lt;source lang="julia"&gt;
 z = [(x-5)^2+(y-5)^2 for x = 0:10, y = 0:10]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Mythryl ===
{{further|Mythryl}}

  s = [ 2*i for i in 1..100 where i*i &gt; 3 ];

Multiple generators:

  pyth = [ (x,y,z) for x in 1..20 for y in x..20 for z in y..20 where x*x + y*y == z*z ];

=== Nemerle ===
{{further|Nemerle}}

&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
$[x*2 | x in [0 .. 100], x*x &gt; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== OCaml ===
{{further|OCaml}}

''OCaml supports List comprehension through OCaml Batteries''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/   OCaml Batteries Included]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===
{{further|Perl 6}}

 my @s = ($_ * 2 if $_ ** 2 &gt; 3 for 0 .. 99);

=== Python ===
{{further|Python syntax and semantics#Generators|l1=Python syntax and semantics: Generators}}

[[Python (programming language)|Python]] uses the following syntax to express list comprehensions over finite lists:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
S = [2*x for x in range(100) if x**2 &gt; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

A '''generator expression''' may be used in Python versions &gt;= 2.4 which gives [[lazy evaluation]] over its input, and can be used with [[generator (computer science)|generators]] to iterate over 'infinite' input such as the count generator function which returns successive integers:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
from itertools import count
S = (2*x for x in count() if x**2 &gt; 3)
&lt;/source&gt;

(Subsequent use of the generator expression will determine when to stop generating values).

=== R ===
{{further|R (programming language)|l1=R}}
&lt;source lang="rsplus"&gt;
 x = (0:100)
 S = 2 * x[x ^ 2 &gt; 3]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Racket ===
{{further|Racket (programming language)|l1=Racket}}

&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(for/list ([x 100] #:when (&gt; (* x x) 3)) (* x 2))
&lt;/source&gt;
An example with multiple generators:
&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(for*/list ([x (in-range 1 21)] [y (in-range 1 21)] [z (in-range 1 21)]
            #:when (= (+ (* x x) (* y y)) (* z z)))
  (list x y z))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Ruby ===
{{further|Ruby (programming language)|l1=Ruby}}

&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
(0..100).select { |x| x**2 &gt; 3 }.map { |x| 2*x }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scala ===
{{further|Scala (programming language)|l1=Scala}}

Using the for-comprehension:

&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
val s = for (x &lt;- 0 to 100; if x*x &gt; 3) yield 2*x
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Scheme ===
{{further|Scheme (programming language)|l1=Scheme}}

List comprehensions are supported in Scheme through the use of the [[Scheme Requests for Implementation|SRFI]]-42 library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/srfi-42.html Scheme SRFI 42: Eager Comprehensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
(list-ec (: x 100) (if (&gt; (* x x) 3)) (* x 2))
&lt;/source&gt;

An example of a list comprehension using multiple generators:
&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
(list-ec (: x 1 21) (: y x 21) (: z y 21) (if (= (+ (* x x) (* y y)) (* z z))) (list x y z))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== SETL ===
{{further|SETL}}
&lt;source lang="html4strict"&gt;
s := {2*x : x in {0..100} | x**2 &gt; 3 };
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Smalltalk ===

&lt;source lang="smalltalk"&gt;
((1 to: 100) select: [ x | x squared &gt; 3 ]) collect: [ x | x * 2 ]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Swift ===

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
// 0 2 4 6 ... 18
let timesTwo = (0..&lt;10).map{ $0*2 }
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
// Suppose isPrime: (Int) -&gt; Bool a function that checks if its argument is a prime number
let primeBelow100 = (0...100).filter(isPrime)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Visual Prolog ===
{{further|Visual Prolog}}

 &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color:#B9005C;"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#B9005C;"&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; = list::getMember_nd&lt;span style="color:#993300;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#993300;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;*&lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#B9005C;"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

=== Windows PowerShell ===
{{further|Windows PowerShell}}

&lt;source lang="powershell"&gt;
$s = ( 0..100 | ? {$_*$_ -gt 3} | % {2*$_} )
&lt;/source&gt;which is short-hand notation of:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="powershell"&gt;
$s = 0..100 | where {$_*$_ -gt 3} | foreach {2*$_}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Remote access ==
Some control panels allow shell [[system console|(console)]] access to the underlying OS through a Java applet, requiring that the client-side computer use [[Java Virtual Machine]] software. Other control panels allow direct access using [[telnet]] or [[secure shell]] (SSH).

In [[Catalan mythology]], '''Comte Estruch'''—whose real name was either Arnald Estruc or Wilfred Estruch—was a 12th-century Catalan wealthy noble.

==Legend==

The legend says that King [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] sent the old noble Count Arnald Estruc to fight paganism and witchcraft at Llers Castle (Alt Emporda) where the Count was killed in 1173. Having led an un-Christian life, after his death the Count become a demonic being. Count Estruch sucked blood from the villagers in the area and seduced and impregnated young women. After nine months, these women would give birth to monstrous newborns who were dead at birth.

Conde Estruch terrorized the villagers for several years until finally the monster was found and killed by an elderly nun. Other versions say that a hermit of Jewish origin that made the Count rest using ancient rituals associated with [[Kabbalah]]. The castle was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). This legend is the oldest [[vampire]] tale in European history and is one of the few Spanish myths associated with [[vampirism]].

==Adaptations==
This legend was popularized in the novels of Salvador Sainz (Estruch, El cine Dracula), and in a few short stories by the same author (Les filles d'Estruc, L'hote d'Estruc, Strigoiaca, L'anneau d'Estruc, Les caves Marcia....).

'''Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum''' is a local [[metro station|station]] on the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] of the [[New York City Subway]]. Located at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Eastern Parkway in [[Brooklyn]] adjacent to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], it is served by the '''[[2 (New York City Subway service)|2]]''' at all times, the '''[[3 (New York City Subway service)|3]]''' at all times except late nights, and the '''[[4 (New York City Subway service)|4]]''' train during late nights.

The name of the station was originally intended to be "Institute Park". However, the IRT received a petition from Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences to change the name of the station to "Brooklyn Museum" to provide an adequate guide for the station's location. As a result an order was issued on March 3, 1920, changing the name of the station to "Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Station Name Changed After Public Hearing |url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252014%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Standard%2520Union%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Standard%2520Union%25201920%2FBrooklyn%2520NY%2520Standard%2520Union%25201920%2520-%25201964.pdf|via=fultonhistory.com |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |work=The Brooklyn Standard Union |date=March 4, 1920 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signs and tiles had to be finished as the station finish work was already underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyM0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=canarsie+line+construction+elevated+evergreen+branch&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO9IPOj_bZAhVRdt8KHXTjDq0Q6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=canarsie%20line%20construction%20elevated%20evergreen%20branch&amp;f=false|title=Annual Report ...|last=Commission|first=New York (State) Transit|date=1922|publisher=J.B.

On October 10, 1920, three stations that were not ready to be opened with the rest of the line, at [[Bergen Street (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Bergen Street]], [[Grand Army Plaza (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Grand Army Plaza]] and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum, were opened.&lt;ref name="EPkwy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/10/11/103481051.pdf|title=Subway Stations Opened: Last Three in Eastern Parkway Branch of I.R.T.

During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Eastern Parkway, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Report 1964–1965|last=|first=|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, it was announced that Eastern Parkway would be one of ten subway stations citywide to receive renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/renovation-set-10-subway-stations-article-1.485558|title=Renovation Is Set for 10 Subway Stations|last=|first=|date=June 11, 2002|work=NY Daily News|access-date=January 8, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the 2015&amp;ndash;2019 MTA Capital Program, elevators will be added to the platforms and street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTA Capital Program 2015-2019: Renew.

There are two local tracks with two [[side platform]]s. The express tracks pass underneath the station and are not visible from the platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycsubway.org/lines/irt-brooklyn-map2.html Brooklyn IRT: Map 2, Brooklyn IRT Dual Contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; A large mosaic displays [[Eastern Parkway]] and ''Brooklyn Museum''.

'''''Eight Poems''''' is a 1962 poetry collection by the American poet [[Marianne Moore]], with illustrations by [[Robert Andrew Parker]]. It was published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Only 195 copies were produced; each was signed by Moore and Parker.&lt;ref name="Leavell2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Leavell|title=Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZetmAgAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-30183-6|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Moore's poems in the volume was accompanied by an image from Parker. In his 2001 book ''Material Modernism: The Politics of the Page'', the literary critic [[George Bornstein]] commented on the juxtaposition of Moore's poem "The Fish" and Parker's drawing in ''Eight Poems''. Bornstein wrote that "One can no longer interpret "The Fish" as military reinforcements in the First World War; they steadfastly remain the delicate creatures of Parker's accompanying watercolor. A poem that started out as an anti-military poem in an anti-war journal has metamorphosed into a commodified (sic) aesthetic object".&lt;ref name="Bornstein2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Bornstein|title=Material Modernism: The Politics of the Page|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tw1ZwOnLj0C|date=5 February 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66154-6|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Facit catalog''' is a specialized postage [[stamp catalog]] for the countries of [[Scandinavia]]. First published in 1947, it is the most detailed and complete catalog available for philatelists interested in the stamps of [[Denmark]], [[Faroes]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Greenland]], [[Åland]], and the [[Danish West Indies]]. Although published in Sweden, the language of the catalog is now English.

Catalog content is developed by a committee of 20 leading philatelists. Beginning with the 2007 catalog, and following a trend among catalog publishers, images of the stamps are printed in color.

Specific recent versions of the catalog include:
* ''FACIT 2007 Special'' (2007) - includes all countries, and a handbook section with informative articles
* ''FACIT Postal VII'' (2004) - [[postal history]] and [[postmark]]s of Sweden
* ''FACIT Sverige 2005'' (2005) - nonspecialized catalog for Sweden only
* ''FACIT Special Classic'' (2018) - includes all countries with varieties and specialties up to 1951.  

The catalogs are published by '''Facit Förlag AB''', located in [[Västerås]], Sweden.

The '''''Fāngyán''''' ({{zh|c=方言}}; “regional words”,&lt;ref&gt;[[David R. Knechtges]], Taiping Chang (eds.): ''Ancient and Early Medieval Chinese Literature. A Reference Guide''. Part Three. Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2014; p.&amp;nbsp;1935.&lt;/ref&gt; “regional expressions”,&lt;ref&gt;Xinzhong Yao (ed.): ''The Encyclopedia of Confucianism''. Routledge, 2015; p.&amp;nbsp;472.&lt;/ref&gt; “dictionary of local expressions”,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham]], Colin A. Ronan (eds.): ''The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978; p.&amp;npbs;118.&lt;/ref&gt; “regional spoken words”;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Michael O’Neill: ''Ideography and Chinese Language Theory: A History''. Berlin/Boston: de Gruyter, 2016; p.&amp;nbsp;206.&lt;/ref&gt; not “dialects” as in modern Chinese&lt;ref&gt;“[I]t is ... disingenuous to translate ''fangyan'' as “dialect” in classical Chinese sources,” op.&amp;nbsp;cit. p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the first [[Chinese dictionary]] of dialectal terms. It was edited by the scholar [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], who lived from 53 BC to 18 AD. The full title is ''Yóuxuān shǐzhĕ juédài yǔ shì biéguó fāngyán'' (輶軒使者絕代語釋別國方言) "Local expressions of other countries in times immemorial explained by the Light-Carriage Messenger," which alludes to a [[Zhou dynasty]] tradition of imperial emissaries who made annual surveys of regional vocabulary throughout China. Yang's preface explains that he spent 27 years collating and editing the ''Fangyan'', which has some 9000 characters in 13 chapters (卷).

''Fangyan'' definitions typically list regional synonyms. For instance, chapter 8, which catalogs animal names, gives regional words for ''hu'' (虎 "tiger") in Han times. &lt;blockquote&gt; (虎, 陳魏宋楚之間或謂之李父, 江淮南楚之間謂之李耳, 或謂之於菟. 自關東西或謂之伯都.) "Tiger: in the regions of Chen-Wei Song-Chu [Central China], some call it ''lifu''; in the regions of Jiang-Huai Nan-Chu [Southern China], they call it ''li'er'', and some call it ''wutu''. From the Pass, east- and west-ward [Eastern and Western China], some call it also ''bodu''." (adapted from Serruys 1967: 256) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Comparative linguists have used dialect data from the ''Fangyan'' in reconstructing the pronunciation of [[Eastern Han Chinese]] (1st century CE), which is an important diachronic stage between [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. In the above example, [[Paul Serruys]] reconstructs "tiger" as Old Chinese *''blxâg''.

Serruys also applied the techniques of modern [[dialectology]] to the distribution of regional words, identifying dialect areas and their relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9219">'''Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records''' ('''FRBR''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɜr|b|ər}}) is a conceptual [[entity–relationship model]] developed by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) that relates user tasks of retrieval and access in online library catalogues and bibliographic databases from a user’s perspective. It represents a more holistic approach to retrieval and access as the relationships between the entities provide links to navigate through the hierarchy of relationships. The model is significant because it is separate from specific cataloguing standards such as [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]] (AACR) or [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD).

==User tasks==
The ways that people can use FRBR data have been defined as follows: to find entities in a search, to identify an entity as being the correct one, to select an entity that suits the user's needs, or to obtain an entity (physical access or licensing).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/frbr/frbr_2008.pdf p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

==FRBR entities==
[[File:FRBR-Group-1-entities-and-basic-relations.svg|thumb|Group 1 entities and basic relations (RDF version)]]
[[File:FRBR-Group-2-entities-and-relations.svg|thumb|Group 2 entities and relations]]

FRBR comprises groups of entities:
*Group 1 entities are work, expression, manifestation, and item (WEMI). They represent the products of intellectual or artistic endeavor.
*Group 2 entities are person, family and corporate body, responsible for the custodianship of Group 1’s intellectual or artistic endeavor.
*Group 3 entities are subjects of Group 1 or Group 2’s intellectual endeavor, and include concepts, objects, events, places.

Group 1 entities are the foundation of the FRBR model:
*''Work'' is a "distinct intellectual or artistic creation."&lt;ref name="3.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#3.2|title=Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records - Final Report - Part 1|publisher=ifla.org|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony apart from all ways of expressing it is a work. When we say, "Beethoven's Ninth is magnificent!" we generally are referring to the work.
*''Expression'' is "the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is 'realized.'"&lt;ref name="3.2"/&gt; An expression of Beethoven's Ninth might be each draft of the musical score he writes down (not the paper itself, but the music thereby expressed).
*''Manifestation'' is "the physical embodiment of an expression of a work. As an entity, manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, in respect to both intellectual content and physical form."&lt;ref name="3.2"/&gt; The performance the London Philharmonic made of the Ninth in 1996 is a manifestation. It was a physical embodiment even if not recorded, though of course manifestations are most frequently of interest when they are expressed in a persistent form such as a recording or printing. When we say, "The recording of the London Philharmonic's 1996 performance captured the essence of the Ninth," we are generally referring to a manifestation.
*''Item'' is "a single exemplar of a manifestation. The entity defined as item is a concrete entity."&lt;ref name="3.2"/&gt; Each copy of the 1996 pressings of that 1996 recording is an item. When we say, "Both copies of the London Philharmonic's 1996 performance of the Ninth are checked out of my local library," we are generally referring to items.

Group 1 entities are not strictly hierarchical, because entities do not always inherit properties from other entities.&lt;ref name="renear"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renear|first1=Allen H.|last2=Choi|first2=Yunseon|title=Modeling Our Understanding, Understanding Our Models - The Case of Inheritance in FRBR|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=10 October 2007|volume=43|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1002/meet.14504301179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite initial positive assessments of FRBR clarifying the thoughts around the conceptual underpinnings of works, there has been later disagreement about what the Group 1 entities actually mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floyd|first1=Ingbert|title=Multiple interpretations: Implications of FRBR as a boundary object|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2009|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1002/meet.2009.14504603110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between Works and Expressions is also unclear in many cases.

==Relationships==
In addition to the relationships between Group 1 and Groups 2 and 3 discussed above, there are many additional relationships covering such things as digitized editions of a work to the original text, and derivative works such as adaptations and parodies, or new texts which are critical evaluations of a pre-existing text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tillett|first1=Barbara|title=What is FRBR?|url=https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FRBR is built upon relationships between and among entities. "Relationships serve as the vehicle for depicting the link between one entity and another, and thus as the means of assisting the user to ‘navigate’ the universe that is represented in a bibliography, catalogue, or bibliographic database."&lt;ref name="5.0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr2.htm#5|title=Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records - Final Report - Part 2|publisher=ifla.org|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of relationship types include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[International Federation of Library Associations]] and Institutions|title=Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: Final Report|url=http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence relationships===
Equivalence relationships exist between exact copies of the same manifestation of a work or between an original item and reproductions of it, so long as the intellectual content and authorship are preserved. Examples include reproductions such as copies, issues, facsimiles and reprints, photocopies, and microfilms.

===Derivative relationships===
Derivative relationships exist between a bibliographic work and a modification based on the work. Examples include:
*Editions, versions, translations, summaries, abstracts, and digests
*Adaptations that become new works but are based on old works
*Genre changes
*New works based on the style or thematic content of the work

===Descriptive relationships===
Descriptive relationships exist between a bibliographic entity and a description, criticism, evaluation, or review of that entity, such as between a work and a book review describing it. Descriptive relationships also includes annotated editions, casebooks, commentaries, and critiques of an existing work.

The  '''''Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum'''''&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's encyclopedia of Eastern European literature'', 1993, Robert B. Pynsent, Sonia I. Kanikova, p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]]: "Deeds of the Huns and Hungarians") is a medieval chronicle written mainly by [[Simon of Kéza]] around 1282–1285. It is one of the [[sources of early Hungarian history]].&lt;ref name="multkor"&gt;[http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?article=8792 Múlt-kor történelmi portál&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the '''''Gesta Hungarorum (II)''''' (Latin: "Deeds of the Hungarians"), the "(II)" indicating its status as an expansion of the original ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' (written around 1200).

The work is dated to 1282–1285 as it includes the [[Battle of Hódtó]] (1282) but does not mention the [[Tatar invasion]] in 1285.

The work combines [[Huns|Hunnish]] legend with history. It consists of two parts: the Hunnish legend ("Hunnish Chronicle"), &lt;!--, mainly from other chronicles mentioned above, --- Which chronicles? Only first Gesta mentioned above.--&gt;expanded with Hungarian oral tales;&lt;ref name="multkor" /&gt; and a history of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] since the original ''Gesta Hungaronum''.

Simon of Kéza was a court cleric of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV.]] (reigned 1272–1290). He travelled widely in Italy, France and Germany and culled his epic and poetic materials from a broad range of readings.

By Kéza's own admission, he used contemporary German, Italian and French chronicles, but it has been proved that he freely used Hungarian sources also.&lt;ref name="multkor" /&gt;

The ''Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum'' was edited and translated in 1999 by [[László Veszprémy]] and [[Frank Schaer]] for the [[Central European University]].

===HIV/AIDS epidemic===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the United States}}
{{See also|History of HIV/AIDS}}

In May 1983, when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was published, the AIDS epidemic in New York City has only recently begun and panic about the unknown causes, means of transmission and potential for treatment for AIDS was spreading rapidly.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; The misconception that there was something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection was common at the time and led to the development of a [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding both the disease and [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]].&lt;ref name=prom&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3397576 |jstor=3397576 |title=How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic |journal=October |volume=43 |pages=237 |year=1987 |last1=Crimp |first1=Douglas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Sonnabend wrote that "it may be impossible for those who did not directly experience the uncertainty and terror of the early years of AIDS to appreciate the circumstances under which these guidelines [for safe sex] were constructed."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

At the time when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was written, there was no consensus on the cause of AIDS, but two main theories existed: the "new agent theory," which was increasingly the scientific consensus, and the "multifactorial theory," which Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend adopted as their basis for [[sexual education]] around AIDS transmission prevention. The new agent theory proposed that AIDS was caused by a single, previously unknown [[pathogen]], likely a [[retrovirus]] similar to the [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV).&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; According to the multifactorial theory, however, continual overexposure to [[semen]], specifically [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) in semen, lead to an eventual state of [[immunosuppression]] that characterized AIDS.&lt;ref name=multi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1984.tb37134.x |pmid=6100000 |title=A Multifactorial Model for the Development of Aids in Homosexual Men |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=437 |pages=177–83 |year=1984 |last1=Sonnabend |first1=Joseph A |last2=Witkin |first2=Steven S |last3=Purtilo |first3=David T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on prior scientific studies that revealed the role that CMV can play in causing cellular immune-related abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, Scott D..''

As a result of the lack of agreement on AIDS cause and transmission, it was difficult to determine the risk of various forms of sexual contact. Berkowitz, in the introduction to his [[autobiography]], describes how, in the early years of the epidemic, [[risk]] categorizations were rewritten every few months: "anal sex with a condom became an endless back and forth [[dance]], from high risk to medium risk to low risk to possibly safe." &lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was this confusion that prompted the authors to create a safe sex manual that clearly outlined for men having sex with men the dangers of each type of contact and various methods to protect oneself from exposure.

===LGBT culture and politics===
{{Main|LGBT rights in the United States}}
{{See also|Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS}}

After the [[Sexual Revolution]] and the [[Gay Liberation]] in the 1960s and `70s, sex in urban gay epicenters was not only newly acceptable, but also often seen as key to gay identity and resistance to [[heteronormativity]]. AIDS brought up a renewed fear about negative media coverage and the [[civil rights]] violations that [[LGBT people]] might face from targeted quarantines and a denial of basic healthcare services.&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; As such, the issue of safe sex was a contentious one, and any arguments criticizing frequent sex were poorly received by the majority of the community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; A large sector of LGBT community leadership worried that raising awareness about AIDS and gay sex would be off-putting to the straight majority and damage the image of the subculture as a whole.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier&gt;Escoffier, Jeffrey (1998-99).

Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Activists still deeply entrenched in the battle to protect the political gains of the past decade tended to overlook the AIDS crisis as a political attack, a topic too controversial to address, or an overreaction by self-hating gay men.&lt;ref name=trenches&gt;Sonnabend, Joseph.

The authors of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' were aware of the political risks they took in creating the booklet: Berkowitz noted in his autobiography the possibility that their writing could be used as ammunition by homophobic institutions and leaders.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; However, their advocacy was motivated by the increasingly critical state of the health crisis and their shared belief in what Callen described as the danger of "put[ting] political considerations over the tragedy of even a single gay man's death."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Before the AIDS epidemic, condoms were mostly advertised and used for preventing pregnancies and therefore were not considered a viable safe sex or STD prevention tool among the LGBT community: David France estimates that less than 1% of men who have sex with men in New York City used them regularly in the 1970s, despite the fact that many other sexually transmitted diseases, including cytomegalovirus and [[hepatitis B]], were already at "endemic" levels.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Sonnabend writes about condoms at the time: "I think most gay men said, 'Oh thank god, that's one thing we don't have to worry about,'"&lt;ref name=france /&gt; and many didn't know how to use one.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, Jason. "A Prophecy Before Our Time: The Gay Men's Health Project Clinic Opens in 1972, Part Two: A Wasted Opportunity" ''[[New York Public Library]].''

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend would show them, condoms really were something to worry about and could be an easy way to prevent disease and death while continuing to have a normal and fulfilling sex life.

Along with ''Play Fair!'', its San Francisco counterpart written by a [[drag (clothing)|drag]] group called the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]], ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was the first [[sex-positive]] manuals for safe sex—in other words, it did not present sex in a negative, shameful or moralistic light. Sonnabend writes in the introduction to the booklet that one of their goals was to "explore the many different forms of sexual expression open to gay men."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; As [[David France (writer)|David France]] later recounted, the authors actively tried to avoid condescension or arrogance in their writing (despite the fact that Callen himself had acknowledged that telling people how to have sex is inherently an arrogant thing to do), instead attempting to establish a dialogue, "[[Queen (slang)|queen]] to queen," between themselves and the people for whom they created the manual.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; Callen even educated himself about different [[philosophers]], including [[Hannah Arendt]], to get an idea of the best way to productively use writing to influence people through rhetoric and written arguments.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; The independent and community-driven nature of this approach to LGBT-related safe sex, according to [[Cindy Patton]], can be traced back to the "self-help model" promoted in the women's health movement.&lt;ref name=ACTUP&gt;Gould, Deborah B.

The primary message of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' is 1) to use [[Sexual protection|protection]] (i.e., condoms) during sex and 2) to limit the specific sex acts one performs to those with a lower risk of contagion. It was a model that attempted to challenge traditional anti-promiscuity and anti-gay viewpoints in previous safe sex education and AIDS prevention—as Callen and Berkowitz argued, it's what you do, not how often you do it or who you do it with. In other words, they had searched for, and come up with, what they termed the possibility of "life-affirming sex."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The categories below contain summaries of the chapters of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and the arguments presented therein:

=== What causes AIDS? ===
The authors introduce the two presiding theories of AIDS transmission and present their arguments for the multifactorial model. They describe the role of CMV in causing abnormalities in immune cells, as well as the potential for gradual immune overload by semen and harmful [[immune complexes]] resulting from the binding of [[antibodies]] to [[antigens]] on other STDs. This section presents evidence against the "new agent theory" but acknowledges that in either case, AIDS is likely sexually transmitted and therefore the best method of prevention will be the use of protection and more critical choice in which sexual acts to perform.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== CMV in connection with AIDS ===
In this section, Callen and Berkowitz elaborate on the multifactorial model to provide a basis for later applications of safe sex practices. They cite the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' study that found that traces of CMV were found in 94% of [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in a New York City cohort in 1981, but later estimate that CMV was present in ¼ of [[sexually active]] gay men in 1982-83, which, when factoring in the average frequency and diversity of partners in the population of sexually active gay men in New York City, would still amount to a high number of exposures per year.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb et al 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; The reasoning behind their support of the multifactorial theory was the concurrent [[epidemics]] of AIDS and CMV in the same sexual networks and locations; they called it the "one common link found in all gay men with AIDS." They summarize the characteristics of CMV and its links to AIDS as the following:&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;
* Cytomegalovirus itself is a type of [[herpesvirus]] that is present in [[bodily fluids]].  
* It remains in the body for more than a year after the immune system has fought off its initial effects.  
* It often manifests again in people with severely compromised immune systems (i.e., those with AIDS).  
* It was also found in some KS tumors of people with AIDS, and can activate the [[Epstein Barr virus]], causing [[lymphoma]] and [[lymphadenopathy]] (both common symptoms of AIDS). 
* Like HIV, CMV has a [[latency period]] that makes it easily transmittable and impossible to discern when picking sexual partners.

This part of the manual stresses the fact that it's not a single infection putting people at risk, but instead repeated exposure to the virus in semen, particularly through anal-receptive intercourse. In addition to the specific cytomegalovirus in sperm, the authors argue that simply exposing the body to such high intake levels of sperm itself can present a health risk. Although the multifactorial model had been criticized for failing to account for the sudden appearance of AIDS, the authors use the fact that the rate of CMV infections in urban sexually active gay men rose significantly in last decade as evidence of the "new" component that accounts for the rapid increase in AIDS cases.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; They advise readers to get tested for CMV and describe which tests to get (e.g. antibody tests or [[virus|viral]] isolation of CMV from [[urine]] and semen), but also acknowledge that the price of such tests ($200) and the fact that it was not routinely offered at traditional clinics and labs might make it inaccessible to most patients.

=== Ethics and responsibility ===
In this section, the authors stress the need for the gay male community to come together to protect itself.  A central component of this was that one's own sexual health and the health of others should "never became separated." They wrote that it was important to think about not only what sexual acts would put oneself in a risky position in terms of disease transmission, but also what would be dangerous for one's partner. They recognize the importance of maintaining mental control during sex, and argue that although it's easy to forget about safety in the heat of the moment, the growing threat of sickness and death should be enough to motivate people to act with foresight. Their primary piece of advice within the "control" subsection is not abstinence; instead, it centers around the importance of staying sober during sexual encounters in order to make informed decisions. This, Callen and Berkowitz write, means not drinking, smoking, or taking poppers before going clubbing. They also emphasize the importance of communication with one's partner in the broader discussion of maintaining control, including the need to talk about health concerns, disease status, and convince him to engage in whatever sexual acts safely.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== Risk categories ===
Much of the rest of the pamphlet is dedicated to discussing the many possible forms of sexual expression available to gay and bisexual men and providing a thorough analysis of the risk associated with each particular act. This analysis is warranted by the fact that, as the authors recognized, different diseases spread through different types of contact, and specifically AIDS/CMV (as they saw it back then) is much more easily transmitted through certain sex acts.

''Note that some of these categorizations are incorrect given current knowledge about HIV transmission, and the descriptions below should not be presumed to be the medical consensus.''&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Wilton, James (Fall 2012). "Putting a number on it: The risk from an exposure to HIV." CATIE: Canada's source for HIV and Hepatitis C information. http://www.catie.ca/en/pif/summer-2012/putting-number-it-risk-exposure-hiv. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;Sucking (i.e. giving [[oral sex]]):&lt;/u&gt; The authors categorize sucking as having a "moderate" risk: although the exposure to semen is not as direct as when it is taken in anally, they state that oral sex, for the person coming into contact with semen, is not risk free (for CMV infection) except with condom use. The compromise they suggest is to avoid having your partner come in your mouth, and, if they do accidentally, to spit out the [[ejaculate]] to reduce the risk of transmission.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting sucked (receiving oral sex):&lt;/u&gt; According to ''How to Have Sex,'' oral sex probably has no risk for the receiver, but there are still [[hygiene]] protocols such as washing, not coming in the person's mouth, etc. that someone in this position should follow to protect the health of his partner. Additionally, it is only risk free from the perspective of CMV/AIDS, as there are plenty of other pathogens that can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Fucking ([[Anal sex|anal penetrative/insertive]]):&lt;/u&gt; This is another position where the authors identified little to no risk for CMV transmission. Again, their main argument is that it is still necessary to wear a condom to protect one's partner, and, by extension, the sexually active community of men who have sex with men as a whole. Because condoms were not commonly used at the time, the authors conceded that if someone finds it difficult to get used to the sensation to the point where they are dissuaded from using a condom altogether, they should at least [[Coitus interruptus|pull out]] before coming to prevent exposing their partner to semen. They also point out the risk of condoms [[tearing]], particularly as most at the time were designed for vaginal, not anal, intercourse. David France recounts that while Callen and Berkowitz were ready to put all of anal sex into the "never again category" (i.e. high risk), Sonnabend, from his experience in clinical practice, was able to see that the people with the majority of the infections were those who were bottoms (i.e. those in the anal-receptive position), which then allowed him to discern a differential in risk depending on one's position in the sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting fucked (i.e. anal-receptive):&lt;/u&gt; Being penetrated in unprotected anal sex was identified as the act with the greatest risk for contracting CMV, and, under the multifactorial model, AIDS. This follows naturally from the fact that anal sex results in the [[ejaculation]] of semen into the rectum, where it is easily absorbed by the [[mucosa]] into the [[bloodstream]]. Callen and Berkowitz made sure to acknowledge, however, that this statement about high risk is not a condemnation of [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]s/men who are penetrated in gay sex. The authors incorporate a feminist critique into the pamphlet, arguing that the ingrained concept that [[manliness]] is compromised in the act of being penetrated in gay sex can create a certain degree of [[defensiveness]] when it comes to accepting that this is inherently a more dangerous position to be in, in terms of contracting AIDS. This is a prime example of how ''How to Have Sex'' attempted to address every element of its education in a sex-positive and affirming way. "Remember that the issue is disease--not sex," they tell their readers.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Rimming]] (anal-oral):&lt;/u&gt; The authors identified this as a high risk activity, stating that there is no way to rim in a risk-free way without being in a [[monogamous relationship]] where both people have been tested. Their advice is to avoid it unless the above criteria are met.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Kissing]]:&lt;/u&gt; ''How to Have Sex'' describes kissing as an activity with moderate risk of CMV transmission, although this risk, they say, can be mitigated partially by kissing with closed lips. They discuss the social and emotional importance of kissing and the negative impact that avoiding it could have on the gay community.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Low risk alternatives:&lt;/u&gt; The authors include various pieces of advice about how to change or moderate one's sexual behavior to avoid getting infected. Among these are [[masturbation]] and alternative methods of [[Sexual penetration|penetration]], including the use of [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingers]], [[Sex toy|toys]], [[dildos]], etc. They describe dildos as a good and relatively safe way to avoid contracting STDs, with the caveat that they be 1) flexible and relatively short to avoid wounds, 2) washed and disinfected regularly, and 3) not shared from person to person. They suggest ways of getting creative with mutual masturbation and jerk-off clubs, as well as "closed circles of fuck buddies," that create the possibility for safer but non-[[monogamous]] sex. They describe jerk-off clubs as typically having a friendly and welcoming atmosphere and clearly posted rules, and encourage their readers to ask around for these in their area or develop their own versions. However, Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also acknowledge that the "closed circles," based on the concept that a group of uninfected people can freely have unprotected sex as long as they do so only within that same group, are very much reliant on the trustworthiness of all members and are therefore more risky than monogamy. Furthermore, it was difficult to determine one's HIV status at the time of the book's publishing, given that the virus itself hadn't even been isolated, much less an antibody test designed to diagnose infection.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Urolagnia|Water sports]] (sexual activity involving urine):&lt;/u&gt; Because CMV is found in high quantities in urine, ''How to Have Sex'' describes water sports as something to be avoided, particularly anything that resulted in urine inside the rectum.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Fisting]]:&lt;/u&gt; This activity, although it is described as "extremely dangerous" in other capacities, had no known connection to AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Sadism and masochism:&lt;/u&gt; The authors take a positive stance on S&amp;M, but emphasize the importance of setting limits and using protection within this environment and limiting the acts one performs to avoid direct bodily fluid contact between people. Most important in this setting, they explain, is prior communication between the people involved about the need to have safe sex, which can naturally be incorporated into the customary setting of boundaries, [[safe words]], etc. that occurs in the context of S&amp;M.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Washing up:&lt;/u&gt; Although this is not a sexual act, per se, Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance of washing with soap and water both before and after sex. They recommend Betadine soap with [[iodine]] and an [[antimicrobial]] soap scrub called [[Hibiclens]]. True to their sex-positive style, they recommend making showering part of the [[foreplay]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;"[[Backroom]]s, Bookstores, Balconies, Meatracks and Tearooms" and "[[BathHouse|The Baths]]":&lt;/u&gt; These locations, generally sites designed for [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] and casual, public sex, were a highly risky environment for disease spread of all kinds. Backrooms and similar spaces tend to be dark and have limited washing facilities. The authors recognize that it is still possible to have medically safe sex in these situations, only much more difficult. The solutions, then, as presented in ''How to Have Sex,'' are "talking, washing, light and rubbers." They recommend talking to one's potential partner, even something as simple as "been here long?" to scope out how potentially infectious the person is, as well as to communicate about one's safe sex preferences (be it using condoms, not performing certain acts, using dildos, etc.). The authors say that, if the person gets defensive (which is understandable, given that the implication is that he will give you a disease), you should politely move on. They strongly recommend going to a place with [[shower]] facilities and also suggest some form of examination of one's partner's body before sex as another assessment of their health; they write, "you don't have to be clinical. Make it a part of foreplay." Lastly, in these situations where sex is often anonymous, exchanging numbers is a good way to be able to keep track of one's sexual encounters and communicate should someone become infected—this is part of the more community-driven mindset that the authors wanted to promote around sex. Lastly, Berkowitz and Callen recognize that visiting the baths is habitual for many gay men, and discuss the strategy that some have been using of masturbating before going to give oneself more self control and prevent risky behavior.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;[[Poppers]]:&lt;/u&gt; A common theory circulating in the early `80s was that the use of poppers (amyl and butyl nitrates), a common party drug in the LGBT nightclub scene, was a cofactor for AIDS transmission. However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' refute this idea, citing scientific proof vindicating the drug, although they also mention that there is a small transmission risk increase associated with taking poppers because it dilates the blood vessels, thus facilitating the entry of microorganisms.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;"Poppers." NAM AIDSMAP. https://www.aidsmap.com/Poppers/page/1322957/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the dangers of poppers outside the realm of disease transmission, including the drugs' extreme toxicity when swallowed.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Prostitution|Buying sex]]:&lt;/u&gt; Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance sexual health in sex work, as well. To those in the position of paying for the sex, they say to make sure their partner respects their health concerns, or else look for someone else. They also warn their readers that, while escort services may claim that their employees are healthy, they cannot actually know for sure and cannot be entirely trusted.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Hustling]]/selling sex:&lt;/u&gt; True to their sex-positive and nonjudgemental tone, the authors first acknowledge hustling as an important source of income for some men who have sex with men. Instead of condemning prostitution, they suggest that sex workers advertise protected sex specifically. They also recognize the unique difficulties posed for hustlers in prioritizing their sexual health because they are "in the business of satisfying others' needs" and emphasize the need to establish guidelines for safe sex before getting together. According to ''How to Have Sex,'' bilateral prevention of disease transfer in sex work is important in a [[global health]] context because sex workers were key to the national and international spread of AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Should people with AIDS have sex?===
Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by stating that, regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be, some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after being infected, whether knowingly or unknowingly, although many may be so incapacitated that sex is "the furthest thing from their minds." The solution, they argue, does not involve treating people with AIDS (PWA) like [[lepers]], as they are just as [[human]] as the rest of the population, desire the same human contact and will simply end up being unwilling to disclose their [[HIV status]] if automatic ostracism is the result. In all likelihood, the authors contend, the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS is higher than to the uninfected person, as any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromised [[immune system]]. For a person with AIDS to go to the baths or backrooms would therefore be "extremely unwise."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Based on the multifactorial model of AIDS transmission, the uninfected person would simply be at risk for being exposed to high levels of CMV-infected semen.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;  However, the reality is that the risk of having sex with someone with AIDS is higher than they described because it is caused by a single virus (HIV) that PWA (and people with HIV pre-AIDS) have and uninfected people do not.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Either way, they conclude in all capital letters that AIDS PATIENTS HAVE AN [[ETHICAL]] OBLIGATION TO ADVISE POTENTIAL PARTNERS OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS." It should be up to the uninfected person to make the informed decision to have sex, evaluating all the risk factors. However, sex between a PWA and an uninfected person, according to the pamphlet, would be fine if they are monogamous lovers and use protection. Given scientific evidence against casual transmission of AIDS, the authors saw no reason to discourage other forms of [[affection]] and touching.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Guilt, morality and sex negativity===
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' stresses the importance of separating valid medical advice from moral-based arguments disguised as medicine. In this section, the authors discuss the difficulties posed by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease, especially given that men who have sex with men, as well as [[transgender women]], were, even before the outbreak of AIDS, often accused of having too much sex by the [[Moral Majority]]. Advice during the initial stage of the epidemic was to "cut down" on the frequency of sex, without giving any thought to the type of sex. The authors describe their attempt to correct this incomplete advice by educating people on what types of sexual acts are higher risk as a way to present them with an alternative to [[abstinence]]/self-denial and encourage a sex-positive mentality.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The example they provide in the pamphlet is a man who decides to limit the number of times he has sex to 12 per year, but does not change what he does with his partners or how he does it (e.g. with protection or not). The authors conclude that this will not prevent him from putting himself at high risk for contracting AIDS at some point during the year. They stress that sex is not a [[vice]], and therefore giving up sex to avoid getting AIDS is not the same as giving up [[smoking]] to avoid [[lung cancer]]. It should be noted that the advice to cut down on only the frequency of sex and sexual partners was even less productive under the "new virus model" as opposed to the multifactorial model.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz also bring up the fact that [[anonymity|anonymous]] sex was highly criticized by the straight majority, but telling one's partner one's name will not make a difference to the [[infectivity]] of the pathogen. However, they recognize anonymity during sex might make the issue of protecting one's partner from disease transmission less pressing and/or personally important.

This section of the manual also highlights the importance of talking to one's [[physicians]] and making sure the information one gets about the disease is reliable by looking at multiple [[source text|sources]] and doing individual [[research]]. They conclude: "If we are to celebrate our gayness and get on with [[Gay Liberation]], we must stay healthy. To stay healthy, we must realize that the issue isn't gayness or sex; the issue is simply disease."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Love===
The penultimate section of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was added after both Sonnabend and Richard Dworkin read it over and were struck by the complete absence of the word "love" in a manual about safe sex.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Afterwards, the authors realized the potential it had as a moral and emotional justification for the use of protection and added this section, starting by admitting, "It came as quite a shock to us to find that we had written almost 40 pages on sex without mentioning the word "love" once." David France explain that Callen and Berkowitz both "cared deeply for their vast sexual communities" and Sonnabend agreed, saying, "you could really love somebody even for just four hours. Genuinely."&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

In this section, the authors describe the years post-Sexual Revolution as a time when sex and love were accepted as being distinct and that STD epidemics were a product of this newfound freedom, not just within the LGBT community but everywhere. If one cares about one's partner or accepts sex as something that is "interpersonally meaningful," they argue, that should be motivation enough to use protection for the sake of both one's partner and oneself. The authors build on their feminist critique, claiming that the challenge facing the gay male community is to undo their "socialization as men" who are "trained to destroy" and to compete with one another and instead promote a community of people who take care of one another. Maybe, they argue, the goal of gay male liberation is to be able to love one's partner even when society teaches them not to. "Men loving men was the basis of gay male liberation, but we have now created 'cultural institutions' in which love or even affection can be totally avoided," they write. They also pose the question to their readers: "Have we modified the belief that we could [[dance]] our way to liberation into the belief that we could somehow fuck our way there?" They end with this statement: "If you Love the person you are fucking with -- even for one night -- you will not want to make them sick. Maybe affection is our best protection."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Conclusion===
In the pamphlet's short section of "closing thoughts," the authors reiterate that "the party of the `70s is over" and that ignorance in the baths and backrooms has now turned into a form of oppression. They add that, because many members of the LGBT community are not well educated or able to afford successive healthcare visits, it's doubly important to disseminate correct, reliable information was widely as possible. Their final call is not for an end to sex, but an end to "sex without responsibility."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' also faced significant barriers in disseminating their message, most of which was due to their message's lack of popularity within the majority of the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; All of their applications for [[grants]] were rejected, and attempts to create a broader educational campaign built around the booklet's teachings were blocked by both the [[New York City government]] and organizations within the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film&gt;Wein, Daryl.

Berkowitz recounts in an [[interview]] it being "infuriating" that in 1985, the city still hadn't adopted any standard safe sex education.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The advent of safe sex in urban gay male populations came too late for many people: by 1983, more than 1,476 people had died from AIDS and David France estimated that as much as half of all MSM in New York City and San Francisco had been infected.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''The AIDS Epidemic: 1981-1987.''

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Retrospective analysis by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] found that there were between 250,000-300,000 people living with HIV in the United States in 1983, and the number of people newly infected between `83-`84 was around 150,000).&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt; However, the model set forth by Callen and Berkowitz at least provided the possibility of a "return to intimacy" for people with AIDS, which, despite being based on a now-defunct notion of how the syndrome arose, was important in combating the [[social death]] that many PWA faced after [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
 
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was also credited with laying a foundation for safe sex education outside of the LGBT community. Duke Global Health Institute founder Michael Merson describes lessons from this grassroots movement—e.g. the importance of [[contraceptives]] over abstinence—as being key in "a generation of prevention approaches to follow," including [[PEPFAR]] (which was criticized for its emphasis on abstinence) and [[The Global Fund]].&lt;ref name="merson"/&gt; 
   
In 1983, it was generally accepted knowledge that AIDS was at least indirectly sexually transmitted. However, it was the stigma and lack of education around this fact that made the frankness and sex-positivity ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' all the more important. The fact that the authors did not advocate for abstinence, were open to people's differing personal preferences, and emphasized that gay sex, anal-receptive sex in particular, was not dangerous or [[immoral]] in and of itself, made it much more effective and well-received by the gay community.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; According to [[Jeffrey Escoffier]], given that many members of the LGBT community saw gay sex as transgressive and [[Empowerment|empowering]], safe sex, particularly the use of condoms that had been traditionally seen as only necessary for [[heterosexual]] sex, was therefore a "normalization" of gay sex and a loss of [[Gay liberation|gay power]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Thus, safe sex education that did not detract from the [[uniqueness]] and power in gay sex was vital; Sonnabend himself recognizes that "perhaps the most valuable contribution of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was its ability to propose condom use in a manner that was able to celebrate sex."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

==Inaccuracies==
In 1981, when Sonnabend was formulating the multifactorial theory of HIV/AIDS transmission, the available [[data]] did not clearly [[disprove]] either his [[Scientific model|model]] or the new agent [[theory]], and there was no time to wait for the debate to be cleared up before offering concrete prevention methods.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; It was widely accepted that AIDS was sexually transmitted, and the fraught political environment made both models unappealing for different reasons.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Sonnabend argued that "to propose without supporting evidence that any [[minority group|minority]] group might be carrying a potentially fatal new, [[mutant]] virus is unconscionable";&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; however, the multifactorial model also came under attack for being [[homophobic]] and [[moralistic]] in its approach to frequent and impersonal sex.&lt;ref&gt;''Armstrong, Elizabeth A.

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt; Because the virus seemed almost entirely isolated to MSM in the early 1980s, it was difficult to see how and why a single virus would target a single demographic group. The new agent theory was adopted by the Gay Men's Health Crisis but was also, according to Callen and Berkowitz, a tool used by the [[Christian right|religious right]] to justify homophobia and dialogues condemning [[sex outside of marriage]], as well as a reflection of the "[[Western world|Western]] tradition of blaming [[Disaster|calamity]] on the [[Third World]]."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=know&gt;Callen, Michael and Richard Berkowitz.

Despite the fact that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was based on incomplete knowledge of the causes of AIDS, the advice given in the 40 pages was relevant to HIV/AIDS prevention, at least when it comes to sex-related modes of transmission.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Its central argument was to avoid getting semen and CMV in one's rectum, although, as the authors pointed out in the first section of the booklet, CMV could be substituted for the new, unidentified retrovirus that was hypothesized to cause AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, there are several instances in which the advice is inaccurate and no longer a part of [[safe sex]] education. The authors put more emphasis than necessary on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] argument—that there are inherent [[behavioral]] patterns in the MSM [[community]] responsible for causing AIDS—and failed to recognize that a single exposure could result in infection.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Under the multifactorial model, kissing a PWA, [[rimming]] and swallowing during oral sex all appear more risky than they actually are; on the other hand, having sex with a person with AIDS was more risky than the multifactorial theory suggested because a single contact can result in [[seroconversion]].&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; The multifactorial model was also unnecessarily critical of [[promiscuity]] (although the authors make sure to clarify that promiscuity is only problematic given high preexisting rates of STDs in the sexual network). In 2008, Sonnabend defended the pamphlet's focus on promiscuity, arguing that high quantities of unprotected sex were a "very significant health hazard" whether or not one put their faith in the multifactorial model, and, indeed, a high frequency of sexual encounters was still relevant given that it increased the probability of contact with an HIV+ person.&lt;ref name=trenches /&gt; 
 
The multifactorial model also gave the authors and their writing a certain degree of [[hope]] that the endpoint to AIDS was not necessarily [[death]] (which it seemed to be at the time): they believed that stopping exposure to semen and CMV after infection could improve the health of the infected individual.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The [[asymptomatic]] latency period had not yet been defined, and accounts of people with AIDS, including Berkowitz himself, maintaining a relatively healthy [[standard of living]] post-[[diagnosis]] convinced the [[authors]] of the importance of continued use of protection among people with AIDS who have sex. As is now common knowledge, once one has been infected with HIV it is almost impossible to completely rid one's body of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;"HIV/AIDS."

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the advice to continue using protection after being diagnosed was important in not only preventing future transmission to uninfected people but also to protecting the person with AIDS from being exposed to more pathogens through sex.

Berkowitz describes ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' as being more [[conservative]] than it needed to be, given that it operated on the sole [[principle]] that gay men should avoid getting sperm in their own or their partner's rectum without knowing the other's status.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;Adnum, Mark.

===Publication===
After the pamphlet went through numerous drafts and editions, Callen and Berkowitz had difficulty finding somewhere to publish it, given its controversial subject matter and point of view.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was rejected by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a prominent LGBT community health group that promoted the single virus theory, as well as by the state of New York when they reached out for help with publication.

===Reception===
====By the New York City LGBT community====
''How to Have Sex'' was met with a mixed response from its [[target audience]] ([[queer]] men/MSM) in New York City. Sales exceeded what the authors had expected, and within two weeks of the initial [[publication]] they had ordered a second batch, and, soon after, a third to meet popular [[demand]].&lt;ref name=france /&gt; David France describes himself and his [[friends]] being "absorbed" by the material: "the [[pool table]] sat idle as a [[dozen]] of us passed around copies, hungry for guidance through the [[terror]] that sex was causing."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; It has been lauded as the "first sex-positive guide to practicing safe sex" and is widely regarded as revolutionizing the tone of safe sex education, particularly in the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=andriote /&gt; The only real sacrifices in behavior that it required were abstaining from substance use in sex-related situations, rather than abstinence from any form of sex itself. Most readers reacted well to the positive and casual tone of the writing, as well as the frank descriptions of sexual acts. [[Edmund White]], author of ''The Joys of Gay Sex'', said of the pamphlet: "this is the sanest, most sensible advice I've read yet about AIDS" and [[Dennis Altman]], author of ''The Homosexualization of America'' said, "at last: a response to the effect of aids on our lives that goes beyond fears and myths to suggest positive actions."&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, Richard. "4. How to Have Sex in an Epidemic." ''Safe Sex Positive.'' Wordpress, 29 June 2010. https://richardberkowitz.com/category/4-how-to-have-sex-in-an-epidemic/&lt;/ref&gt; David France called it "a survival [[guide]] for the plague years."&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Many gay men were simply glad for any concrete advice in the midst of such confusion, particularly advice that did not present celibacy as the only safe option.

====Controversy====
As expected, ''How to Have Sex'' did receive significant [[criticism]] from other gay men and [[gay organizations]] for its critical take on promiscuity. Callen and Berkowitz had attempted to tone down their critical tone from their first major publication, "We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity" in a 1982 issue of the New York Native, which had harshly condemned the "excessiveness" and "pigging out" that was occurring in the gay nightclub scene.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; They incorporate consistent affirmation of gay sex throughout the forty pages, including sentences like the following:&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

{{quote|As you read on, we hope we make at least one point clear: Sex doesn't make you sick — diseases do. Gay sex doesn't make you sick — gay men who are sick do.}}

Many gay community members and leaders saw the writing in ''How to Have Sex'' as moralistic and attributed the advice against some types of sex to internalized homophobia, [[self-hatred]] and an "anti-sexual sense of guilt."&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt; A response written by Michael Lynch and Bill Lewis in the Toronto Politic, a Canadian gay newspaper, criticized Callen and Berkowitz for blowing the epidemic out of proportion and allowing the medical community to "pathologize" gay men, and the authors faced frequent accusations of [[victim-blaming]] and siding with the religious right.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was not an easy message for some gay men to receive: in an interview for Berkowitz' biographical film, Sex Positive, Larry Kramer described it as a blast of "cold [[water]] in the [[face]]."&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

However, all three authors firmly believed in the importance of disseminating their message despite negative reactions. Callen wrote in his book ''Surviving AIDS'' that "to be attacked for trying to save the lives of others was deeply wounding. But we felt we had no choice."&lt;ref&gt;Callen, Michael. ''Surviving AIDS.'' HarperCollins, first edition (November 1, 1990). {{ISBN|0060161485}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnabend argued that [[political correctness]] and the "desire to be nonjudgemental" were beginning to interfere with [[medical practitioners]]' primary commitment to take care of their patients and was becoming a public health issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sonnabend, Joseph. "Promiscuity is bad for your health." ''The New York Native,'' September 13–26, 1982. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Callen even applauded the negative responses to their advocacy published in [[the New York Native]], because it ended up causing debate and dramatically widening the [[audience]] and popularity of ''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic. "It turns out historically to have been one of the advantages of our status as [[heretics]]," he was quoted saying in ''[[How to Survive a Plague]].''&lt;ref name=france /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz do address the personal and [[political]] implications of their safe sex advice, specifically the loss of [[autonomy]] and [[joy]] the community might experience from having to [[police]] sexual behavior. In "We Know Who We Are" they wrote:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;

{{quote|ultimately, it may be more important to let people die in pursuit of their own [[happiness]] than to limit personal [[freedom]] by regulating risk.}}

====By the straight community====
In his memoir, Berkowitz wrote, "there was little chance we would water down our safe sex [[manifesto]] to make it more presentable for the general public in the [[Reagan era]]."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;  Although he and Callen both stressed that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was not intended for [[Heterosexuality|straight]] audiences, its popularity and importance as a foundational safe sex manifesto ensured that it got at least some level of attention beyond the LGBT community of New York City. According to the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] archives, the pamphlet was purchased by numerous [[public libraries]] (twelve known examples) and [[universities]], as well as seven known [[high schools]], a surprising number of which were in traditionally conservative states that still had functioning [[sodomy laws]].&lt;ref name=blah&gt;Oliver, Chris. "Who was reading 'How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'?" London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Archives, 12 December 2014. http://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/library/2014/12/12/reading-sex-epidemic/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The frank description of gay sex did not seem to dissuade more mainstream [[institutions]], although it is unclear whether they were aware of the [[Sexually explicit|explicit]] content of the manual before purchasing it.

The primary readership of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was still gay men in New York City, but knowledge of the work spread to people of all sexualities around the country, and even, in some cases, [[internationally]]. Soon after its initial publication, the booklet was given a review in the [[New York Review of Books]], and later a [[newscaster]] came from [[West Germany]] to interview the authors about their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberson, Jonathan. "Anatomy of an Epidemic." The New York Review of Books, 18 August 1983. http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/08/18/anatomy-of-an-epidemic/. Retrieved 14 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also received response letters from around the [[country]] and from international readers.&lt;ref name=blah /&gt;

==Historical significance==
Social scientists have credited ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and a 1982 pamphlet called ''Play Fair!'' by the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] as the first literature to recommend safe sex as a strategy for reducing the risk of contracting the transmitting agent which causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, Anthony M.''After the Wrath of God: AIDS, Sexuality, and American Religion.'' Oxford University Press; first edition (July 1, 2015). {{ISBN|0199391289}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar AIDS education manual, entitled "Can We Talk?" was published by the [[Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club]] in San Francisco at the beginning of 1983, although it is less often credited as being foundational for safe sex.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS Prevention Flyers: Can We Talk?", Pacific Oregon University Archives. http://exhibits.lib.pacificu.edu/items/show/940. Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===For HIV/AIDS Activism and Gay Politics===
Despite the negative press that ''How to Have Sex'' received for what many perceived as a criticism of promiscuity, many [[Queer theory|queer theorists]] have acknowledged the importance of the pamphlet and others like it to the evolution of the broader [[LGBT rights movement]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, Gary W. ''Practicing Desire: Homosexual Sex in the Era of AIDS.'' [[Stanford University Press]], first edition (November 1, 1996). {{ISBN|0804727112}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The politics at the time were fraught, and the AIDS epidemic revealed what Callen and Berkowitz described as the danger of having "a positive political force [i.e. the LGBT liberation] tied to a dangerous lifestyle [i.e. promiscuity without condom use]."&lt;ref name=know /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/799651 |jstor=799651 |title=Gay Baths and the Social Organization of Impersonal Sex |journal=Social Problems |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=124 |year=1975 |last1=Weinberg |first1=Martin S |last2=Williams |first2=Colin J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint presented in the booklet is one that attempted to challenge the institutions that had arisen in the urban gay male community, including bathhouses and backrooms, that had an [[economic]] "stake in keeping us promiscuous," according to the authors.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; There was a common notion in the community at the time that STDs were supposed to be what [[Edmund White]] called "[[red]] [[badges]] of [[courage]] in a [[war]] against a sex negative society," but as the cost of life from these diseases rose, members of that same community saw the need to change practices to make sex safer, and ''How to Have Sex'' is a result of that phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Tammy. ''The Death of Right and Wrong.'' Crown Forum, Reprint edition (June 22, 2004). {{ISBN|1400052947}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/136345930100500103 |title=Gay Men and HIV/AIDS Risk Management |journal=Health: an Interdisciplinary Journal for the Social Study of Health, Illness and Medicine |volume=5 |pages=50 |year=2016 |last1=Flowers |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is part of the shift in behavior and mentality from the 70s to the 80s resulting directly from the AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name=law /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbistudy /&gt; The following quote from "We Know Who We Are" demonstrates the authors' call to action:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;
{{quote|The [[motto]] of promiscuous gay men has been 'so many men, so little time.' In the `70s we worried about so many men; in the `80s we will have to worry about so little time. For us, the party that was the `70s is over. For some, perhaps, homosexuality may always mean promiscuity. They may very well die for that belief. The last 13 years since [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] have demonstrated tremendous change. So must the next 13 years.}}

===For the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement===
{{main|People with AIDS}}
Along with buddy programs, [[The Denver Principles]], the San Francisco model of care, and [[activism]] occurring around the country, pamphlets like ''How to have Sex'' and ''Play Fair!'' have been described as key elements of the [[People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement]].&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2013.301381 |pmid=23948013 |pmc=3780739 |title=Only Your Calamity: The Beginnings of Activism by and for People with AIDS |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=1788–98 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt; Sonnabend called the method presented in the manual a "do it yourself" approach that "did not wait for others to take care of pressing needs."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; As Berkowitz explained, having the power to control one's [[sex life]] and to prevent oneself from getting sick was the essence of [[self-empowerment]] at a time when AIDS was taking away gay men's [[sexual freedom]] and ability to enact a [[rebellion]] against heteronormativity through sex.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

===For Safe Sex===
{{main|Sex positive movement}}
Along with Play Fair!, ''How to have Sex'' was among the first safe sex educational materials produced and widely disseminated that addressed the subject in a positive and affirming light.&lt;ref&gt;King, Edward. ''Safety in Numbers: Safer Sex and Gay Men.'' Routledge, first edition (April 27, 1994). {{ISBN|0415909317}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; David France described the authors' method and aims to modify the behaviors of an entire [[subculture]] as something so radical that, had they discussed its feasibility with [[social scientists]] beforehand, they might have been dissuaded from attempting it.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; That said, Berkowitz has lamented that the grassroots origins of safe sex were rapidly forgotten as it became increasingly touted as an invention from experts in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

===For Public Health===
''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic is evidence of a larger trend occurring in the 1980s and 1990s in which the impetus for [[Therapy|treatment]] and [[preventive healthcare|prevention]] for HIV/AIDS came directly from the [[People With AIDS|infected communities]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=law /&gt; As Alan Brandt argues, the AIDS epidemic did more than any other to blur the line between the healthcare field and the people they treated; community-based care became a central model for public and global health efforts related to this particular disease.&lt;ref name=brandt&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1305297 |pmid=23738542 |title=How AIDS Invented Global Health |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=368 |issue=23 |pages=2149–52 |year=2013 |last1=Brandt |first1=Allan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have recognized the importance of "[[vernacular]] knowledge" from within the gay community, such as the vocabulary used in ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' being brought into a broader [[epidemiological]]/scientific context, because it was this intimate knowledge of sexual behavior among MSM that gave Callen and Berkowitz the authority to address the subject and the ability to do so in a way that appealed to their audience and avoided condescension.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Queer theorist [[Douglas Crimp]] wrote:&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; 

{{quote|We [gay men] were able to invent safe sex because we have always known that sex is not, in an [[epidemic]] or not, limited to [[penetrative sex]]. Our promiscuity taught us many things, not only about the [[pleasures]] of sex, but about the great multiplicity of those pleasures.}}

On a practical level, this sort of grassroots prevention advocacy was necessary because, in the early years of the epidemic when little was known about transmission and AIDS [[panic]] was highly prevalent, many [[mainstream]] medical [[institutions]] refused to offer care to [[people with AIDS]] or did so in a substandard manner.&lt;ref&gt;"When Doctors Refuse to Treat AIDS."

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the booklet itself and the partnership of the contributors (i.e., between Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend) helped lay the foundation for greater [[collaboration]] between [[scientists]] and the affected communities they study.&lt;ref name=brandt /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

''How to have Sex in an Epidemic'' was an important medical text in that it gave straight [[healthcare professionals]] and mainstream institutions more in depth knowledge of gay culture in general, and sexual culture of MSM specifically, including a variety of niche sex acts. This information was critical for [[Medical practitioner|practitioner]]s and [[researchers]] in their attempts to understand the risks associated with contracting HIV.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

'''Information governance''', or '''IG''', is the management of information at an organization. Information governance balances the use and security of information. Information governance helps with legal compliance, operational transparency, and reducing expenditures associated with [[legal discovery]]. An organization can establish a consistent and logical framework for employees to handle data through their information governance policies and procedures. These policies guide proper behavior regarding how organizations and their employees handle electronically stored information ([[Electronically stored information (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure)|ESI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/debra_logan/2010/01/11/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-hard/|title=What is Information Governance?

Information governance encompasses more than traditional [[records management]].  It incorporates [[information security]] and protection, compliance, [[data governance]], [[electronic discovery]], [[risk management]], privacy, data storage and archiving, [[knowledge management]], business operations and management, audit, analytics, IT management, [[master data management]], [[enterprise architecture]], [[business intelligence]], [[big data]], [[data science]], and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iginitiative.com/igi-publishes-2014-annual-report/|title=IGI PUBLISHES 2014 ANNUAL REPORT - Information Governance Initiative|date=11 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Records management===
Records management deals with the creation, retention and storage and disposition of records.  A record can either be a physical, tangible object, or digital information such as a database, application data, and e-mail.  The [[records life-cycle|lifecycle]] was historically viewed as the point of creation to the eventual disposal of a record.  As data generation exploded in recent decades, and regulations and compliance issues increased, traditional records management failed to keep pace.  A more comprehensive platform for managing records and information became necessary to address all phases of the lifecycle, which led to the advent of information governance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/pdf/WhatIsRIM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the Department of Health in England introduced the concept of broad-based information governance into the National Health Service, publishing version 1 of an online performance assessment tool with supporting guidance. The NHS IG Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igt.hscic.gov.uk/|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now used by over 30,000 NHS and partner organisations, supported by an e-learning platform with some 650,000 users.

In 2008, [[ARMA International]] introduced the Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®, or "The Principles"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arma.org/page/CoreConceptFund?|title=Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent "The Principles" Information Governance Maturity Model.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arma.org/principles/metrics.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; "The Principles" identify the critical hallmarks of information governance. As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use "The Principles" to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units. ARMA International recognized that a clear statement of "Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®" ("The Principles") would guide:

* CEOs in determining how to protect their organizations in the use of information assets;
* Legislators in crafting legislation meant to hold organizations accountable; and
* Records management professionals in designing comprehensive and effective records management programs.

Information governance goes beyond retention and disposition to include privacy, access controls, and other compliance issues.  In electronic discovery, or e-discovery, relevant data in the form of [[electronically stored information]] is searched for by attorneys and placed on [[legal hold]].  IG includes consideration of how this data is held and controlled for e-discovery, and also provides a platform for defensible disposition and compliance.  Additionally, [[metadata]] often accompanies electronically stored data and can be of great value to the enterprise if stored and managed correctly.

With all of these additional considerations that go beyond traditional records management, IG emerged as a platform for organizations to define policies at the enterprise level, across multiple jurisdictions.  IG then also provides for the enforcement of these policies into the various repositories of information, data, and records.

A coalition of organizations known as Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM), which was founded in 2005 to address issues related to electronic discovery and information governance, subsequently developed, as one of its projects, a resource called the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=EDRM|url=http://www.edrm.net/what-is-edrm|title=About EDRM|accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, EDRM, in collaboration with ARMA International, published a white paper that describes ''How the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM) Complements ARMA International’s Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles ("The Principles")''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White Paper|title=How the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM)Complements ARMA International’s Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles|year=2011|publisher=EDRM and ARMA International|pages=15|url=http://www.edrm.net/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/12/White-Paper-EDRM-Information-Governance-Reference-Model-IGRM-and-ARMAs-GARP-Principles-12-7-2011.pdf|editor-last=Ledergerber|editor-first=Marcus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IGRM illustrates the relationship between key stakeholders and the Information Lifecycle and highlights the transparency required to enable effective governance IGRM v3.0 Update: Privacy &amp; Security Officers As Stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edrm.net/download/all_projects/igrm/The-Final..-IGRM_v3.0Update-Whitepaper_Oct_2012.pdf IGRM v3.0 Update: Privacy &amp; Security Officers As Stakeholders]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council (CGOC) developed the Information Governance Process Maturity Model, or (IGPMM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/new-igpmm-essential-in-confronting-data-challenges/|title=New IGPMM Essential in Confronting Data Challenges - Corporate Compliance Insights|date=2017-03-03|work=Corporate Compliance Insights|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model outlines 13 key processes in [[Electronic discovery|electronic discovery (e-discovery)]] and [[information management]]. Each process is described in terms of a maturity level from one to four – completely manual and ad hoc to greater degrees of process integration across functions and automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edrm.net/frameworks-and-standards/information-governance-reference-model/using-the-igrm-model/|title=Using the IGRM Model|website=www.edrm.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it was updated to include an emphasis on legal, privacy, information security, cloud security issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hfma.org/Templates/leadership/Content.aspx?Pageid=28003&amp;id=60103|title=Hospitals, Health Plans Should Treat Information as a Prime Asset {{!}} HFMA|website=www.hfma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and evolving data privacy concerns, including the impact of [[General Data Protection Regulation|The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)(EU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/new-igpmm-essential-in-confronting-data-challenges/|title=New IGPMM Essential in Confronting Data Challenges - Corporate Compliance Insights|date=2017-03-03|work=Corporate Compliance Insights|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational structure===
In the past, records managers owned records management, perhaps within a compliance department at an enterprise.  In order to address the broader issues surrounding records management, several other key stakeholders must be involved.  Legal, IT, and Compliance tend to be the departments that touch information governance the most, though certainly other departments might seek representation.  Many enterprises create information governance committees to ensure that all necessary constituents are represented and that all relevant issues are addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleFriendlyCC.jsp?id=1202533945005|title=From the Experts: Information Governance and Its Impact on Litigation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
To address retention and disposition, Records Management and Enterprise Content Management applications were developed.  Sometimes detached search engines or homegrown policy definition tools were created.  These were often employed at a departmental or divisional level; rarely were tools used across the enterprise.  While these tools were used to define policies, they lacked the ability to enforce those policies.  Monitoring for compliance with policies was increasingly challenging. Since information governance addresses so much more than traditional records management, several software solutions have emerged to include the vast array of issues facing records managers.

==The sculpture==
[[File:CHF100 8 back.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Four views of ''L'Homme qui marche&amp;nbsp;I'' depicted on the 1998 version of the 100&amp;nbsp;[[Swiss Franc]] banknote]]
The bronze sculpture depicts a lone man in mid-stride with his arms hanging at his side.&lt;ref name="WallJournal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704259304575043482913970608|title=Sotheby's Sells Giacometti for Record $104.3&amp;nbsp;Million|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2010 | first=Kelly | last=Crow | date=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is described as "both a humble image of an ordinary man, and a potent symbol of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126411679319132847?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines|title=Set to Fetch a Grand Price|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=4 February 2010 | first=Margaret | last=Studer | date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giacometti is said to have viewed "the natural equilibrium of the stride" as a symbol of "man's own life force".&lt;ref name="SNB"&gt;{{citation | title = Design of the current banknote series: 100 franc banknote | url = http://www.snb.ch/en/iabout/cash/current/design/id/cash_current_design_100 | publisher = Swiss National Bank | accessdate = 4 February 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Giacometti was asked to be part of a public project by the [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza|Chase Manhattan Plaza]] in New York to plant bronze figures outside the building.&lt;ref name="WallJournal"/&gt; He created several sculptures, with ''L'Homme qui marche&amp;nbsp;I'' among them.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Giacometti struggled with the project and eventually abandoned the commission.&lt;ref name="WallJournal"/&gt; However, in 1961 he cast the life-size work in bronze and exhibited it at the [[Venice Biennale]] a year later.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; ''L'Homme Qui Marche&amp;nbsp;I'' was created at the high point of Giacometti's mature period and represents the pinnacle of his experimentation with the human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/news/giacometti-homme-sothebys.htm|title=Sotheby's will offer Giacometti's L'Homme Qui Marche&amp;nbsp;I|work=The Art Wolf|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is considered to be one of the most important works by the artist&lt;ref name="SNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8497287.stm|title=Giacometti sculpture fetches £65m at Sotheby's auction |work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 February 2010|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most iconic images of Modern art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159576376|title=L'Homme Qui Marche&amp;nbsp;I|work=Sotheby's|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edition number one of the sculpture is located at the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie"/&gt; Edition number two belongs in a private collection. Other casts of ''L'Homme qui marche I'' include those at the [[Fondation Maeght]] in  [[Saint-Paul, Alpes-Maritimes]], the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]] in [[Buffalo, NY]], and [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] near [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159576376 | title=Impressionist &amp; Modern Art Evening Sale: Lot 8 Alberto Giacometti  | publisher=Sotheby's | accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auction==
[[File:L'Homme Qui Marche II.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''L'Homme qui marche II'', a closely related sculpture in the series]]
On 3 February 2010, edition number two of the sculpture came up for auction at [[Sotheby's]] auction house in London.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; The piece was sold by German banking group [[Commerzbank]], which had acquired it when it took over the [[Dresdner Bank]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60744C20100108?type=artsNews|title=Life-size Giacometti bronze goes under the hammer|work=Reuters|accessdate=3 February 2010 | date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the sculpture marked the first time in 20 years that a life-size Giacometti figure of a walking man came to auction.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;
It had been estimated to sell for between £12 and £18&amp;nbsp;million, but in just eight minutes the sculpture was bought by [[Lily Safra]], widow of the prominent [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] banker [[Edmond Safra]] for £58&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aN5LJjCDaDfQ|title=Lily Safra Paid $103.4 Million for Giacometti, Dealers Say |work=Bloomberg|accessdate=4 May 2010|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Including the [[buyer's premium]] the price reached £65&amp;nbsp;million (US$103.7&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8497287.stm|title=Giacometti sculpture fetches £65m at Sotheby's auction |work=BBC|accessdate=3 February 2010|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The piece broke the record for a Giacometti work at auction, which was set at $27.5 million by ''[[Alberto Giacometti#Grande Femme Debout II|Grande Femme Debout&amp;nbsp;II]]'' in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jJ-nuOHmXSBq7_MFQrllsC6jrt4A |title=Monet fetches record price at New York auction |work=AFP |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512060740/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jJ-nuOHmXSBq7_MFQrllsC6jrt4A |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that for the most expensive sculpture sold at a public auction, which was held by the 5000-year-old ''[[Guennol Lioness]]'', sold at Sotheby's in 2007 for $57.2 m. When expressed in British pounds and when [[inflation]] is ignored, the bronze also broke the record price for an art work sold at auction which, since 2004, was held at $104.2&amp;nbsp;million (then £58.2 m) by [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Garçon à la pipe]]''.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35223008/ns/entertainment-arts_books_more/|title=Giacometti sculpture fetches record $104M|work=MSNBC|accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most expensive work of art sold at a public auction remained [[Van Gogh]]'s ''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'', which was bought in May 1990 for $82.5&amp;nbsp;million (approx. $138.4&amp;nbsp;million in [[consumer price index|CPI]]-adjusted 2010 US dollars),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm CPI Inflation Calculator, US Bureau of Labor Statistics].&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jackson Pollock]]'s ''[[No. 5, 1948]]'', which was privately sold for $140&amp;nbsp;million in 2006 (approx. $151&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 dollars), remained the most expensive work of art sold overall.

== OS packaged software ==

=== Apple ===

==== iOS ====
FLAC is  natively supported on [[IOS 11]], including all "[[iDevice]]s", but only via the [[Files (Apple)]] app or [[iCloud Drive]] .[[iTunes]] does not support FLAC, with Apple only offering native support for their own similar [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] lossless audio format. Third party applications are available in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] which enable FLAC playback, such as [https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id751159889 MyAudioStream] .&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flac-player/id390532592?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liveli/id628181563&lt;/ref&gt;

[[iOS jailbreaking|Jailbroken]] iOS devices could play it through the applications from [[Cydia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;!-- blog's http://vlc4iphone.blogspot.com not allowed, find another reputable source --&gt;

==== macOS ====
As with their iOS operating system, Apple's iTunes software on macOS  cannot natively playback FLAC audio files. One exception to this is with the use of a third-party software plug-in, which currently allows iTunes software to playback a small percentage of [[Ogg]]-based FLAC files. Computers that run on the [[MacOS High Sierra]] operating can play Flac files via preview.app . Older versions require third-party non-iTunes media players in order to playback FLAC files, or to encode into FLAC files.

=== Android ===
Native support for FLAC was added to the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] starting from the '''3.1''' 'Honeycomb' update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html |title=Android Supported Media Formats |date=4 August 2011 |work=Andro Med Formats |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature came about after much public discussion on Android's [[Google Code]] development site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1461
|title=Issue 1461&amp;nbsp;– android&amp;nbsp;– FLAC file support enhancement request. |work=code.google.com |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, FLAC support is limited to .FLAC files as Android does not support decode inside of other file containers (such as MP4 and MKV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html
|title= Android Developer's Supported Media Formats |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Android 3.1 update, Samsung included native support on over 32 Android devices, including their [[Samsung Galaxy|Galaxy]] line of phones.&lt;ref name="GSM Arena"&gt;[http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?sFreeText=flac "FLAC" Phone Finder results - GSMArena.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other prior Android device users could only (and still today) resort to using third-party applications (apps) available for Android such as PowerAMP, andLess, Astro Player or otherwise alternatively turn to installing custom system ROMs such as [[CyanogenMod]]. Note that some of these third-party applications, especially PowerAMP, decode FLAC and other formats using [[FFmpeg]] and therefore do not rely on the operating system to provide that functionality.

=== Microsoft ===
The [[Windows Mobile]] operating system is able to support playback of FLAC files through the use of plugins or third-party applications such as [[The Core Pocket Media Player|TCMP]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corecodec.com/products/coreplayer
|title=CorePlayer Platform |work=CoreCodec.com |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Windows Phone 7]] (WP7) there is no FLAC support available in the default [[Zune#Windows Phone|Zune]] media player&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff462087(v=vs.92).aspx
|title=Supported Media Codecs for Windows Phone |work=Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pocketnow.com/windows-phone/windows-phone-7-which-video-and-audio-file-formats-are-supported |title=Windows Phone 7: Which Video and Audio File Formats are Supported? |publisher=pocketnow.com |date=21 September 2010 |first=Brandon |last=Miniman |work=Pocketnow Win Phone 7 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though playback is supported in third-party applications like a Flac Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/flac-player/7624b8fb-798a-4f48-84ab-6963eb624f2b|title=Flac Player|publisher=Shamrock Soft|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Similar goes for Windows Phone 8.

Microsoft [[Windows 10]] supports FLAC decoding in [[Windows Media Player]] and other software that uses Windows platform APIs for audio decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/27/windows-10-native-flac-mkv-support/ |title=Windows 10 will play your .MKV and .FLAC files all on its own |date=2014-11-27 |accessdate=2014-11-28 |last=Copper |first=Daniel |publisher=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Samsung YP-P3, YP-Q1, YP-Q2, YP-U5, YP-S5 (with upgraded firmware available from Samsung website)
*FLAC playback is possible on [[mobile device]]s or [[Mobile phone|phones]] based on Windows Mobile, or [[Symbian OS]] with either [[S60 (software platform)|S60]], [[Series 80 (software platform)|Series 80]] or [[Series 90 (software platform)|Series 90]] [[User interface|UI]] platforms, can run the [[Free software|free]] [[Open source software|open source]] [[Media player (application software)|media player]] application OggPlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leif H. Wilden |url=http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/ |title=Symbian OggPlay |publisher=Symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also LCG Jukebox from Lonely Cat Games is able to play FLAC audio on Symbian S60 and Windows Mobile devices.
*[[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] devices are capable of playing FLAC since version 3.1 &lt;ref&gt;https://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html&lt;/ref&gt; Others may also support it by replacing the device's firmware with the third-party [[CyanogenMod]] ROM, which can play back FLAC. Otherwise users could simply opt to use a third-party supported application for Android such as PowerAMP, andLess, RockPlayer or Meridian Media Player. Such players can even recognize the tags after using Extended Media Scanner. Example of this include HTC HD2 running third-party Android software.
* [[Rockbox]] open source firmware for multiple portable audio players

'''''Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons''''' is a medical book focused on [[public health]] and [[medical ethics]]. It was written by English physician [[Thomas Percival]] and published in 1803. The book is widely regarded as the first on public health and ethics in medicine.&lt;ref name="ncbi_Medi"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Ethics; or a Code of Institutes and Precepts adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons| author = | work = PubMed Central| date = 1849-12-26| access-date = 30 November 2018| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2488117/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Prior to 1803 medical ethics was more focused on medical etiquette. ''Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons'' was the first book to coin the term "medical ethics".

'''''Menggu Ziyun''''' ({{zh|c=蒙古字韻}}, "Rimes in Mongol Script") is a 14th-century [[rime dictionary]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as written in the [['Phags-pa script]] that was used during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368).{{sfn|Kim-Renaud|1997|p=44}}  The only surviving examplar of this dictionary is an 18th-century manuscript copy that belonged to [[Stephen Wootton Bushell]] (1844–1908), and is now held at the [[British Library]] (Or. 6972).  As the only known example of a 'Phags-pa script dictionary of Chinese, it is important both as an aid for interpreting Yuan dynasty texts and inscriptions written in Chinese using the 'Phags-pa script, and as a source for the reconstructed pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]].

== The British Library manuscript ==
[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Page from ''Menggu Ziyun'' covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim''.  Beneath each syllable (written in 'Phags-pa script) is a list of characters with that pronunciation, grouped by [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone]] (平, 上, 去 and 入).]]
The [[British Library]] manuscript was acquired by the antiquarian and art historian [[Stephen Wootton Bushell|S. W. Bushell]] when he worked as a physician at the British Legation in [[Beijing]], [[China]] from 1868 to 1900, probably in 1872 during a trip to [[Inner Mongolia]] and the ruins of [[Shangdu]], the fabled summer capital of the Yuan emperors then known as "Xanadu" in English.{{sfn|Bushell|1875}}{{sfn|Lewicki|1949|p=26}}  In April 1909, a year after his death, Bushell's widow, Florence Bushell, sold the manuscript to the [[British Museum]] in London, and it is now held by the British Library (shelfmark Or. 6972).{{efn|According to the [[British Museum]], Florence Bushell donated her husband's extensive collection to the British Museum in 1909,&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Biographical details for Mrs Florence Bushell | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=141896 | accessdate=2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least this item was sold rather than donated as the inside back cover of the first volume has the inscription "Bought of Mrs. Bushell Apr. 6, 1909".  "Mrs. Bushell" was misread as "Mrs. Rushell" by Luo and Cai,{{sfn|Luo|Cai|1959|p=84}} and so many sources (such as Kim-Renaud 1997 and Coblin 2007) incorrectly state that the manuscript was originally owned by Mrs. Rushell.}}

The manuscript is written on thin, brown paper which has been mounted on white backing paper and bound in two [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|traditional stitched volumes]], each 24.7 × 17.3&amp;nbsp;cm.  Each folio of the manuscript is 22.5 × 28.8&amp;nbsp;cm in size, folded in half as is normal in stitch-bound volumes.{{sfn|West|2006}}  The text is written in vertical columns running from left to right across the page, which is the opposite of traditional Chinese books, but follows the layout of Mongolian script and 'Phags-pa texts.  The first volume comprises an unnumbered title folio and 33 numbered folios, and the second volume comprises an unnumbered title folio and 31 numbered folios, of which page 30b and 31a are blank except for the volume and page numbers.  The missing section covers the rimes in ''-a'' and ''-e'', as well as the first part of the appended ''Taboo Characters'' section, which [[Junast]] and Yang Naisi have calculated should actually take up three full folios (i.e. the second volume of the original edition would have comprised 33 folios).{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=148}}

The manuscript does not indicate when and by whom it was copied, and there are no [[Seal (East Asia)|ownership seals]].  However, on the basis of [[Naming taboo|tabooed characters]] of Qing dynasty emperors, the manuscript has been dated to the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong era]] (1736–1795).{{sfn|Kim-Renaud|1997|p=76}}  The manuscript may be a second or third hand copy of an original Yuan dynasty edition, made by someone who did not necessarily understand the 'Phags-pa script, and so the 'Phags-pa letters are often poorly written or corrupted, and there are many transcription errors such as missing, misplaced and incorrectly written Chinese characters.{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=2}}{{sfn|Ning|1994|p=71}}

== Authorship and editions ==
Based on its format, the British Library manuscript of ''Menggu Ziyun'' is thought to be a copy of an earlier printed edition.  Although no extant printed editions are known, one mid 19th century writer, Luo Yizhi 羅以智, mentions that he had seen a Yuan dynasty printed edition of the dictionary.  Other [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) writers mention having seen manuscript copies of the text, but the British Library manuscript is now the only known copy.{{sfn|Luo|Cai|1959|p=90}}

The British Library manuscript includes two prefaces in Chinese dated 1308, one by Liu Geng 劉更 and one by Zhu Zongwen 朱宗文 (Mongolian name Bayan) of Xin'an 信安 (modern [[Changshan County]] in [[Zhejiang]]).  The prefaces both indicate that this edition of the dictionary was composed by Zhu Zongwen, but that it is a revised edition based on a collation of several editions that were in circulation at the time, including one edition published in [[Hubei]] and one edition published in Eastern [[Zhejiang]].{{sfn|Coblin|2007|pp=9–10}}  The original 'Phags-pa dictionary that is ancestral to the 1308 edition was probably compiled by imperial order soon after the 'Phags-pa script was devised in about 1269, intended for use in teaching the new script to Chinese officials.{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=2}}{{sfn|Coblin|2007|p=12}}

Two late 13th century books which may be related to ''Menggu Ziyun'' are recorded in Yuan dynasty sources, one called ''Měnggǔ Yùnlüè'' 蒙古韻略 ("Summary of the Mongol Rimes") and one called ''Měnggǔ Yùnlèi'' 蒙古韻類 ("Mongol Rime Categories") that was compiled by Li Hongdao 李宏道.  Although neither work is extant, it has been conjectured that they could be primary sources used by Zhu Zongwen in compiling his edition, or possibly even earlier editions of ''Menggu Ziyun'' published under a different title.  A preface for ''Měnggǔ Yùnlèi'' that has survived, and it indicates that it used a system of 15 rime classes and 32 initials, which is very similar to the system used in ''Menggu Ziyun''.{{sfn|Coblin|2007|pp=11–12}}

== Contents ==
[[File:Yang Wengshe 1314.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Christian tombstone of Yang Wengshe, dated 1314, from [[Quanzhou]], China.  The 'Phags-pa inscription reads {{Phagspa|h|ꡖꡟꡃ ꡚꡦ ꡗꡃ ꡚꡞ ꡏꡟ ꡈꡓ|·ung shė yang shi mu taw|size=12}} (''·ung shė yang shi mu taw''), representing Chinese ''weng she yang shi mu dao'' 翁舍楊氏墓道 "tomb memorial of Yang Wengshe".]]

The book is written in Chinese using a mixture of Chinese characters and 'Phags-pa transcription, with section titles and rime class headings given in both scripts.  Only the two prefaces and the appended list of taboo characters are written entirely in Chinese characters.  The title of the book in 'Phags-pa script ({{Phagspa|h|ꡏꡡꡃ ꡣꡡꡙ ꡐꡜꡞ ꡝꡧꡞꡋ|mong xol tshi ʼwin}} ''mong xol tshi ʼwin'') is anomalous in that it does not exactly transcribe the corresponding Chinese characters (''Měnggǔ Zìyùn'' 蒙古字韻) as ''mong xol'' is not a transcription of the Chinese characters 蒙古 (měnggǔ, meaning 'Mongol'), but is a direct phonetic representation of the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] word {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ}} ''mongɣol'' 'Mongol'.{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=160}}

The book comprises the following sections:

* Preface in Chinese written by Liu Geng 劉更 and dated 1308
* Preface in Chinese written by Zhu Zongwen 朱宗文 and dated 1308
* Table of errors in earlier editions of ''Menggu Ziyun'' that are corrected in this edition
* Diagram illustrating the pronunciation of 'Phags-pa letters (incomplete in the extant manuscript)
* Table of the [[Rime table#36 initials|thirty-six initial sounds]] of Chinese in the 'Phags-pa script
* Table of [[seal script]] forms of 'Phags-pa letters
* Table of the fifteen Chinese rime classes under which the entries are ordered
* The main text of the dictionary
* Appendix listing [[Naming taboo|taboo characters]], derived from the ''[[Decrees and Regulations of Yuan dynasty]]'' (元典章){{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=148}}

The main text comprises 813 entries ordered by rime class and initial sound.  Three folios covering some 37 syllables with ''-a'' and ''-e'' rimes are missing in the extant manuscript, and so it is thought that the original text would have comprised about 850 entries in total.{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=148}}  Each entry consists of a syllable written in 'Phags-pa script at the top, below which are a list of [[Chinese characters]] representable by this 'Phags-pa syllable, ordered according to the [[Four tones (Chinese)|four traditional Chinese tones]] ("level", "rising", "falling" and "entering").  The 'Phags-pa script does not indicate tonal differences so Chinese characters with the same pronunciation but different [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] are represented using the same 'Phags-pa syllable.  A total of 9118 Chinese characters are given under the surviving 813 entries, although as Chinese characters may have more than one pronunciation, some characters are included under multiple entries.

== Phonetic features ==
The entries in ''Menggu Ziyun'' are arranged by the fifteen [[Syllable rime|rime]] classes listed at the start of the dictionary, and within each rime class by rime subclass (there are 71 subclasses in total, as shown in the table below).  Within each rime subclass entries are ordered according to the thirty-six traditional [[Syllable onset|initial onsets]].{{sfn|Coblin|2007|pp=14–15}}

The rime classes in ''Menggu Ziyun'' follow those given in ''Gǔjīn Yùnhuì Jǔyào'' 古今韻會舉要, a lexicographical compendium originally compiled by Huang Gongshao 黃公紹 (died 1297), and published in an abridged form by Xiong Zhong 熊忠 in 1297.{{sfn|Coblin|2007|pp=11–12}}{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=3}}  However, the Chinese characters under each entry may be based on ''Xīnkān Yùnlüè'' 新刊韻略, a rime book compiled by Wang Wenyu 王文郁 during the late [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] (the text is known from a manuscript copy of an edition published in 1229).{{sfn|Ning|1994|p=71}}

The 36 initials are a traditional classification of initial onsets used in Chinese books dating back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), but by the Yuan dynasty they represented an idealized phonetic system that did not accurately reflect the Old Mandarin language that the 'Phags-pa script was designed to represent.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The discrepancy between the theoretical and actual phonology of Yuan dynasty Chinese is indicated by certain peculiarities in the use of 'Phags-pa letters to represent the 36 initials in ''Menggu Ziyun'':

* The 'Phags-pa letters ''ja'', ''cha'' and ''ca'' are each used to represent two different initials, one from the palatal series (9–11) and one from the palatal-retroflex series (26–28), suggesting that in Yuan dynasty Old Mandarin these two series had converged.
* Initials 17–19 are represented by two forms of the 'Phags-pa letter ''fa''.  Although the table of 36 initials at the head of the dictionary assigns the normal form of the letter ''fa'' to initials 17 and 19, and the variant form of the letter ''fa'' to initial 18, the actual entries in the dictionary are not consistent about which form of the letter to use for which initial.{{sfn|Junast|Yang|1987|p=8}}  However, as no rime subclass has more than two of the three initials, only two forms of the letter ''fa'' are required to distinguish the initials from each other.
* Initials 29 ({{IPA|*[ɕ]}}) and 30 ({{IPA|*[ʑ]}}) are represented by two forms of the 'Phags-pa letter ''sha'', and were probably pronounced the same in Yuan dynasty Old Mandarin.
* Initial 32 ({{IPA|*[ɣ]}}) is represented using both 'Phags-pa letter ''xa'' and a variant form of 'Phags-pa letter ''ha''.  However the distribution of the two letters is complementary, with the letter ''xa'' used before [[back vowel]]s and ''i'', and the variant form letter ''ha'' used before the [[semivowel]] ''y'' and [[front vowel]]s other than ''i''.
* Initial 33 ({{IPA|*[ʔ]}}) is represented using both 'Phags-pa letter ''·a'' and the normal form of 'Phags-pa letter ''ya''.
* Initial 34 ({{IPA|*[j]}}) is represented using both 'Phags-pa letter ''ʼa'' and a variant form of 'Phags-pa letter ''ya''.

This use of variant forms of the letters ''fa'', ''ha'', ''sha'' and ''ya'' for different initials is not reflected in surviving inscriptions in the 'Phags-pa script, and is probably an attempt by Zhu Zongwen to artificially distinguish historical phonetic differences that were no longer valid in Yuan dynasty Old Mandarin.{{sfn|Unicode|2007|p=356}}

'''Momart''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] company specialising in the storage, transportation, and installation of works of [[art]].

A major proportion of their business is maintaining (often delicate) artworks in a secure, climate-controlled environment. The company maintains specialist [[warehouse]] facilities adapted for this task. Momart's clients include the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[Tate Modern]], [[Tate Britain]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The company received considerable media attention in 2004 when a fire spread to one of their warehouses from an adjacent unit, destroying the works in it, including works by [[Young British Artists]] such as [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Damien Hirst]], with the most well known work lost being Emin's 1995 piece ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''. On 5 March 2008 Momart was taken over by  [[Falkland Islands Holdings]] for a value of £10.3 Million &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/311966/fine-art-move-by-falkland.thtml|title=Fine art move by Falkland|date=2008-03-07|work=Growth Company Investor|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which £4.6 Million was in cash, £2.5 Million was with shares and £3.2 was deferred consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fihplc.com/download/Momart_acquisition030308.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Momart began in 1971 as the “Jim Moyes’s Compendium of Working Possibilities”, with its founder, himself an artist, offering installation, display, handling, transport and framing services to up an coming artists and emergent galleries in London. Early users of the service included [[David Hockney]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. The client base quickly grew by word of mouth in recognition of the service levels being offered and in September 1972 the company was registered as Momart Limited&amp;nbsp;– an amalgam of Jim Moyes and new partner Rees Martin. Rees subsequently left the business but the brand was becoming well established so the name remained.

=== Early days ===

The company set up its first office on Richmond Road, Hackney in East London and continued to grow organically – moving art, painting gallery walls, making frames and cases, hanging paintings, slinging sculpture and providing art storage. By 1985 Momart had gained a solid reputation amongst the commercial galleries and artists and started to introduce its credentials to the public sector such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], the [[National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] and other UK based art institutions.

In 1985, Momart commissioned the UK’s first fine art vehicle with temperature control and air ride suspension and carried out its first museum job on behalf of the Royal Academy - a [[Henry Moore]] exhibition. Momart was by then able to undertake all of the transport handling requirements completely in-house, including making site visits to the individual lenders where required, case making, transport of the empty cases to the lenders, pack on site and delivery of the case loan to the borrower.

=== Research and development ===
From 1988 Momart expanded the services to include the international movement of artworks on behalf of both commercial and museum clients overseas. This prompted close analysis and investigation of the various case making options and specifications and in 1991, in collaboration with Tate, the company assisted with the development and the standard specification for museum cases for touring exhibitions and for sending artworks worldwide. This was then presented at the Art in Transit Conference in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/8127/mci_Art_in_Transit_Handbook_for_Packing_and_Transporting_Paintings.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Warrant ===

Momart’s client base continued to expand. In the late 1980s the company started working for the Royal Collection and, in 1993, in recognition of the high quality of service provided by Momart, Her Majesty The Queen appointed Momart as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant]] holder.

=== New storage facilities ===

In 2003 Momart invested in new premises in [[Leyton]], with new plant and equipment and room for expansion. This included a new state-of-the-art workshop, storage facilities and transport office with Hackney remaining as the office base for the project coordination, administration and some satellite warehousing. This investment improved efficiency and capacity for increased storage business. In the same year Momart was granted Listed Agent status with the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) allowing certified Momart employees to carry out hand search procedures on client artworks to avoid the need for X-raying at the airport of departure.

=== Falkland Islands Holding ===

In 2008 Momart was acquired by Falkland Islands Holdings (FIH) the international services group that owns services businesses focused on transport and logistics. Following the acquisition, Momart's key management and staff has continued to work within the group to drive the company’s continued expansion, particularly in rapidly growing overseas markets. In that same year Momart’s administrative offices were moved from Hackney to Whitechapel from where the company operated all of the administration, coordination, shipping, finance, IT services.

=== Customs procedures ===

In 2009 HMRC granted Momart the then unique privilege amongst fine art transport companies to undertake all of its customs procedures in-house. Couple of years later, in 2011, Momart has been certified as an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/aeo_home.jsp?Lang=en|title=Authorised Economic Operator|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the company to simplify customs bureaucracy and speed up passage within the EU for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/authorised-economic-operator-certification|title=Authorised Economic Operator|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''New premises''' ===
In 2013 the company relocated its head office to South Quay, East London where it currently resides.

In 2016 Momart expanded its storage facilities in [[Leyton]], East London, with a new purpose-built unit providing additional 2,500 square metres of specialist art storage space.

== ARTIM ==
In 2001 Momart and five other respected international fine art transport agents founded the professional association ARTIM, whose members monitor each other's service levels both professionally and financially. ARTIM comprises the leading fine art agents worldwide who have the highest standards of service. Agents wishing to join ARTIM have to be voted in with a majority vote by the Founders’ Committee before becoming members. The association has gained much respect due to the calibre of the membership and although it cannot be used as an advertising tool in any way, offers great mutual support and benefits to its members and thereby to its clients and to the art world as a whole.

== The 2004 warehouse fire ==

In the early hours of 24 May 2004 a fire broke out at the Cromwell industrial estate in Leyton, east London. According to the fire investigation report, the flames that caught between 1.45 am and 3.15 am that morning were started deliberately, after burglars broke into a unit located at the extreme south-western corner of the estate and leased to an individual business repairing consumer electronics. 

The fire spread through the adjoining units at the estate, eventually reaching and destroying a warehouse then operated by Momart.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/27/thebritartfire.arts1|title=50 years of British art lies in ashes|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram|date=2004-05-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blaze destroyed more than 100 works by some of Britain's leading contemporary artists including Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Helen Chadwick and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3748179.stm|title=Fire devastates Saatchi artworks|date=2004-05-26|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those works were owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], the country's biggest collector of modern art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Art industry insiders noted at the time that the insurance value of the works lost in the fire would be many times their initial purchase price, and that a comparable rise could be expected in the market values of the remaining (and future) works by artists whose works were lost. The total value of artworks lost was estimated at between £30 and £50 million.

A number of artists, in a joint action with several insurance firms, alleged negligence and pursued a legal case against Momart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1592859/Art-blaze-sparks-lawsuits-against-Momart.html|title=Art blaze sparks lawsuits against Momart|work=This is Money|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled out of court in a mediated agreement for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the order of  “tens of millions of pounds”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plone.unige.ch/art-adr/cases-affaires/warehouse-fire-2013-gillian-ayres-et-al-and-momart|title=Warehouse Fire – Gillian Ayres et al. and Momart — Centre du droit de l'art|website=plone.unige.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Momart Christmas card series ==
The tradition of the Christmas card goes back to 1984 when the first object – a festive card – was designed for the company by Bruce McLean. Since then Momart collaborated on this project with many of the top British and international artists. The complete series of Momart Christmas card is now part of the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate.

'''''National Westminster Finance NZ Ltd v South Pacific Rent-a-Car Ltd''''' [1985] 1 NZLR 646 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the validation of illegal contracts under the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
South Pacific  ran a Christchurch-based rental car agency. Over the years, it had purchased 80 cars under hire purchase from the NZ Motor Corporation, paying a 10% deposit, plus a further 15% in instalments over the next 8 months, with the NZMC purchasing the vehicles back.

Problems arose however in 1979, when Mr Mullaly sold the company to another company owned by Mr Cooper, after his lawyer advised him that these agreements were illegal, as under the Hire Purchase and Credit Sales Stabilisation Regulations 1957, hire purchase agreements are illegal if they have a deposit of less than 60%.

As a result, Cooper took the drastic action of demanding that the finance company take all the vehicles back, which the duly did, and after selling the vehicles, sent South Pacific a demand for $44,922.74, as well as to Mr Mullaly under his personal guarantee.

After neither party was prepared to pay, the finance company sued both parties. South Pacific lodged a counter-claim that as the contracts were illegal, not only were they not liable for the shortfall, that they were also entitled to the $55,238.14 that they had paid under these contracts to be refunded, and NatWest subsequently filed in the court for a validation order.

==Held==
The court made an order for validation of the HP contracts, but only on the basis that they first release Mr Mullaly from his guarantee.

'''''Noua Dreaptă''''' ({{lang-en|The New Right}}) is an [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]], [[far-right]] organization in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], founded in 2000.

==Beliefs==
The group's beliefs include militant [[ultranationalism]] and strong [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] religious convictions.  ''Noua Dreaptă'''s [http://www.nouadreapta.org website] indicates opposition to [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]], [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsies), [[abortion]], [[communism]], [[globalization]], the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], religious groups other than the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], race-mixing, territorial autonomy for Romania's ethnic [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian minority]], and immoderate cultural import (including some [[American culture]], [[manele|''manele'' music]], and the celebration of [[Valentine's Day]]).  They claim to be against both Marxism and capitalism, proposing a concept of "social justice" economics, following the [[third position]]ist ideology.

The members of ''Noua Dreaptă'' [[personality cult|revere]] the leader of the [[Iron Guard]] in the 1930s, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]. ''Noua Dreaptă'' members refer to him as "''Căpitanul''" ("The Captain"), which is what Codreanu's supporters called him during his lifetime.

==Goals and actions==
The stated ultimate political aim of ''Noua Dreaptă'' is to restore [[Greater Romania]], which represented Romania at its greatest geographic expanse before [[World War II]]. The group also states it is strongly opposed to the principles of [[representative democracy]], which it sees as an "inadequate" form of government. Some individual members are [[monarchist]]s.

''Noua Dreaptă'' is registered as a political party since 2015. The number of members is undocumented, but it is estimated from 1000 to 2000.

Some members have also engaged in violence.  Incidents have been specifically reported involving physical attacks by ''Noua Dreaptă'' members against [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5745.htm 2001 International Religious Freedom Report (Romania)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] — from U.S. State Department web site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27860.htm 2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (Romania)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] — from U.S. State Department web site&lt;/ref&gt; and gays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://romania.indymedia.org/en/2005/06/851.shtml gayfest 2005 - the 1st gay festival &amp; parade in romania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other actions, the organization attempts to attract supporters through publicity campaigns aimed against what it sees as foreign and without any connections with the Romanian traditional heritage (and therefore negative) cultural influences - such as [[Valentine's Day]].

==Affiliations==
''Noua Dreaptă'' was part of the [[European National Front]], an umbrella group of far-right nationalist organizations, many of which can be characterized as [[Fascist]].  The ''Noua Dreaptă'' web site includes a column of "links of interest" to numerous extreme nationalist organizations throughout Europe, including the following:

* [[Danskernes Parti]] (Denmark)&lt;ref&gt;[http://danskernesparti.dk/archives/4647/ "Danskernes Parti besøgte Rumænien"], in ''[[Corneliu Codreanus monument]]'' 3 December 2013 (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (Germany)
* [[Forza Nuova]] (Italy)
* [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]] (Greece)
* [[National Renovator Party]] (Portugal)

''Noua Dreaptă'' is also reported{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to have ties to the following political groups:

* [[Eurasian Youth Union]] (Russia) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiras.ru/evrazija/8805-esm-i-rumynskie-neonacisty-obedinilis.html ЕСМ и румынские неонацисты объединились для борьбы против государства Украина], Lenta: Transdniestrian News Agency, 09/05/2009, accessed 15.05.2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extremist reputation==
[[Image:Celtic-style crossed circle.svg|thumb|drawing of a nationalistic stylized Celtic cross]]
[[Image:Legionary stamp.jpg|thumb|150px|''Stamp bearing the symbol of the'' Iron Guard ''over a green cross that stood for one of its humanitarian ventures.'']]

''Noua Dreaptă'' uses imagery associated with ''legionarism'', the ideology of the extreme nationalist and anti-Semitic interwar [[Iron Guard]], which roughly paralleled the [[Fascist]] and [[Nazi]] movements in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], respectively. The group's symbol, for example — the [[Celtic cross]] (usually drawn on a green background) — is reminiscent of the insignia of the Iron Guard.

''Noua Dreaptă'' has aligned itself with organizations elsewhere in [[Europe]] with strongly [[anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] views,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/austria.htm Stephen Roth Institute: Antisemitism And Racism]&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not focused its efforts against Romania's currently small [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]]. Rather, the group has concentrated its rhetoric and efforts against the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarians]], [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsies), [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nouadreapta.org/limbistraine_prezentare.php?idx=24&amp;lmb=eng NOUA DREAPTA :: Pentru Dumnezeu, Neam si Tara !&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] (in English)&lt;/ref&gt; and minority religious faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24429.htm 2003 International Religious Freedom Report (Romania)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] — from U.S. State Department web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Its anti-democratic and anti-constitutional views and statements made them a permanent target of surveillance by the Directorate for the Defense of the Constitution, a department of the [[Romanian Intelligence Service|domestic intelligence service]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Political rallies==
In May 2006, dozens of ''Noua Dreaptă'' members were arrested by police after trying to violently disrupt the [[GayFest]] pride parade in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L0393312 World Crises | Reuters.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311135027/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L0393312 |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also used tear gas to disperse counterprotesters led by individuals identified as ''Noua Dreaptă'' members.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

On 15 March 2008, on the National Day of [[Hungary]], ''Noua Dreaptă'' organized an anti-Hungarian rally in Cluj-Napoca — an action which, after group members attacked and beat an ethnic Hungarian celebrator, led [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania|UDMR]] leader [[Marko Bela]] to criticize Cluj's mayor [[Emil Boc]] for approving it. In addition, two ethnic Hungarian members of the Romanian Parliament demanded the banning of ''Noua Dreaptă'' on the grounds that it continues Iron Guard's spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/795943/Noua-Dreapta-subiect-de-disputa-intre-Boc-si-UDMR/ "Noua Dreaptă, subiect de dispută între Boc şi UDMR"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'' 17 March 2008 (in Romanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Original vampires''', in the universe of ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', are a family of vampires from which all current vampires descend, as well as being the most powerful and indestructible of their kind. In Autumn 1001 AD,&lt;ref&gt;"For The Next Millennium"&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of her youngest son Henrik at the hands of [[werewolves]], the powerful [[witch]] [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Esther|Esther]] performed an occult blood ritual in order to protect her five remaining children—([[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Finn Mikaelson|Finn]], [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Elijah|Elijah]], [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Klaus Mikaelson|Niklaus]], [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Kol Mikaelson|Kol]], and [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Rebekah Mikaelson|Rebekah]])—and her husband, [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Mikael|Mikael]]. The ritual formed her family into the first vampires. Then the whole family  scattered  across the world.

==Family history==
The family comes from 10th century [[Viking]]-era&lt;ref name=Picktainment&gt;{{cite web|title=How Did the "Original Vampires" Come to Be? The Vampire Diaries Recap - "Ordinary People"|url=http://www.picktainment.com/blog/2011/11/vampire-diaries-recap-ordinary-people/|publisher=Picktainment|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe, from the [[Norway#Viking Age|Kingdom of Norway]] where a young [[witch]] named Esther and her sister Dahlia were captured by Viking raiders. They were the only survivors and were kept alive so Dahlia could aid them by using her witchcraft. Esther was allowed to live freely. She turned her back on her magical heritage to marry Mikael, a wealthy landowner and powerful Viking warrior. She and her sister Dahlia, who since childhood had been her best friend, had sworn an oath to protect each other always and forever. They used to hum the song of the starlings together. Dahlia was distraught that Esther would rather lay with their captors than escape with her, as she lived like a slave. A year later Esther discovers she is barren, and her desire for children ended in failure. Desperate, Esther turned for help to her sister. Dahlia performed the ritual at a high price, and Esther became fertile. She gave birth to a daughter named Freya, who was quickly followed by a boy named Finn. By the time they left the Old World for the [[New World]], Esther was pregnant with their third child, a boy named Elijah. Mikael was a good husband and a doting father, who adored his children but especially loved his daughter Freya. However, during Esther's third pregnancy and while Mikael was away, Dahlia came to collect her price; the first child of the first generation, just as Esther had promised. She had also promised that she would give up every first child for every generation to come. Dahlia took Freya, and Esther lied to Mikael, telling him their daughter died of the plague and that she burned the body to stop its spread.

Not wanting to lose any other children to Dahlia, Mikael and Esther, along with Finn, unborn Elijah, and Esther's friend and [[mentor]] Ayana, left [[Europe]] for the [[Americas]], where several Viking colonies already existed. There, they settled in a village on the location of the future town of Mystic Falls in [[Virginia]]. Their neighbours were powerful [[werewolf]] warriors, and they quickly became a part of the society. Mikael became a fierce warrior who helped the werewolves in battle while Ayana became the village healer and taught Esther how to use her magic. Esther quickly became a very powerful witch, even considered by some as being the most powerful of her time. However, the loss of Freya had badly hurt Mikael, and he grew distant from his wife. Eventually, Esther took a liking to the young werewolf leader of the village, Ansel. The two begun an affair, as Mikael still neglected Esther. Esther eventually became pregnant with Ansel's child; and, realizing what Mikael would do to them if he ever found out, she returned to her husband. When she gave birth to a third boy, Niklaus, it renewed his hope for a family. Three more children would be born to Mikael and Esther; two sons, Kol and Henrik, and a daughter, Rebekah. However, Mikael had become harsher as a result of Freya's loss. While he loved his children he wanted them to be fierce warriors, and his children came to fear him. To prevent Mikael from finding out her wedlock son's nature, Esther gave Klaus a cursed pendant, which weakened him and prevented him from triggering his curse. This led him to be viewed badly by Mikael, and he suffered the brunt of his violence. Esther also forbade Ansel from seeing their son; but the werewolf remained close, knowing that Klaus would one day trigger his curse and need him. Despite Mikael's contempt for Klaus, the family was a close one. When Klaus was abused Esther taught him to hum a song, sung by the starlings she'd brought to the new world long ago, the song that her sister Dahlia and she used to hum.

However, the family's happiness came to an end when Klaus and Henrik, fascinated by the werewolves, snuck out of the caves to see them turn on the full moon, which was forbidden by their village's laws. Henrik was killed by the turned wolves. Desperate to protect their remaining children but refusing to run again, Mikael and Esther planned to use magic to prevent them from being hurt. Mikael had Esther turn him and their children into beings faster and stronger than werewolves, with their own fangs to attack, and heightened senses, and unable to be truly killed. Esther, upon her husband's request, called on the power of the sun for life, and the ancient white oak tree for immortality to make her children stronger and immortal while also using the magically spelled blood of a [[doppelganger]] to allow them to be reborn as a powerful new species. Mikael and his five remaining children turned while Esther remained a witch. However, for every new strength, a weakness plagued them, the sun that granted life would burn them and keep them inside until dark, vervain that grew on the white oak tree could burn them and prevent mind compulsion, while neighbors who had once invited them into their homes could now keep them out unless they are invited, and wood from the white oak tree is the one thing that can take their immortal lives away, by killing them. The worst of the weaknesses was the terrible hunger for blood (as the thing that had made them vampires, it was the thing they craved above all else). They had become the first of the vampire. In their hunger, they massacred half of their village. When Klaus made his first human kill, he triggered his werewolf curse, revealing his mother's infidelity. In his rage, Mikael slaughtered half the village before killing Ansel himself. He then forced his wife to suppress Klaus's werewolf side by using the blood of the doppelganger. Furious at his mother's betrayal, Klaus killed her and blamed his step-father for her death. Mikael fled from their village in his rage, followed by Finn and Kol. After burying their mother, Elijah, Klaus and Rebekah also left their hometown.

Despite originating in 10th century [[Christianization of Scandinavia|pre-Christianized]] Norway, most members of the family (all but Freya, Finn, Kol, and Henrik) carry non-Scandinavian names. The rest, apart from Niklaus, carry biblical Hebrew names: Mikael, Esther, Elijah, and Rebekah. The name Mikaelson, or any variants, would likely be [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in 10th century Norway.

==Members of the Mikaelson family==

===Mikael===
Mikael is the [[patriarch]] of the Mikaelson family. He is portrayed by [[Sebastian Roché]].

Mikael was searching for Klaus and the rest of his family for a thousand years.&lt;ref name="MSN Social Entertainment"&gt;{{cite web|title='Vampire Diaries' Talking Points: The Dead Return|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/tv/blogs/tv-buzz-blogpost.aspx?post=582fdeaf-023e-4ae6-8ab2-e3901888d699|publisher=MSN|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He desired to kill Klaus, in order to get revenge for the murder of his wife and him being framed for it. He always had a bad relationship with Klaus, but caring enough to save him by turning him into a vampire but otherwise being hard on him when he was growing up. Unlike the rest of children who fell inline, Klaus was the black sheep of the family and acted differently, this was because he was the product of an affair Klaus' mother had with a werewolf. As such, Mikael was condescending, cold and abusive towards Klaus for no apparent reason, though Mikael tried to justify this by claiming he was trying to toughen Klaus up. This treatment contributed greatly to Klaus' narcissism, hunger for power, paranoia and psychosis.

Mikael was imprisoned in a coffin by [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Bonnie Bennett|Bonnie]]'s mother [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Abby Bennett|Abby]], when he came to Mystic Falls looking for Elena when she was a small child. He wanted to kill the [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Katherine Pierce|Petrova]] doppelgänger in order to prevent Klaus from breaking the curse and creating a hybrid army. [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Katherine Pierce|Katherine]] awoke him in order to get information on how to kill Klaus.

Klaus eventually killed Mikael using the white oak stake after being saved by Stefan.

When the Original Vampires throw a ball in order to introduce themselves to the Mystic Falls community, they use the last name "Mikaelson", as a tribute to the patriarch.&lt;ref name="Wet Paint"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wet Paint|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/the-vampire-diaries/articles/the-vampire-diaries-recap-of-season-3-episode-14-dangerous-liaisons-one-for-all-all-for-one|publisher=Wet Paint|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Klaus also refers to himself as Mikaelson, despite his deep resentment of Mikael.

Mikael's ghost appears in New Orleans and convinces Davina to resurrect him, which is successful but found himself bound to Davina via a mystical bracelet or at least until Kol Mikaelson released him while Davina was knocked out.

Mikael is the oldest of the Original Family and considered the strongest and most powerful vampire in existence, although after Klaus breaks the sun and moon curse and became a hybrid it is likely that margin was somewhat narrowed, given they faced each other twice after that and Klaus prevails in the first encounter and gains the upper hand in the second only to be thwarted in an attempt to save Camille.

Klaus kills Mikael a second time in a surprise attempt to use his Viking ashes for a spell to defeat his Aunt Dahlia.

===Esther===
Esther is the [[matriarch]] of the Mikaelson family. She is portrayed by a British actress [[Alice Evans]] in ''The Vampire Diaries'' and was played by [[Natalie Dreyfuss]] in ''The Originals'' while possessing Cassie's body. She was played by [[Sonja Sohn]] while possessing Lenore's body. She was stuck in Lenore's body as a vampire.

She was not a vampire, but was a powerful witch. She was the apprentice of a very powerful Bennett witch, Ayanna, during her first years in the New World. Esther was responsible for turning her family into vampires. She did so by summoning life from the sun and immortality from a [[Quercus alba|white oak tree]], then making them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them.

She was referred to as "The Original Witch",&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|title='''The Vampire Diaries''' Recap: Klaus Finds Forgiveness|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/crystal-bell/vampire-diaries-recap_b_1251232.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she was not the first witch in the world. This was a reference to the fact that she was the witch who was a part of the Original Family.

Esther was murdered by Klaus in the early 11th century, because she used her powers, and those of some other fellow witches, to suppress his werewolf abilities and bind them to the moonstone through the use of a curse, and for making him the target of Mikael's hatred through her affair. Esther comes back to life in the 21st century, when she was awakened by Bonnie and Abby Bennett. Esther tries to kill all of her vampire children, whom she now believes to be abominations after seeing the violence that they embody. She obtains the help of her son Finn, who becomes willing to be sacrificed in order to end the pain that his siblings bring to the world. Esther also seeks the help of Bonnie Bennett and her mother Abby (descendants of the powerful ancient witch Ayanna) by channeling them and their bloodline, in order to gain more power to perform the spell that will kill her children. However, Esther's son Elijah finds out about the plan, and teams up with his siblings to force the Salvatore brothers to prevent his mother from killing the family by kidnapping Elena and threatening to kill her if the Salvatores do not stop Esther's endeavors. Damon ends up turning Bonnie's mother into a vampire, which ends her witch abilities and thus destroys the spell. Esther then flees from Mystic Falls to avoid her family.

In the season three episode, "Heart of Darkness", Esther returns to Mystic Falls. She tells Rebekah that she was dying, and wanted to see her daughter one last time; however, she had ulterior motives for returning. She grabs Rebekah's hands, and performs a spell in order to switch bodies with Rebekah, using her as a cover for safety. Esther was desperate to stay safe from Klaus and her other Original Vampire children who want her dead after learning of her plans to kill them all and ending the vampire race. After she returns to her own body, she was killed by Alaric's normal self, but not before she successfully performs the ritual on his dark side, and her body was put back into its coffin by Klaus.

Esther's remains are consecrated in New Orleans and as a result, she becomes a New Orleans witch, a witch that has or can use the collective power of all the dead New Orleans witches. She eventually becomes the leader of the Ancestors, the spirits of the dead witches who give their power to the living witches.

===Freya Mikaelson===
She is portrayed by an American-Canadian actress [[Riley Voelkel]].

Mikael and Esther's firstborn child was a daughter. It was originally believed that she died in Europe at a very young age as the result of a plague that had struck their homeland. In reality, Esther's sister Dahlia took the child (and all firstborns from Esther's bloodline) as the price for the magic used to allow Esther to bear children. Esther lies to Mikael, and Freya's supposed death is what caused Mikael and Esther to move to a village in a "mystical land" far away in the New World, which was later called Mystic Falls.

Dahlia took Freya and taught her many of her secrets and, over the years, she became a very powerful witch. Eventually, Dahlia cast a spell on both of them which would provide them with "the next best thing" to immortality: they would slumber for one hundred years before waking for a year of aging. Eventually, Freya escaped from Dahlia, later telling her brothers, Klaus and Elijah, that it hadn't been easy and that she had lost something in the process. Freya hid from Dahlia's wrath and, eventually, ended up in New Orleans where she wanted to meet her family. Invited to a party thrown by her brothers and her sister as her brother Kol's date, she witnessed Klaus daggering Kol. As his date, she was imprisoned in a cottage which had become an asylum for mad witches since Klaus had a spell placed on it which prevented witches from leaving. Once inside the asylum, Freya returned to her slumber, remaining as such for a hundred years.

As her slumber came to an end, Freya discovered that her sister, Rebekah, had been imprisoned in the asylum when her spirit was placed in a witch body by a vengeful Kol. Pretending to be another inmate, she finally met her sister properly, admiring her bravery when she stood up to the Kindred witches who ran the asylum. Later, when Rebekah planned to draw on Freya (not knowing she was her sister) to break the spell on the asylum, the Kindred tried to stop her but Freya arrived and easily dispatched the Kindred with her magic before breaking the spell that contained the witches. Revealing her true identity to Rebekah, she told her that she would soon come to see their brothers. The first of them she met was her brother Finn, whom she had been close to as a child. Revealing what had happened to her after the kidnapping, Freya also learnt that her younger brother, Klaus, had fathered a daughter, something that would draw Dahlia once she found out. Helping Finn to kill Hope, she cast a spell to protect her brother for his upcoming confrontation with Elijah, who was protecting Hope. She later brought Finn back thanks to her spell when he was killed by Elijah. She also told him that, once Hope started doing magic, Dahlia would sense it and come for what was hers.

Sometime afterwards, once Finn was strong enough, Freya asked him to take her to Mikael, their father, who Finn had been using as a sacrificial power source in his battle with their brothers. Although Mikael was sceptical at first, he eventually recognized his long-lost daughter, and father and daughter happily reunited. Telling Mikael about the truth behind her disappearance and the threat posed by Dahlia, Freya then met with her brothers Klaus and Elijah, who had confronted Finn in the City of the Dead. Removing Finn's spirit from his host and placing him in her pendant, Freya told her brothers that Hope had nothing to fear from her or from Finn now that he was neutralized. She then told them that they needed to ally if they wanted to stop Dahlia, who was far more powerful than any witch they had ever come across. Although Klaus refused her help, especially when he learnt of her alliance with Mikael, Elijah was willing to hear her out and even ally with her but he told her that he did not trust her. Freya hoped that she would be able to one day win her younger brother's trust.

Freya is one of the most powerful witches to ever walk the earth, along with Dahlia, her niece Hope and her mother Esther. However, Hope's power seems even greater than Freya's and Esther's, as she is capable of accomplishing feats even Esther and Freya could not. Even Rebekah, whose knowledge of magic was quite limited, knew that Freya was far more powerful than any other witch she had encountered. Freya knew and mastered a vast number of spells and could accomplish them at a greater degree than other witches; namely, she could locate someone despite them being protected by a cloaking spell. She could also use her magic in a fight, something that not even a Harvest witch like Davina can do.

===Finn Mikaelson===
He is portrayed by a British actor [[Casper Zafer]] and was played by American actor [[Yusuf Gatewood]] while possessing Vincent Griffith's body.

Finn is Mikael and Esther's second born child and was the oldest living Mikaelson family member (he was also the only person to know the truth of Freya's "death," as he was there), until his elder sister Freya woke up. He is shown to be even more noble and moral than Elijah, but is more distant to his siblings since he views them as monsters. Finn once had a loving relationship with his siblings, but that changed after they became vampires, and after seeing how they acted he emotionally distanced himself. He still cared about them enough that he stayed with them but held a judgemental attitude towards them, especially Niklaus, whose relationship with Finn became hostile. This made Klaus decide to leave the White Oak Ash Dagger in Finn after The Brotherhood of the Five attacked them. However 900 years later, after Elijah un-daggered him, he conspired with Esther to link all the remaining Original Vampires so they could all be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Picktainment2&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vampire Diaries Recap- "Break on Through"|url=http://www.picktainment.com/blog/2012/03/vampire-diaries-break-on-throug/|publisher=Picktainment|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finn was responsible for turning the 900-year-old vampire, Sage, with whom he is in love.&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries,' Season 3, Episode 18, 'The Murder of One': TV Recap|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/03/29/the-vampire-diaries-season-3-episode-18-the-murder-of-one-tv-recap/?mod=google_news_blog|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sage and Finn reunite shortly before his death.

He is killed in the season 3 episode "The Murder of One", when Stefan, Elena and Matt kill him, thinking that it will kill all of the Originals due to their "linked" status.&lt;ref name="The Celebrity Cafe"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries' Recap: 'The Murder of One'|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/2012/03/vampire-diaries-recap-murder-one|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Klaus manages to force Bonnie into unlinking the siblings moments before Finn is killed. It is revealed through Finn's death that when an Original dies, all vampires of his or her bloodline die as well.&lt;ref name="The Celebrity Cafe"/&gt;

As was revealed in the season finale of ''The Originals'', Finn returns along with his mother Esther and brother Kol in another body of a male witch named Vincent.

===Elijah Mikaelson===
He is portrayed by New Zealand actor [[Daniel Gillies]]

Elijah first appears in episode eight of season two, entitled "Rose". Elijah is brought into the circle by two vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals if they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppelgänger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the ritual required to become a vampire/werewolf Hybrid. They were subsequently hunted by Klaus and Elijah for centuries.

Elijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, a former doppelgänger he was in love with), and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee. Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise.

Elena is rescued by the Salvatore brothers not long after Elijah kills Trevor, who had betrayed Elijah in the past by helping Katerina escape. The Salvatores attack Elijah and succeed in staking him; however, he comes back to life at the end of the episode because he is an Original Vampire who can not be killed by any wooden stake. Only wood from the ancient White Oak Tree, which his family burned when they became vampires, can kill Originals. Elijah then works with a witch to locate Elena.

The witch is able to locate her, so he goes to Mystic Falls to confront her, where he ends up saving her from a group of vampires who also wanted to take Elena. It is revealed that those vampires wanted to hand her over to Klaus. When Elijah discovers this, he makes peace with Elena and her friends, because he wants to use Elena as bait to draw out Klaus and kill him. He thus makes a deal with Elena that if she helps him kill Klaus, he will leave her family and her friends alone and keep them safe. However, he intends for Elena to be successfully sacrificed, as once Klaus breaks the curse and starts transforming, he will be left vulnerable enough to be killed. During a series of events, Elijah is temporarily "killed" when Elena stabs him with a mystical dagger that can kill an Original when dipped in ash from the White Oak Tree.

When Klaus comes to town, Elena un-daggers Elijah because she needs his help, and he then reveals to her his family's history, and the fact that Klaus killed the rest of his siblings. Elijah thus at first tries to help Elena and her friends kill Klaus, but ends up saving him instead in the Season 2 finale episode, because Klaus promises to take Elijah to their family (Elijah had assumed Klaus had hidden their "dead" bodies deep in the ocean) if Elijah spares him. In season two's finale however, it is revealed that Klaus double-crossed Elijah once again, and daggered him to keep him close to him, like the rest of his daggered siblings.

Damon undaggers Elijah later in season 3 to help him find a way to kill Klaus. When Elijah awakes, he undaggers the rest of his siblings who were located in similar coffins in the same room. They begin to plot their revenge against Klaus; however, before they can make their move, their mother Esther, thought to be dead, reappears and convinces the siblings to be a family again [which later turns out to be a front for her true motives; she wants to link her children's lives together and kill one of them to kill the rest, rendering vampires extinct].

After Elijah foils his mother's plans to kill him and his siblings, he leaves Mystic Falls a tortured soul, ashamed of his own barbaric actions and those of his family's. He is shown to be one of the most sophisticated and peaceful of the Original siblings, alongside his older brother Finn. He is the most compromising regarding Elena and her friends. Elijah and Elena develop a sort of understanding, and Elena comes to be fond of Elijah's company. She thus feels especially betrayed when earlier Elijah threatened to allow Rebekah to kill Elena if the Salvatore brothers are not able to stop Esther Mikaelson from killing the Original Family. However, in the 18th episode of season 3, Elena professes that she hopes that her vampire friends are descended from Elijah's bloodline, so that he can be spared. Elijah returns to town in the season three finale episode, "The Departed", in order to make a deal with Elena and her friends. Elijah proposes that he be allowed to take Klaus's desiccated (by witch Bonnie and help from the Salvatores and Tyler) body with him and his siblings and leave town, and in exchange, he would make sure that Klaus would not be resurrected within Elena's lifetime or even that of her children, stating: "perhaps that will teach him some manners". However, Klaus is staked, and Elijah and Rebekah believe him to be dead, even though Klaus actually possessed Tyler Lockwood's body and lives on.

In season four, Elijah reappears as Katherine's lover, and is making a deal with Katherine for her to be granted her freedom from Klaus in exchange for the cure for immortality, which Klaus wants to give to Silas, the world's first and most dangerous immortal being, to avoid Silas' psychic torture. Elijah refuses Klaus the cure for Rebekah to take before Silas re-claims it, denying Katherine's freedom. Elijah breaks up with Katherine when he learns Klaus has fathered a child and returns to New Orleans to keep Klaus' unborn baby safe and help his brother.

He follows his brother Klaus to New Orleans and finds out that Hayley is pregnant with Klaus' child. He begins to have feelings for Hayley and throughout 'The Originals' the two make their feelings for each other clear. When Esther returns, she reveals the truth about how Elijah's first love, Tatia, was killed, proving it was in fact himself who had fed on her when they had newly been vampires. During one of Finn's spells Elijah is trapped in a room with animal heads which represent each brother of the family. To escape, Elijah discovers you must ruin the representation of each other, thus causing him to share with Klaus that he killed Tatia. When Klaus proves he is capable of forgiveness the spell is broken and they are free.

===Niklaus Mikaelson===
Niklaus Mikaelson (more commonly called Klaus) is physically the most powerful immortal supernatural being in ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' and ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'' universe. He is shown to be cruel, sadistic, ruthless. He's  portrayed by British actor [[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]]. After the Original couple moved to the Americas, Klaus's mother had an affair with a member of the neighboring werewolf tribe. Klaus was born as a result. The mother's [[infidelity]] was later revealed. His illegitimate birth as well as his perceived weaknesses made him the target of his step-father's ruthless hatred, emotional neglect, abuse, and contempt.

When Esther turned the family into vampires, Klaus's blood-lust became particularly strong and he transitioned into a hybrid after his first kill, due to his werewolf gene. Esther later bound his werewolf powers to the moonstone, due to her believing that his hybrid status made him an abomination. In order to obtain his werewolf abilities, Klaus had to perform a ritual in which a werewolf, a vampire and a Petrova doppelganger had to be sacrificed. Klaus first hunted Katerina Petrova, later known as Katherine Pierce, who was from the line of supernatural Petrova doppelgangers. In order to avoid being sacrificed by Klaus and allowing him to gain his werewolf powers, Katerina drinks the blood of a vampire and then kills herself in order to transition into a vampire. She then becomes useless to Klaus because his ritual requires a human doppelganger. Katherine subsequently spends centuries on the run from Klaus, who is enraged at her actions. As a result, Klaus kills her entire family and continues to hunt her obsessively.

Continuing his quest to release his werewolf abilities, Klaus compels Isobel Saltzman to locate the latest Petrova [[doppelganger]], Elena Gilbert, her own daughter. Klaus is then able to perform the ritual. He sacrifices Tyler Lockwood's werewolf friend, Jules, and turns Jenna Sommers into a vampire before killing her. Finally, Klaus drains Elena of blood (though she lives thanks to a ritualistic sacrifice made by her biological father, [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#John Gilbert|John Gilbert]]) and thus completes the ritual, becoming a fully functional vampire-werewolf hybrid.

A major plot line of the show is Klaus' quest to create a hybrid army. Klaus can only [[Sire (vampire)|sire]] other hybrids by using the blood of the supernatural [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Katherine Pierce|Petrova]] doppelgänger, [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Elena Gilbert|Elena Gilbert]]. Thus, he is often a threat to Elena and is a major kill target for the Salvatore brothers.

At one point, Klaus blackmails Stefan into helping him create more hybrids, by threatening to kill his brother Damon. Klaus forces Stefan to return to his old, deadly ways, and returns Stefan to the Salvatores' former sociopathic persona, known as "The Ripper".&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries' recap: Stefan the Ripper|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/vampire-diaries-season-3-episode-3/|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Klaus discovers that he needs Elena's blood to create his hybrid army, he sends Stefan back to Mystic Falls to keep an eye on her, but also forces Stefan to turn off his emotions (an ability that all vampires have). Tyler Lockwood ends up becoming Klaus' first successful hybridized victim.

It's also revealed that Klaus murdered his own mother, because she suppressed his werewolf powers through a curse, and because he blames her for making him the target of Mikael's hatred by her conception of him through an affair. When his half-sister Rebekah learns of this, she initially disowns him. However, when Elena's friends release Klaus's family from their coffins, Rebekah forgives him, though only after their mother convinces them that she wants them to reunite as a family.

Glimpses of his humanity can also be seen in regard to his half-siblings, such as when he saves his half-sister's life when Kol was about to stab her with the white oak stake, in spite of the fact that he had previously disowned her and the two were at odds, or when he became infuriated over his half-brother Kol's death. There are also small instances when it's revealed how deeply he cares for his unborn child, and even the child's mother Hayley.

In the season three episode, "Before Sunset", Klaus is temporarily "killed" by the Salvatores and Tyler Lockwood.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries' recap: 'Before Sunset'|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bthesite/tv-lust/bal-the-vampire-diaries-recap-episode-21-before-sunset-20120504,0,3553286.story|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to kill Elena by draining her of all her blood in order to kill two birds with one stone; (1) have a supply of her blood with which to create a hybrid army, (2) kill the vampire form of the vampire-hating Alaric Saltzman, who desires to kill Klaus, all other vampires and whose life is tied to Elena's by the witch Esther. Subsequently, Elena's friends neutralize Klaus in order to protect her. Instead of staking him, which could potentially kill them all (see "Mythology" section), the Salavatore brothers use Bonnie's magic and a dark spell to stop Klaus' heart, which "[[Desiccation|desiccates]]"&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"/&gt; him and leaves him immobile and starved of blood, and thus in a seemingly "dead" state. A similar spell was performed on Klaus's step-father, Mikael, by Bonnie's mother, Abby Bennett.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"/&gt; In the season three finale episode "The Departed", Klaus is staked in his coffin by the vampire form of Alaric Saltzman and subsequently, his body burns to ashes, (see "Mythology" section). However, Klaus lives on by switching bodies with Tyler Lockwood, through a spell which Bonnie Bennett performs.&lt;ref name="E! Online"/&gt;

In "Bring It On" Klaus sleeps with Hayley Marshall and provides her with information in regards to her family, because he noticed a crescent moon shaped birthmark on her shoulder.

In "The Originals", the backdoor pilot for the spin-off show, Klaus is told by a group of witches, who are blackmailing him, that Hayley is carrying his child. They threaten to kill the child and Hayley if he doesn't. Klaus decides he wants this child, so he vows to protect Hayley and their unborn child, whatever it takes.


As the Original Vampire-Werewolf Hybrid, Klaus is the strongest of the original vampires, despite not being the eldest, he grows stronger and faster with age due to his vampirism and when he is using his lycanthrope enhancement, also increase in strength when enraged; due to his werewolf side.

In Klaus's confrontations against the-then Enhanced Original Vampire Alaric Saltzman, his step-father Mikael, and the Upgraded Original Vampires Lucien Castle and Marcel Gerard respectively, the latters' are apparently proven to be physically stronger than Klaus, however, it should be noted in each of these confrontations, the Original Hybrid never truly used his full strength, as his physical attributes (such as strength and speed) are at their peaks when he is fully transformed into his werewolf form.

Although stronger than his Original Vampire maternal half-siblings due to his werewolf heritage, some of his half-siblings have been shown to be able to fight with him almost equal terms; not enough to actually defeat Klaus, as the latter always quickly turns the tables on his half-siblings in the end.

His supernatural and physical attributes aside, Klaus' greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time and surpasses Elijah's penchant for strategies and forming contingencies; as he has outsmarted Elijah on several occasions and rarely is outsmarted by the latter. According to Dahlia, Klaus is the most intelligent of his maternal half-siblings.

===Kol Mikaelson===
Kol is the youngest surviving son of the Original Family, since the death of his younger brother Henrik and the second youngest child still living, being older than Rebekah. He is portrayed by Australian actor [[Nathaniel Buzolic]] and was played by British actor [[Daniel Sharman]] while possessing Kaleb's body.

He tries to kill Matt Donovan for entertainment during the Originals' family ball, but is stopped by Damon Salvatore.&lt;ref name=Zap2It&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries' recap: In which Elena is starting to get on our nerves|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/02/the-vampire-diaries-recap-are-you-suggesting-i-cant-be-gentle.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215072514/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/02/the-vampire-diaries-recap-are-you-suggesting-i-cant-be-gentle.html|archivedate=15 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season three episode, "Heart of Darkness", Kol appears in Denver, Colorado, where Elena and Damon had sent Jeremy, to get him away from Mystic Falls and protect his life. He threatens to hurt Jeremy, in order to prevent Elena and Damon from trying to find out the history of Damon's blood line; (if they managed to do so, they might find out that Elena's friends are not descended from Kol, which would allow them to kill him—see "Mythology" section). Damon drives a baseball bat through Kol's body in order to debilitate him so that he, Elena, and Jeremy can escape. Kol later appears at the house of Mary Porter, the vampire who sired [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Guest stars|Rose]]. Kol kills Mary, so that she is not able to tell Elena and Damon about the history of her bloodline, which could lead them to find out which Original vampire Damon, Stefan, Caroline and Abby Bennett are descended from; Mary sired Rose, Katherine Pierce forced Rose to sire her, and Katherine later sired Damon and Stefan.

In season four, Kol returns to aid Rebekah in finding the rumoured "cure" for vampirism. He tortures Professor Shane, who supposedly knows how to get the cure. When Kol realizes that Shane plans to release Silas, the first and most dangerous immortal being of all time, Kol stabs Shane through the torso with a wooden object, killing him. However, Bonnie is able to save Shane's life through an "expression", or dark magic spell.

Kol compels Damon to kill Jeremy so that they cannot find Silas, but Stefan locks Damon away so that he cannot. Elena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete.

Elena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena corners him and showers him in water mixed with vervain. Jeremy stabs Kol with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching furiously in the doorway, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved.

Kol returned in the season four episode "The Walking Dead", along with several deceased characters as ghosts, longing for revenge against their killers and the residents of Mystic Falls. He clashes once more Matt Donovan, wounding him by throwing a glass bottle at his shoulder and taunting his sister, angered at her brief grieving period, before proceeding to attack Elena, grieving for her brother at his grave. His neck is snapped by Stefan before he managed to kill Elena, however appears in the next episode, "Graduation", threatening Bonnie into completely destroying the veil so he could return to life. Bonnie plays along with his plan, however deceives him by luring him into a trap, so he can't cause any more harm until the veil is returned.

Kol later appears to Matt Donovan while Matt is temporarily trapped on the Other Side. After Matt witnesses his sister Vicky being sucked into oblivion, Kol reveals that the Other Side is unraveling, slowly taking one spirit after the other. Soon, every spirit of the supernatural kind will be gone. Kol begs Matt for his help, before he, too, will be swept away. However, upon awaking, Matt doesn't remember. Soon, the Other Side completely disintegrates, and Kol's fate is left unknown.

Some time later in season 2 of ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', a young man named Kaleb appears in New Orleans, flirting with the young but powerful witch Davina Claire. He later meets up with Cassie and Vincent, two witches whose bodies have been taken over by Esther and Finn. It's revealed that Kaleb is actually Kol, having taken possession of a body as well. Kol continues his relationship with Davina Claire, originally because his mother told him to but develops feelings for her. He chooses to side with Davina over his mother Esther who he helps stop along with his siblings. However, this leads to his brother Finn casting a spell on him which eventually kills him, leaving Davina heartbroken. In season 3 Davina works to resurrect Kol which she succeeds in doing by aligning herself with the Strix to get the power she needed. Kol is later resurrected by Davina through the energy that was used in un-siring Klaus.

===Rebekah Mikaelson===

Rebekah is currently the youngest member of the original family since Henrik died over a thousand years ago. She is portrayed by Australian actress [[Claire Holt]] and was played by British actress [[Maisie Richardson-Sellers]] while possessing Eva Sinclair's body. 
 
She and her living siblings, Elijah, Finn, Klaus and Kol were turned into vampires by their parents, Esther and Mikael Mikaelson. They made them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them. Esther, their mother who is an original witch, performed a spell using white oak ash for eternal life. When they woke, their father forced them to drink human blood. With the intention of turning them into vampires was so that they could survive in their village and to be stronger, faster and even more vigilant than the werewolves, who killed their youngest brother. However, the great hunger and lust for blood was a bad effect that their parents didn't plan on. Vervain, a plant by the white oak tree, burned them as did sunlight, which caused them to be forced to wear daylight rings or necklaces. The only thing that can really kill an Original is a stake made of the actual white oak tree used to turn them, while a dagger dipped in the ash of the white oak can place them in a deathlike trance until the dagger is pulled out.

Rebekah shares a deep bond with her brother Klaus, and was the only family member that remained loyal to him throughout his vicious behavior. Klaus thus kept her by his side, while he kept the rest of his family daggered and stored in coffins for hundreds of years.

She had a romantic interest in Stefan Salvatore during their encounters in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Crush (MTV)"&gt;{{cite web|title='The Vampire Diaries' Recap: 'The End of The Affair'|url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/09/30/vampire-diaries-recap-the-end-of-the-affair/|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time period, Klaus and Rebekah are once again forced to go on the run after the arrival of their vengeful father Mikael. Consequently, Rebekah professes an interest to stop running and desires to live a stable life with Stefan by her side. Klaus forces her to choose between himself and Stefan. She chooses the latter, leading Klaus to dagger her. He brings her back to life shortly thereafter, in order to obtain her necklace, which was originally Esther's. The same necklace is gifted to Elena by Stefan during the series first season. Rebekah and Klaus thus head to Mystic Falls. Rebekah develops a deep hatred and envy of Elena, and continually tries to hurt, kill, and emotionally distress her, until her brother makes her stop. Later on, Rebekah tries to be Elena's friend and helps with her and her friends' plan to kill Klaus once she found out he killed her mother, but is betrayed, and daggered by Elena, to simplify the Salvatore's plan to killing Klaus. In season three, Klaus makes Elena reveal Rebekah's location, and takes her body with him. She is eventually un-daggered by Elijah.

During her time in Mystic Falls, Rebekah enrolls at the local high school, much to the disgust of Elena and her friends. There, she at first makes romantic advances towards Tyler Lockwood, Caroline Forbes' boyfriend. She later develops a fondness for Matt Donovan, and invites him to her family's ball.

Rebekah is shown to be lonely and insecure, though she hides this by being cruel and violent. This is demonstrated quite well through her sexual rendezvouses with Damon Salvatore, an enemy of her family, and the subsequent torture she makes him endure after being betrayed and used by him.&lt;ref name="The Celebrity Cafe"/&gt;

Her mother Esther comes back and tells Rebekah and her siblings she wants them to unite and become a family again. However, she really came to kill them all by linking them with a spell that would cause each sibling to die only by killing one of them. Klaus forces Bonnie to undo the spell, but Elena, the Salvatore's and others kill Finn, Rebekah's brother.

Rebekkah's body is temporarily taken over by her witch mother, Esther, through a spell which Esther performs. She invades Rebekah's body in order to be able to go unnoticed while scheming to kill all of her Original children (who are out for her blood, ever since they discovered that she tried to kill them by a blood-linking spell at the family ball). Esther later leaves Rebekah's body and stakes her; however, Klaus restores Rebekah by removing the stake.

Rebekah supposedly leaves Mystic Falls in the season three episode "Before Sunset", in order to avoid the vampiric version of Alaric Saltzman, who wants to kill her and all other vampires.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"/&gt; However, she then returns to Mystic Falls after witnessing the supposed "death" of her brother. Grief-stricken, she decides to kill Elena, therefore killing Alaric and taking away the last threat to her and her family therefore saving her family. She causes both Elena and Matt Donovan to drive off of the Wickery Bridge and into the lake to drown, and Elena dies, along with Alaric. However, Elena had vampire blood in her system, something Rebekah was unaware of.

In season four, Rebekah is yet again daggered by Klaus, after he believes she will be an obstacle in finding The Cure. However, she is then un-daggered by April Young, and sets upon finding it herself. After developing a 'no strings attached' relationship with Stefan, she reveals she wants to be human, feeling miserable as a vampire.

In season two of ''The Originals'', after Klaus's child is born she returns to New Orleans and is named the caretaker of Klaus's child. She promises to get a strong witch to protect her and her niece from Esther, who wants to kill the baby
In season 3 Rebekah makes a return.

===Henrik Mikaelson===
Henrik was the child of Esther and Mikael. He was killed by werewolves a thousand years ago, before the family had been turned into vampires.&lt;ref name="Heroine TV"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE VAMPIRE DIARIES: "Dangerous Liaisons"|url=http://www.heroinetv.com/2012/02/16/the-vampire-diaries-dangerous-liaisons/|publisher=Heroine TV|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed by Devon Allowitz in season three.

His death created a war between the werewolf [[clan]] and his own family, causing his mother to turn the family into vampires, so they could defend themselves against the [[werewolf|lycanthropic]] beasts.

===Hope Mikaelson===
Hope is portrayed by Alexandria and Victoria Collins in "Rebirth", later by toddlers in seasons 2 and 3, by Summer Fontana in season 4,&lt;ref name="Fontana"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Swift|url=http://tvline.com/2016/07/28/the-originals-spoilers-new-hope-cast-season-4/|title=The Originals Season 4: Meet the Actress Playing Grown-Up Hope|work=TVLine|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Danielle Rose Russell]] in season 5 and the Hope-centric spin-off series ''[[Legacies (TV series)|Legacies]]''.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web|author=Samantha Highfill|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/17/the-originals-danielle-rose-russell-hope-season-5/|title=''The Originals'' casts Danielle Rose Russell as teenage Hope for season 5|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 17, 2017|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope Andrea Mikaelson is the daughter of Klaus and the former-werewolf Hayley Marshall. Hope is the result of a one-night stand between her parents, and after her birth her family agreed to fake her death to protect her from all those who wish her harm. Klaus, after promising to get Hope back one day, gives her to the only person he can trust to protect and raise his daughter: his sister, Rebekah. Hope is returned to her parents later in Season 2.
 
Hope is extremely powerful who, apart from being a vampire-werewolf hybrid, is also a witch of the Mikaelson bloodline which is one of the most powerful witch lineages in the fictional world of ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]''. Moreover, her vampire lineage is that of an Original, making her almost invincible and more powerful than average vampires. Her werewolf heritage is that of an alpha, through Hayley, making her royalty among the werewolves as the Princess of the Crescent pack.

At the end of season 4, Hope is sent to Mystic Falls to study magic at the Salvatore Boarding School, which provides the premise for ''[[Legacies (TV series)|Legacies]]''.

===Dahlia===
She is portrayed by Australian actress [[Claudia Black]].

The sister of Esther, and first-born witch of that generation of their family, Dahlia is one of the most powerful witches in history, far more than that of her sister, already regarded as one of the most powerful. Dahlia was taken, along with Esther from her homeland, which was destroyed by the Vikings who locked her away as a slave to do magic whilst allowing Esther to roam freely. When Ester decides to marry one of their captors instead of escape with her sister and best friend, Dahlia becomes a hate-filled woman. Years later Esther discovers she is infertile and in desperation seeks out her sister. Dahlia agrees to perform a ritual that will give her fertility, if Esther agrees to give her the first-born child of every generation, all of whom, like Dahlia, would possess immense magical power. Esther obliges and Dahlia comments that she would be able to help herself if Esther hadn't given up magic. 
Years later Dahlia contacts her sister wishing to collect her fee, 5-year old Freya Mikaelson. Esther, upset, begs her sister not to take her daughter, and swears to grow in power until she is more powerful than Dahlia, claiming she did not know the love of a parent to a child when she made the deal. Dahlia commands Esther to tell Mikael that their daughter died from the bubonic plague and her body was burned.

Described by Freya as the most powerful witch she has ever seen, Dahlia first gained her enhanced powers by linking her magic to the magic possessed by her then five-year-old niece Freya. Once Freya reached adulthood, Dahlia then cast a spell that allows them both to gain pseudo-immortality by leap-frogging through time; the women were put into a magically-induced sleep for nearly a century, only to awaken for one single year of life and aging with all of the magic they accrued over their hundred-year-long slumber, before they would once again return to their sleep after the year had passed.

Dahlia's understanding of magic after so many years of study is extensive enough that she was able to create her own form of connective magic in the 10th century. She also has the ability to sense the magic of other witches, especially those of the first-born children of her and her sister Esther's bloodline, as the first-born witches of their lineage possess devastating amounts of power. According to Freya, Dahlia aims to be truly immortal without having to sleep for centuries, and she will not hesitate to come and claim the first-born Mikaelson witches to achieve this goal, even if it means destroying anyone who stands in her way.

==Mythology and powers==
Being the oldest and most powerful vampires, the Original Vampires are stronger and faster than all normal vampires, though it is implied they do not get stronger with age due to being ''created'' at the zenith of vampiric physical prowess. (Alaric was just as strong, if not stronger, than the other Original Vampires despite being a day old. So too was Lucien, strong enough to kill Finn). It is possible that the spell used to make the Original Vampires, gives them the peak powers of vampirism. Also, werewolves prove little to no challenge for them, though they can be challenging in their wolf form (where they are at their strongest) as a pack of four can defeat an Original Vampire (Rebekah) and two human form werewolves with moonrings (which allows them to use the full power of their condition) overpowered Elijah. Also, Original Vampires are somewhat immune to werewolf venom, which is fatal to normal vampires but it still affects Original Vampires, though they only experience weakness and hallucinations. Original Vampires have the power to "compel" or hypnotize ordinary vampires in addition to humans, though they cannot compel each other.&lt;ref&gt;Elijah compels Slater to drive a stake through his heart, "[[Katerina (The Vampire Diaries)|Katerina]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing can kill an Original Vampire, except for a heart-aimed [[Vampire#Methods of destruction|stake]] made only of the ancient [[Quercus alba|white oak]] tree or the immense power of a very powerful witch, though channeling that much power will also kill the witch. If an Original Vampire is stabbed by a white oak stake, he or she will die and burn to ashes. Using a silver dagger dipped in the ashes of the white oak tree will cause the Original Vampires to be neutralized as long as the dagger remains within them; however, that type of dagger would not work on Klaus due to his hybrid nature, and only a pure white oak stake could kill him. However, Davina and Kol had created a gold dagger with the ability to subdue Klaus. Other stakes temporarily disable Original Vampires, but they recuperate in hours. This was demonstrated when Elijah pulled out the wooden stake that Damon had plunged into his chest when attempting to rescue Elena from Rose and Trevor.&lt;ref&gt;Damon is able to temporarily subdue Elijah, "[[Rose (The Vampire Diaries)|Rose]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

When an Original Vampire dies, all of the vampires from his or her bloodline die as well.&lt;ref name="The Celebrity Cafe"/&gt; This is demonstrated when [[Damon Salvatore|Damon]], [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Stefan Salvatore|Stefan]], Elena and Matt kill Finn, resulting in the deaths of [[List of The Vampire Diaries characters#Sage|Sage]] and Troy, (Finn had [[Sire (vampire)|sired]] Sage and Sage had sired Troy, thus creating a blood line).&lt;ref name="The Celebrity Cafe"/&gt; Thus, if all Original Vampires were to be killed, the entire vampire species would be rendered extinct, since all the vampires in the world are descended from the Original Vampires. However, in season 3 of the Originals, Klaus and his sireline are unlinked, meaning that if Klaus were to die, his sireline would continue to live on. It is unknown if any new Vampires that Klaus sired would be linked to him, or if they would also be unlinked, it is also unknown if Klaus' sireline can be relinked to him again.

However, it is necessary for the Original Vampire's spirit to cross the veil, in order for his or her bloodline to follow suit. In the season three finale episode "The Departed", Klaus manages to switch bodies with Tyler Lockwood before being staked and lives on; thus, even though his body supposedly burnt to ashes, none of his bloodline is affected.&lt;ref name="E! Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vampire Diaries Finale Recap|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/vampire_diaries_finale_recap_elena/315327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season four it was revealed that the spell Esther used to create the Original Vampires is a variation of the spell Qetsiyah, the ancestor of her friend Ayana, used to create the immortality elixir.

Klaus, the Original hybrid, was fertile due to his werewolf nature and thus impregnates Hayley, giving him a daughter named Hope. She has only shown witch powers and presumably would be a werewolf if she killed anyone, but her blood can create hybrids sired to her. She has created a new sire line by turning her mother. While initially it was unknown if her death would result in the death of her "descendants" like for any other original vampires, Hayley was later described as an "Unsired Vampire", meaning that any hybrid or vampire that Hope sires would continue to live on if she were to be killed.

==TV series==
On January 11, 2013, it was announced that a [[Backdoor pilots|back-door pilot]] focused on the Originals, starring [[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]] as Klaus titled ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'' would air April 25 for a potential series pick-up for the 2013-2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/01/11/the-cw-orders-backdoor-pilot-for-vampire-diaries-spinoff-the-originals/165059/comment-page-2/#comments |title=The CW Orders Backdoor Pilot for ‘Vampire Diaries’ Spinoff, ‘The Originals’ - Ratings &amp;#124; TVbytheNumbers |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date=2013-01-11 |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second spin-off attempt is carried out by [[Julie Plec]]. There is no involvement by Kevin Williamson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Vampire Diaries' Spinoff 'The Originals' in the Works at CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/vampire-diaries-spinoff-works-at-411487|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, it was announced that [[Daniella Pineda]] was cast as the witch Sophie for episode 4x20 of ''The Vampire Diaries''. This episode serves as a backdoor-pilot for the spin-off series, revolving around ''the Originals'' and taking place in the French Quarter of [[New Orleans]]. She was a regular cast member for first thirteen episodes of the series.

On February 11, 2013 it was announced that [[Leah Pipes]] was cast as the human Camille. Although there has been talk of a love triangle between Marcel and Klaus with this bartender/college student, there isn't any evidence to support this. However the character was in a small love triangle for couple episodes, but isn't anymore.

'''Pinoy Auto Trader''' was an online automotive marketplace primarily catered for the Philippine market. It was owned and operated by Netrepreneur Connections Enterprises and was a sister-company of the Philippine buy and sell website [[Sulit.com.ph]]. Pinoy Auto Trader was primarily a [[business-to-consumer]] (B2C) website.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/07/03/13/sulit-acquires-pinoy-auto-trader-website Sulit acquires Pinoy Auto Trader]" ''ABS CBN News''.

== History ==
Pinoy Auto Trader was founded by Daniel Scott, Christopher Franks and Reynaldo Castellano III as part of Philippine technology startup company SirQo.com, Inc and launched in public beta on November 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://e27.co/2012/11/27/pinoy-auto-trader-wants-to-simplify-the-hunt-for-a-used-car-launches-public-beta/ Pinoy Auto Trader wants to simplify the hunt for a used car, launches public beta]" ''E27''. 2012.

In October 2012, prior to the official beta-launch, the Pinoy Auto Trader website was one of eight winners during the inaugural Philippine startup competition Hack2Hatch that was organized and hosted by Filipino Silicon Valley Entrepreneurs Winson Damarillo, [[Dado Banatao]] and Paco Sandejas.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hack2hatch.com Hack2Hatch]" ''Hack2Hatch from Hacker to Founder''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://e27.co/2012/10/09/hack2hatch-pinoy-auto-trader-makes-buying-and-selling-cars-easier/ Hack2Hatch: Pinoy Auto Trader makes buying and selling cars easier]" ''E27''. 2012.

The museum is under the management of the [[Israel Museum]] and houses the head office of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/travel/the-rockefeller-museum-1.242644 The Rockefeller Museum, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the Rockefeller Museum, the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] [[Department of Antiquities of Mandatory Palestine|Department of Antiquities]] and British School of Archaeology were housed in an old building in Jerusalem with a small exhibition hall. The only other archaeological museum at the time was the Franciscan Biblical Museum, built in 1902.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=39&amp;subj_id=156&amp;id=155&amp;module_id=12#as Rockefeller Museum: Historic Background]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1906, the [[Jewish National Fund]] began to negotiate the purchase of Karm el-Sheikh, a tract of land facing the northeastern corner of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] walls, to house the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel School of Art and Crafts]]. The founder of the school, [[Boris Schatz]] envisaged a museum and university that would overlook the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref name="imj.org.il"&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/rockefeller/eng/index.html West Meets East: The Story of Rockefeller Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, town planner [[Patrick Geddes]] proposed the establishment of an antiquities museum at this site. To further the project, the Mandate authorities proposed a special tourism tax in 1924.&lt;ref name="antiquities.org.il"/&gt;
 
Visiting [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1925, during the days of the British Mandate, [[James Henry Breasted]], founder and director of the [[University of Chicago]]'s Oriental Institute, recognized the need for an archaeological museum in Jerusalem to house important regional finds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=39&amp;subj_id=156&amp;Module_id=12 Israel Antiquities Authority: Rockefeller Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by [[Lord Plumer]], the British [[High Commissioner]], Breasted approached American philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], who agreed to donate two million dollars toward the project. Previously, he had offered to build an archeological museum in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kletter |first1=Raz |title=Just Past? The Making of Israeli archaeology |date=2006 |publisher=Equinox Publishing Limited |location=London/Oakville |p=174 |isbn=1-84553-085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was turned down, possibly due to pressure from the British government, which was anxious to keep America from establishing a foothold in the region.

[[File:East Jerusalem, the Rockefeller Museum Rockefeller Museum P1190104.JPG|thumb|Relief representing [[Israelite]] culture, one of ten bas-reliefs by [[Eric Gill]] in the inner courtyard at the museum.]]
The museum was designed by [[Austen Harrison]], (Austen St. Barbe Harrison), chief architect of the Mandatory Department of Public Works, who drew up blueprints for a white limestone building integrating eastern and western architectural elements.&lt;ref name="kletter"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Raz | last=Kletter | title=The Friends of Antiquities: The story of an Israeli volunteer group and comparative remarks | journal=[[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] | volume=8 | at = Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of the new museum was laid on June 19, 1930, but construction was delayed due to the discovery of tombs dating to the fifth century B.C. at the building site.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/27/arts/in-jerusalem-a-museum-s-treasures-go-unseen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | title=In Jerusalem, a Museum's Treasures Go Unseen | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=27 September 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum features a stone [[bas-relief]] of the meeting of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] above the main entrance together with ten stone reliefs illustrating different cultures and a [[gargoyle]] fountain in the inner courtyard carved in 1934 by the British sculptor [[Eric Gill]] (1882–1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.imj.org.il/rockefeller/eng/Gill.html | title=Eric Gill, 1882–1940 | publisher=[[Israel Museum]] | work=East Meets West: The Story of the Rockefeller Museum | accessdate=31 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill also produced stone carved [[signage]] throughout the museum in [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Arabic]].

[[File:Rockefeller Museum.jpg|thumb|Rockefeller Museum inner courtyard.]]
[[File:Rockefeller_Museum_Courtyard.jpg|thumb|Inner courtyard with a view to the tower.]]
The museum opened to the public on January 13, 1938. Officially, it was called the ''Palestine Archaeological Museum'', but was also known as the ''Rockefeller Museum''.&lt;ref name="kletter" /&gt;
Until the final days of the Mandate period, the museum was administered by the British Palestine Government.&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Palestine Post]] | date = April 22, 1948 | title = Board of Trustees for Museum | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1948 it was closed for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kletter |first1=Raz |title=Just Past? The Making of Israeli archaeology |date=2006 |publisher=Equinox Publishing Limited |location=London/Oakville |p=175 |isbn=1-84553-085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1948, the High Commissioner appointed a council of international trustees to administer the museum. The council consisted of twelve members: two representing the High Commissioner, one from the British Academy, one from the British Museum, one from the French National Academy, one from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two from the Antiquities Departments of the Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Transjordanian governments; one from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], one from the Royal Swedish Academy, one from the American Institute of Archaeology, and one from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=PP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=39&amp;subj_id=156&amp;Module_id=12 Rockefeller Museum, Israel Antiquities Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; The board run the museum until 1966. In the 1950s controversies came up about objects removed by the two sides to Amman and the Israeli side respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kletter |first1=Raz |title=Just Past? The Making of Israeli archaeology |date=2006 |publisher=Equinox Publishing Limited |location=London/Oakville |pp=185–189 |isbn=1-84553-085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the museum also became a secondary headquarters of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, headed by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] until 1956.&lt;ref name=Silberman&gt;{{cite book| last=Silberman | first=Neil Asher | title=The archaeology of Israel: constructing the past, interpreting the present|year=1997|publisher=[[Sheffield Academic Press]] |isbn=978-1-85075-650-7|pages=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH4MkEQH7M8C&amp;pg=PA72|authorlink=Neil Asher Silberman |editor1-first=Neil Asher | editor1-last=Silberman | editor2-first=David B. | editor2-last=Small | chapter=Structuring the Past}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the museum was nationalized by [[King Hussein]] during the  [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Seven months later, when the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] broke out, the museum was captured by an Israeli paratroop brigade.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Its hexagonal tower was used as a lookout. Fierce fighting took place here between Israeli and Jordanian forces, culminating in an Israeli victory.{{Citation needed| date=May 2012}} The Museum was then officially renamed as the Rockefeller Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Kimberly | last=Katz | page=134 | publisher =[[University Press of Florida]] | title=Jordanian Jerusalem: Holy Places and National Spaces | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, the museum has been jointly managed by the Israel Museum and the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (later reorganized as the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]]).

Inside what was to have been the rear courtyard of the museum stood (until it died after nearly 300 years in 1998) one of the oldest pine trees in the country. According to Arab legend, on the site of this pine tree, [[Ezra the Scribe]] sat and wrote the Torah for Israel.&lt;ref name="Vilnay1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Vilnay|title=Legends of Jerusalem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi7XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 November 2010|date=May 1973|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America|isbn=978-0-8276-0004-1|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stump may still be seen behind the museum.

==Collections==

The museum's first curator was John H. Iliffe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J H Iliffe Collection|url=http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/ms/uqfl514.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who arranged the artifacts in chronological order, from two million years ago to 1700 AD. Among the museum's prized possessions are 8th-century wooden panels from the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] and 12th-century ([[Crusade]]r-period) marble lintels from the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Most of the collection consists of finds from the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/27/arts/in-jerusalem-a-museum-s-treasures-go-unseen.html In Jerusalem, a Museum's Treasures Go Unseen]&lt;/ref&gt; On display are artifacts unearthed in [[Jerusalem]], [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], [[Ashkelon]], [[Lachish]], [[Samaria]], and [[Jericho]]. One of the [[Lachish letters]] is on permanent display at the museum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Lakhish_Ostraca,_c._587_BCE Lakhish Ostraca, c. 587 BCE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111022237/http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Lakhish_Ostraca,_c._587_BCE |date=2012-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the statuary and stucco decorations from the [[Umayyad]] [[Hisham's Palace]].

Some of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] discovered at [[Qumran]] between 1947 and 1956, consisting of Jewish texts and commentaries, were housed in the Rockefeller Museum.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 1967, following the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem, the scrolls were seized by Israel and relocated to the [[Shrine of the Book]], a specially designed building on the grounds of the Israel Museum, with the ownership of these scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. The [[Copper Scroll]] was taken to the Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/curious.shtml On the Curious Protests of the Dead Sea Scrolls Exhibition in Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''''S v Motau and Another''''' is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] Provincial Division on March 11, 1963, with judgment handed down on March 25. The judges were Ludorf J en Trollip J.

== Judgment ==
The case was an appeal from a conviction on a charge of [[arson]], which requires [[South_African_criminal_law#Arson|by definition]] that the affected [[property]] be [[immovable property|immovable]]. As it appeared that the state had failed to prove sufficiently that the complainant's "house" was immovable, the court substituted a conviction of [[malicious injury to property]], although the appellants had been acquitted on such a charge.

The '''Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture''' is a [[research library]] of the [[New York Public Library]] (NYPL) and an archive repository for information on people of African descent worldwide. Located at 515 [[Lenox Avenue|Malcolm X Boulevard]] (Lenox Avenue) between [[135th Street (Manhattan)|West 135th]] and [[136th Street (Manhattan)|136th]] Streets in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], it has, almost from its inception, been an integral part of the Harlem community.  It is named for Afro-Puerto Rican  scholar [[Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]].

The resources of the Center are broken up into five divisions, the Art and Artifacts Division, the Jean Blackwell Hutson General Research and Reference Division, the Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division, the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division, and the Photographs and Prints Division.

In addition to research services, the center hosts readings, discussions, art exhibitions, and theatrical events. It is open to the general public.

== Early history==

===135th Street branch===

In 1901, [[Andrew Carnegie]] tentatively agreed to donate $5,200,000 ({{Inflation|US|5,200,000|1901|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) to construct 65 [[Carnegie library|branch libraries]] in [[New York City]], with the requirement that the City provide the land and maintain the buildings once construction was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carnegie Offers City Big Gift |date=1901-03-16 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1901-03-16/ed-1/seq-1/ |work=[[New-York Tribune]] |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1901 Carnegie formally signed a contract with the City of New York to transfer his donation to the city to then allow it to justify purchasing the land to house the libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Library Plans All Right Now: Carnegie Approves Controller Coler Contracts |date=1901-09-09 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1901-09-09/ed-1/seq-3/ |work=The Evening World |pages=3}}; [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1901-09-10/ed-1/seq-6/ Carnegie Approves the Contracts], [http://www.search.proquest.com/docview/96155738 Mr. Carnegie's Libraries], ''The New York Times'', 1901-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] were chosen as the architects and [[Charles Follen McKim]] designed the three-story library building at 103 West 135th Street in the Italian Renaissance Palazzo mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|White|Willensky|2000|p=507}}; contra: These attribute the original design to [[Stanford White]]: [http://search.proquest.com/docview/146891492 "Books, Black Culture and- the Course of History: Books and History"], ''Washington Post'', and [https://www.webcitation.org/64e5rRBgD?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/arts/road-to-freedom-show-at-library.html "'Road to Freedom' Show at Library".]&lt;/ref&gt; At its opening on July 14, 1905, the library had 10,000 books&lt;ref name=NYAN0714&gt;{{cite news |title=Library's West 135th Street Branch Will Mark 25th Anniversary Tuesday: Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature Brought Harlem Unit 'to Attention of Book World--Considered Finest&lt;!--informative--&gt; |date=1930-07-30 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/226222291 |work=New York Amsterdam News |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the librarian in charge was Gertrude Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Library Opened |date=1905-07-15 |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1905-07-15/ed-1/seq-4/ |work=New-York Tribune |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi'''''|しゃべる!DSお料理ナビ|Shaberu! Dīesu Oryōri Nabi|literally "''It Talks! DS Cooking Navigator''"}} is a cooking simulator for the [[Nintendo DS]]. It was released on July 20, 2006 in Japan.

==Brief information==
The software contains numerous Japanese recipes with step by step instructions, and the user can use the Nintendo DS's microphone for voice-recognition commands like turning pages. All the instructions are read out loud, while some instructions are video recordings showing how to do some tasks like chopping. It is possible to choose recipes based on a number of calories, the ingredients the user has and so forth. The simulator also keeps in memory what dishes the player has already made. It also features a timer, useful when on is cooking noodles and the like; however, some kitchen appliances already have built-in timers, like [[kitchen stove]]s and [[microwave oven]]s for example. As a bonus, the [[Game &amp; Watch]] game, ''Chef'', can also be played in this DS title.

==Reception==
''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi'' received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2006 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2006/entertainment/000499/index.php|title=2006 Japan Media Arts Festival Entertainment Division Excellence Prize Shaberu!

==Sequels and Spinoffs==
''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi'' gave birth to five sequels, with development split between Nintendo and [[Koei]]. Nintendo itself issued a Japan only sequel {{nihongo|[https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/aoij/index.html ''Kenkou Ouen Recipe 1000: DS Kondate Zenshuu'']|[[:ja:健康応援レシピ1000 DS献立全集|健康応援レシピ1000 DS献立全集]]|lit. "Health Boost Recipe 1000: DS Complete Menu"}} and the North America-only 2010 release ''America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking'', based on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program, [[America's Test Kitchen]] after ''[[Cook's Illustrated]]'' magazine helped the publisher to write the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fIeyCqi4iFZwJXW395q2KhDE0wyfId_q America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking] Nintendo of America, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Koei]]'s releases are both Japan only, with the company releasing {{nihongo|[http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/ds/cook/ ''Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi: Marugoto Teikoku Hotel'']|しゃべる!DSお料理ナビ まるごと帝国ホテル|It Talks!

==Legacy==
A musical remix based on this Nintendo DS title was used in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', where it was heard in the Kirby Final Smash update. This was only heard on the Japanese version of the official website;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smashbros.com/jp/characters/kirby.html |title=カービィ：最後の切りふだ |accessdate=2007-12-07 |last=Sakurai |first=Masahiro |date=2007-10-09 |work=スマブラ拳!! }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the song was added to all versions of Super Smash Bros. Brawl as one of the songs for the [[PictoChat]] stage.

The '''Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition''' was an expedition to Africa led by outgoing American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and outfitted by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=Science1908&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|title=President Roosevelt's African Trip|date=December 18, 1908|volume=28|issue=729|pages=876–877|jstor=1635075|doi=10.1126/science.28.729.876|pmid=17743798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to collect specimens for the Smithsonian's new Natural History museum, now known as the [[National Museum of Natural History]]. The expedition collected around 11,400 animal specimens which took Smithsonian naturalists eight years to catalog.&lt;ref name="SI100Years"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/onehundredyears/expeditions/SI-Roosevelt_Expedition.html |title=Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition |website=National Museum of Natural History: Celebrating 100 Years |publisher=Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the expedition, Roosevelt chronicled it in his book ''African Game Trails''.

==Participants and resources==
The group, led by the legendary hunter-tracker R. J. Cunninghame, included scientists from the Smithsonian and was joined from time to time by [[Frederick Selous]], the famous big game hunter and explorer. Among other items, Roosevelt brought with him four tons of salt for preserving animal hides, a lucky rabbit's foot given to him by boxer [[John L. Sullivan]], a [[Holland &amp; Holland]] [[double rifle]] in [[.500/450 Nitro Express|.500/450]] donated by a group of 56 admiring Britons, a [[Winchester 1895]] rifle in [[.405 Winchester]], an Army ([[M1903 Springfield|M1903]]) Springfield in [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] caliber stocked and sighted for him, a Fox No. 12 shotgun, and the famous Pigskin Library, a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk. Participants on the Expedition included Roosevelt's son, [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], [[Edgar Alexander Mearns]], [[Edmund Heller]], and [[John Alden Loring]].

==Timeline and route ==
[[File:Roosevelt-Smithsonian_Expedition_Map.jpg|left|thumb|Map of the route taken by the party.  From the Edmund Heller Papers, [[Smithsonian Institution Archives]].|253x253px]]The party set sail from New York City on the steamer Hamburg on March 23, 1909, shortly after the end of Roosevelt's presidency on March 4.&lt;ref name="SI100Years" /&gt; The party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]), traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]]. Financed by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Roosevelt African Expedition Collects for SI|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_193|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11,397&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt; animals. According to Theodore Roosevelt’s own tally, the figure included about four thousand birds, two thousand reptiles and amphibians, five hundred fish, and 4,897 mammals (other sources put this figure at 5,103). Add to this marine, land and freshwater shells, crabs, beetles and other invertebrates, not to mention several thousand plants, and the number of natural history specimens totals 23,151.&lt;ref name="SIA"/&gt; A separate collection was made of ethnographic objects. The material took eight years to catalogue. The larger animals shot by Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt are listed on pages 457 to 459 of his book'' African Game Trails''. The total is 512, of which 43 are birds. The number of [[big-game hunting|big game]] animals killed, was 17 lion, 3 leopard, 7 cheetah, 9 hyena, 11 elephant, 10 buffalo, 11 (now very rare) black rhino and 9 [[White Rhinoceros|White rhino]]. Most of the 469 larger non big game mammals included 37 species and subspecies of antelopes. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals which were required to provide fresh meat for the large number of porters employed to service the expedition. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to [[Washington, D.C.]]; the quantity took years to [[taxidermy|mount]], and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other [[museum]]s. Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, "I can be condemned only if the existence of the [[National Museum of Natural History|National Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned."&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Patricia (2005) ''When Trumpets Call'', p. 67, Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-86477-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In assessing whether the toll of animals was excessive in that the animals taken spanned a period of ten months, and were procured over an area that ranged from Mombasa through Kenya, to Uganda and the Southern Sudan, a distance travelled, with side trips, of several thousand kilometres. The diversity of larger mammal species collected  was such that few individuals of any species were shot in any given area, and the large mammals collected had a negligible impact on the great herds of game that roamed East Africa at that time. Apologists for the Roosevelts have pointed out that the number of each big game species shot was very modest by the standards of the time: many white hunters of that period, for example, such as [[Karamoja Bell]], had killed over 1,000 elephants each, while the Roosevelts between them killed just eleven. In making this comparison it has to be remembered that the white hunters weren’t collecting specimens for museums, but were employed by landowners to clear animals from land they wanted to use for plantations.

Although the safari was conducted in the name of science, it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion; Roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land-owning families, and met many native peoples and local leaders.

While Theodore Roosevelt greatly enjoyed hunting, he was also an avid conservationist. In ''African Game Trails'' he condemns "game butchery as objectionable as any form of wanton cruelty and barbarity" (although he does note that "to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head, not of soundness of heart") and as a pioneer of wilderness conservation in the USA he fully supported the British Government's attempts at that time to set aside wilderness areas as game reserves, some of the first on the African continent. He notes (page 17) that "in the creation of the great game reserve  through which the Uganda railway runs  the British Government has conferred a boon upon mankind", a conservation attitude which Roosevelt helped sow that finally grew and blossomed in the form of the great game parks of East Africa today.

'''''The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps''''' was a [[Classified information in the United States|classified]] 30 volume book prepared in the late 1950s by Major Ann Bray&lt;!--Do not link. Goes to a different Anne Bray--&gt; and others at the [[United States Army Intelligence Center]] and printed in 1959. The document contains the history of the US Army's [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] (CIC) until 1950. A [[Sanitization (classified information)|declassified]] (sanitized) version of the official history is now available to researchers at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA).

Volume XXX of the book has been published by [[Hanlim University]], [[Korea]] as ''US Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC - Korea) Archives''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720081630/http://www.kimsoft.com/1997/cic.htm]

An 18-part series of declassified documents edited by John Mendelsohn&lt;!--do not link, goes to a musician--&gt; and titled ''[[Covert Warfare (book)|Covert Warfare: Intelligence, counterintelligence, and military deception during the World War II era]]'' was published in 1989. Part 11 was also named ''The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC)''.

In December 2005 a single-volume condensed history based on declassified CIC documents was published by the army as ''[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps103181/GPO_Army_318-530.pdf In the Shadow of the Sphynx: A History of Army Counterintelligence]''.

'''Twin Galaxies''' is an [[United States|American]] organization that tracks [[video game]] [[world record]]s and conducts a program of electronic-gaming promotions. It operates the Twin Galaxies website and publishes the ''Twin Galaxies' Official Video Game &amp; Pinball Book of World Records'', with the Arcade Volume released on June 2, 2007. ''The Guinness World Records - Gamers Edition 2008'' was released in March, 2008 in conjunction with Twin Galaxies, who [[Guinness World Records]] considers to be the official supplier of verified world records to the annual volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamers.guinnessworldrecords.com/aboutus/twin_galaxies.aspx Twin Galaxies is the official supplier of video game scores to the Guinness World Records books - GuinnessWorldRecords.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723195740/http://gamers.guinnessworldrecords.com/aboutus/twin_galaxies.aspx |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In mid-1981, [[Walter Day]], founder of Twin Galaxies Incorporated, visited more than 100 video game [[arcade game|arcades]] over four months, recording the [[high score]]s that he found on each game. On November 10, he opened his own arcade in [[Ottumwa, Iowa]], naming it Twin Galaxies. On February 9, 1982, his database of records was released publicly as the Twin Galaxies National Scoreboard.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Twin Galaxies became known as the official scoreboard, arranging contests between top players. Twin Galaxies' first event attracted international media attention for gathering the first teams of video-game stars. Top players in [[North Carolina]] and [[California]] were formed into state teams that faced off in a "California Challenges North Carolina All-Star Playoff", playing on 17 different games in [[Lakewood, California]], and [[Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina]]. California defeated North Carolina 10–7 over the weekend of August 27–30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1308 California Tops Carolina in Video Challenge - RePlay Magazine, October, 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023173627/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1308 |date=2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar competitions were also conducted during the summers of 1983 and 1984 when Day organized the players in many U.S. states to form teams and compete in high score contests for the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. The states included California, North Carolina, Washington, Illinois, Nebraska, Ohio, Michigan, Idaho, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, Alaska, Iowa and Kansas.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

On November 30, 1982, Ottumwa mayor Jerry Parker declared the town "Video Game Capital of the World",  a claim that was backed up by [[Iowa Governor]] [[Terry Branstad]], [[Atari]] and the Amusement Game Manufacturers Association in a ceremony at Twin Galaxies on March 19, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1141 What is the Video Game Capital of the World? - Cashbox Magazine, April 2, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313021159/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1141 |date=March 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1055 The King of the Video Game Addicts - Toronto Sunday Star, March 27, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023183126/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1055 |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1060 Video Game Capital Lies Amid Iowa Cornfields - St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 9, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313021148/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1060 |date=March 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin Galaxies' status as the official scorekeeper was further enhanced by support from the major video game publications of the early 1980s. Beginning in the summer of 1982, ''Video Games'' magazine and ''Joystik'' magazine published full-page high-score charts taken from Twin Galaxies' data. These high-score tables were published during the entire lives of these magazines. Additional high-score charts also appeared in ''Videogiochi'' ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]), ''Computer Games'', ''Video Game Player'' magazine and ''Electronic Fun'' magazine. Twin Galaxies' high-score charts also appeared in ''[[USA Today]]'' (April 22, 1983), ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine and was distributed sporadically in 1982 and 1983 by the [[Knight-Ridder]] news service as an occasional news feature, originating from the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=424 Seek Individual Excellence - Associated Press Wire Story in Miami Herald, August 21, 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174126/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=424 |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=749 Records, like promises, are not always meant to be broken - USA Today, July 7, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324082222/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=749 |date=March 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=748 Video Game Records - USA Today, April 22, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324082212/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=748 |date=March 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin Galaxies brought top players together on November 7, 1982, to be photographed by [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]]. This photo session is the subject of a recent documentary film, ''[[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]]'', which was screened at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]]. On January 8–9, 1983, Twin Galaxies organized the first significant video-game championship, to crown a world champion. This event was filmed in Ottumwa by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' and was aired on the night of February 21, 1983.&lt;ref name="twingalaxies.com"&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1033 Twin Galaxies' Coronation Day Crowns Video's Best of '83 - RePlay Magazine, February 1, 1984] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311171236/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1033 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1983, Twin Galaxies was contracted by the Electronic Circus to assemble a professional troupe of video game superstars who would travel with the Circus as an "act." With Walter Day hired as the "Circus Ringmaster", Twin Galaxies supplied a squad of 15 world-record holders on Twin Galaxies' high-score tables. Though the Circus was scheduled to visit 40 cities in North America, its Boston inaugural performance, opening in the Bayside Exposition Ctr. on July 15, 1983, lasted only five days, closing on July 19. The players selected by Twin Galaxies for the Circus are believed to be history's first professionally contracted video game players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1304 Video Hall of Fame - Blip Magazine, February 1, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174423/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1304 |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 1983, Twin Galaxies established the professional [[U.S. National Video Game Team]], the first such, with Walter Day as team captain. The USNVGT toured the United States during the summer of 1983 in a 44-foot [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] bus filled with arcade games, appearing at arcades around the nation and  conducting the 1983 Video Game Masters Tournament, the results of which were published in the 1984 U.S. edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. Under the direction of Day, functioning as an assistant editor for the ''Guinness Book'' in charge of video-game scores, the USNVGT gathered annual contest results that were published in the 1984—1986 U.S. editions. In September 1983, the USNVGT visited the Italian and Japanese Embassies in Washington D.C. to issue challenges for an international video game championship. In 1987, the USNVGT toured Europe where it defeated a team of UK video game superstars. Every month between 1991 and 1994, the U.S. publication ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' (''EGM''), published a full-page high-score table titled "The U.S. National Video Game Team's International Scoreboard".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1133 U.S. Video Team Holds Tourney - CashBox Magazine, October 22, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208034746/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1133 |date=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1140 U.S. vs. Japan Video Tournament? - CashBox Magazine, August 27, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174206/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=1140 |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=705 They're Masters of Video Games - Spokesman-Review, Spokane, WA, August 24, 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208034852/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=705 |date=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the Guinness Book of World records stopped publishing records from Twin Galaxies due to a decline in interest for arcade games.&lt;ref name="relation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/technology/guinness-to-release-book-of-game-records-20080206-1qoy.html|title=Guinness to Release Book of Game Records|newspaper=Sidney Morning Herald|date=Feb 7, 2008|accessdate=Oct 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1998, ''Twin Galaxies' Official Video Game &amp; Pinball Book of World Records'' was published. It is a 984-page book containing scores compiled since 1981. A second edition was published as a three-volume set in 2007. A third edition was published in 2009.

==Classic Video Game World Championship==
Twin Galaxies conducted the first "Classic Video Game World Championship" on June 2–4, 2001 at the Funspot Family Fun Center in [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|Weirs Beach]], [[New Hampshire]]. The winner of this renewed video game contest was Dwayne Richard with Donald Hayes coming in second place.

The 2nd "Classic Video Game World Championship" was conducted on the weekend of June 30–July 2, 2002.  The winner was Dwayne Richard with Donald Hayes again coming in second place.  This was the last year the contest was in this format.  The following years had the Funspot location organizing and running the contest in a more informal arcade "Player of the Year," format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=315 Classic Video Game World Championship Set for New Hampshire May 8, 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174146/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=315 |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=8 Classic Video Game World Championship Attracts the World's Best, May 26, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219042042/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=27&amp;id=8 |date=February 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001 and 2002, Twin Galaxies conducted the annual Twin Galaxies' Video Game Festivals at the Mall of America, attracting approximately 50,000–75,000 attendees each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18&amp;id=455 Festival Marries Classics with CounterStrike, RePlay Magazine, Woodland Hills, CA, September 1, 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230052834/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=18 |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2005, Walter Day and the staff of Twin Galaxies led a contingent of USA and UK video game players to [[Paris]], [[France]], where they delivered an eight-foot (2.4&amp;nbsp;meter) tall Proclamation which proposed a "London vs. Paris" Video Game Championship.

On September 24, 2005, The [[U.S. National Video Game Team]] revived and formed a New England Chapter with Walter Day as the national team captain and David Nelson of [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]], [[New Hampshire]], as the chapter captain.

==Iron Man Contest==
In the first week of July, 1985, Twin Galaxies conducted the 1st Twin Galaxies Iron Man Contest. The goal of the Iron Man competition was simple: competitors had to continue playing their game for as long as they could. If anyone passed 100 hours, they would be awarded a $10,000 prize from the Sports Achievement Association.

The winner of the contest was 18-year-old James Vollandt, who carried his ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'' game for 67½ hours. The game malfunctioned at around 58 hours, wiping out all of his 210 extra lives. However, he earned back forty of them. He left the game voluntarily with a record-breaking score of 107,216,700 points, a record that stood until 2010, when John McAllister broke the record over live streaming video on justin.tv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=New World Record In Joust Awaiting Certification|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2010/10/new-world-record-in-joust-awaiting-certification/|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
In 2007, a film about Twin Galaxies and video game champions in the 1980s, ''[[Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade]]'', was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

''[[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'', a feature documentary about retro arcade gamers, featuring Twin Galaxies, was released in theaters on August 24, 2007. The documentary was in large measure critical of Twin Galaxies' handling of challenges to long-established top scores, suggesting that its organizational structure is rife with conflicts of interest.

''[[Frag (documentary)|Frag]]'', a feature documentary about modern professional gamers, was released on DVD on August 1, 2008 by Cohesion Productions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cohesionproductions.com Cohesion Productions Releases FRAG - www.cohesionproductions.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724195132/http://www.cohesionproductions.com/ |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Cedar Falls, Iowa. The first ten minutes of the documentary recapped Twin Galaxies' role as the pioneers of organized video game playing back in the early 1980s.

''[[Man vs Snake|Man vs Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler]]'', a feature documentary about the video game [[Nibbler (video game)|Nibbler]], was released worldwide in 2016. The film includes Twin Galaxies history and the competition for high scores. Walter Day is featured throughout the film.

==Poster gallery==
Since August 1, 1982, Twin Galaxies has been producing unique, colorful posters to document gaming events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1191 Twin Galaxies' Gallery of Posters, 1982-2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328112858/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1191 |date=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the first dozen posters issued in the early 1980s enjoyed printing runs of 500 – 1,000 copies each, the posters created in later years have been issued as limited editions with only 20-24 copies produced of each one.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''Uniformat''' is a standard for classifying building [[specification]]s, [[Cost estimate|cost estimating]], and cost analysis in the U.S. and Canada. The elements are major components common to most buildings. The system can be used to provide consistency in the economic evaluation of building projects. It was developed through an industry and government consensus and has been widely accepted as an ASTM standard.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Charette, Harold E. Marshall, "UNIFORMAT II Elemental Classification for Building Specifications, Cost Estimating, and Analysis" U.S. Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology, NISTIR 6389, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Faithful+Gould|Hanscomb Associates]], a cost consultant, developed a system called MASTERCOST in 1973 for the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA). The U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA), which is responsible for government buildings, was also developing a system. The AIA and GSA agreed on a system and named it UNIFORMAT. The AIA included it in their practice on construction management, and the GSA included it their project estimating requirements. In 1989, [[ASTM International]] began developing a standard for classifying building elements, based on UNIFORMAT. It was renamed to UNIFORMAT II.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Charette, Harold E. Marshall, "UNIFORMAT II Elemental Classification for Building Specifications, Cost Estimating, and Analysis" U.S. Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, National Institute of Standards and Technology, NISTIR 6389, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Construction Specifications Institute]] (CSI) and Construction Specifications Canada (CSC) began to revise Uniformat. UniFormat is now a trademark of CSI and CSC and was most recently published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"Uniformat," Construction Specifications Institute, http://www.csinet.org/uniformat&lt;/ref&gt;

A new strategy to classify the built environment, named OmniClass,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniclass.org/&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates the elemental building classification in its Table 21 Elements. The numbering system is changed in OmniClass.

}}'''Whitepages''' is a provider of online directory services, fraud screening and identity verification for businesses, public record background checks, and other products, based on its database of contact information for people and businesses. It has the largest database available of contact information on US residents.&lt;ref name="VB"/&gt;

Whitepages was founded in 1997 as a hobby for then-[[Stanford]] student [[Alex Algard]]. It was incorporated in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.

==History==
The idea for Whitepages was conceived by [[Alex Algard]], while studying at [[Stanford]] in 1996. Algard was searching for a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number.&lt;ref name="ppp"/&gt; He thought of an online email directory as an easier way to find people.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages.com has number for fast growth|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20031013&amp;slug=btinterface13|newspaper=The Seattle Times|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=October 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900,&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas|last=Carlson|date=January 24, 2007|url=http://www.internetnews.com/xSP/article.php/3655611|publisher=InternetNews|title=WhitePages.com: Reach out and search someone|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt; which he says was all of his savings at the time.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for [[Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref name="dakfhukajehf"/&gt; He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup).&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt; Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs.&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt; In 1998, Algard left his job to focus on the website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.&lt;ref name="dakfhukajehf"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Private Equity Growth Capital Council|url=http://www.pegcc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/pec_cs_whitepages_020309a.pdf|title=WhitePages.com: From hobby to number one people search destination|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site grew and attracted more advertisers. The company brokered deals with Yellowpages and Superpages, whereby Whitepages earned revenue for sending them referral traffic. By 2005, $15 million in annual revenues was coming from these contracts.&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt; In 2003, Algard stepped down as CEO to focus on CarDomain.com, which he had also founded&lt;ref name="ppp"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brad|last=Broberg|title=Founder returns to WhitePages.com|publisher=Puget Sound Business Journal|date=September 30, 2007|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2007/10/01/focus10.html|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Max Bardon took his place as CEO temporarily.&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt; In 2005, Technology Crossover Ventures and Providence Equity Partners invested $45 million in the company.&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt;&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; That same year, MSN adopted Whitepages' directory data for its "Look it up" feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MSN Replaces InfoSpace with WhitePages.com|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/28828/#axzz2bIuB3tM1|first=Shankar|last=Gupta|date=April 5, 2005|accessdate=August 7, 2013|publisher=MediaPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algard returned to the company in 2007.&lt;ref name="ppp"/&gt; By the end of that year, the Whitepages database had grown to 180 million records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages.com coverage expands from 40 to 80 percent|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2004062675_btbriefs10.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was listed as one of [[Deloitte]]'s 500 fastest growing technology companies in North America three times.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages hires new CTO|first=Rebecca|last=Collins|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2010/11/whitepages-taps-new-cto.html|publisher=Puget Sound Business Journal|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008 the company had $66 million in annual revenues.&lt;ref name="recentsource"/&gt;

In 2008, Whitepages said it would start working on options for users to control their information on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Vaughan-Nichols|newspaper=Computerworld|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/216557/whitepages_com_grapples_privacy_web_2_0_world/?|title=WhitePages.com grapples with privacy in Web 2.0 world|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, it acquired [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] developer [[Snapvine]]&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite news|first=Angel|last=Gonzalez|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2004458452_whitepages05.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|title=WhitePages.com to buy Snapvine|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to add features where users could be called through the website without giving out their phone number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages.com to buy Snapvine for around $20 million|first=Michael|last=Arrington|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=August 7, 2013|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/04/whitepagescom-to-buy-snapvine-for-around-20-million/|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced an [[api]],  which gave third-party developers access to Whitepages' data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Gunderloy|date=March 31, 2008|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/03/31/open-phone-data-whitepages/|accessdate=August 7, 2013|title=Open Phone Data from WhitePages.com|publisher=Giga Om}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitepages released an iOS app that August, followed by the Whitepages Caller ID app for Android devices  in February 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|first=MG|last=Siegler|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2013|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/02/27/caller-id-a-paid-android-app-to-better-screen-my-phone-calls/|title=Caller ID: A paid Android app to better screen my phone calls}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for Blackberry that May.&lt;ref name="plp"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|title=The background-check scams: Is WhitePages really better than Intelius?|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/05/07/the-background-check-scams-is-whitepages-really-better-than-intelius/|first=Matt|last=Marshall|date=May 7, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitepages.com underwent a re-design in 2009.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages launches $2.5 million overhaul|first=Brier|last=Dudley|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2009467080_whitepagescom_launches_25_mill.html|date=July 14, 2009|accessdate=August 7, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising "cleaner" and made it more obvious when someone was going to a third-party website like US Search.&lt;ref name="VB"&gt;{{cite news|date=July 14, 2009|first=Matt|last=Marshall|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/07/14/whitepages-now-the-largest-database-of-american-people-cleans-up-act/|publisher=VentureBeat|title=WhitePages, now the largest database of American people, cleans up act|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that clicked on US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that made it difficult to access the information they paid for.&lt;ref name="VB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The background-check scams: Is WhitePages really better than Intelius?|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/05/07/the-background-check-scams-is-whitepages-really-better-than-intelius/|date=May 7, 2009|first=Matt|last=Marshall|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local business lookup feature called "Store Finder" was added in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WhitePages upgrades business search, adds "store finder"|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2012197459_whitepages_upgrades_business_s.html|first=Brier|last=Dudley|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local shops join forces with coupon websites to sweeten sales|first=Melissa|last=Allison|author2=Amy Martinez |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/retailreport/2012259556_retailreport02.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=July 1, 2010|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which differed from [[Groupon]] by offering short-term deals on nationally available products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amy|last=Martinez|date=October 20, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2013|newspaper=The Seattle Times|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2013209878_dealpopweb21.html|title=WhitePages' DealPop to try national approach as it takes on Groupon, other coupon websites}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealpop was sold to [[Martin Tobias#Tippr.com|Tippr]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tippr Grabs Sales &amp; Tech Talent in DealPop Acquisition, Continuing Daily Deals Dogfight for Third Place|url=http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2011/06/01/tippr-grabs-sales-tech-talent-in-dealpop-acquisition-continuing-daily-deals-dogfight-for-third-place/|newspaper=Xconomy|date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2013|first=Curt|last=Woodward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Superpages and Yellowpages cut back spending with Whitepages from $33 million to $7 million, causing a substantial decline in revenues and a tense relationship with investors. Algard spent $50 million in cash the company had on-hand and $30 million from a bank loan, to buyout the investors in 2013.

Whitepages released the Localicious app in July 2011.

'''Willis Allison Carto''' (July 17, 1926 &amp;ndash; October 26, 2015) was an American political activist on the [[Far right in the United States|American far right]]. He described himself as [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Right-wing populism|populist]], but was primarily known for his promotion of [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic conspiracy theories]] and [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name="ADLCarto"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/carto.asp| title=Willis Carto| publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] | year= 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kaplan|editor1-first=Jeffrey|title=Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right|date=2000|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0742503403|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Willis+Carto+anti-semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uYsIVbvBO8PsaIbhgfAC&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Willis%20Carto%20anti-semitism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levy|editor1-first=Richard|title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1851094394|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Willis+Carto+anti-semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uYsIVbvBO8PsaIbhgfAC&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Willis%20Carto%20anti-semitism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Michael&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=George|title=Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415628440|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SOAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Willis+Carto+anti-semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uYsIVbvBO8PsaIbhgfAC&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Willis%20Carto%20anti-semitism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carto was one of America's most influential political racial theorists through the [[Liberty Lobby]] and successor organizations which he helped create. Carto ran a group supporting [[racial segregation|segregationist]] [[George Wallace]]'s [[George Wallace presidential campaign, 1968|1968 presidential campaign]] which formed the basis for the [[National Youth Alliance]] which promoted [[Francis Parker Yockey]]'s political philosophy. Carto helped found the [[Populist Party (United States, 1984)|Populist Party]], which served as an electoral vehicle for [[white supremacist]] group and [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, such as [[David Duke]] in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] and [[Christian Identity]] supporter [[Bo Gritz]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. Carto ran ''[[American Free Press]],'' another extremist organization, which publishes anti-semitic and racist books and features columns by [[Joe Sobran]], [[James Traficant]], [[Paul Craig Roberts]],  and others. The organization promotes [[9/11 conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/us/politics/ron-paul-disowns-extremists-views-but-doesnt-disavow-the-support.html?pagewanted=all "Paul Disowns Extremists’ Views but Doesn’t Disavow the Support"] by Jim Rutenberg &amp; Serge F. Kovaleski,''[[The New York Times]]'', December 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Carto's many other projects included the [[Institute for Historical Review]], which promotes Holocaust denial.

==Early life==
Willis Carto was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. He fought in [[World War II]], serving in the [[Philippines]] and earning the [[Purple Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marans|first1=Daniel|title=Famed Holocaust Denier Could Be Buried In Arlington National Cemetery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holocaust-denier-arlington-national-cemetery_5637c588e4b0631799134d74|accessdate=3 November 2015|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the military he lived with his parents in [[Mansfield, Ohio]]. He took at least some classes at the [[University of Cincinnati College of Law|University of Cincinnati Law School]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He later worked for [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and moved west to [[San Francisco, California]] where he worked for the [[HSBC Finance|Household Finance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/us/willis-carto-far-right-figure-and-holocaust-denier-dies-at-89.html?_r=0 "Willis Carto, Far-Right Figure and Holocaust Denier, Dies at 89"] by Douglas Martin,''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
{{Neo-Fascism}}
Willis Carto was a devotee of the writings of [[Francis Parker Yockey]].&lt;ref name=nizkor&gt;[http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/ihr/ihr-faq-02.html "Willis Carto and the IHR"], [[Nizkor Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; Yockey promoted [[Adolf Hitler]]'s German [[Nazism|National Socialism]] movement, [[anti-Semitism|harsh criticism of the influence of Jews]], and other [[Fascism|Fascist]] causes and worked with the Nazi aligned [[German-American Bund]] and the [[National German-American Alliance]]. While in prison for possessing falsified passports, Yockey was visited by Carto.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yockey's book, ''[[Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics]]'', was adopted by Carto as his own guiding ideology.&lt;ref name=nizkor /&gt;

Later, Carto would define his ideology as [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[populism|populist]] rather than National Socialist, particularly in Carto's 1982 book, ''Profiles in Populism''.&lt;ref name=profiles&gt;Lyons, Matthew N. &amp; Chip Berlet. ''Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort''; The Guilford Press; 2000; {{ISBN|978-1572305625}}; p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; That book presented sympathetic profiles of several United States political figures including [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Henry Ford]], as well as [[Catholic]] [[Catholic priest|priest]] Father [[Charles Coughlin]] who used radio to issue commentary in support of the policies of Adolf Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name=profiles /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shelton Lawrence|Lawrence, John Shelton]] &amp; Robert Jewett. ''[[The Myth of the American Superhero]]''; Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.; June 1, 2002; {{ISBN|978-0802825735}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty Lobby and newspapers==
In 1955, Carto founded an organization called [[Liberty Lobby]], which remained in operation under his control until 2001, when the organization was forced into [[bankruptcy]] as a result of a [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref name="ADLCarto"/&gt; Liberty Lobby published ''[[The Spotlight]]'' newspaper between 1975 and 2001.&lt;ref name="ADLCarto"/&gt;

Carto&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=David |author-link=David Aaronovitch |date=2010 |chapter= |chapterurl= |title=Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&amp;lpg=PT205&amp;dq=%22American%20Free%20Press%22%20Carto&amp;pg=PT205#v=onepage&amp;q=Willis%20Carto&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Riverhead Books |page= |isbn=9781101185216 |access-date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several ''Spotlight'' staff members and writers subsequently founded a new newspaper called the ''[[American Free Press]]''.  The paper includes articles from syndicated columnists who have no direct ties to Carto or his organizations.

In 1966, Carto acquired control of ''[[The American Mercury]]'' via the Legion for the Survival of Freedom organization. It was published until 1980.

==Political activism in the 1960s and 1970s==
Carto ran a group called "Youth for George Wallace" to aid the [[third political party|third party]] [[presidential campaign]] of [[George Wallace]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]].&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey (editor). ''Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right''; AltaMira Press; June 14, 2000; {{ISBN|978-0742503403}}; page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; When the campaign failed, he converted what remained of the Youth for George Wallace organization into the [[National Youth Alliance]]. As National Chairman for this group, Carto was successful in recruiting [[William Luther Pierce]], who later became famous for his authorship of ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''.&lt;ref name=kaplan /&gt;  Eventually, Carto lost control of the National Youth Alliance to Pierce who transformed it into the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], which is today a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] and [[White separatism|white separatist]] political organization.

On September 10, 1971, the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]'' published a detailed critique of Carto's activities up to that point. It was titled "Liberty Lobby - Willis Carto and his Fronts."

==Historical revisionism and Holocaust denial==
The [[Institute for Historical Review]] was founded by Willis Carto in 1979. Carto was also the founder of a publishing company called [[Noontide Press]], which published a number of books on white [[racialism]], including Yockey's ''Imperium'' and [[David Hoggan]]'s ''The Myth of the Six Million'', one of the first books to [[Holocaust denial|deny the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="ADLHolocaust"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.adl.org/holocaust/carto.asp | title=Willis A. Carto: Fabricating History | publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] | year= 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noontide Press later became closely associated with the IHR, and fell out of Carto's hands at the same time as the IHR did.&lt;ref name="ADLCarto"/&gt;

The IHR and Carto were sued in 1981 by public interest attorney [[William John Cox]] on behalf of Auschwitz survivor [[Mel Mermelstein]]. In that case, which was to eventually last eleven years, the court took "[[judicial notice]] of the fact that [[Jews]] were gassed to death at [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp]] in [[Poland]] during the summer of 1944."&lt;ref name=stun&gt;[http://ihr.org/news/oct1991mermelstein.html "IHR Scores Stunning Victory in Mermelstein Trial - $11 Million Lawsuit Ends in Vindication for Defendants"], ''IHR Newsletter'', October 1991, no.82&lt;/ref&gt; The court went on to state, "It is simply a fact."&lt;ref name=transcripts&gt;[http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/people/m/mermelstein.mel/ftp.py?people/m/mermelstein.mel//mermelstein.order.072285 Transcript], ''[[Nizkor Project]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mermelstein Victory", ''Heritage'', October 23, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Footnote to the Holocaust" by Melinda Beck, ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 19, 1981, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The law firm of Robert Von Esch, Jr., representing the defendants, settled with the plaintiff to remove themselves from the case by agreeing to pay $100,000 and an explicit apology for having filed an August 1986 libel suit by the IHR against Mermelstein. The Von Esches also formally acknowledged that Jews had been gassed at Auschwitz and that millions of Jews had perished in [[Nazi concentration camp|German wartime camps]].&lt;ref name=stun/&gt; On September 19, 1991, the plaintiffs withdrew complaints of libel, conspiracy to inflict emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress, following [[Los Angeles County Superior Court|Los Angeles Superior Court]] Judge [[Stephen Lachs|Stephen M. Lachs]]' dismissal  of the malicious prosecution portion of the case.&lt;ref name=stun/&gt;

After losing control of Noontide Press and the IHR in a [[Takeover#Hostile takeovers|hostile takeover]] by former associates, Carto started another publication, ''[[Barnes Review|The Barnes Review]]'', with the focus also on Holocaust denial.

==Populist Party (1984&amp;ndash;1996)==
In 1984, Carto was involved in starting a new political party called the [[Populist Party (United States, 1984)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref name="ADLCarto"/&gt; It quickly fell out of his hands in a hostile takeover by disgruntled former associates.  Critics asserted that this Populist Party (not to be confused with the 19th-century [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], commonly known as "Populists") was little more than an electoral vehicle for current and former [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Christian Identity]] members.  [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athlete [[Bob Richards]] ([[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]]), [[David Duke]] (a founder of the [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] and a future [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana state representative]], [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]]) and former [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] [[Bo Gritz]] ([[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]) were the Populist Party's only three presidential candidates.  It folded before it could nominate a candidate for the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 elections]].

==In the media==
Carto's Liberty Lobby acquired the Sun Radio Network in December 1989, and attempted to use [[talk radio]] as a vehicle for espousing his views. It was eventually a financial failure.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  Liberty Lobby and ''[[American Free Press]]'' also sponsored the ''Radio Free America'' talk show. Carto also formed the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment, one of several nonprofits Carto used to spread money to like-minded individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocweekly.com/news/moore-carto-connection-8510504 Judge Roy Moore Got $1,000 from OC Holocaust Denial Group's Co-Founder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdfa.us/about-us/ Foundation to Defend the First Amendment - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; Carto also published [[Barnes Review]] from 1994.

In 2004, Carto joined in signing the [[New Orleans Protocol]] on behalf of ''American Free Press''. The New Orleans Protocol seeks to "mainstream our cause" by reducing internecine warfare. It was written by [[David Duke]].

Carto has also been featured as a guest on ''[[The Political Cesspool]]'', which, according to its statement of principles, represents "a philosophy that is pro-White." He has spoken at meetings conducted by "Pastor" [[Thomas Robb]], a prominent Ku Klux Klan leader and Christian Identity advocate and in 2015 participated in the ground breaking ceremony for the Christian Revival Research and Development Center being built on Robb's compound in [[Arkansas]], along with Edward Fields and Canadian white supremacist [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]].

In 2007, Carto condemned the "genocidal maniacs like Vice President [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] and commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]" in their support of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration's]] [[Iraq War|attack on Iraq]].&lt;ref name=steps/&gt; Carto defended [[Iraq]] as a "highly civilized, independent, stable country with 6,000 years of proud history" where over "800,000 innocent men, women and children have been killed, and at least one million wounded, an untold number of homes have been demolished, roads blown up, buildings destroyed." Carto warned that "now the crooks are prodding America to attack [[Iran]]" and condemned "the war cries of cowardly [[Neoconservatism|'neo-con']] [[Israel]]-firsters who literally demand war against Iran". He expressed the fear that American bombs might kill enough Iranians so that Israel will "establish control over the entire theatre and those who presently live there will become Jewish serfs—like the [[Palestinians]]."&lt;ref name=steps&gt;[http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/war_with_iran.html :U.S. Takes More Steps Toward War With Iran]" by Willis Carto; ''American Free Press''; issue #45; November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His media outlets have supported candidate and congressman [[Ron Paul]].

==Death==
Carto died on October 26, 2015 at the age of 89, reportedly from [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willis Allison Carto, American, Rest in Peace|url=http://barnesreview.org/willis-allison-carto-american-rest-in-peace/|website=Barnes Review|publisher=Barnes Revoew|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, he was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] (which the family had the right to request because he had earned a [[Purple Heart]].) Far-right, white nationalist leader Pastor Thomas A. Robb presided over his funeral.

{{Israel-Palestinian peace process}}
The '''Wye River Memorandum''' was an agreement negotiated between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] at a summit in [[Wye River (Maryland)|Wye River]], [[Maryland]], U.S., held from 15–23 October 1998. The Memorandum aimed to resume the  implementation of the 1995 [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip]] (Oslo II Accord). It was signed in the [[White House]] by [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Yasser Arafat]], through negotiations led by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], on 23 October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gellman | first = Barton | title = Netanyahu, Arafat Sign Accord; Talks Nearly Founder After Israel Demands Convicted Spy's Release | page = A1 |work=The Washington Post | date = 24 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1998 Israel's 120 member parliament, the [[Knesset]], approved the Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. The Memorandum determined that it would enter into force on 2 November 1998, ten days from the date of signature.

On 18 December 1998, the Clinton administration and the EU declared their contentment about the implementation of the first phase of the Memorandum by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mid034.asp ''US-EU Declaration on the Middle East Peace Process'']. US State Department, 18 December 1998&lt;br /&gt;
* ''We welcome implementation of the first phase of the Memorandum by both sides. We call on the parties to implement fully the remaining obligations ...''&lt;/ref&gt; Israel, however, had only implemented stage 1 of the further redeployment (F.R.D.), meaning that it had withdrawn from 2% of [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area C]] instead of the required 13%.&lt;ref name=ProCon_Sharm_Memo&gt;[http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=431 ''What Was the 1999 Sharm al-Sheikh Memorandum?'']. ProCon, 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beinin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/pins/pin1.html |title=''The demise of the Oslo process'' |accessdate=16 August 2000 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816222849/http://www.merip.org/pins/pin1.html |archivedate=16 August 2000 }}. Joel Beinin, MERIP, 26 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties accused each other of not fulfilling its share of responsibilities under the Wye River Memorandum, and the further implementation of the agreement remained unfinished.

== The summit ==

The summit was brokered by the United States at the [[Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers]] near [[Wye Mills, Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the final push to get Netanyahu and Arafat to overcome remaining obstacles, Clinton invited [[King Hussein]] who had played a past role in easing tensions between the two men, to join the talks.

On the final day of the negotiations, the agreement almost fell through. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] had asked President [[Bill Clinton]] to release [[Jonathan Pollard]], an American naval intelligence officer who has been serving a life sentence since 1985 for giving classified information to [[Israel]]. A bitter disagreement arose, with Netanyahu claiming that Clinton had promised to release Pollard, and Clinton saying he had only promised to "review" the case. It was reported that then-Director of the [[CIA]] [[George Tenet]] had threatened to resign should Pollard be released.

The agreement was finally signed by Netanyahu and [[PLO]] Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] at the [[White House]], with President Clinton playing a key role as the official witness.

==Background==
[[File:Netanyahu Arafat Shaath.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Davos in 1997.]]
For the implementation of the [[Oslo II Accord]] and to facilitate the Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian Authorities signed a number of agreements and protocols. The documents contained the reciprocal responsibilities, including those relating to further redeployments and security.

In 1994, the "Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO" was signed. In 1995, the "Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities" followed. The 1997 [[Hebron Protocol]] settled the withdrawal from 80% of Hebron and its division into two Areas.

==Redeployments==
{{Further|West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord}}

The Further Redeployments (F.R.D.) in the Wye River Memorandum refer to the three phases in Appendix 1 of Annex I of the Oslo II Accord, which would follow the previous redeployment from populated areas in the West Bank. Only the phases 1 and 2 are specified. Phase 3 was delegated to a "Third further redeployment committee" which was to be started.

===Phase one and two of the further redeployments===
The Phases one and two, not specified in the Oslo II Accord, comprised the transfer to the Palestinians of 13% from Area C and shifts of parts of Area B to Area A.&lt;ref name=Knesset_Memo&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/wye_eng.htm ''The Wye River Memorandum''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010715000000/https://www.knesset.gov.il/process/docs/wye_eng.htm |date=15 July 2001 }}. Knesset website, 23 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The redeployment was divided into three stages, specified in the "Time line".&lt;ref name=Knesset_Memo/&gt;
*Stage 1 (November 1998): 2% from Area C to B; 7.1% from B to A
*Stage 2 (December 1998): 5% from Area C to B
*Stage 3 (January 1999): 5% from Area C to B; 1% from C to A; 7.1% from B to A

In total, 13% would thus be transferred from Area C. Area B would increase with 13% and Area A with 14%.

If the Memorandum had been implemented, Area C would theoretically have been reduced from circa 74% to 61%. Article I, however, determined that 3% of Area B would be designated as Nature Reserves with full Israeli control, meaning that the Palestinians would neither have free access to it, nor could build new constructions.&lt;ref name=Knesset_Memo /&gt; This specification was a result of a misunderstanding regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's "bottom line" for Israeli territorial withdrawal. He told American negotiator [[Dennis Ross]] he could go as high as the "lowest teen" in percentage of territory, and Ross persuaded Chairman Arafat to accept the 13% figure. Later, Netanyahu insisted he had meant 11% withdrawal, so Ross surfaced the idea of using the nature reserves to bridge the 11% and 13% figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwKJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA284|title=Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.–Israel Relationship from Truman to Obama|author=Dennis Ross|page=284|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|year=2015|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
In the provisions on security arrangements of the Interim Agreement, the Palestinian side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Israeli side, against individuals falling under the Israeli side's authority and against their property, just as the Israeli side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Palestinian side, against individuals falling under the Palestinian side's authority and against their property. The two sides also agreed to take legal measures against offenders within their jurisdiction and to prevent incitement against each other by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction.

===A: Security actions===

====1: Outlawing and combating terrorist organizations====
(a) The Palestinian side was to make known its policy of zero tolerance for terror and violence against both sides.
(b) A work plan developed by the Palestinian side would be shared with the U.S. and thereafter implementation would begin immediately to ensure the systematic and effective combat of terrorist organizations and their infrastructure.
(c) In addition to the bilateral Israeli–Palestinian security cooperation, a U.S.–Palestinian committee would meet biweekly to review the steps being taken to eliminate terrorists cells and the support structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets terror.
(d) The Palestinian side would apprehend the specific individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and terror for the purpose of further investigation, and prosecution and punishment of all persons involved in acts of violence and terror.
(e) A U.S.–Palestinian committee would meet to review and evaluate information pertinent to the decisions on prosecution, punishment or other legal measures which affect the status of individuals suspected of abetting or perpetrating acts of violence and terror.

====2: Prohibiting illegal weapons====
(a) The Palestinian side would ensure an effective legal framework is in place to criminalize, in conformity with the prior agreements, any importation, manufacturing or unlicensed sale, acquisition or possession of firearms, ammunition or weapons in areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.
(b) In addition, the Palestinian side would establish and vigorously and continuously implement a systematic program for the collection and appropriate handling of all such illegal items it accordance with the prior agreements. The U.S. agreed to assist in carrying out the program.
(c) A U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would be established to assist and enhance cooperation in preventing the smuggling or other unauthorized introduction of weapons or explosive materials into areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.

====3: Prevention of incitement====
(a) The Palestinian side would issue a decree prohibiting all forms of incitement to violence or terror, and establishing mechanisms for acting systematically against all expressions or threats of violence or terror. This decree would be comparable to the existing Israeli legislation which deals with the same subject.
(b) A U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would meet on a regular basis to monitor cases of possible incitement to violence or terror and to make recommendations and reports on how to prevent such incitement. The Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. sides would each appoint a media specialist, a law enforcement representative, an educational specialist and a current or former elected official to the committee.

===B: Security cooperation===
The two sides agreed that their security cooperation would be based on a spirit of partnership and would include, among other things, the following steps:

====1: Bilateral cooperation====
There would be full bilateral security cooperation between the two sides which would be continuous, intensive and comprehensive.

====2: Forensic cooperation====
There would be an exchange of forensic expertise, training, and other assistance.

====3: Trilateral committee====
In addition to the bilateral Israeli–Palestinian security cooperation, a high-ranking U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would meet as required and not less than biweekly to assess current threats to deal with any impediments to effective security cooperation and coordination and address the steps being taken to combat terror and terrorist organizations.

===C: Other security issues===

====1: Palestinian police force====
(a) The Palestinian side would provide a list of its policemen to the Israeli side in conformity with the prior agreements.
(b) Should the Palestinian side request technical assistance, the U.S. indicated its willingness to help meet those needs in cooperation with other donors.
(c) The Monitoring and Steering Committee would, as part of its functions, monitor the implementation of this provision and brief the U.S.

====2: PLO charter====
The Executive Committee of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the Palestinian Central Council should reaffirm the letter of 22 January 1998 from PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat to President Clinton concerning the nullification of the [[Palestinian National Charter]] provisions that were inconsistent with the letters exchanged between the PLO and the Government of Israel on 9–10 September 1993.

====3: Legal assistance in criminal matters====
Among other forms of legal assistance in criminal matters, there were requests for the arrest and transfer of suspects and defendants. The United States had been requested by the sides to report on a regular basis on the steps being taken to respond to the above requests.

====4: Human rights and the rule of law====
Accepted norms of human rights and the [[rule of law]], and would be guided by the need to protect the public, respect human dignity, and avoid harassment.

==Economic issues==
#The Israeli and Palestinian sides reaffirmed their commitment to improve their relationship and agreed on the need to actively promote economic development in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].
#The Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed on arrangements which would permit the timely opening of the Gaza Industrial Estate.
#Both sides should have renewed negotiations on Safe Passage immediately. Negotiations on the northern route would continue with the goal of reaching agreement as soon as possible.
#The Israeli and Palestinian sides acknowledged the great importance of the Port of Gaza for the development of the Palestinian economy, and the expansion of Palestinian trade.
#The two sides recognized that unresolved legal issues hurt the relationship between the two peoples.
#The Israeli and Palestinian sides also should launch a strategic economic dialogue to enhance their economic relationship.
#The two sides agreed on the importance of continued international donor assistance in helping both sides to implement agreements.

==Permanent status negotiations==
The two sides would immediately resume permanent status negotiations on an accelerated basis and will make a determined effort to achieve the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by 4 May 1999.

==Unilateral actions==
Recognizing the necessity to create a positive environment for the negotiations, neither side should initiate or take any step that would change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Interim Agreement]].

==Political impact in Israel==
The Wye agreement was broadly popular in Israel, with 74% of Israelis supporting the agreement according to early-November polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/human-rights-in-the-wye-river-memorandum|title=Human Rights in the Wye River Memorandum|series=Policywatch|volume=188|author=Matthew Levitt|date=4 November 1998|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prime Minister Netanyahu sensed opposition within his [[Likud]] party and delayed a vote of cabinet approval while he sought public assurances from the Clinton administration about the implementation of Wye. Rather than join a [[national unity government]] with opposition leader [[Ehud Barak]], Netanyahu tried to assuage Likud hardliners by stopping implementation of Wye in early December over confrontations between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''The Missing Peace'', pp. 461–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Disapproval of Netanyahu's policies from Barak's Labor Party and the Likud right resulted in a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] against his government that prompted [[Israeli general election, 1999|general elections in May 1999]]; Barak was victorious and pledged to continue the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.

The '''yellow pages''' are any [[telephone directory]] of [[business]]es, organized by category rather than alphabetically by business name, and in which [[advertising]] is sold. The directories were originally printed on yellow paper, as opposed to [[Telephone directory|white pages]] for non-commercial listings. The traditional term "yellow pages" is now also applied to [[Electronic Yellow Pages|online directories]] of businesses.

In many countries, including [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and elsewhere, "Yellow Pages" (or any applicable local translations), as well as the "Walking Fingers" logo first introduced in the 1970s by the [[Bell System]]-era [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]], are registered [[trademark]]s, though the owner varies from country to country, usually being held by the main national [[telephone]] company (or a subsidiary or spinoff thereof).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yell.com/legal/home.html|title=Conditions of using our website|work=Yell.com|publisher=[[Hibu|Yell Limited]] (UK)|accessdate=2012-10-14|quote=We (Yell Limited or 'Yell') [...] legally own a wide range of intellectual property rights used in and relating to this website, including [...] the trademarks [...] Yellow Pages [...] and related logos...}} (Yell Limited is a subsidiary of [[Hibu]], which was spun off from [[British Telecom]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://360.yellowpages.ca/files/Bogus_billing_EN_complete_19Mars.pdf|title=Beware of Fraudulent Participation|publisher=[[Yellow Pages Group]]|accessdate=2012-10-14|quote=But there’s only one true Yellow Pages directory that carries the Yellow Pages brand and Walking Fingers &amp; Design in Canada. Yellow Pages Group is the exclusive owner of these trademarks in the country.}} (Yellow Pages Group is a spin-off of [[Bell Canada]].)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[United States]], neither the name nor the logo was registered as trademarks by AT&amp;T, and are freely used by several publishers. This can sometimes be very confusing as YP (AT&amp;T) and yellow pages are similar in nature.

==History==
The name and concept of "yellow pages" came about in 1883, when a printer in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], working on a regular telephone directory ran out of white paper and used yellow paper instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/r-for-recovery-plan-yell-plots-digital-future-2285553.html | title=R for recovery plan? Yell plots digital future | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=16 June 2011 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Clark | date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, [[R. H. Donnelley|Reuben H. Donnelley]] created the first official Yellow Pages directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/xyzstartinventions/a/yellow_pages.htm |title=Yellow Pages – History of the Yellow Pages |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/TQ0310441/odds/odds_main.html |title=M E D I A * M A T T E R S * odds &amp; ends |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the expression ''yellow pages'' is used globally, in both [[English language|English-speaking]] and non-English speaking countries. In the [[United States]], it refers to the category, while in some other countries it is a registered name and therefore a proper noun. The term ''Yellow Pages'' is not a registered name within the United States and is freely used by many companies. Telephone directories using the official internet address "yellowpages.xx" exist in 75 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phonebookoftheworld.com/yellowpages.htm |title=Official Yellow Pages around the World|publisher=phonebookoftheworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are edited by many different phone companies and directory publishers, mostly independent from each other.

In [[Belgium]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Romania]], the yellow pages are known as the ''[[Golden Pages]]''. In [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], the yellow pages are known as ''Gelbe Seiten'', and in [[Sweden]] as ''Gula Sidorna'', which in both cases means the yellow pages. In [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]], the yellow pages are known as ''Páginas Amarelas''. In [[Spain]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Argentina]] and other countries in [[Latin America]], the yellow pages are known as ''páginas amarillas''. In [[France]] and in [[francophone Canada]], they're known as ''Pages jaunes''. In [[Italy]] and [[Languages of Switzerland#Italian|Italian Switzerland]] they are known as ''Pagine gialle''. In [[Japan]], the yellow pages are known as ''Town Page''. In [[Sri Lanka]], the yellow pages are known as the ''Rainbow Pages'', or the ''silver page''.

A particular yellow pages is a print directory which provides an alphabetical listing of businesses within a specific geographical area (e.g., the Tampa Bay area), which are segregated under headings for similar types of businesses (e.g., plumbers). Traditionally these directories have been published by the local phone company, but there are numerous independent directory publishers. Some yellow pages publishers focus on a particular demographic (e.g., Christian yellow pages or business pages).

Yellow pages directories are usually published annually, and distributed for free to all residences and businesses within a given coverage area. The majority of listings are plain and in small black text. The yellow pages publishers generate profit by selling advertising space or listings under each heading. Advertising may be sold by a direct sales force or by approved agencies (CMR's). Available advertising space varies among publishers and ranges from bold names up to four color twin page ads ("double trucks").

In the United States, the predominant yellow pages are [[DEX One]]'s DEX, the [[AT&amp;T Advertising &amp; Publishing|AT&amp;T Real Yellow Pages]], [[Yell Group|Yellowbook]], and the [[SuperMedia|Verizon Superpages]].
[[Image:Yellowbook logo.png|thumb|right|Yellowbook Logo used in the United States]]

Business listings used for publication are obtained by several methods. Local phone companies that publish yellow pages directories rely on their own customer lists and include business listings that are provided by [[Incumbent local exchange carrier|incumbent local exchange carriers]] (ILECs). Business owners that utilize phone services other than the local phone company (typically a Bell Company) should make certain that their information has been sent to the publisher for printing in upcoming directories.

Advertising in yellow pages directories requires payment in full prior to printing or may be billed monthly over the life of the contract, which is usually 12 months. Typically, a sales representative will assist the customer in creating their ad design and provides a Proof Copy for review and approval. Advertisers should be aware that many contracts have automatic renewal clauses and require action on the part of the advertiser to end future billing.

Yellow pages print usage is reported to be declining with both advertisers and shoppers increasingly turning to Internet search engines and online directories. According to a study by Knowledge Networks/SRI, in 2007, print yellow pages were referenced 13.4 billion times, while Internet yellow pages references increased to 3.8 billion, up from 2006’s 3.3 billion online searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/new-research-shows-overall-yellow-pages-usage-growing-172-billion-searches-in-2007-825649.htm New Research Shows Overall Yellow Pages Usage Growing &amp;ndash; 17.2 Billion Searches in 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most yellow pages publishers have attempted to create online versions of their print directories. These online versions are referred to as IYP or Internet yellow pages. Independent ad agencies or Internet marketing consultants can assist business owners in determining sound opportunities for yellow pages advertising and provide objective information on usage, possession and preferences.

Archived yellow pages and telephone directories are important tools in local [[historical research]], trademark litigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Adam|title=Trademark Law: protection, enforcement, and licensing|year=2005|publisher=Aspen Law and Business|pages=10–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genealogy]].

==Logo==
[[Image:Yellow Pages logo.svg|thumb|right|Canadian yellow pages logo]]

The "Walking Fingers" logo was created by Henry Alexander&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertpaulgalleries.com/level.itml/icOid/51 |title=Henry Alexander Obituary |publisher=Robert Paul Galleries |date= |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a well known New England artist. Upon graduation from the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Mr. Alexander began a freelance career as an illustrator and commercial designer. He formed a long association with the New England Telephone Company lasting thirty-one years. In 1962 he designed the "walking fingers" logo and within a year it became the national trademark for their yellow pages.

AT&amp;T, the creator and owner of the most famous three-fingered version of the "Walking Fingers" logo, never applied for a trademark on the logo. While they eventually received a trademark on a different version of the logo, the version with the three fingers was not considered by AT&amp;T to be proprietary and they in fact allowed any telephone directory to use it.&lt;ref name="georgetownll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/9_opinions/91-1461.html |title=Bellsouth v. Datanational |publisher=Ll.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the 1970s, many cities ran television ads showing a disembodied hand "walking" across an open copy of the Yellow Pages, with the slogan "Let Your Fingers Do the Walking."

The Bell System later applied for a trademark on the logo but had their trademark denied on the grounds that it "had become a generic indicator of the yellow pages without regard to any particular source."&lt;ref name="georgetownll"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Bell began using a trademarkable logo with a lightbulb instead of the walking fingers, but returned to the walking fingers two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/bell_logos.html |title=Bell System Memorial- Bell Logo History |publisher=Porticus.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the familiar "walking fingers" logo is not protected as a trademark and may be used by anyone. This logo is used in varying forms by almost every yellow pages publisher; however, there are companies that use it to imitate mainstream publishers.
In Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, Israel and the Netherlands the directory, although using the yellow pages logo, is called "Golden Pages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.co.il/?arena=Business&amp;language=EN&amp;page=Home&amp;previousPage=Home |title=D Website |publisher=D.co.il |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldenpages.ie/displayhome.ds&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet yellow pages==
Online business directories are branded as IYP or Internet yellow pages. On a broader scale, they can be classified as vertical directories. There are consumer oriented and business oriented varieties. Providers of IYP offer online advertising.

According to several reports the search term "yellow pages" was in the top 5 highest revenue generator of all search terms in Google's AdWords program in 2010. Experian/Hitwise reported in January 2011 that the search term "yellow pages" was one of the top 50 search terms across all search engines and all search terms(millions of search terms). This makes "yellow pages" one of the most searched for things on the Internet.{{speculation inline|date=November 2014}}

The Local Search Association released an online search usage study in June 2011. Their study of US consumers on how they find local businesses. 57% had used an Internet yellow pages in the past year. 58% had used a newspaper and 74% used a print phone book and 76% used a search engine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The Yellow Pages Association said in February 2011 that 75 percent of adults in the United States still used print yellow pages and that for every $1 in investment, businesses returned $15.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;

In 2009, Burke, a media research organization released a "Local Media Tracking Survey". A couple of highlights of the study found that users of Internet yellow pages reported that 36% of the time they used an IYP they made a purchase (more than 1 out of 3 leads purchased something). It was further reported that a large number of users had no company in mind when they began their search on Internet yellow pages. {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

It takes many keywords and search terms to cover a small businesses "category" or "heading" for search engines. Internet yellow pages allow a small business to advertise locally and target their audience with single familiar categories with such as "attorney" or "florist" or "plumbing".

It was reported by Borrell and Associates(a media research group) in March 2012 that online directories have a 12.6% share of the $19 billion local online advertising. {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

IYP offers listings differently from standard search engines. Where search engines return results based on relevancy to the true search term, IYP returns results based on a geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenchair.net/articles/Local-Search-and-Internet-Yellow-Pages.htm |title=Local Search and Internet Yellow Pages – A Whole New vocabulary for Small Business Sales &amp;#124; Green Chair Marketing Group |publisher=Greenchair.net |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by independent companies such as Nielson and comScore have shown that Internet yellow pages have a smaller percentage of total Internet searches, 85% of all Internet searches, occur on the major search engines Google, Yahoo and Bing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

IYP is classified as a [[Local search (Internet)|local search]] directory which provides content with the added ability to refine the search to find the needed service. The search engine prioritizes local businesses in its results rather than the results being dominated by regional or national companies. All services offer paid advertising options which typically offer preferred placement on search results pages.

==Environmental concerns==
In later years, the yellow pages industry faced scrutiny from environmentalist groups who claim printed yellow pages are a wasteful resource, citing statistics that by 2011 nearly 70% of all Americans rarely or never used printed phone directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Website Lets You Opt-Out Of Yellow Pages Delivery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/yellow-pages-opt-out-website_n_818050.html?ir=Green|publisher=The Huffington Post | first=Catharine|last=Smith|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found that a majority of consumers continue to use Yellow Pages. Approximately 58% of working U.S. adults said they use phone books at home, work or both, according to a 2013 survey by RingCentral that appeared in USA Today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RingCentral In the News: PC Magazine, The Economist and More |url=http://blog.ringcentral.com/2013/04/ringcentral-in-the-news-pc-magazine-the-economist-and-more |publisher=RingCentral |date=19 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Product Stewardship Institute claims local governments spend $54 million a year to dispose of unwanted phone books and $9 million to recycle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phone Book Project|url=http://www.productstewardship.us/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=59|publisher=Product Stewardship Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phone books use low grade glues and are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery. Publishers note that phone book directories are 100% recyclable and are made using soy-based and non-toxic inks, glues and dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrive in Perpetuity: 2012 Sustainability Report |url=http://localsearchassociation.org/Resource.ashx?sn=n2012_Sustainability_Report |publisher=Local Search Association |date=23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[San Francisco]] became the first city in the US to restrict yellow page distribution to people who opt in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco effectively bans the Yellow Pages|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/money/2011/05/san-francisco-effectively-bans-the-yellow-pages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was being sued in federal court by the Local Search Association on freedom of speech grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phone Book Industry Takes S.F.'s Yellow Pages Ban to Federal Court|url=http://sfist.com/2011/09/01/phone_book_industry_really_wants_yo.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912084724/http://sfist.com/2011/09/01/phone_book_industry_really_wants_yo.php|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sierra Club, 1.6 million phone books were distributed annually in San Francisco, producing 3600 tons of waste, $1 million in disposal costs, and 6180 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Club's position statement on yellow pages|url=http://sanfranciscobay.sierraclub.org/yellow-pages.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed, and the Mayor signed, an ordinance that repealed the Yellow Pages Distribution Pilot Program (Ordinance 130186).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Code – Repealing Yellow Pages Distribution Pilot Program |url= http://sfgov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1306733&amp;GUID=ED2F3ED0-C4B1-4C34-88AB-FFC748595558&amp;Options=ID |publisher=City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors |date=7 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, Yellow Pages Association and the Association of Directory Publishers started the yellowpagesoptout.com web site allowing anyone in the United States to choose not to receive directories. The site remains active in 2018.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2018/02/23/answer-man-classic-who-wrote-billy-grahams-my-answer-column/363025002/|title=Answer Man Classic: Who wrote Billy Graham's 'My Answer' column?|last=Boyle|first=John|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=23 February 2018|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Municipal Solid Waste report classified directories as the smallest contributor of paper and paperboard products to the solid waste stream, representing only 0.3% – significantly less than all other paper product categories such as newspapers, magazines and books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2009 Facts and Figures |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2009rpt.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the EPA stopped measuring directories separately from newspapers, indicating the minor impact of directories on municipal waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Tables and Figures for 2010 |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/2010_MSW_Tables_and_Figures_508.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow Pages publishers reduced paper usage by nearly 60% between 2007–2012, and were projected to increase reduction to more than 60% by the end of 2013, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulp and Paper Products Council |url= http://www.pppc.org/info/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA’s 2011 Municipal Waste report showed that approximately 73% of phone directory, newspaper and mechanical papers were recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2011 Facts and Figures |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/MSWcharacterization_fnl_060713_2_rpt.pdf |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of Print Directories==

In September 2017 the UK publisher of Yellow Pages, Yell, announced that the business would be fully digitised from January 2019, ending the publication's 51-year run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Pages to stop printing from January 2019 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/01/yellow-pages-to-stop-printing-from-january-2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
