'''Aclima''' (also '''Luluwa''') according to some religious traditions was the oldest daughter of Adam and Eve, the twin sister of [[Cain]] and wife of Abel.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, E. Cobham. "Brewer's dictionary of phrase and fable." (1894).&lt;/ref&gt; According to these traditions, she was the first female human who was born naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Michael. "The Death of Adam—An Armenian Adam Book." Harvard Theological Review 59.3 (1966): 283-291..&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic and rabbinic tradition, a marriage between Aclima and Abel was proposed and arranged by their father Adam. In order to commence contentment from Aclima's twin brother, Adam (their father) suggested that a sacrifice be made, yet sacrifice was subsequently rejected by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brewer|first1=Cobham|title=Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|date=2001|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/stream/dictionnairedes01coll#page/n151/mode/2up Cain]", ''Dictionnaire des sciences occultes'' (''Encycloedie Theologique'' Vol. 48), ed. [[Jacques Paul Migne]], cols. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind the commotion was that Cain viewed Aclima as being aesthetically more attractive than [[Awan (religious figure)|Awan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Margaret|title=Apocrypha Arabica|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Kalmana or Calmana; Balbira==
Some sources in the Eastern Orthodox traditions state Aclima's name as ''Calmana'' or ''Calmanna''. Alternative transliterations of her name include ''Aclimah'', ''Aclimia'', ''Aclimiah'', ''Klimia''.&lt;ref&gt;Burrington, Gilbert. An Arrangement of the Genealogies in the Old Testament and Apocrypha: To which are Added, from the Same Authorities, a Selection of Single Names, and Chronological Tables of the Kings of Egypt, Syria, and Assyria: with Notes Critical, Philological, and Explanatory; and Copious Indexes, in Two Volumes. Vol. 1. Rivington, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Seder Hadorot]]'', Aclima is called ''Kalmana''.&lt;ref name="Seder Hadorot"&gt;Seder Hadorot 8a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6uK5pa3R4d8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Balbira+Abel Abarbanel Gen. 4,1 as cited by Codex Judaica]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{bibleverse||Genesis|4:17|NKJV}} states that after he had killed Abel, "Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore [[Enoch (son of Cain)|Enoch]]". In an effort to explain where Cain and Abel acquired wives, some traditional sources stated that each child of [[Adam and Eve]] was born with a twin who became their mate. According to the ''Seder HaDorot'', the wife and twin sister of Cain was named Kalmana, and the wife and twin of Abel was Balbira.&lt;ref name="Seder Hadorot" /&gt;

The sister of Cain was named ''Kalmana'' in the [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]] (first Greek redaction) II.1.,&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Lolos, ''Die Apokalypse des Ps.-Methodios''. Beiträge zur klassischen Philologie 83. Meisenheim am Glan: Hain, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Calmana'' in the [[Golden Legend]]. The poet [[Petrus Riga]] (1140–1209) included ''Calmana'' in his famous poem ''Aurora'', and this could have been a source for her appearance in [[Petrus Comestor|Peter Comestor's]] [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica ''Historia Scholastica'']. Comestor's Biblical narrative text then served as the standard textbook for Biblical education for centuries.

==Luluwa==
Some religious sources describe Aclima's name as ''Luluwa''. She is described as the most beautiful of the early daughters of Adam and Eve. However, Cain reportedly hated her whilst in Eve's womb with her. The name ''Luluwa'' means "beautiful". This narrative was recorded in the ''Forgotten Books Of Eden'', which itself is a exegesis of earlier apocryphal texts. &lt;ref&gt;Platt, Rutherford H. ''The Forgotten Books Of Eden'' (Annotated Edition). Jazzybee Verlag, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Rafid''' ({{lang-ar|الرفيد}}) is a village in the [[Rashaya District]], in the southeastern area of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]]. Its population is estimated to be 3,000. Its inhabitants are predominantly [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]]s. The village has two [[mosques]], two schools, two pharmacies, and a telecommunications facility.

==Overview==
The oldest part of the village lies halfway up Mount Baaloul (Jabal Baaloul) on the eastern slope. It is widely accepted by the inhabitants of the town that the town was originally located on the top of the mountain but was re-located after a civil strife had subsided over 400 years ago. Neighboring localities include Beere, Muhaydhi, Khirbet-Rouha, and Mdouckha. The town is located about {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Beirut]] and {{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. From Al-Rafid, Jabal -Al-Sheikh ([[Mount Hermon]]) can be seen with its majestic snow-capped peak.

The village was occupied first by [[PLO]] forces in the late 1970s, then by [[Israel]]i forces in the early 1980s. Before Israel's invasion, the town suffered from Israeli warplane attacks. In one incident, the school was bombed, killing a mother and her four children. Israel said that the school was being used as a base for [[PLO]] forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">'''Antipater of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀντίπατρος ὁ Τύριος}}; fl. 1st century BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] and a friend of [[Cato the Younger]] and [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonhard Schmitz]] claimed ([[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0213.html ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' (1867) Page 204] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405181455/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0213.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}) that the Antipater of Tyre who was the friend of Cato, was a different, earlier Antipater of Tyre to the one mentioned by Cicero. Schmitz did not explain why; he may have thought (incorrectly) that a teacher of Cato could not have lived down to 45 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Antipater lived after, or was at least younger than, [[Panaetius]]. Cicero, in speaking of him, says, that he died "recently at [[Athens]]", which must mean shortly before 45 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D86 ''de Officiis'', ii. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned by [[Strabo]] as a "famous philosopher" from Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/16B*.html ''Geography'', xvi. 2.] 24&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater is said to have befriended Cato when Cato was a young man, and introduced him to Stoic philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/cato_you.html ''Cato the Younger''. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Having gained the intimate acquaintance of Antipater the Tyrian, the Stoic philosopher, he [Cato] devoted himself to the study, above everything, of moral and political doctrine.}}

==Works==
Little is known about his writings. From Cicero we can perhaps infer that Antipater, like Panaetius, wrote a work ''On Duties'' ({{lang-la|de Officiis}}):
{{quote|Antipater of Tyre, a Stoic philosopher who recently died at Athens, claims that two points were overlooked by Panaetius — the care of health and of property. |Cicero, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D86 ''de Officiis'', ii. 86]}}

[[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref name="diog1"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, [[s:Lives of the Eminent Philosophers/Book VII|''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, vii.'']] 139, 142, 148&lt;/ref&gt; refers to another work by him called ''On the Cosmos'' ({{lang-el|περὶ κόσμου}}):
{{quote|The whole world is a living being, endowed with soul and reason, and having [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] for its ruling principle: so says Antipater of Tyre in the eighth book of his treatise ''On the Cosmos''.|Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 139}}

Construction of the complex began in 1984 and the museum was officially opened in March 1990 by [[Abdul Latif Jassim Kanoo]]. It was built to "accommodate a comprehensive and valuable collection of the [[Qur'an]] and other rare manuscripts", a concept which, according to a regional magazine, is unique in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beit Al Qur'an|url=http://www.timeoutbahrain.com/community/features/10362-beit-al-quran|publisher=TimeOut Bahrain|accessdate=5 October 2012|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The core of the museum's holdings is Kanoo's own collection of Qur'anic manuscripts and Islamic art, since he was reportedly said to have been an avid collector. As his collection grew, he reportedly came to feel a strong sense of responsibility toward the rare manuscripts he had acquired. In 1990, he donated his collection to the museum he established to operate a first-of-its-kind institution dedicated to the service of the Qur'an and the preservation of historic manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Aramco/&gt;

The establishment of the institute was funded completely by public donations, with added help from a variety of people from all walks of life in Bahrain, ranging from heads of state to school children. The facilities at Beit Al Qur'an are free to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beit al-Quran in Manama, Bahrain|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bahrain/manama/sights/museum/beit-al-quran|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution and its museum house an internationally celebrated collection of historic Quranic manuscripts from various parts of the Islamic world, from China in the East and to Spain in the West, representing a progression of [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions from the first [[Hijri]] century (622–722 AD) and of the [[Islamic Golden Age]], to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muqueem Khan|first=Shaista|title=Islamic Manuscripts|url=http://ddms.usim.edu.my/bitstream/handle/123456789/1923/ISLAMIC%20MANUSCRIPTS.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=World Congress of Muslim Librarian &amp; Information Scientists|accessdate=17 October 2012|pages=10, 11|date=November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013841/http://ddms.usim.edu.my/bitstream/handle/123456789/1923/ISLAMIC%20MANUSCRIPTS.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BNA&gt;{{cite web|title=بيت القرآن يستأنف فعالياته غداً السبت الاول من سبتمبر|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/522645|publisher=Bahrain News Agency|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
{{Quran}}
The Beit al Qur'an complex is open to the public on Saturdays to Wednesdays from 9am to 12pm and 4pm to 6pm respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bait al Quran |url=http://www.moc.gov.bh/en/top10/Name,7534,en.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121130040805/http://www.moc.gov.bh/en/top10/Name,7534,en.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 November 2012 |publisher=Ministry of Culture (Bahrain) |accessdate=25 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex's exterior designs are based on an old fashioned 12th-century mosque.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; The entire complex itself comprises a [[mosque]], a [[library]], an [[auditorium]], a [[madrasa]], and a [[museum]] that consists of ten exhibition halls. A large stained glass dome covers the grand hall and mosque. The [[Mihrab]], the sign indicating the direction to Mecca, is covered in blue ceramic tiles with engraved Al Qursi Qur'anic verse.&lt;ref name="TO Bahrain"/&gt;

The library consists of over 50,000 books and [[manuscripts]] in three languages – [[Arabic]], English and French – that are mostly on Islam. The institute does specialise in [[Islamic art]], and many of the [[reference books]] have international importance. The library and its reading rooms are open to the public during working hours with internet access available, as well as providing individual rooms for researchers and specialists.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt;

There is also an auditorium – named the Mohammed Bin Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa Lecture Hall – which can accommodate up to 150 people, and is mainly used for [[lectures]] and [[Academic conference|conferences]]. Guest speakers are brought to Bahrain from many countries, including the US, UK, and France. The conference hall is often made available for general use for public lectures in cooperation with different societies and institutions in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="TO Bahrain"/&gt;

The Yousuf Bin Ahmad Kanoo School for [[Islamic Studies|Qur'anic Studies]] is located within the site. The school offers seven study areas fully equipped with computers and modern aids, with separate classes for women and children learning the Qur'an.&lt;ref name="TO Bahrain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beit Al Qur'an in Bahrain|url=http://www.timeoutbahrain.com/art/features/17229-beit-al-quran-in-bahrain|publisher=TimeOut Bahrain|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The '''Al Hayat Museum''' is the complex's most recognized establishments; it consists of ten halls spread over two floors, exhibiting rare Qur'anic manuscripts from different periods, starting from the first century [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (700&amp;nbsp;AD). Manuscripts on parchments that originate from [[Saudi Arabia]] ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]), [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]], are present in the museum.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; The manuscripts undergo special procedures for the preservation of these artifacts, in order to protect them from damages. Some of the artifacts present in the museum include a rare manuscript of the Qur'an, dating to 1694&amp;nbsp;AD and was printed in Germany. The museum also houses the world's oldest translated copy of the Qur'an, which was translated to [[Latin]] in [[Switzerland]] and dates to 955&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="BNA" /&gt; The first copy of the Qur'an, written during the reign of [[Caliph]] [[Uthman ibn Affan]], is on display in the museum alongside a number of small copies of the Qur'an, which could only be read using optical instruments.&lt;ref name="BNA" /&gt;

Grains, peas and rice, dating from the 14th century in present-day [[Pakistan]], which contain surahs engraved into them, are displayed in the museum.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt; The exhibits include a rare number of gold and copper [[pottery]] and glass from different eras of Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Egypt, respectively.&lt;ref name=BNA/&gt;

The works of Islamic scholars, such as [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] are preserved in the museum. It has been claimed to have been "''the only institute in the world dedicated to the Qur'an and Qur'anic studies''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic Textbook | url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/languages/pdf/Frangieh_prefaceintro.pdf | publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a rough estimate of fifty thousand Buddhists, '''[[Buddhism]]''' is practiced by around 0.5% of the [[Czech Republic|'''Czech''']] population. The World Buddhist Directory lists 70 Buddhist places in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhanet.net/wbd/country.php?country_id%3D58 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014214240/http://buddhanet.net/wbd/country.php?country_id=58 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic|Vietnamese-speaking]] communities form the mainstay of the Buddhist population in the Czech Republic. The Vietnamese practice mainly [[Mahayana Buddhism]] with some syncretism of [[ancestor worship]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. They represent roughly from two thirds to three quarters of the Buddhist community alongside being the largest Asian community in the Czech Republic, numbering over 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.czso.cz/csu/cizinci.nsf/t/45002E12A0/$File/c01t01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder consists of a significant number of [[Czechs]] who have converted (mainly to [[Theravada]] or [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]) and the smaller communities of [[Chinese people in the Czech Republic|overseas Chinese]] and [[Koreans in the Czech Republic|Koreans]].

Buddhism is found mainly where the Vietnamese-speaking people reside, notably in the cities of [[Prague]] and [[Cheb]]. ''Thien An'' Buddhist Pagoda in the northern province of [[Varnsdorf]] was the first Vietnamese style temple to be consecrated in the Czech Republic, in January 2008. The pagoda was completed in September 2007 and now serves as a center of Vietnamese culture and teaching Vietnamese language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thanhniennews.com/overseas/?catid=12&amp;newsid=35384&lt;/ref&gt; There are also ten Korean Buddhist temples in the Czech Republic, with three each in Prague and [[Brno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/search.php?keyword=+korean+&amp;prev_keyword%5B%5D=+korean+&amp;newsearch=new&amp;search=Begin+Search&amp;country_id=58&amp;province_id=0|title=Korean Buddhist congregations in the Czech Republic|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|year=2006|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vajrayana practitioners are mainly centered on the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools. The [[Karma Kagyu]] tradition has established about 50 centers and meditation groups. The [[Diamond Way]] tradition of Vajrayana Buddhism, founded and directed by [[Ole Nydahl]] is active in both the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]].

A '''censer''', '''incense burner''' or '''perfume burner''' (these may be [[hyphen]]ated) is a vessel made for burning [[incense]] or perfume in some solid form. These vessels vary greatly in size, form, and material of construction, and have been in use since ancient times in many cultures, in both secular and religious contexts. They may consist earthenware]] bowls or [[fire pot]]s to intricately carved [[silver]] or [[gold]] vessels, small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high. Many designs use [[openwork]] to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning [[incense]] has [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[religious]] connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer.

Some types could also be used as [[pomander]]s, where the perfume diffuses slowly by evaporation rather than burning.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', p. 87, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For direct-burning incense, pieces of the incense are burned by placing them directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or [[thurible]].&lt;ref name=CI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07716a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|author=P. Morrisroe. Transcribed by Kevin Cawley.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect-burning incense, also called "non-combustible incense",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scents-of-earth.com/makyourownna.html|title=Scents of earth|publisher=www.scents-of-earth.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form, leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion. The use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions. This incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material. Finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area. The heat is traditionally provided by [[charcoal]] or glowing embers.

For home use of granulated incense, small, concave charcoal briquettes are sold. One lights the corner of the briquette on fire, then places it in the censer and extinguishes the flame. After the glowing sparks traverse the entire briquette, it is ready to have incense placed on it.

For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. Flames on the incense are then fanned or blown out, with the incense continuing to burn without a flame on its own.

Censers made for stick incense are also available; these are simply a long, thin plate of wood, metal, or ceramic, bent up and perforated at one end to hold the incense. They serve to catch the ash of the burning incense stick.

In Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers.

The history of censers in [[Chinese culture]] probably began in the late [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (770–256 BCE). The [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]] words meaning "censer" are [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''lu'' ([[Wikt:爐|爐]] or [[Wikt:炉|炉]] "brazier; stove; furnace"), which originated as a type of [[Chinese bronzes#Miscellaneous|Chinese bronze]]. ''Xianglu'' ([[Wikt:香|香]]爐, with "incense") "incense burner; censer" is the most common term. ''Xunlu'' ([[Wikt:熏|熏]]爐, with "smoke; fumigate; cure (food) with smoke", or [[Wikt:薰|薰]]爐, with "fragrance; an aromatic grass") means "small censer, esp. for fumigating or scenting clothing; censing basket", which [[Edward H. Schafer]] described.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Censing baskets" were globes of hollow metal, pierced with intricate floral or animal designs; within the globe, an iron cup, suspended on gimbals, contained the burning incense. They were used to perfume garments and bedclothes, and even to kill insects.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. (1963). ''The Golden Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics''. University of California Press. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Shoulu'' ([[Wikt:手|手]]爐, with "hand") means "hand-held censer; handwarmer".

The ''boshanlu'' (博山爐 "universal mountain censer" or ''boshan xianglu'' 博山香爐) or [[hill censer]], which became popular during the era of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BCE), displayed a microcosmic [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred mountain]] (esp. [[Kunlun Mountains|Mount Kunlun]] or [[Mount Penglai]]). These elaborate censers were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Susan N. (1992). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20062588 "Boshanlu: Mountain Censers of the Western Han Period: A Typological and Iconological Analysis"], ''Archives of Asian Art'' 45:6-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han Dynasty scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] wrote a (c. 40 BCE) ''boshanlu'' inscription:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I value this perfect utensil, lofty and steep as a mountain! Its top is like [[Mount Hua|Hua Shan]] in yet its foot is a bronze plate. It contains rare perfumes, red flames and green smoke; densely ornamented are its sides, and its summit joins azure heaven. A myriad animals are depicted on it. Ah, from it sides I can see ever further than Li Lou'' [who had legendary eyesight].&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph and Lu Gwei-Djen (1974). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality'']. Cambridge University Press. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archeologists excavated many (c. second century BCE) ''boshanlu'' at [[Mawangdui]], and some contained the remains of ashes. Analysis revealed aromatic plants such as ''maoxiang'' (茅香 "[[Imperata cylindrica]], thatch grass"), ''gaoliangjiang'' (高良薑 "[[Galangal]]"), ''xinyi'' (辛夷 "[[Magnolia liliiflora]], Mulan magnolia), and ''gaoben'' (藁本"[[Ligusticum]] sinense, Chinese lovage"). Scholars presume burning these grasses "may have facilitated communication with spirits" during funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson (1992), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the sinologist and historian [[Joseph Needham]], some early [[Daoist]]s adapted censers for the [[religious and spiritual use of cannabis]]. The (ca. 570 CE) Daoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' (無上秘要 "Supreme Secret Essentials"), recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shangqing School]] of Daoism provides a good example. The Shangqing scriptures were written by [[Yang Xi]] (330– c. 386 CE) during alleged visitations by Daoist [[Xian (Taoism)|"immortals"]], and Needham believed Yang was "aided almost certainly by cannabis".&lt;ref name="needham151"&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536 CE), who edited the official Shangqing canon, also compiled the ''Mingyi bielu'' (名醫別錄 "Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians"). It noted that ''mabo'' (麻勃 "cannabis flowers"), "are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians ([''shujia''] 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future."&lt;ref name="needham151" /&gt; Needham concluded,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus all in all there is much reason for thinking that the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with hallucinogenic smokes, using techniques which arose directly out of liturgical observance. … At all events the incense-burner remained the centre of changes and transformations associated with worship, sacrifice, ascending perfume of sweet savour, fire, combustion, disintegration, transformation, vision, communication with spiritual beings, and assurances of immortality. ''Wai tan'' and ''nei tan'' met around the incense-burner. Might one not indeed think of it as their point of origin?&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu  (1974), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These ''[[Waidan]]'' (外丹 "outer alchemy") and ''[[neidan]]'' (內丹 "inner alchemy") are the primary divisions of [[Chinese alchemy]].

Chinese censers were popularly shaped like a bird or animal, sometimes designed so that the incense smoke would issue from the mouth.

Early Islamic vessels are usually called perfume burners, and had no specific religious function, but were widely used in houses. Animal shapes, often [[lynx]] or other cats, in [[bronze]] or [[brass]] with openwork bodies are found from the 11th century until the Mongol conquests of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', pp 86-87, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of other types were used at different times.

==Japan==
'''Koro''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 香炉, ''kōro'') is a [[Japan]]ese censer often used in [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese tea ceremonies]].

Examples are usually of globular form with three feet, made in [[pottery]], [[Imari porcelain]], [[Kutani ware]], [[Kakiemon]], [[Satsuma ware|Satsuma]], [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] or [[bronze]].
In Japan a similar censer called a {{Nihongo|''egōro''|柄香炉}} is used by several Buddhist sects. The egōro is usually made of brass with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, makkō powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method is known as Sonae-kō (Religious Burning).&lt;ref name=JI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanese-incense.com/sonaeko.htm|title=Buddhist Incense – Sonae ko|author=Japanese-Incense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tapadera de incensario teotihuacana (M. América Inv.91-11-45) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Teotihuacan]] censer lid. Museo de América, Madrid]]
Used domestically and ceremonially in Mesoamerica, particularly in the large Central-Mexican city of [[Teotihuacan]] (100–600 AD) and in the many kingdoms belonging to the [[Maya civilization]], were ceramic incense burners. The most common materials for construction were [[Adobe]], plumbate&lt;ref&gt;Bruhns, Karen Olsen. “Plumbate Origins Revisited.” American Antiquity, vol. 45, no. 	04, 1980, pp. 845–848., doi:10.2307/280154.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[earthenware]]. These materials can be dried by the sun and were locally sourced, making them the perfect material for a Mayan craftsman. Censers vary in decoration. Some are painted using a [[fresco]] style technique or decorated with ''adornos''&lt;ref&gt;Feinman, Gary M., and Dorie Reents-Budet. "Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period." The Hispanic American Historical Review 75, no. 3 (1995): 457. doi:10.2307/2517243.&lt;/ref&gt;, or small ceramic ornaments. These decorations usually depicted shells, beads, butterflies, flowers, and other symbols with religious significance that could to increase rainfall, agricultural abundance, fertility, wealth, good fortune or ease the transition of souls into the underworld&lt;ref&gt;Morehart, Christopher T., Abigail Meza Peñaloza, Carlos Serrano Sánchez, Emily Mcclung De Tapia, and Emilio Ibarra Morales. "Human Sacrifice During the Epiclassic Period in the Northern Basin of Mexico." Latin American Antiquity 23, no. 04 (2012): 426-48. doi:10.7183/1045-6635.23.4.426.&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period." The Hispanic American Historical Review 75, no. 3 (1995): 457. doi:10.2307/2517243.&lt;/ref&gt;, artists used colorful paints. 

Used to communicate with the Gods, these censers functioned for acts of religious purification. Made up of [[copal]] (tree resin), rubber, and chewing gum, the incense produced what was described as "the odor of the center of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Michael D. The Maya, Seventh Edition. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mayan censers, which had a reservoir for incense on top of a vertical shaft were highly elaborate during the Classic period (600–900 AD), particularly in the kingdom of [[Palenque]], and usually show the head of a Mayan deity. In Post-Classic Yucatán, particularly in the capital of the kingdom of [[Mayapan]], censers were found in great numbers, often shaped as an aged priest or deity. Craftsmen produced Mayan censers in many sizes, some just a few inches in height, others, several feet tall.

====Chain censer====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], as well as the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], censers ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''thymiateria'') are similar in design to the Western [[thurible]]. This fourth chain passes through a hole the hasp and slides in order to easily raise the lid. There will often be 12 small bells attached to the chains, symbolising the preaching of the [[Twelve Apostles]], where one of the bells has been silenced to symbolize the rebel [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Herrera, Matthew D. ''[http://www.smellsbells.com/incense.pdf Holy Smoke: The Use of Incense in the Catholic Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912022346/http://www.smellsbells.com/incense.pdf |date=2012-09-12 }}.'' San Luis Obispo:  Tixlini Scriptorium, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditions the censer with bells is normally used only by a bishop. Before a deacon begins a censing, he will take the censer to the priest (or the bishop, if he is present) for a [[blessing]]. The censers, charcoal and incense are kept in the [[diaconicon]] (sacristy) Entrance with the censer at Great Vespers.

The censer is used much more frequently in the Eastern churches: typically at every [[vespers]], [[matins]], and [[Divine Liturgy]], as well as [[pannikhida]]s (memorial services), and other occasional offices. If a [[deacon]] is present, he typically does much of the ''censing;'' otherwise, the [[priest]] will perform the censing. Unordained servers or acolytes are permitted to prepare and carry the censer, but may not swing it during prayers. Liturgical ''Censing'' is the practice of swinging a censer suspended from chains towards something or someone, typically an [[icon]] or person, so that smoke from the burning incense travels in that direction. Burning incense represents the prayers of the church rising towards [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  One commonly sung [[psalm]] during the censing is "Let my prayer arise in Thy sight as incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+141&amp;version=NIV Psalm 141:2, New International Version]&lt;/ref&gt;  When a deacon or priest performs a full censing of the [[temple]] (church building), he will often say [[Psalm 51]] quietly to himself.

====Hand censer====

In addition to the chain censer described above, a "hand censer" (Greek: Κατσί ''katzi or katzion'') is used on certain occasions. This device has no chains and consists of a bowl attached to a handle, often with bells attached. The lid is normally attached to the bowl with a hinge.

In Greek practice, particularly as observed on [[Mount Athos]], during the portion of Vespers known as "Lord, I cry unto Thee" the [[ecclesiarch]] (sacristan) and his assistant will perform a full censing of the temple and people using hand censers.

Some churches have the practice of not using the chain censer during [[Holy Week]], even by a priest or bishop, substituting for it the hand censer as a sign of humility, repentance and mourning over the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Passion of Christ]]. They return to using the chain censer just before the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]] at the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].

Some Orthodox Christians use a standing censer on their [[icon corner]] (home altar).

===Western churches===
[[File:QuinnCense.jpg|thumb|right|Censer used during mass]]
In the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and some other groups, the censer is often called a ''[[thurible]]'', and used during important offices ([[benediction]]s, processions, important Masses). A common design for a thurible is a metal container, about the size and shape of a coffee-pot, suspended on chains. The bowl contains hot coals, and the incense is placed on top of these. The thurible is then swung back and forth on its chains, spreading the fragrant smoke.

A famous thurible is the ''[[Botafumeiro]]'', in the cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral, the swinging of this {{convert|5|ft|m|sing=on}} high, 55 kilogram silver vessel is an impressive sight.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

One of the explanations for the great size of the Botafumeiro is that in the early days it was used to freshen the air in the cathedral after being visited by droves of travel-weary pilgrims.  It was also once believed that the incense smoke guarded against contracting the many diseases that plagued the populace in past centuries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Hindu use ==

Hindus have traditionally used an earthen censer called a [[Dhunachi]] for burning incense with coal, though coconut husk is also used. The vessel has a flared shape with a curved handle and an open top. There are also brass and silver versions.

== History ==
The idea to establish a center for media, religion and culture was introduced by Paul S. Voakes in 2003 when the dean saw Hoover’s success in attracting support from the Lilly Endowment, Inc to conduct research on media and religion. What started as a research collaboration between Hoover, his graduate students and his colleagues in Europe began to develop into something bigger. 

In November 2004 Hoover with the assistance of [[Lynn Schofield Clark]] wrote a proposal for the establishment of the center. They identified project areas that later became the center's foci. Research works remained to be the foundational activity for the center. In addition, the center seeks support for Senior, Faculty and Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program that help shape ongoing research and scholarly projects in the field of media, religion and culture. The center also hold lectures, seminars and formal conferences both independently and in cooperation with other institutions such as [[New York University]] and the [[University of Southern California]] in an effort to bridge the academy with religious communities, industries and the wider public. Furthermore, it acts as the global secretariat for the International Conferences on Media, Religion and Culture that started in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], in 1994 and it has become the prominent conference in the field.

The Center was officially inaugurated in 2006. During the same year, Clark left [[University of Colorado]] at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and subsequently the Center to become Assistant Professor at the School of Communication at [[University of Denver]]. She remains a close collaborator of the Center and maintains a good relationship with Hoover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scholarly &amp; Creative Work - Faculty &amp; Staff - MFJS - University of Denver |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url=http://www.du.edu/ahss/mfjs/faculty/facportfolio_lynnclark.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706225844/http://www.du.edu/ahss/mfjs/faculty/facportfolio_lynnclark.html# |archive-date=2015-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Journalism and Mass Communication hired a new Assistant Professor, Nabil Echchaibi,&lt;ref name="nabilechchaibi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabilechchaibi.com/|title=Nabil Echchaibi|work=nabilechchaibi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who specializes in identity politics among young Muslim in the Arab world and in diaspora. He is now the associate director of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmrc.colorado.edu/our-people/center-alumni/|title=The Center for Media, Religion and Culture -   Center Alumni &amp; Past Fellows|work=The Center for Media, Religion and Culture|access-date=2015-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707182851/http://cmrc.colorado.edu/our-people/center-alumni/#|archive-date=2015-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Research Projects ===

Some of the projects mentioned below took place prior to the establishment of the Center, but closely associated with its development and continuation.

'''Finding Religion in the Media, 2010 - Present'''
The Center for Media, Religion and Culture is currently undertaking a study funded by the Ford Foundation on the ways religion is represented, experienced, and understood through the media today. The project, entitled “Finding Religion in the Media,” explores the extent to which religious belief, practice, and action—particularly that directed at social reform and social change—can be generated in and through the media sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmrc.colorado.edu/research/current-research/# |title="Current Research - Finding Religion in the Media." The Center for Media Religion and Culture. University of Colorado, 2015. Web. 7 July 2015 |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708033459/http://cmrc.colorado.edu/research/current-research/# |archive-date=2015-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “third spaces” concept has been central to the Finding Religion in the Media project. As developed by Hoover and Echchaibi, this concept serves as an interpretive tool to highlight what we call a “thickening” of the religious experience beyond dichotomous definitions of both religion and media categories. Digital spaces have opened up opportunities to theorize the production of meaning across hybrid spaces. Digital media reflect and narrativize life experiences and the Center has done so by looking specifically at case studies of the way religion and the religious is articulated and contested online. The research is framed around the novelty of technologies that leads us to adopt a hierarchical indexing of what constitutes an authentic experience of belonging and belief, outside of dichotomies of traditional/modern, physical/digital, and real/proximal embodied experience. The impulse to define how and why we communicate, drawing boundaries between various technological media leads to problematic understandings of complex user identities. The third spaces concept argues that theories of ritual, religion, media and communication benefit from an analysis of how meaning is produced and performed at the borderlines of a complex ecosystem of media ensembles and hybrid spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Stewart, and Nabil Echchaibi. "The" Third Spaces" of Digital Religion." The Center for Media, Religion, and Culture. Boulder  (2012). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muslims in the Mountain West, 2009-2010''' 
This research, supported by a grant from the Social Sciences Research Council, is a joint project of the Center and the University of Colorado’s Center for Asian Studies. It is intended to develop a profile of Muslims and of Islam in the six states of the mountain west. Interviews and site visits will document the life, interests and culture of this growing community. The outcome will be information useful to media, scholars, and interested members of the public, and products including a website, a documentary film, and various resources and materials. The grant also supports a series of round table conversations and informational events bringing together scholars of Islam, members of the media, and representatives of the Muslim community. The project also fed into the Center’s conference on Islam and the Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://muslimsinmountainwest.org/about# |title=Echchaibi, Nabil. "About."

'''Symbolism, Media, and the Lifecourse, 1996-2001''' 
Principal Investigator (P.I.): [[Stewart Hoover]]; Associate P.I: [[Lynn Schofield Clark]]; Research Associates: Diane F. Alters, Joseph G. Champ, Lee Hood, and Henrik Boes. The project resulted in the book Media, Home, and Family ([[Routledge]], 2004) written in collaboration by Hoover, Clark and Alters. The book argued that how families discuss the rules and practices surrounding media use are an important part of how they lay claim to a family identity in the age of reflexive parenting. The Symbolism project also provided the initial research for Hoover's, Religion in the Media Age (Routledge, 2006), Clark's From Angels to Aliens: Teenagers, the Media, and the Supernatural (Oxford U Press, 2003), and supported the development of the edited volume Practicing Religion in the Age of the Media, edited by Hoover and Clark (Columbia U Press, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmrc.colorado.edu/resources/publications/# |title=Publications (The Center for Media Religion and Culture) |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707180620/http://cmrc.colorado.edu/resources/publications/# |archive-date=2015-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project provided the funding that supported the completion of Clark's book, From Angels to Aliens: Teenagers, the Media, and the Supernatural (Oxford U Press, 2003/2005 paperback). It also supported the conclusion of Hoover's Religion in the Media Age (Routledge, 2006) and the early research stage of Clark's Parenting in a Digital Age (forthcoming). Moreover, it provided support for the collaborative effort Hoover and Clark engaged in with the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project to produce the 2004 report, Faith Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2004/Faith-Online.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112175324/http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2004/Faith-Online.aspx |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cmrc.colorado.edu/resources/publications/# |title=Publications: The Center for Media Religion and Culture |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707180620/http://cmrc.colorado.edu/resources/publications/# |archive-date=2015-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Findings|work= Pew Research Center Internet Science Tech RSS.

Master '''Cheng Yen''' ({{zh|t=證嚴法師|p=Zhèngyán Fǎshī}}; born 11 May 1937) is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[nun]] ([[bhikkhuni]]), teacher, and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography of Dharma Master Cheng Yen |url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=198&amp;lang=en |publisher=Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation |date=22 May 2014 |access-date=2010-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184449/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=159&amp;Itemid=198&amp;lang=en |archive-date=2011-07-21 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tricycle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mowe|first1=Sam|title=Diane Wolkstein on Dharma Master Cheng Yen|url=http://www.tricycle.com/blog/?p=2173|publisher=Tricycle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906090614/http://www.tricycle.com/blog/?p=2173|archivedate=6 September 2010 |date=12 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://religion.vn/Plus.aspx/en/News/71/0/1010054/0/5049/%5BDownload%5D|title=Founder of Tzu Chi Receives Rotary International Hono|website=religion.vn|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0412/companies-cheng-yen-taiwan-philanthropy-widjaja-sister-of-charity.html|title=Sister of Charity|last=Chen|first=Shu-Ching Jean|date=2010-04-12|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107040307/http://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0412/companies-cheng-yen-taiwan-philanthropy-widjaja-sister-of-charity.html|archive-date=2017-01-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2058044_2060338_2059983,00.html|title=The 2011 TIME 100 Poll|last=Staff|first=TIME|date=2011-04-04|work=Time|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0040-781X|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226045354/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2058044_2060338_2059983,00.html|archive-date=2017-02-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a student and follower of Master [[Yin Shun|Ying Shun]], a major figure in the development of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan. In 1966, Cheng Yen founded the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation,&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; ordinarily referred to as [[Tzu Chi]]. Cheng Yen started Tzu Chi as a group of thirty housewives who saved money to help needy families. The organization later became one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world, eventually becoming the largest Buddhist organization in [[Taiwan]]. 

Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the development of modern [[Taiwanese Buddhism]]. In Taiwan, she is popularly referred to as one of the "[[Buddhism in Taiwan|Four Heavenly Kings]]" of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with her contemporaries Master [[Sheng-yen]] of [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], Master [[Hsing Yun]] of [[Fo Guang Shan]] and Master [[Wei Chueh]] of [[Chung Tai Shan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html|title=Come to Taiwan, Return with good memories|date=|publisher=Info.taiwan.net.tw|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183910/http://info.taiwan.net.tw/tourbusE/december_page1.html|archivedate=27 February 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-02-15|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuai|first=J.

==Early life==

Cheng Yen was born "Chin-Yun Wong"&lt;ref name="parabola"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolkstein|first1=Diane|title=THE DESIRE TO RELIEVE ALL SUFFERING|url=http://www.parabola.org/the-desire-to-relieve-all-suffering|publisher=Parabola Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923002225/http://www.parabola.org/the-desire-to-relieve-all-suffering |archivedate=23 September 2010 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|t=王錦雲|p=Wáng Jǐnyún}}) in 1937 in Kiyomizu Town, Taikō District, [[Taichū Prefecture]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Taiwan]] (modern-day [[Qingshui District|Qingshui]], [[Taichung City]], [[Taiwan]]).&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Unlike most leaders of major [[Buddhism in Taiwan|Taiwanese Buddhist organizations]], Cheng Yen was born in Taiwan rather than mainland China.&lt;ref name="chinaperspectives.revues.org" /&gt; Her uncle was childless, so she was given to be raised by her aunt and uncle. Cheng-Yen grew up during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan during [[World War II]], where she witnessed the devastating effects of war and experienced the bombings in Taiwan. These experiences were credited as contributing to what she regarded as the truth behind the concept of [[impermanence]].&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; In 1945, when she was eight years old, she looked after her sick brother in a hospital for eight months, and so learned more closely about people's pain and helplessness.  At the age of 23, her father died suddenly from brain blood vessel disorder that brought about hemorrhaging and stroke.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; It was in searching for a burial place for him that Cheng Yen first came into close contact with the Buddhist [[Dharma]], associated doctrines, and Buddhist scriptures ([[sutra]]s). After her father's death, Cheng Yen took over managing her father's theaters and became financially responsible for her family.

===Bhikṣuṇī Ordination===
Upon deciding to become a nun, Cheng Yen ran away to a temple in 1960, fearing that if she were to ask leave in advance, she might not be permitted to go.&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt;  After her first attempt at running away, her mother found her three days later and brought her back home.&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; She ran away from home a second time in 1961. She left to travel through eastern Taiwan with a friendly nun by the name of Master Xiūdào (修道法師).  Cheng Yen followed a nontraditional route to becoming a nun, traveling for two years with Master Xiūdào. Cheng Yen even shaved her own head before she had been officially ordained a nun.  After traveling for two years, Cheng Yen decided that she needed to become an ordained nun in order to continue her lifestyle. She went to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lin Chi Temple|zh|3=臨濟護國禪寺}} to register for ordination, but was turned down because she did not have a master. Typically, to become a nun in Taiwan, one must be the disciple of a master for two years before ordination. Cheng Yen encountered Venerable Master [[Yin Shun]], whom she asked to be her mentor.  He accepted her request, an hour before the registration closed.  In February 1963, she became the disciple of her mentor, the Venerable Master Yin Shun, who gave her the [[dharma name]] of Cheng Yen and the courtesy name of '''''Huìzhāng''''' (慧璋).&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; Yin Shun also gave her the expectation of "doing all for the Buddhist religion and for all beings", which is written with six characters in Chinese. These six characters became the highest ideals for Cheng Yen in belief, teaching, and practice.

In May 1963, shortly after receiving her ordination as a nun, she went to [[Pu Ming Temple]] (普明寺) in [[Hualien County]] to continue her spiritual formation.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; As a part of that formation, she recited the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', which she revered, every day and transcribed every month. It was during her six months there that she vowed to commit herself to the Lotus Sutra and the "[[Bodhisattva vow|Path of the Bodhisattvas]]."

==Tzu Chi==

===Lotus Sutra===
Master Cheng Yen was heavily influenced by the [[Lotus Sutra]], which she called the culmination of the Buddha's teachings. Master Cheng Yen's initial exposure to the [[Lotus Sutra]] happened when she left her family in [[Fengyuan District|Fengyuan]], Taichung County, and stayed away from the world by lodging in a small hut in [[Taitung County]], in eastern Taiwan. While in Taitung, she accidentally found a Japanese version of the Lotus Sutra, and was pleased with what the book said. Later, she had a friend bring back a Japanese copy of the Lotus Sutra (Myoho Renge Kyo) from Japan, and was inspired by the Muryōgi Kyō, or what is better known as the [[Innumerable Meanings Sutra]], which is traditionally regarded as the prologue to the Lotus Sutra. The Innumerable Meanings Sutra addresses human problems, weather behavior, and psychiatric, psychological, and spiritual issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cheng Yen (证严上人) |script-title=zh:无量义经 |language=Chinese |date=2011 |publisher=Fudan Univ. |location=Shanghai |isbn=9787309076196 |pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscarriage of Taiwanese Aborigine===
There were two watershed events that occurred in 1966 that are credited with having inspired Cheng Yen to found Tzu Chi. The first event occurred while Cheng Yen was visiting a hospital in [[Fenglin, Hualien|Fenglin]]. After seeing blood on the hospital floor, she learned that a [[Taiwanese aborigine]] woman had a [[miscarriage]]. They were forced to carry the pregnant woman back up the mountain after they could not afford the 8000 [[New Taiwan dollar]] deposit. The aborigine woman later died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t529SPeue5MC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=cheng+yen+miscarriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S6wUuNXBZb&amp;sig=MMPlRnmp3z8C4c_wMXfrrvfiR3s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1ppD09tXWAhVKy2MKHbmFCaM4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=miscarriage&amp;f=false|title=Charisma and Compassion: Cheng Yen and the Buddhist Tzu Chi Movement|last=Huang|first=C.

While Cheng Yen never mentioned the name of the doctor when telling the story, one of her followers did, resulting in a defamation suit against Cheng Yen by the doctor's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/09/18/2003068259|title=Tzu Chi founder not to appeal case|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2003|work=Taipei Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004135838/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/09/18/2003068259|archive-date=2017-10-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encounter with Roman Catholic Nuns===
The second event was a now-famous discussion Cheng Yen had with three [[Roman Catholic]] nuns at Pu Ming temple in 1966. While the nuns admitted the profundity of Buddhist teachings, they noted that the Catholic Church had helped people around the world by building schools and hospitals and inquired, "But what has [[Buddhism]] done for society?". The discussion is credited with having made Master Cheng Yen realize that Buddhism had to do more than simply encourage the private cultivation of people's souls.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t529SPeue5MC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=cheng+yen+miscarriage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S6wUuNXBZb&amp;sig=MMPlRnmp3z8C4c_wMXfrrvfiR3s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1ppD09tXWAhVKy2MKHbmFCaM4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=miscarriage&amp;f=false|title=Charisma and Compassion: Cheng Yen and the Buddhist Tzu Chi Movement|last=Huang|first=C.

===Founding of Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation  ===

{{main|Tzu Chi}}

Influenced by the Lotus Sutra, and the encounters with the Taiwanese aborigine woman and the Roman Catholic nuns, Master Cheng Yen established the Buddhist Compassion Relief [[Tzu Chi]] Foundation on 14 May 1966 in an endeavor to help the poor of east Taiwan.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; The organization started when Cheng Yen encouraged her thirty housewife followers to save fifty [[New Taiwan dollar|cent]]s ([[US$]]0.02) from their grocery money every day and store them in bamboo savings banks to help needy families.&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; When posed with the question, "Why can't we give once a week?"&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; Master Cheng Yen replied, "Because giving is a practice and we need to give every day. If we have a yearning or a positive desire in us, we must nourish it and bring it to fulfillment. Just as Buddha was guided by a noble desire to help others, we too can listen to those who are sad or help those who are in pain."&lt;ref name="parabola"/&gt; In the first year, fifteen families were provided with aid by the initial thirty followers.

Tzu Chi expanded its work from helping needy families to medical aid in 1970. In 1986 Tzu Chi established its first Hospital in [[Hualien City|Hualien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t--23FOImmIC&amp;dq=Tzu+Chi:+Serving+with+Compassion.&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Tzu Chi: Serving with Compassion.|last=Mark.|first=O'Neill,|date=2010-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9780470825679|location=|pages=26|oclc=940634655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi has since built hospitals in [[Yuli, Hualien|Yuli]], Hualien County; [[Dalin, Chiayi|Dalin]], [[Jiayi County]]; [[Guanshan, Taitung|Guanshan]], [[Taidong County]]; and [[Xindian District|Xindian]], [[New Taipei City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4PuparQrsUC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=tzu+chi+hospitals+yuli&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw8tmw58jTAhUX22MKHWETDrkQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tzu%20chi%20hospitals%20yuli&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Buddhist Organizations in Taiwan, 1989-2003: Safeguard the Faith, Build a Pure Land, Help the Poor|last=Laliberté|first=André|date=2013-08-21|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781134353545|location=|pages=94|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://app.tzuchi.com.tw/tzuchi_en/About_TP_Center/Default.htm|title=About Medicine Mission|last=|first=|date=|website=Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. However, with the surge in popularity of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations. From 1987 to 1991 Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994 it boasted a membership of 4 million members.&lt;ref name="chinaperspectives.revues.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hsiao|first2=Hsin-Huang Michael|date=2005|title=Taiwan's Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|journal=China Perspectives|issue=59|last1=Schak|first1=David|accessdate=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012062338/https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto1n1|archive-date=2016-10-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tzu Chi is most well known for its work in disaster relief, Cheng Yen's philosophy includes the notion that not only are those receiving assistance benefiting materially by receiving the aid, but those delivering the aid are also spiritually rewarded when they see the gratitude in the eyes and smiles of the recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=519:when-east-meets-west&amp;catid=83:the-master-answers&amp;Itemid=200&amp;lang=en|title=When East Meets West|last=Foundation|first=Tzu Chi|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630215232/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=519%3Awhen-east-meets-west&amp;catid=83%3Athe-master-answers&amp;Itemid=200&amp;lang=en|archive-date=2016-06-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=48,5538,0,0,1,0|title=Taiwan {{!}} A Buddhist Tends to her Flock in Taiwan|website=www.buddhistchannel.tv|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517214154/http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=48,5538,0,0,1,0|archive-date=2015-05-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tzu Chi's first major disaster relief effort was in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after [[Eastern China flood of 1991|severe floods hit central and eastern China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Outline of assistance given to Chinese provinces|url=http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|archivedate=2012-03-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305053915/http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/book/book1/book1.htm|accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Dharma Master Cheng Yen - Discovery Channel Documentary 證嚴法師 - Discovery 頻道 (中文字幕) 480p|date=2014-03-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsDjv5JqbU|accessdate=2017-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525233639/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHsDjv5JqbU|archive-date=2017-05-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Tzu Chi has provided disaster relief aid to over 85 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5BaMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=tzu+chi+disaster+relief&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn77TtcrTAhVI8GMKHSJIC1sQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=85%20countries&amp;f=false|title=Taiwan's Marginalized Role in International Security: Paying a Price|last=Glaser|first=Bonnie S.|last2=Vitello|first2=Jacqueline A.|date=2015-01-21|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=9781442240605|location=|pages=28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around [[environmentally friendly]] goals such as the encouragement of recycling and using reusable items to reduce waste. As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-recycling-20141117-story.html|title=Taiwan Buddhists transform plastic waste|last=Jennings|first=Ralph|date=17 Nov 2014|website=latimes.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116175356/http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-recycling-20141117-story.html|archive-date=2017-01-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Da Ai Television==
In January 1998, Cheng Yen launched Da Ai (literally "Great Love") Satellite Television (慈濟大愛電視台; ''Cí jì Dà Ài Diàn Shì Tái'') a [[24-hour clock|24-hours]] in daily of [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television station]]. Da Ai is commercial free and operates twenty-four hours a day. It is funded by donations as well as partially by Tzu Chi's recycling programs. Da Ai features non-political news, lectures from Cheng Yen and serial programs focused on the virtues, often profiling people who made major changes in their life for the better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://olbios.org/life-of-the-mother-teresa-of-asia/|title=Life of the "Mother Teresa of Asia" {{!}} Olbios|date=2016-01-26|work=Olbios|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319115145/http://olbios.org/life-of-the-mother-teresa-of-asia/|archive-date=2017-03-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daai.tv/daai-web/main/|title=大愛電視 DaAi TV|website=www.daai.tv|access-date=2017-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020103914/http://www.daai.tv/daai-web/main/#|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=912:da-ai-television-launches-high-definition-channel&amp;catid=80:missionofculture&amp;Itemid=180&amp;lang=en|title=Da Ai Television Launches High-Definition Channel|last=Foundation|first=Tzu Chi|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-gb|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319195927/http://tw.tzuchi.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=912:da-ai-television-launches-high-definition-channel&amp;catid=80:missionofculture&amp;Itemid=180&amp;lang=en|archive-date=2017-03-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Christian Hebraist''' is a [[Hebraist|scholar of Hebrew]] who comes from a [[Christianity|Christian]] family background/belief, or is a [[Jewish Christian|Jewish adherent of Christianity]]. The main area of study is that commonly known as the ''[[Old Testament]]'' to Christians (and ''[[Tanakh]]'' to Jews), but Christians have occasionally taken an interest in the ''[[Talmud]]'', and ''[[Kabbalah]]''.

The early fathers of the Christian Church got their knowledge of Hebrew traditions ([[Masoretic]], [[Midrashim]], [[Aggadah]]) from their Jewish teachers. This is seen especially in the exegesis of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Aphraates]], [[Ephraem Syrus]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]]. [[Jerome]]'s teachers are even mentioned by name—e.g., Bar Ḥanina (Hananiah).
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Middle Ages==
[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] have always been reading and using Hebrew texts. In [[western Christianity]], however, knowledge of Hebrew was historically scarce outside of converts from Judaism.&lt;ref name=Grabois&gt;Aryeh Grabois, "Christian Hebraists", in [[Joseph Strayer]] (ed.), ''The Dictionary of the Middle Ages'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), vol. 3, pp. 313–14.&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been claimed that the [[Venerable Bede]] (d.735) knew something of Hebrew, but his knowledge appears to have been gleaned entirely from St [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]].&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Sutcliffe, "The Venerable Bede's Knowledge of Hebrew", ''Biblica'' '''16''' 3 (1935): 300–06.&lt;/ref&gt; The same may be said of [[Alcuin]] (b. 735), who revised the Biblical translation of Jerome. The ninth-century [[Pseudo-Jerome]], who worked in the circle of [[Rabanus Maurus]] (d.856), had knowledge of Hebrew.&lt;ref name=Grabois/&gt;

During the [[Twelfth-Century Renaissance]], contact between Christian and Jewish scholars increased. [[Peter Abelard]] (d.1142) recommended Christian scholars take up the language of the Old Testament and many followed this recommendation. The [[School of Saint Victor]] became the centre of Hebraism in western Europe. The [[Toledo School of Translators|school of Toledo]] also worked with Hebrew, but it was secondary to Arabic. [[Adam of Saint Victor]] (d.1146) was the most prominent Victorine Hebraist and his student, [[Herbert of Bosham]] (fl.1162–89), studied with [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (d.c.1167) to acquire deeper grammatical understanding. The [[Cistercian]] tradition of Hebrew studies began with [[Nicholas Manjacoria]].&lt;ref name=Grabois/&gt;

In the thirteenth century, Hebrew learning declined among native Christians, while converts from Judaism mainly used their knowledge polemically against their co-ethnics. The tradition of scholarly Hebraism was strongest in England.&lt;ref&gt;The "''Magister Andreas, natione Anglus''" mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], and identified by S. R. Hirsch with an [[Augustinian]] monk who lived about 1150, must at least have been able to read the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible in the Hebrew original]].&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prominent English Hebraists were [[Alexander Neckham]] (d.1217); [[Stephen Langton]] (d.1228), who composed a Hebrew–Latin dictionary of Biblical terms; [[William de la Mare]] (fl.1272–79), who was patronised by [[Robert Grosseteste]] (d.1253); and [[Roger Bacon]] (d.c.1292), who wrote  Hebrew grammar.&lt;ref name=Grabois/&gt;

In the fourteenth century, the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took up Hebrew, but their purpose was evangelical. They were instrumental, however, in setting up chairs of Hebrew in [[Medieval university|universities]] across Europe. The ecumenical [[Council of Vienne]] (1312) ordered chairs established at the universities of [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Paris|Paris]], [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. Paris had the leading Hebraist of the period in [[Nicholas of Lyra]] (d.1349), while following him was Bishop [[Paul of Burgos]] (d.1435), a Jewish convert.&lt;ref name=Grabois/&gt;

==Renaissance==
It was not, however, until the end of the 15th century that the Renaissance and the Reformation, while awakening a new interest in the classics, brought about a return to the original text of Scripture and an attempt to understand the later literature of the Jews. [[Hieronymus Buslidius]], the friend of [[Erasmus]], gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a Hebrew chair at [[Leuven|Louvain]]; as the chair of Hebrew at the [[University of Paris]], Francis offered the chair to [[Elijah Levita]], the friend of Cardinal [[Ægidius of Viterbo]], who declined to accept it. [[Cardinal Grimani]] and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the Cabala with Jewish teachers; even the warrior [[Guido Rangoni]] attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of [[Jacob Mantino]] (1526). [[Pico de la Mirandola]] (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and [[Reuchlin]] was the first to write a dictionary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506). A more detailed grammar was published by [[Otto Walper]] in 1590. But interest still centered wholly around the Bible and the expository literature immediately connected therewith.

During the whole of the 16th century it was Hebrew grammar and Jewish exegesis that claimed attention. Christian scholars were not ashamed to be the students of Jewish teachers. In fact, one of the most noted Hebraists of this period was [[Immanuel Tremellius]] (1510-1580), born Jewish and converted first to Catholicism and soon thereafter became a Calvinist, producing the main Reformed translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin (he also translated the New Testament from the Syriac into Latin). [[Sebastian Münster]] (d. 1552) was known as a grammarian; [[Conrad Pellican|Pellicanus]] (d. 1556) and [[Xanthus Pagninius|Pagninius]] (d. 1541), as lexicographers; [[Daniel Bomberg]] (d. 1549), as a printer of Hebrew books. [[Arius Montanus]] (d. 1598) edited the [[Masoretic Text|Masorah]] and the ''Travels of Benjamin of Tudela''. Widmanstadt (1523), living in a colony of [[Spanish Jew]]ish refugees in [[Naples]], studied Hebrew with [[David ibn Ya'ya]] and [[Baruch of Benevento]], and collected the Hebrew manuscripts which formed the basis of the Hebrew division of the Royal Library at Munich. Vatablé (d. 1547) made use of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. [[Conrad Gesner]] (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books; [[Jacob Christmann]] (d. 1613) busied himself with the Jewish calendar, and Drusius (d. 1616) with the ethical writings of the Jews.

==17th century==

[[Johannes Buxtorf]] (d. 1629) marks a turning-point in the study of Jewish literature by Christians. He not only studied the ''[[Targum]]'' and the ''Talmud'', but endeavored to understand Jewish history, and he was the first real bibliographer. Women showed an interest: [[Anna Maria Schurman]], the "star of the century", in the Dutch Republic; [[Dorothea Moore]] in England; [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (d. 1689); [[Maria Dorothea]], consort of the [[Duke of Saxe-Weimar]]; [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick of the Palatinate]]; [[Maria Eleanora]], wife of [[Charles Ludwig of the Palatinate]]; Antonia, daughter of [[Duke Eberhard of Württemberg]].

Through Buxtorf a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin. In this connection the following names may be mentioned: [[Johannes Cocceius]] (d. 1667); [[Constantin L'Empereur]] (d. 1648); [[John Lightfoot]] (d. 1675); [[Johann Leusden]] (d. 1699); and especially [[Surenhuis]] (1698), who gave a complete translation of the ''[[Mishnah]]''; Jewish theology was studied by Carpzov (d. 1699), Wagenseil (1705; whose letters show how he gathered information), and [[Johann Stephan Rittangel]] (1641); antiquities, by [[Samuel Bochart]] (d. 1667), Hottinger (d. 1667), Hyde (d. 1700), [[Jacob Trigland (1652-1705)|Trigland]] (d. 1705), Breithaupt (1707), and [[Johann Jakob Schudt]] (d. 1722). It was a time in which the Christian theologian studied Hebrew and rabbinics before taking up his specific theological study. Hackspan (d. 1659) wrote upon the value to the theologian of studying the works of the Rabbis. Their writings on the Bible were read by Schickard (1635), [[Humphrey Hody]] (d. 1706), and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] (d. 1712), while catalogues of Hebrew collections were published by Plantavitius (d. 1651), Le Long (d. 1721), and Montfaucon (d. 1741). Hottinger gave this literature a place in his ''Bibliotheca Orientalis''; Otho (1672) wrote a biographical lexicon of the Mishnah teachers; and Bartolocci's ''Bibliotheca Rabbinica'' (1675) was a worthy continuation of these bibliographical labors.

==18th century==

The first half of the 18th century contains the names of three important scholars. [[Jacques Basnage]] knew no Hebrew, but his ''L'Histoire de la Religion des Juifs'' was the first attempt at a complete presentation of the history of Judaism. The ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' of [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger|Eisenmenger]] (d.1704) exhibits a mass of Jewish learning. [[Johann Christoph Wolf]] (d. 1739), who, with the help of the Oppenheimer library, was able to produce his ''Bibliotheca Hebræa'', which laid the foundation for all later works in Hebrew bibliography.

[[Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz]] (d. 1797), though not a scholarly Hebraist, gave an accurate account of Jewish ceremonials. By the side of these stand [[Bashuysen]] (d. 1750), the translator and printer of Hebrew books; [[Reland]] (d. 1718), the first to use Talmudic material for the study of the geography of Palestine; the bibliographers Unger (d. 1719) and Gagnier (d. 1720), who gave Wolf his information regarding the manuscripts in the Bodleian; J. H. Michaelis (d. 1738) and Mai (d. 1732), who compiled a catalogue of the [[Uffenbach library]]; Baratier (d. 1740), the youthful prodigy, who wrote on [[Benjamin of Tudela]]; Mill (d. 1756), who treated rabbinical exegesis; and Wähner (1762), who described Hebrew antiquities. [[Biagio Ugolini]] (1744) is said to have been a converted Jew, and therefore finds no place here. Special mention should be made of [[Ezra Stiles]], the learned president of [[Yale College]] (1778), certainly the most learned Christian student of post-Biblical Jewish literature that America has produced.

==Early 19th century==

Towards the end of the 18th century such friends of Hebrew literature became ever rarer. The rise of Biblical criticism and of the study of other [[Semitic language]]s engaged the whole interest of Semitic scholars.

Even [[Johann Jacob Rabe|Rabe]], the translator of the ''[[Mishnah]]'' into German (d. 1798), [[Semmler]], [[Michaelis]], [[Tychsen]] (d. 1815), and [[Sylvestre de Sacy]] (d. 1838) can hardly be mentioned by the side of the humanists of previous centuries. Interest in the text of the Bible caused some work to be done in the collecting of Hebrew manuscripts, especially by [[Benjamin Kennicott]] in England (1776–80) and [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] in Italy (1784–88). The last-named made a valuable collection of Hebrew manuscripts; and by his side may be mentioned [[Joseph Pasinus]] (or Giuseppe Passini) in [[Turin]] (d. 1749), [[Antonio Maria Biscioni]] in [[Florence]] (d. 1752), [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]] in Rome, and Ury in [[Oxford]] (d. 1787).

==At the universities==
{{POV section|date=December 2014}}
The downward trend continued in the first half of the 19th century; [[Jewish literature]] became less and less a subject of investigation by Christians; and when it was studied it was generally for the purpose of forging weapons against the people whose literature it was. This is seen in such works as [[A. T. Hartmann]]'s ''Thesaurus Linguæ Hebr. c Mischna Augendi'' (1825), in Winer's ''Biblisches Real Wörterbuch'', and even in the works of Hitzig and Ewald. There was no understanding even of the period of [[Jewish history]] during which Christianity arose and developed; and [[David Strauss]]'s complaint in regard to this was only too well founded.

During the second half of the 19th century, however, the idea gained currency that there was something to be learned by going back to the sources of this history; but only a very few of the universities made a place for this study in their curricula. At the beginning of the 18th century [[David Rudolph (linguist)|David Rudolph]] of [[Liegnitz]] included ''Rabbinisch und Chaldäisch'' among the Oriental languages which he taught at Heidelberg; but he had few imitators; and in the 19th century, apart from a few stray courses, such as [[Emil Kautzsch]]'s on [[David Kimhi|Kimhi]] at Tübingen, Lagarde's on [[Al-Ḥarizi]] at [[Göttingen]], and [[Strack]]'s on the ''[[Mishnah]]'' at Berlin, the whole of [[rabbinic literature]] was ignored by European universities.

Honorable exceptions in this respect were furnished in the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where A. Cowley was sublibrarian of the [[Bodleian Library]]) and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (which has produced such scholars as [[W. H. Lowe]], Matthews, and [[Charles Taylor (Hebraist)|Charles Taylor]]) in England, and in [[Columbia University]], the [[University of California]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Johns Hopkins University]], in America. The Jews had been allowed to work out by themselves the new Jewish science (''Jüdische Wissenschaft''), little attention being paid to that work by others.

In more recent times Christian scholars have given Jewish literature their attention. Abbé [[Pietro Perreau]] has done good service by his many articles on the literature of the Jews in the [[Middle Ages]] and by the assistance he has given to scholars from the Hebrew manuscripts at [[Parma]]; [[Martin Hartmann]] has translated and commentated the "Meteḳ Sefatayim" of [[Immanuel Frances]] (Berlin, 1894); [[Thomas Robinson (scholar)|Thomas Robinson]] has collected some good material in his ''The Evangelists and the Mishna'' (1859). [[August Wünsche]], in his "Erläuterung der Evangelien aus Midrasch und Talmud" (1878), enlarged the scope of the inquiry begun by Lightfoot; and his translations from the ''[[Midrash]]'' opened up the stores of ancient Jewish exegesis. Weber's ''System der Altsynagogalen Palestinischen Theologie'' (1880) was, with all its failings, an honest attempt to understand the [[theology]] of the [[Synagogue]], followed by [[Wilhelm Bousset]] in his ''Religiondes Judenthums im Neutestamentlichen Zeitalter'' (1903). [[Dom Pedro II]], King of Brazil, should also be mentioned for his publication of [[Occitan language|Provençal]] Jewish poetry.

==Late 19th century==

The [[Institutum Judaicum]] in [[Leipzig]], founded by [[Franz Delitzsch]], and a similar society bearing the same name in Berlin and founded by [[Hermann Strack]], have attempted, by their various publications, to diffuse in the Christian world a knowledge of Jewish writings. [[Gustav Dalman]] has shown by his philological works on Talmudic grammar and lexicography that he is at home in the rabbinic writings. Hermann Strack in Berlin demands special mention not only for his publications dealing with the literature of the Mishnah and the Talmud, but also on account of the fearless manner in which he has combated [[anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] prejudice, drawing his material directly from the original sources. [[Carl Siegfried]], in his yearly reports in the ''Theologischer Jahresbericht'', for many years called attention to publications on Jewish subjects, and the mention of such works in the ''Orientalische Bibliographie'' has served to bring them more closely to the attention of Christian scholars. The roll of Christian Hebraists in England includes the names of J. W. Etheridge, the author of a popular ''Introduction to [post-Biblical] Hebrew Literature'' (1856); [[Thomas Chenery]], translator of ''Legends from the Midrash'' (1877), and editor of Al-Ḥarizi's translation of Ḥariri; and [[W. H. Lowe]], who edited the Palestinian recension of the Mishnah.

In spite, however, of these facts and of the warning given by Lagarde (''Symmicta'', ii. 147; ''Mittheilungen'', ii. 165), that in order to understand the Bible text itself a deep study of the [[Halakah]] is necessary, Christian writers on the life of [[Jesus]] continue their disregard of the primary sources. This may be seen in Hausrath's ''Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte'' (''Kaufmann Gedenkbuch'', p.&amp;nbsp;659), and even in Schürer (''Gesch.''), who, though making a great advance upon previous efforts, still relies upon second-hand sources for many of the pictures that he draws (see Abrahams in "J. Q. R." xi. 628). [[Adolph Harnack]], who, in his ''Dogmengeschichte'' (3d ed.), endeavors to do some justice to the rabbis of old, in his ''Wesen des Christenthums'' (1900), sustains potential historical inaccuracies from a perhaps selective review of Jewish literature of the relevant period, possibly most noticeable in a lack of regard for the Jewish literature and history during the most recent eighteen hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Perles]], ''Was Lehrt Uns Harnack?' [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] (1902)&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Christian Hebraists==
The following list of Christian Hebraists includes material taken from the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), compiled upon the basis of Steinschneider's article mentioned in the bibliography below. Christian students of the [[Bible]] more generally were not included, as they may be found in other articles.

In [[Aztec mythology]], the '''Cihuateteo''' ({{IPAc-en|s|iː|ˌ|w|ɑː|t|ᵻ|ˈ|t|eɪ|oʊ}}; {{lang-nci|Cihuātēteoh}}, singular {{lang|nci|Cihuātēotl}}) or “Divine Women,” were the malevolent spirits of women who died in childbirth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50525805|title=Aztecs|last=Eduardo.|first=Matos Moctezuma,|date=2002|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|others=Solís Olguín, Felipe R.|isbn=9781903973134|location=London|oclc=50525805}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were likened to the spirits of male warriors who died in violent conflict, because childbirth was conceptually equivalent to battle in Aztec culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Orellana|first=Margarita|last2=Pope|first2=Quentin|last3=Moctezuma|first3=Eduardo Matos|last4=Nagao|first4=Debra|last5=Balderas|first5=Ximena Chávez|last6=Cué|first6=Lourdes|last7=León-Portilla|first7=Miguel|last8=Uriarte|first8=María Teresa|last9=Quirarte|first9=Vicente|date=2009|title=THE AZTECS-MEXICA AND DEATH: A Rebirth of Gods and Men|jstor=24317808|journal=Artes de México|issue=96|pages=65–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, a woman in labor was said to capture the spirit of her newborn child similar to the way a warrior captures his opponent in battle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/307634|title=Cihuateotl {{!}} Aztec {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spirits are also associated with the west, the place where the sun sets each day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mythology ==
The ''Cihuateteo'' resided in a region in the west known as ''Cihuatlampa'', the “place of women.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each day, they guided the sun into the west from noon until sunset, and are occasionally suggested to have even borne it through the underworld until it rose again. They were aided by the spirits of male warriors, and this practice of guiding the sun was seen as exclusive to these two groups of the deceased—it was an honor that was not bestowed on any other individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On five specific days in the [[Aztec calendar]], the ''cihuateteo'' descended to the earth: 1 Deer, 1 Rain, 1 Monkey, 1 House, and 1 Eagle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While on earth, they were considered to be demons of the night, and often haunted crossroads. Roadside shrines were often erected to appease them, as they were believed to steal children, cause madness and seizures, and induce men to adultery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The figure of a ''cihuateotl'' from the Metropolitan Museum of Art has been inscribed on top of her head with the name ''Ce Calli'', “1 House,” while the figure from the British Museum is inscribed with the glyph “1 Monkey”—these indicate their respective days of descent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Funerary practices ==
When an Aztec woman experienced childbirth, it was seen as a violent and laborious effort likened to the intensity of battle. It was believed that the child was sent down to the earth by the gods, and the woman had to fight and struggle in order to bring it into the world. The newborn child was seen as a sufficient reward if she was successful and emerged victorious from her “fight” with the gods, but if she lost and proved unsuccessful, then she died and her soul underwent transformation into a ''cihuateotl''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28327040|title=Ancient America : contributions to New World archaeology|last=Shelton|first=Anthony Alan|publisher=Oxbow Books|others=Saunders, Nicholas J.|year=1992|isbn=978-0946897483|location=Oxford|pages=5|oclc=28327040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the death of the woman, special funerary practices were carried out, as the body of a woman who had died in childbirth was believed to possess special powers and magic following the departure of the soul from the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these special practices, the body was guarded fiercely by an armed entourage that included the widowed husband, his friends, all the midwives, and old women. This was deemed necessary due to the need to protect the woman's human remains from male warriors. Parts of the body believed to be especially potent relics for warriors were the left middle finger and the hair. According to Aztec belief, “these relics had magical power and, if placed on their shields, would make the warriors brave and valiant, give them strength, and blind the eyes of their enemies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20723387|title=Soldaderas in the Mexican military : myth and history|last=Salas|first=Elizabeth|date=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0292776302|edition=1st|location=Austin|pages=|oclc=20723387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions in art ==
[[File:Cultures précolombiennes MRAH Cihuateotl 291211 1.jpg|thumb|A terracotta statue depicting an El Zapotal ''cihuateotl''.|240x240px]]''Cihuateteo'' can be characterized as “fearsome figures with clenched, claw-like fists, macabre, bared teeth and gums and aggressive poses.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sitting with their clawed feet tucked beneath their skirts, they seem at once in repose and ready to attack. In Aztec art, the postpartum female body is often depicted with pendulous breasts and stomach folds. Within the Aztec artistic tradition, ''cihuateteo'' are commonly depicted with taut stomachs, exposed breasts, and prominent nipples. These are all features that serve to highlight their unrealized potential as mothers, as these women died before having the opportunity to bear and nurse their newborn child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Oftentimes, ''cihuateteo'' are also depicted with swirling, unkempt hair and skirts fastened with snake belts. ''Cihuateteo'' figures found at the site of [[El Zapotal]] even carry staffs bearing heads as trophies, and seem to be covered with flayed skins, which suggests deference or worship to a female vegetation deity. The serpent around the waist may be a reference to the serpentine goddess [[Cihuacoatl]], who was not only associated with war, sacrifice, and political power, but also with fertility, childbirth, and midwifery.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56057973|title=Encyclopedia of religion|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|others=Jones, Lindsay, 1954-, Eliade, Mircea, 1907-1986., Adams, Charles J.|year=|isbn=978-0028657424|edition=2nd|location=Detroit|pages=5905|oclc=56057973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the unkempt hair is often associated with darkness and the earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Not only was ''Cihuatlampa'' a place of darkness, but most Aztec associations with the earth (and particularly earth goddesses) symbolize both childbirth and sacrifice, two of the defining traits of the ''cihuateteo'' themselves.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Dan Goggin''' is an [[United States|American]] writer, [[composer]], and [[lyricist]] for [[musical theatre]].

Goggin began his career as a singer in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Luther (play)|Luther]]'', which starred [[Albert Finney]]. He then toured for five years as aa member of the folksinging duo, ''The Saxons'', before writing the music for and appearing in the off-Broadway musical ''Hark!''.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324647/bio Dan Goggin, IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunsense&gt;[http://nunsense.com/ The Official Nunsense Website:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goggin began composing both music and lyrics for revues satirizing current events, trends, and personalities. He later composed incidental music for the short-lived 1976 Broadway production, ''Legend'', starring [[Elizabeth Ashley]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], which closed after five performances.

Goggin's early life experiences, including schooling by the [[Marywood]] Dominican Sisters and his days as a [[seminarian]], influenced him to create his greatest success. A line of greeting cards featuring a nun offering tart quips caught on so quickly that Goggin decided to expand the concept into a cabaret show called ''The Nunsense Story'', which opened for a four-day run at [[Manhattan]]'s Duplex and remained for 38 weeks, encouraging its creator to expand it into a full-length theater production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offbroadway.com/offbroadway_blog?page=6 Off Broadway] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525022705/http://www.offbroadway.com/offbroadway_blog?page=6 |date=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was ''[[Nunsense]]'' (1985), one of [[off-Broadway]]'s biggest commercial successes, which ran a total of 3672 performances. By the time it closed, it had become an international phenomenon translated into 21 languages with more than 5000 productions worldwide. Goggin followed it with six sequels, ''Nunsense 2: The Second Coming'', ''Sister Amnesia's Country Western Nunsense Jamboree'', ''Nuncrackers: The Nunsense Christmas Musical'', ''Meshuggah-Nuns!'', ''Nunsensations: The Nunsense Vegas Revue'', and ''Nunset Boulevard''. In 1998 Dan opened an all-male production of ''Nunsense'' entitled N''unsense A-Men!'' The show played in New York City to rave reviews.&lt;ref name=imdb /&gt;

Goggin also wrote the book, music, and lyrics for ''A One-Way Ticket To Broadway'' and ''Balancing Act'', neither of which was as successful as the ''Nunsense'' franchise.

Olère studied at the Warsaw [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Academy of Fine Arts]], and upon completion of his studies there at the age of 16, moved to [[Danzig]] and later [[Berlin]], where he exhibited woodcuts at museums and art houses.&lt;ref name=dob&gt;{{cite web|title=David Olere Biography|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/ARTS/DOBIO/DOarts.HTM|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he was hired by [[Ernst Lubitsch]] at the ''Europäische Film Allianz'' to work as a set builder for the film ''[[Das Weib des Pharao]]''.&lt;ref name=sujo&gt;Sujo ''et al'' (2001), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Olère also lived in Munich and Heidelberg &lt;ref name="uahc"&gt;Union of American Hebrew Congregations ''et al'' (1981), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to Paris in 1923 and settling in [[Montparnasse]], where he designed costumes and publicity posters for [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name=sujo/&gt; In 1930, Olère married Juliette Ventura who gave birth to his son, Alexandre.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; When war broke out, Olère was drafted into the infantry regiment at [[Lons-le-Saunier]].&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

== The Holocaust ==
On February 20, 1943, Olère was arrested by French police during a round up of Jews in [[Seine-et-Oise]] and placed in [[Drancy internment camp]].&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;  On March 2, 1943, he was one of approximately 1,000 Jews deported from Drancy to Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264&gt;Hoffmann (1998), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; From this transport, Olère was one of 119 people selected for work; the rest were gassed shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; He was registered as prisoner 106144 and assigned to the ''Sonderkommando'' at Birkenau, the unit of prisoners forced to empty gas chambers and burn the bodies, firstly working in Bunker 2 and later in Crematorium III.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; In addition to these duties, he was also forced to work as an illustrator, writing and decorating letters for the SS.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

Olère remained at Auschwitz until January 19, 1945, when he was taken on the evacuation [[death march]], eventually reaching [[Mauthausen concentration camp]], then the Melk and [[Ebensee concentration camp|Ebensee]] subcamps,&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; from which he made five unsuccessful escape attempts.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; Following his liberation on May 6, 1945,&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; he learned that his entire family had been exterminated in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; He subsequently moved back to Paris.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt;

== Art ==
Olère began to draw at Auschwitz during the last days of the camp, when the SS became less attentive.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; His work has exceptional documentary value: there are no photos of what happened in the gas chambers and crematoria,&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; and Olère was the only artist to have worked as a member of the ''Sonderkommando'' and survived.&lt;ref name=hoffmann264/&gt; He was also the first witness to draw plans and cross-sections to explain how the crematoria worked.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

Olère felt compelled to capture Auschwitz artistically to illustrate the fate of all those that did not survive.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; He sometimes depicts himself in his paintings as a ghostly witnessing face in the background.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; He exhibited his work at the State Museum of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City]], at the [[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive|Berkeley Museum]], and in Chicago.&lt;ref name=uahc/&gt; He retired from being an artist in 1962, and died in 1985.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt; His widow and son have continued to inform the world about Auschwitz via his artwork.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

'''Dead File''' is a file kept by the Ethics section of [[Scientology organization]]s on those who have allegedly written the organization a critical letter, those who are declared [[Potential Trouble Source]]s and cannot be "handled" or [[Disconnection|disconnected]], and those who are declared [[Suppressive Person]]s.  The policy covering this is HCOPL 7 June 1965 Issue II, "Entheta Letters and the Dead File, Handling of".  Ethics Dead File is not to be confused with the 'dead file' in Central Files/Addresso for deceased persons.
The [[Church of Scientology]] has a strict policy of dealing with letters to the organization that are critical. From page 3 of this policy: "Ethics files shall include a DEAD FILE. This file includes all persons who write nasty or choppy letters to an org or its personnel. Rather than go to the trouble of issuing a suppressive person order or even investigating, we assign writers of choppy letters to the DEAD FILE. When their area is enturbulated or we want to locate a suppressive, we can always consult our DEAD FILE for possible candidates and then investigate and issue an order.  The DEAD FILE is by sections of the area or the world and alphabetical in those sections. The actual action is simply to cut comm.  You can always let entheta lines drop.  Entheta means ''en'' = enturbulated; ''theta'' = thought or life."

There are exceptions to the application of the Dead File policy. From page 4:"Dead file does ''not'' cover business firms demanding bills, government squawks or dangerous suits or situations. It covers only entheta public letters received on any line including ''SO #1''."  Letters destined for the Dead File are literally rubber stamped as "entheta". "Receiver stamps it with a big rubber stamp:
"ENTHETA
To Central Files
To Address then
To ETHICS DEAD FILES"

Dead Filing is not restricted to just the organization receiving a critical letter, but rather any Scientology organization the sender may correspond with. From page 5: "Ethics receiving a ''folder or a letter'' marked with the ENTHETA stamp takes the following action:  Writes a surface-mail postcard, colored an ugly mustard yellow, to any organizations where the person's name may be part of CF (central files), stamped on the back as follows:
From (name of org)
ENTHETA
To Central Files
To Address
To ETHICS DEAD FILE
and writes the person's name and address under it.  Do NOT put two names on one card.  One card = one name."

From page 6: "However, if Ethics finds the person is not in its DEAD FILE and all it has received is a card, ETHICS makes a folder and puts the card in it.  That way the DEAD FILE of an org tells one that there is other material in another org and knows what org."

Ethics personnel are not to verify the accuracy of the Dead File label because the system of management is "fast flow".
"Ethics does not even bother to read the letter or examine the folder on receiving a DEAD FILE folder or letter.  This is, after all, a fast flow system of management.  With the DEAD FILE system, one just parks the name in a folder in the DEAD FILES as inactive until there is ''a reason'' to do otherwise."

From page 7: "It is the ''full'' intention that:

1. ''All'' choppy, nattery rumormongery letters dead-end in the DEAD FILE.  2. That no further magazines or procurement letters go to the person. 3. That no staff personnel be enturbulated by the content of such letters. 4. That the line be cut completely. 5. That a record remain in Ethics."

Even if the sender of a past critical letter writes a friendly letter thereafter, that sender is still kept in the Dead File as Hubbard believed that these people were "mad dogs" who "don't change their froth" unless "released" or "cleared".
"When a Letter Reg, in answering some letter, calls for the folder and finds it is a mustard-colored DEAD FILE DUMMY, the letter to be answered is simply stamped with the above entheta stamp no matter ''what'' it says, and is routed with the dummy on through  as though it were an entheta letter regardless of what he new letter says.  Short of releasing and clearing, these mad dogs don't change their froth."

SP names are also put into the Dead File and given an additional rubber stamp. From page 8: "All suppressive persons and groups are filed in the DEAD FILE but with the Ethics Order.  The Ethics Order is stamped with the ENTHETA stamp as above but with the additional stamp ''Suppressive''."

Potential Trouble Sources are spared the Dead File if they handle or disconnect from the SP."A potential trouble source order is not given the entheta DEAD FILE routing unless the person refuses to disconnect or handle.  At this time the person's name is put on a despatch stamped with the entheta stamp and is routed to CF (central files), etc., as above.  Sometimes a PTS refusing to disconnect is declared suppressive and in such a case it is handled as an SP above."

Those who are Dead Filed are never informed of that action.  Getting out of the Dead File is at the discretion of the Ethics Officer. From page 9: "How does a person ever get out of the Dead File? One could somehow discover without our help he or she was in the dead file (we never inform them).  If so, he or she could take it up with the Ethics Officer.  But the probable outcome may just be more Dead File."

A report from a former Scientology staff member says that in the period of one year, over 1200 complaint letters were disposed of by using the Dead File policy in a Scientology organization.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Sir John | last = Foster | title = Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology, Chapter 7: Scientology and its Enemies | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London | year = 1971}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scientology policy, "Entheta Letters and the Dead File, Handling of" was cited as an exhibit in the [[New Zealand]] government inquiry into Scientology called the [[Dumbleton-Powles Report]].&lt;ref name="dpowles"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Sir Guy Richardson | last = Powles | title = The Commission of Inquiry into the Hubbard Scientology Organization | publisher = Government Printer, Wellington | year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of 21 precepts. "Dokkodo" was largely composed on the occasion of Musashi giving away his possessions in preparation for death, and was dedicated to his favorite disciple, [[Terao Magonojō]] (to whom the earlier ''[[The Book of Five Rings|Go rin no sho]]'' [''The Book of Five Rings''] had also been dedicated), who took them to heart. "Dokkōdō" expresses a stringent, honest, and [[ascetic]] view of life.

{{Creationism2}}
[[Hinduism]] includes a range of viewpoints about the [[origin of life]], [[creationism]] and [[evolution]]. There is no single story of creation, due to dynamic diversity of Hinduism, and these are derived from various sources like [[Vedas]], some from the [[Brahmana]]s, some from [[Puranas]]; some are philosophical, based on concepts, and others are narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyo.in/variety/hindusim-world-creation-universe-brahma-vishu-shiva/story/1/19522.html|title=How did the world come into being according to Hinduism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rigveda]] mentions the ''[[Hiranyagarbha]]'' ("golden embryo") as the source of the creation of the Universe, similar to the [[world egg]] motif found in the [[creation myth]]s of many other civilizations. It also contains a myth of  [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origin, in which the creation arises out of the [[dismemberment]] of a cosmic being (the [[Purusha]]) who is sacrificed by the gods.&lt;ref name="Jan2007"/&gt; As for the creation of the primordial gods themselves, the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of Rigveda takes a near-[[agnostic]] stand, stating that the Gods came into being after the world's creation, and nobody knows when the world first came into being.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Ralph T.H. (Transl.): [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10129.htm Rigveda Hymn CXXIX. Creation] in Hymns of the Rgveda, Vol. II, 1889-92. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the later [[Puranas|Puranic]] texts, the creator god [[Brahma]] is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe'. Some texts consider him equivalent to the Hiranyagarbha or the Purusha, while others state that he arose out of these. Brahma is a part of the [[trimurti|trinity]] of gods that also includes [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], who are responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively. 

Many Hindu texts mention the [[Hindu cosmology|cycle of creation and destruction]]. The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] states that the current human generation descends from [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the only man who survived a [[flood myth|great deluge]] after being warned by the God. This legend is comparable to the other [[List of flood myths|flood legends]], such as the story of the [[Noah's Ark]] mentioned in the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="Sunil1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sunil Sehgal | title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism: C-G | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWG64bgtf3sC&amp;pg=PA401 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | year=1999 | publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons | isbn=978-81-7625-064-1 | page=401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact? The Teachings of U.G.Krishnamurti: A Case Study  |last=Moorty | first=J.S.R.L.Narayana| work = Krishnamurti Centennial Conference| accessdate=2008-12-26 |date=May 18–21, 1995|quote=Hinduism has its own version of evolution, which agrees with the scientific theory that evolution is from the simple to the complex and from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the concept of [[Dashavatara]] can be seen as having some similarities to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.The [[Matsya|first incarnation of Vishnu]] in the form of a fish resembles the evolutionary origin of fish in the [[Silurian Period]].

In a survey of 909 people, 77% of its respondents in India agreed that enough scientific evidence exists to support [[Darwinism|Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution]], and 85% of God-believing people said they agree with evolution as well.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885|title=Opinions on evolution from ten countries - NCSE|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article2100585.ece | title = One in seven Britons believe in creationism over evolution | location=London | work=The Times | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the survey conducted by [[Pew Forum]] in the [[United States]], 80% of Hindus agree that evolution is the best explanation for the origin of human life on earth.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;[http://pewforum.org/Science-and-Bioethics/Religious-Differences-on-the-Question-of-Evolution.aspx Religious Groups: Opinions of Evolution], [[Pew Forum]] (conducted in 2007, released in 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in India, there were minimal references to Darwinism in the 1800s. Elements of Victorian England opposed the idea of Darwinism. Hindus already had present notion of common ancestry between humans and animals. The Hindu dharma believes that the gods have animal features, showing a theory that humans can be reborn again as animals or with their features.&lt;ref name="Gosling 345–347-348–353"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: Does What Goes Around Come Around?|journal=Zygon|date=June 2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–347–348–353|url=http://authenticate.library.duq.edu/login?url=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3drfh%26AN%3dATLA0001843790%26site%3dehost-live|accessdate=2014-01-24|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hindu creationism ==

According to [[Hindu]] [[creationism]] all [[species]] on earth including [[humans]] have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]]. Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;Science &amp; Religion: A New Introduction, Alister E. McGrath, 2009, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;The creationists: from scientific creationism to intelligent design, Ronald L. Numbers, 2006, p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of [[old earth creationism]]. According to Hindu creationists the [[universe]] may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]] which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the [[earth]].&lt;ref&gt;James C. Carper, Thomas C. Hunt, The Praeger Handbook of Religion and Education in the United States: A-L, 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1, Surendranath Dasgupta, 1992, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation myths ===

Hinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alone in Unity: Torments of an Iraqi God-Seeker in North America | first=Faris | last=Georgis | publisher=Dorrance Publishing | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFZrxLjtiI8C&amp;pg=PA62 | page=62 | isbn=1-4349-0951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Hindu texts]] do not provide a single canonical account of the creation; they mention a range of theories of the creation of the world, some of which are contradictory.&lt;ref name="Robert1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert M.

==== Rigveda ====

The [[Purusha Sukta]] of the earliest Hindu text [[Rigveda]] mentions [[Purusha]], primeval cosmic being.&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"&gt;{{cite book | author=S. N. Sadasivan | title=A Social History Of India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be3PCvzf-BYC&amp;pg=PA227 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2000 | publisher=APH Publishing | isbn=978-81-7648-170-0 | pages=226–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purusha is described as all that has ever existed and will ever exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10090.htm|title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda, Book 10: HYMN XC. Puruṣa.|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This being's body was the origin of four different kinds of people: the [[Brahmin]], the [[Kshatriya|Rajanya]], the [[Vaishya]], and the [[Shudra]].&lt;ref name=Tignor2014&gt;"Worlds Together Worlds Apart", Fourth Edition, Beginnings Through the 15th century, Tignor, 2014, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Viraj, variously interpreted as the [[world egg|mundane egg]]&lt;ref name="SNSadasivan2000"/&gt; (see [[Hiranyagarbha]]) or the twofold male-female energy, was born from Purusha, and the Purusha was born again from Viraj. The gods then performed a [[yajna]] with the Purusha, leading to the creation of the other things in the manifested world from his various body parts and his mind. These things included the animals, the Vedas, the [[Varna]]s, the celestial bodies, the air, the sky, the heavens, the earth, the directions, and the Gods [[Indra]] and [[Agni]]. It is likely that this myth has [[proto-Indo-European religion|proto-Indo-European]] origins, as it is similar to other myths found in the Indo-European cultures, in which the creation arises out of the dismemberment of a divine being (cf. [[Ymir]] of the [[Norse mythology]]).&lt;ref name="Jan2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jan N.

The concept of Purusha is similar to the concept of [[Brahman]] described in the later texts.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"&gt;{{cite book | author=Roshen Dalal | title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA318 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=5 October 2011 | publisher=Penguin Books India | isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 | pages=318–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318}} As for the creation of the primordial beings (such as the gods who performed the sacrifice of the Purusha), the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] states:&lt;ref name="McNamaraWildman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick McNamara|author2=Wesley J.

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
Who really knows, and who can swear,
How creation came, when or where!
Even gods came after creation’s day,
Who really knows, who can truly say
When and how did creation start?
Did He do it? Or did He not?
Only He, up there, knows, maybe;
Or perhaps, not even He.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Rig Veda 10.129.1-7
}}

Rigveda (10.121) also mentions the [[Hiranyagarbha]] (literally, golden embryo/womb/[[world egg|egg]]) that existed before the creation. This metaphor has been interpreted differently by the various later texts. The [[Samkhya]] texts state that Purusha and the [[Prakṛti|Prakriti]] made the embryo, from which the world emerged. In another tradition, the creator god [[Brahma]] emerged from the egg and created the world, while in yet another tradition the Brahma himself is the Hiranyagarbha.&lt;ref name="Edward2009"&gt;{{cite book | author=Edward Quinn | title=Critical Companion to George Orwell | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZET2sSUVsgC&amp;pg=PA188 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2009 | publisher=Infobase Publishing | isbn=978-1-4381-0873-5 | page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of the Purusha, the creation of the gods and other details of the embryo creation myth have been described variously by the later Hindu texts.

The early hymns of Rigveda also mention [[Tvastar]] as the first born creator of the human world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/594460?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101565303097 The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda]" by W. Norman Brown. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 62, No. 2 (Jun., 1942), pp. 85-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting the creation of gods, the Rig Veda does seem to affirm ‘’creatio ex nihilo’’. Rig Veda 10.72 states:
{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
देवानां नु वयं जाना पर वोचाम विपन्यया | 
उक्थेषुशस्यमानेषु यः पश्यादुत्तरे युगे ||

1. LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Gods,
That one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.
2 These Brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith,
Existence, in an earlier age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
3 Existence, in the earliest age of Gods, from Non-existence sprang.
Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 10.72 translation by R.T.H. Griffith (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

==== Brahmanas ====
[[File:The fish avatara of Vishnu saves Manu during the great deluge.jpg|thumb|right|The [[matsya|fish avatara]] of [[Vishnu]] saves [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the progenitor of the existing human race, during the [[flood myth|great deluge]].]]
The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] mentions a story of creation, in which the [[Prajapati]] performs [[tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] to reproduce himself. He releases the waters and enters them in the form of an egg that evolves into [[Brahmanda|the cosmos]].&lt;ref name="WhitePollak2010"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Merry I.

With further tapas, he created the devas. He also created the [[asura]]s, and the darkness came into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}} It also contains a story similar to the other [[List of flood myths|great flood stories]]. After the great flood, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] the only surviving human, offers a sacrifice from which Ida is born. From her, the existing human race comes into the being.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

==== Upanishads ====

The [[Aitareya Upanishad]] (3.4.1) mentions that only the "[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]" (the Self) existed in the beginning. The Self created the heaven (''Ambhas''), the sky (''Marikis''), the earth (''Mara'') and the underworld (''Ap''). He then formed the Purusha from the water. He also created the speech, the fire, the prana (breath of life), the air and the various senses, the directions, the trees, the mind, the moon and other things.&lt;ref name="MaxMuller2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=F. Max Muller | title=The Upanishads, Vol I | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6VFU0jK7UC&amp;pg=PA228 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=30 June 2004 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4191-8641-7 | pages=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (1.4) mentions that in the beginning, only the Atman existed as the Purusha. Feeling lonely, the Purusha divided itself into two parts: male ("pati") and female ("patni"). The men were born when the male embraced the female. The female thought "how can he embrace me, after having produced me from himself? I shall hide myself." She then became a cow to hide herself, but the male became a bull and embraced her. Thus the cows were born. Similarly, everything that exists in pairs, was created. Next, the Purusha created the fire, the [[soma (drink)|soma]] and the immortal gods (the [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]]) from his better part. He also created the various powers of the gods, the different [[varna in Hinduism|classes]], the [[dharma]] (law or duty) and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15055.htm Fourth Brâhmana] in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Fourth Brahmana. Translated by Max Müller as The Upanishads, Part 2 (SBE15) [1879].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] states that the being (''sat'') was created from the non-being. The Being later became the ''Atman'' (2.7.1), and then created the worlds (1.1.1).&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} The [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chhandogya]] states that the Brahma creates, sustains and destroys the world.&lt;ref name="ANPrasad2007"&gt;{{cite book | author=S.K.

==== Later texts ====
[[File:An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati.jpg|thumb|350px|left|An attempt to depict the creative activities of Prajapati; a steel engraving from the 1850s]]
Belief in evolution is among the [[Samkhya]] philosophy. In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, evolution is symbolized by the Sanskrit term parinama. Many Hindu reformers compare this term and philosophy with Darwinism. The prominent Vivekananda, based most of his cosmological and biological ideas off of the [[Samkhya]].&lt;ref name="Gosling 345–347-348–353"/&gt;  The [[Samkhya]] texts state that there are two distinct fundamental eternal entities: the Purusha and the [[Prakriti]]. The Prakriti has three [[guṇa|qualities]]: ''[[sattva]]'' (purity or preservation), ''[[rajas]]'' (creation) and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'' (darkness or destruction). When the equilibrium between these qualities gets broken, the act of creation starts. ''Rajas'' quality leads to creation.&lt;ref name="Joshi2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dinkar Joshi | title=Glimpses Of Indian Culture | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fw-0iBvmMAC&amp;pg=PA32 | accessdate=15 December 2012 | date=1 January 2005 | publisher=Star Publications | isbn=978-81-7650-190-3 | page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later texts such as the [[Puranas]] identify the Purusha with the [[God in Hinduism|God]]. In many Puranic notes, [[Brahma]] is the creator god.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} However, some Puranas also identify Vishnu, Shiva or Devi as the creator.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}}

In [[Garuda Purana]], there was nothing in the universe except the [[Brahman]]. The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his hair, sheep from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from feet). His body hair became the herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind, Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa. Kashypata married thirrteen of Daksha's daughter and all the devas and the createures were born through them.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|103}} Other Puranas and the Manu Smriti mention several variations of this theory.

In [[Vishnu Purana]], the Purusha is same as the creator deity [[Brahma]], and is a part of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}} The [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] texts mention the Hiranyagarbha as a creation of [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="Edward2009"/&gt; According to the [[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]] Purusha and Prakriti emerged together and formed the [[Brahman]], the supreme universal spirit that is the origin and support of the universe.&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|319}}

The Advaita Vedanta states that the creation arises from Brahman, but it is illusory and has no reality. (Vivarta)&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{realmente p|103}}

===Hindu cosmological view===

Many Hindu philosophies mention that the [[Hindu cycle of the universe|creation is cyclic]].&lt;ref name="Roshen2011"/&gt;{{rp|104}} According to the [[Upanishad]]s, the universe and the Earth, along with humans and other creatures, undergo repeated cycles (''[[pralaya]]'') of creation and destruction. A variety of myths exist regarding the specifics of the process, but in general the Hindu view of the cosmos is as eternal and cyclic. The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. In Hindu cosmology, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 years (one [[day of Brahma]], the creator or ''kalpa'')&lt;ref&gt;A survey of Hinduism, [[Klaus K. Klostermaier]], 2007, pp. 495-496&lt;/ref&gt; and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day. This process, called ''pralaya'' (cataclysm), repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion, 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.

== Modern Interpretations of Scriptural archetypes ==

Most Hindus accept the theory of biological evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; They either regard the scriptural creation theories as allegories and metaphors, or reconcile these legends with the modern theory of evolution.

===Dashavatara===
{{main|Dashavatara#Evolutionary interpretation}}

The order of the [[Dashavatara]] (ten principal [[avatar]]s of the god [[Vishnu]]) is interpreted to convey Darwin's evolution.&lt;ref name="Chandra1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suresh Chandra|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses|year=1998|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-039-9|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishna2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nanditha Krishna|title=Sacred Animals of India|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306619-4|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] opined that they are a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of evolution. Like the evolutionary process itself, the first avatar of God is a fish - [[Matsya]], then comes the aquatic reptile turtle, [[Kurma]], then a mammal - the boar [[Varaha]], then [[Narasimha]], a man-lion being, [[Vamana]], the dwarf then the rest four are humans; Kalki is not yet born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cover Story: Haldane: Life Of A Prodigious Mind | journal=[[Science Reporter]] | year=1992 | volume=29 | pages=46 |publisher=Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various thinkers and authors like [[Helena Blavatsky]],  [[Monier Monier-Williams]], [[Nabinchandra Sen]], [[C. D. Deshmukh]] have associated the Dashavatara with evolution.

===Vanara===
[[File:Building of Rama's Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Hindu epics mention an ape-like humanoid species called the [[vanara]]s.]]

The [[Sanskrit]] epics of the Hindus mention several [[exotic tribes of ancient India|exotic creatures]] including ape-like humanoids.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Trikha, A study of the Ramayana of Valmiki, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindus see this as a proof of the historicity of their mythological characters and as support for the theory of evolution in their texts. The [[Ramayana]] speaks of the [[Vanaras]], an ape-like species with human intelligence, that existed millions of years ago. According to the Ramayana alongside these [[ape-men]] existed [[modern humans]]. Thus, according to these ancient writings, the status of such creatures was a state of coexistence rather than evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tribute to Hinduism: Thoughts and Wisdom Spanning Continents and Time about India and Her Culture|page=386|first=Sushama|last=Londhe|year=2008|quote= For example, the Ramayana speaks of the Vanaras, a species of apelike men that existed millions of years ago.|publisher=Pragun Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu opposition to Christian creationism==
While the [[Creation–evolution controversy]] has seen much debate in the US and other countries, it is an insignificant issue in India, because of its Hindu-majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Balaram|first = P|title = Editorial| journal = [[Current Science]] | volume = 86| issue = 9| year = 2004| url = http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1191.pdf| pages = 1191–1192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Coleman  |first = Simon |author2=Carlin, Leslie |title = The Cultures of Creationism: Anti-evolutionism in English-speaking Countries |chapter = The cultures of creationism: Shifting boundaries of belief, knowledge and nationhood |publisher = Ashgate Publishing| page = 3| year = 2003|isbn = 0-7546-0912-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus are among many faiths that have expressed apprehension about efforts to teach [[Christian]] creationism in public schools in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''"Christian agenda worries other faiths: push for intelligent design seen by some as imposing Christianity on others"'', Jim Baker, Lawrence World – Journal, May 12, 2005.

'''Hinduism in Southeast Asia''' has a profound impact on the region's [[Culture of Southeast Asia|cultural development]] and [[History of Southeast Asia|its history]].

[[Hinduism|Hindu civilization]] also transformed and shaped the social construct and statehood of Southeast Asian regional polity. Through the formation of [[Indianized kingdoms]], small indigenous polities led by petty chieftain were transformed into major kingdoms and empires led by a [[maharaja]] with statecraft concept akin to those in India. It gave birth to the former [[Champa]] civilisation in [[History of Vietnam|southern parts of Central Vietnam]], [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] in [[Cambodia]], the [[Khmer Empire]] in [[Indochina]], [[Langkasuka|Langkasuka Kingdom]] and [[Kedah Kingdom|Old Kedah]] in the [[Malay Peninsula]], the [[Sriwijaya]]n kingdom on [[Sumatra]], the [[Medang kingdom|Medang]] kingdom, [[Singhasari]] and the [[Majapahit Empire]] based in [[Java]], [[Bali]], and parts of the [[History of the Philippines|Philippine]] archipelago. The civilisation of India influenced the languages, scripts, written tradition, literatures, calendars, beliefs system and artistic aspects of these peoples and nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The spread of Hinduism in Southeast Asia and the Pacific | work = Britannica | url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism/The-spread-of-Hinduism-in-Southeast-Asia-and-the-Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient era===
[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]
Indian scholars wrote about the Dwipantara or [[Jawa Dwipa]] Hindu kingdom in [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] around 200 BC. "Yawadvipa" is mentioned in India's earliest epic, the [[Ramayana]]. [[Sugriva]], the chief of [[Rama]]'s army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of [[Sita]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ic4BjWFmNIC&amp;pg=PA465 History of Ancient India Kapur, Kamlesh]&lt;/ref&gt; It was hence referred to in Indian by the Sanskrit name "yāvaka dvīpa" (dvīpa = island). Southeast Asia was frequented by traders from eastern India, particularly [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], as well as from the [[Chola dynasty|kingdoms]] of South India.

The [[Indianised kingdom|Indianised]] [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom was established in [[West Java]] around 400s, produced among the earliest inscriptions in [[Indonesian history]]. There was a marked Buddhist influence starting about 425 in the region. Around the 6th century, [[Kalingga Kingdom|Kalingga]] Indianized kingdom was established in norther coast of [[Central Java]]. The kingdom name was derived from [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] east coast of India.&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Southeast Asian seafaring peoples engaged in extensive trade with India and China. Which attracted the attention of the [[Mongols]], Chinese and Japanese, as well as [[History of Islam|Islamic traders]], who reached the Aceh area of [[Sumatra]] in the 12th century.

Examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout the Southeast Asia owe much to the legacy of the [[Chola dynasty]]. For example, the great temple complex at [[Prambanan]] in Indonesia exhibit a number of similarities with the South Indian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_dynasty#CITEREFSastri1984|title=Chola dynasty - Wikipedia|website=en.m.wikipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57054139|title=A history of India|last=Hermann.|first=Kulke,|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|others=Rothermund, Dietmar, 1933-|isbn=0203391268|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=57054139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Malay chronicle ''Sejarah Melayu'', the rulers of the [[Malacca sultanate]] claimed to be descendants of the kings of the Chola Empire.Chola rule is remembered in Malaysia today as many princes there have names ending with Cholan or Chulan,one such being [[Raja Chulan]], the Raja of [[Perak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aklujkar|first=Ashok|last2=Kalyanaraman|first2=A.|date=1971|title=Aryatarangini: The Saga of the Indo-Aryans.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2755739|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=44|issue=3|pages=451|doi=10.2307/2755739|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chola school of art also spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/6237916|title=Thai art with Indian influences|last=1945-|first=Promsak Jermsawatdi,|date=1979|publisher=Abhinav Publications|oclc=6237916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7312/bowm11004|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|last=Bowman|first=John|date=2000-01-31|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231500043|location=New York Chichester, West Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have pointed out that the legends of [[Ikshvaku (Hinduism)|Ikshvaku]] and Sumati may have their origin in the Southeast-Asian myth of the birth of humanity from a bitter gourd. The legend of Sumati, the wife of King Sagar, tells that she produced offspring with the aid of a bitter gourd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Koenraad | last=Elst | authorlink=Koenraad Elst|title=[[Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate]] | publisher=Aditya Prakashan | year=1999 | isbn=81-86471-77-4}}; Sergent, Bernard: Genèse de l'Inde, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:A day of devotion – Thaipusam in Singapore (4316108409).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hinduism in Singapore|Hindu devotees]] during [[Thaipusam]] festival in [[Singapore]]]]
Today, vibrant Hindu communities remain in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Medan]] city of [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] mainly due to the presence of Indians, such as [[Tamil people]], who migrated from the Indian sub-continent to Southeast Asia in past centuries. One notably Southeast Asian aspect of Tamil Hinduism is the festival of [[Thaipusam]], while other Hindu religious festivals such as [[Diwali]] are also well-observed by Hindus in the region. In Thailand and [[Cambodia]], [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Khmer people]] practised Hindu rituals and traditions along with their Buddhist faith, and Hindu gods such as [[Brahma]] are still widely revered.

In [[Indonesia]], it is not only people of Indian descent who practice Hinduism; Hinduism still survives as the major religion in [[Bali]], where [[native Indonesians]], the [[Balinese people]], adheres to [[Agama Hindu Dharma]], a variant of Hinduism derived from ancient Java-Bali Hindu traditions developed in the island for almost two millennia that often incorporates native spiritual elements. Other than the Balinese, a small enclave of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] Hindu minorities are also can be found in [[Java (island)|Java]], such as around Tengger mountain ranges near [[Mount Bromo|Bromo]] and [[Semeru]] volcanoes, [[Karanganyar Regency]] in [[Central Java]], and near [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]]. Similarly, Hinduism is also found among the [[Cham people|Cham]] minority in [[Southern Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]]: just like the Javanese, the majority of them are Muslims but a minority are Hindu. In other parts of Indonesia, the term ''Hindu Dharma'' is often loosely used as umbrella category to identify native spiritual beliefs and indigenous religions such as Hindu [[Kaharingan]] professed by [[Dayak people|Dayak]] of [[Kalimantan]].
[[File:Bali-Ubud 0704a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Balinese temple|temple]] offering in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]]]
The resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country.  In the early 1970s, the [[Toraja]] people of [[Sulawesi]] were the first to be identified under the umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980.  In an unpublished report in 1999, the National Indonesian Bureau of Statistics admitted that around 100,000 people had officially converted or 'reconverted' from Islam to Hinduism over the previous two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=49 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820025445/http://www.swaveda.com/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=49 |archivedate=20 August 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ministry of Religious Affairs, as of 2007 estimates there to be at least 10 million Hindus in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90137.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of [[Sabdapalon]] and [[Jayabaya]]. Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of [[Sukarno]]'s PNI, and now support [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]].  This return to the 'religion of [[Majapahit]]' (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.

Next to Indonesian Balinese, today, the [[Cham people|Balamon Cham]] are the only surviving native (non-[[Indian people|Indic]]) Hindus in Southeast Asia. In Vietnam there are roughly 160,000 members of the Cham ethnic minority, majority of them adheres Hinduism while some are Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = National Geographic | title = The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines, The ancestors of Vietnam's Cham people built one of the great empires of Southeast Asia | author = Adam Bray | date = 18 June 2014 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After centuries being dominated by Kinh ([[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]), today there are some effort to revive Cham culture.

==Regions==
===Cambodia===
[[File:Angkor Wat W-Seite.jpg|thumb|left|[[Angkor Wat]], in [[Cambodia]], is one of hundreds of ancient Hindu temples in southeast Asia.]]
[[Cambodia]] was first influenced by Hinduism during the beginning of the [[Kingdom of Funan]]. Hinduism was one of the [[Khmer Empire]]'s official religions. Cambodia is the home of the holy temple of [[Angkor Wat]], the largest Hindu temple in the world. The main religion adhered in Khmer kingdom was [[Hinduism]], followed by [[Buddhism]] in popularity. Initially the kingdom revered Hinduism as the main state religion. [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] were the most revered deities, worshipped in Khmer Hindu temples. Temples such as Angkor Wat are actually known as ''Preah Pisnulok'' (''Vara Vishnuloka'' in Sanskrit) or the realm of Vishnu, to honour the posthumous King [[Suryavarman II]] as Vishnu. Hindu ceremonies and rituals performed by Brahmins (Hindu priests), usually only held among ruling elites of the king's family, nobles, and the ruling class.

The Khmer Empire has developed a complex society where sophisticated culture, art and architecture flourish. The Khmer king and his officials were in charge of irrigation management and water distribution, which consisted of an intricate series of hydraulics infrastructure, such as canals, moats, and massive reservoirs called ''[[baray]]s''. Society was arranged in a hierarchy reflecting the [[Hindu caste]] system, where the commoners — rice farmers and fishermen — formed the large majority of the population. The [[kshatriya]]s — royalty, nobles, warlords, soldiers, and warriors — formed a governing elite and authorities. Other social classes included [[brahmin]]s (priests), traders, [[artisan]]s such as carpenters and stonemasons, potters, [[metalworker]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and textile weavers, while on the lowest social level are [[slaves]]. The extensive irrigation projects provided rice surpluses that could support a large population. The state religion was Hinduism but influenced by the cult of [[Devaraja]], elevating the Khmer kings as possessing the divine quality of living gods on earth, attributed to the incarnation of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="God and King"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=7306 |title=God and King : The Devaraja Cult in South Asian Art &amp; Architecture |author=Sengupta, Arputha Rani (Ed.) |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |ISBN= 8189233262|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In politics, this status was viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The cult enabled the Khmer kings to embark on massive architectural projects, constructing majestic monuments such as [[Angkor Wat]] and Bayon to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth.

The empire's official religions included Hinduism and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] until [[Theravada Buddhism]] prevailed, even among the [[Commoner|lower classes]], after its introduction from [[Sri Lanka]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keyes1995|Keyes, 1995]], pp.78–82&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Hinduism slowly declined in Cambodia, and finally being replaced by Theravadan Buddhist as the major faith in the kingdom. Despite this, hindu rituals continue to play an important role in the kingdom. Like in the neighboring Thailand, the ceremony of coronation is conducted mostly by royal brahmins, during which the sovereign swears in front of the idols of gods Vishnu and Shiva to maintain the ancient national traditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/royal-cambodian-coronation&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in [[Indonesia]], Hinduism is practised by 3% of the total population, they constitute 92.29% of the population of [[Bali]] and 15.75% of the population of Central Kalimantan, as of the 2000 census. However, between the 4th century to 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism was adhered by the majority of the population, along with native indigenous [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs that venerated natural and [[veneration of the dead|ancestral spirits]]. By 15th to 16th-century [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the majority religion in Indonesian archipelago. The influence of Hinduism has profoundly left its marks on the culture of Bali, Java and Sumatra. Bali has become the last remnant of once Hindu dominated region.

Hindu influences reached the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] as early as first century. In 4th-century, the kingdom of [[Kutai]] in [[East Kalimantan]], [[Tarumanagara]] in [[West Java]], and Holing ([[Kalingga]]) in [[Central Java]], were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Several notable ancient Indonesian Hindu kingdoms are [[Medang Kingdom|Mdang i Bhumi Mataram]], famous for the construction of the majestic 9th-century [[Trimurti]] [[Prambanan]] temple, followed by [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[Singosari]], and reached the peak of its influence in the 14th-century [[Majapahit]], the last and largest among Hindu-Buddhist Javanese empires.

The Hindu civilisations has left its marks in [[Indonesian culture]]. The epics ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'', became enduring traditions among Indonesian artforms, expressed in [[wayang]] shadow puppet and [[Dance in Indonesia|dance performances]]. Many [[Indonesian names#Sanskrit-derived names|Indonesian names]] are Sanskrit-based, and [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] contains loads of [[List of loanwords in Indonesian#From Sanskrit|loandwords of Sanskrit origin]]. The vehicle of [[Vishnu]], [[Garuda]], was adopted as both [[National emblem of Indonesia|national emblem Garuda Pancasila]] and flag carrier national airline named [[Garuda Indonesia]].

Today, the Indonesian government has recognised Hinduism as one of the country's six officially sanctioned religions, along with Islam, [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The new Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (''pura'') or around archaeological temple sites (''candi'') which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of [[Semeru|Mt. Semeru]], Java's highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the [[Kingdom of Blambangan]], the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri), where the Hindu king and prophet [[Jayabaya]] is said to have achieved spiritual liberation (''[[Moksha|moksa]]''). Another site is the new Pura Pucak Raung in East Java, which is mentioned in [[Balinese literature]] as the place from where [[Maharishi Markandeya]] took Hinduism to Bali in the 5th century.

An example of resurgence around major archaeological remains of ancient Hindu temple sites was observed in Trowulan near Mojokerto, the capital of the legendary Hindu empire [[Majapahit]]. A local Hindu movement is struggling to gain control of a newly excavated temple building which they wish to see restored as a site of active Hindu worship. The temple is to be dedicated to Gajah Mada, the man attributed with transforming the small Hindu kingdom of Majapahit into an empire. Although there has been a more pronounced history of resistance to Islamization in East Java, Hindu communities are also expanding in Central Java near the ancient Hindu monuments of Prambanan. The current estimates of Hinduism in Indonesia range from 4 to 8 percent.

Hinduism make less than 0.1% of the population of Laos.
Approximately 7,000 People of Laos are Hindus.

In Ancient Time Laos used to be a part of Ancient Hindu Empire [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Wat Phou]] is one of the last influences of that period. The Laotian adaptation of the Ramayana is called ''[[Phra Lak Phra Lam]]''.

[[File:Taipusam Batu Caves, 2012 - panoramio (6).jpg|thumb|[[Thaipusam]] festival at [[Batu Caves]] Temple in [[Malaysia]]. Majority of Malaysian Hindus are [[Tamil Malaysians|Tamils]].]]
[[Hinduism]] is the fourth largest religion in Malaysia. About 1.78 million Malaysian residents (6.3% of the total population) are Hindus, according to 2010 Census of Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=1215 2010 Population and Housing Census of Malaysia (Census 2010)] Department of Statistics Malaysia, Official Portal (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Malaysian Hindus are settled in western parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. Indian Hindus and Buddhists began arriving in Malaysia during ancient and medieval era. A large number of Hindus from South India were brought to Malaysia by British colonial empire during the 19th and 20th century, as indentured labourers to work on coffee and sugarcane plantations and tin mining; later they were deployed in large numbers, along with Chinese Buddhists, on rubber plantations. The British [[Kangani system|''kangani'' system]] of recruitment, designed to reduce labour turnover and enhance labour stability, encouraged Hindu workers to recruit friends and family from India to work in British operations in Malaysia. The kangani system brought numerous Tamil Hindus into Malaysia by early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Sandhu (2010), Indians in Malaya: Some Aspects of Their Immigration and Settlement (1786-1957), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521148139}}, pp. 89-102&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950s, about 12.8% of Malaysian population professed to be a Hindu.

After Malaysia gained its independence from British colonial empire in 1957, it declared its official state religion as Islam, and adopted a discriminatory constitution as well as the Sedition Act of 1971 which limited public debate on Malaysia's treatment of religion, language and citizenship policies.&lt;ref name=2011report/&gt;&lt;ref name=gandg&gt;Gill &amp; Gopal, Understanding Indian Religious Practice in Malaysia, J Soc Sci, 25(1-2-3): 135-146 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Lee, Patterns of Religious Tension in Malaysia, Asian Survey, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Apr. 1988), pp. 400-418&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, there have been increasing reports of religious persecution of Hindus, along with other minority religions, by various state governments of Malaysia and its [[Sharia]] courts.&lt;ref name=2011report&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/502105a42d.html 2011 Report on International Religious Freedom - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222357.pdf Religious Freedom Report 2013 - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu temples built on private property, and built long before Malaysian independence, have been demolished by Malaysian government officials in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208456.pdf Religious Freedom Report 2012 - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, there has been large scale emigration of Hindus (along with Buddhists and Christians) from Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orfonline.org/cms/export/orfonline/modules/issuebrief/attachments/malaysia_1203067850658.pdf Malaysian Indian Community: Victim of ‘Bumiputera’ Policy] ORF Issue Report (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akaur&gt;Amarjit Kaur, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/02/20/aliens-in-the-land-indian-migrant-workers-in-malaysia/ Indian migrant workers in Malaysia – part 1] Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akaur2&gt;Amarjit Kaur, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/02/21/aliens-in-the-land-indian-migrant-workers-in-malaysia-part-2/ Indian migrant workers in Malaysia – part 2] Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myanmar===
{{main|Hinduism in Myanmar}}
[[File:Hindu temple procession cart, Yangon.jpg|thumb|left|A Hindu procession in Yangon, Myanmar]]
Hinduism in Burma is practised by about 840,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-numbers/ Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Numbers] Pew Research Center (December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Because a reliable census has not been taken in Burma since colonial times, estimates are approximate. Most Hindus in Myanmar are [[Burmese Indians]]. In modern Myanmar, most [[Burmese Indians|Hindus]] are found in the urban centres of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. Ancient Hindu temples are present in other parts of Burma, such as the 11th century [[Nathlaung Kyaung Temple]] dedicated to Vishnu in [[Bagan]]. Hinduism in Myanmar has also been influenced by Buddhism with many Hindu temples in Myanmar housing statues of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25438275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/myanmars-hindu-community-looks-west&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Hinduism continue in Burma today, even in the majority Buddhist culture. For example, Thagyamin is worshipped whose origins are in the Hindu god [[Indra]]. Burmese literature has also been enriched by Hinduism, including the Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana, called [[Yama Zatdaw]]. Many Hindu gods are likewise worshipped by many Burmese people, such as [[Saraswati]] (known as Thuyathadi in Burmese), the goddess of knowledge, who is often worshipped before examinations; Shiva is called ''Paramizwa''; Vishnu is called ''Withano'', and others. Many of these ideas are part of thirty seven [[Nat (spirit)|Nat]] or deities found in Burmese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thant Myint-U (2001), The Making of Modern Burma, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521799140}}, pp. 27-47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Hinduism in the Philippines|Religion in pre-colonial Philippines}}
Before the arrival of an Arab trader to [[Sulu Island]] in 1450 and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who sailed in behalf of Spain in 1521, the chiefs of many Philippine islands were called ''[[Raja]]s'', and the script was derived from [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]]. [[Karma]], a Hindu concept is understood as part of the traditional view of the universe by many Philippine peoples, and have counterparts such as ''kalma'' in the [[Pampangan language]], and [[Gabâ]] in [[Visayan languages]]. The vocabulary in all Philippine languages reflect Hindu influences.

There are smaller number of followers of [[Hinduism in the Philippines|Hinduism]] today at 0.1% of the Philippine population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there is a "Hindu Temple" (attended mostly by Sindhīs) on Mahatma Gandhi Street and a "Khalsa Diwan Indian Sikh Temple" (attended mostly by Sikhs) on United Nations Avenue. Both are in Manila city's Paco-Pandacan area, the traditional Indian enclave, and are about 15 minutes walk away from each other.&lt;ref&gt;In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the ISKCON temple was right beside the Hindu Temple.&lt;/ref&gt; As per estimate there are 22 gurudwāras all over the Philippines today, although most of the adherents are Indians, [[Sri Lanka]]ns and [[Nepal]]ese. There are various [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] groups in the country that are gaining in popularity.

===Singapore===
{{Main|Hinduism in Singapore}}
[[File:Little India- Serangoon Road Singapore Diwali 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Diwali]] in Little India, Singapore]]
The introduction of Hinduism into [[Singapore]] dates back to the early 10th century, during the [[Chola]] period. Immigrants from southern India, mostly [[Tamil people|Tamils]], arrived as labourers for the [[British East India Company]], bringing with them their religion and culture. Their arrival saw the building of [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] temples throughout the island, and the beginnings of a vibrant Hindu culture. The first temple, [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore|Sri Mariamman Temple]] in Singapore's [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]]. There are currently about thirty main temples in Singapore, dedicated to various gods and goddesses from the Hindu pantheon. Today, two government bodies deal with all Hindu affairs: The Hindu Endowments Board and The Hindu Advisory Board.

Hindus are a minority in Singapore, comprising about 5.1% of its citizens and permanent residents in 2010. Among 15 years or older population, there were about 158,000 Hindus; 37% of all Hindus in Singapore speak Tamil at home, another 42% speak English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/cop2010/census_2010_release1/cop2010sr1.pdf Census of population 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113154937/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/publications_and_papers/cop2010/census_2010_release1/cop2010sr1.pdf |date=13 November 2013 }} Singapore Department of Statistics (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Deepavali is a major Hindu festival and a public holiday observed in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/leave-and-holidays/Pages/public-holidays-2014.aspx Public Holidays] Ministry of Manpower, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
[[File:A Hindu deity Brahma in Bangkok Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|upright| A murti of [[Brahma]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]
A number of Hindus remain in Thailand. They are mostly located in the cities. In the past, the nation came under the influence of the [[Khmer Empire]], which had strong Hindu roots. Despite the fact that today Thailand is a [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhist majority nation]], many elements of [[Culture of Thailand|Thai culture]] and symbolism demonstrates Hindu influences and heritage. For example, the popular epic, [[Ramakien]], is based on the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ramakien | work = Royal Thai Embassy | url = http://www.thaiembassy.no/News/joe_louis/en_Ramakien.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emblem of Thailand|Royal emblem of Thailand]] depicted [[Garuda]], the vahana (vehicle) of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The concept of Garuda in Thai society | url = http://emuseum.treasury.go.th/articles-en/537-garuda-coin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai city, [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] near Bangkok, is named after Ayodhya, the birthplace of [[Rama]]. Numerous rituals derived from Brahmanism are preserved in rituals, such as use of holy strings and pouring of water from conch shells. Furthermore, Hindu deities are worshipped by many Thais alongside Buddhism, such as [[Brahma]] at the famous [[Erawan Shrine]], and statues of [[Ganesh]], [[Indra]], and [[Shiva]], as well as numerous symbols relating to [[Hindu deities]] are found, e.g., [[Garuda]], a symbol of the monarchy. Reliefs in temple walls, such as the 12th-century ''Prasat Sikhoraphum'' near [[Surin, Thailand|Surin (Thailand)]], show a dancing Shiva, with smaller images of [[Parvati]], [[Vishnu]], Brahma and Ganesha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/seasia/sikhoraphum/sk02.html Sikhoraphum], Thailand, Arts &amp; Archaeology Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Devasathan]] is a Hindu temple established in 1784 by King [[Rama I]]. The temple is the centre of Brahminism in Thailand. The royal court Brahmins operate the temple, they perform several royal ceremonies per year.

An annual [[Giant Swing]] ceremony known as ''Triyampavai-Tripavai'' was held in major cities of Thailand until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=M. E. Manickavasagom Pillai |title=Dravidian Influence in Thai Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=soFCAAAAYAAJ |year=1986 |publisher=Tamil University |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two [[Tamil language]] Hindu chants: ''[[Thiruvempavai]]'' and ''[[Thiruppavai]]''. It is known that Tamil verses from ''Thiruvempavai'' — ''poet pratu sivalai'' ("opening the portals of Shiva's home") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|coronation ceremony]] of the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai king]].&lt;ref name="Upendra_1986"&gt;{{cite book |author=Upendra Thakur |title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1986 |publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-207-9 |pages=27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Consider Our Vow: Translation of Tiruppāvai and Tiruvempāvai Into English |author=Norman Cutler |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMOAAAAMAAJ |year=1979 |publisher=Muttu Patippakam |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swinging ceremony depicted a legend about how the god created the world. Outside shops, particularly in towns and rural areas, statues of [[Nang Kwak]] as the deity of wealth, fortune and prosperity (version of [[Lakshmi]]) are found.&lt;ref&gt;Ara Wilson (2008), The Sacred Geography of Bangkok’s Markets, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, Volume 32.3, September 2008, page 635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lee, Fumitaka Matsuoka, Edmond Yee and Ronald Nakasone (2015), Asian American Religious Cultures, ABC, {{ISBN|978-1598843309}}, page 892&lt;/ref&gt;

The elite, and the royal household, often employ Brahmins to mark funerals and state ceremonies such as the [[Royal Ploughing Ceremony]] to ensure a good harvest. The importance of Hinduism cannot be denied, even though much of the rituals has been combined with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/2003/7-9/18-27_thailand.shtml Hinduism Today | Thailand | July/August/September, 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Thai Census of 2005, there are 52,631 Hindus living in Thailand, making up just 0.09% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;http://popcensus.nso.go.th/show_table.php?t=t5&amp;yr=2543&amp;a=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
{{See also|Cham people|Hinduism in Vietnam}}
[[File:Danses Cham.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Cham people|Balamon Cham]] dancers in [[Po Nagar]]]]
The first recorded religion of the Champa was a form of [[Shaivism|Shaiva Hinduism]], brought by sea from India. Hinduism was the predominant religion among the Cham people until the sixteenth century. Numerous temples dedicated to [[Shiva]] were constructed in the central part of what is now Vietnam. The mainly Hindu [[Óc Eo]] archeological site in [[Mekong River Delta]] in southern Vietnam, dates back to 7th century and earlier. The [[Champa]] civilisation was located in the more southern part of what is today Central [[Vietnam]], and was a highly Indianized Hindu Kingdom, practising a form of [[Shaivite]] Hinduism brought by sea from India. [[Mỹ Sơn]], a Hindu temple complex in central Vietnam built by the [[Cham people]] is still standing albeit in ruins in [[Quảng Nam Province]], in Vietnam. Since the 15th century under the growing Vietnamese kingdom from the north, Champa was conquered and reduced as a polity. The Chams were subsequently absorbed by the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and today are recognised as one of the many ethnic minorities of Vietnam.

The ''[[Chams]] Balamon'' (Hindu [[Brahmin]] Chams) form a majority of the Cham population in Vietnam while most of the remainder are ''Cham Bani'' followers of Islam. The term Balamon is considered to have been derived from Brahmin,&lt;ref name="Sơn p.105"&gt;Champa and the archaeology of Mỹ Sơn (Vietnam) By Andrew Hardy, Mauro Cucarzi, Patrizia Zolese p.105&lt;/ref&gt; however another study suggests that 70% are considered to descend from the [[Nagavamshi Kshatriya]] caste&lt;ref&gt;''India's interaction with Southeast Asia'', Volume 1, Part 3 By Govind Chandra Pande, Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture, Centre for Studies in Civilizations (Delhi, India) p.231,252&lt;/ref&gt; (pronounced in [[Cham language|Cham]](?) as "Satrias"), and claim to be the descendants of the Champa Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35433.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2004], U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case a sizeable proportion of the Balamon Hindu Cham are considered [[Brahmins]].

Hindu temples known as ''Bimong'' in the [[Cham language]] and the priests ''Halau Tamunay Ahier''.

The exact number of Hindus in Vietnam are not published in Government census, but there are estimated to be at least 50,000 Balamon Hindus, with another 4,000 Hindus living in [[Ho Chi Minh City]]; most of whom are of Indian ([[Tamil people|Tamil]]) or of mixed Indian-Vietnamese descent. The [[Mariamman Temple, Ho Chi Minh City|Mariamman Temple]] is one of the most notable Tamil Hindu temples in Ho Chi Minh City. Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan Provinces are where most of the Cham ethnic group (~65%) in Vietnam reside according to the last population census. Cham Balamon (Hindu Cham) in Ninh Thuan numbered 32,000 in 2002 inhabiting 15 of 22 Cham villages.&lt;ref name="Sơn p.105"/&gt; If this population composition is typical for the Cham population of Vietnam as a whole then approximately 60% of Chams in Vietnam are Hindu.

Hinduism is practised by the ethnic Cham people of Vietnam, particularly in the [[Ninh Thuan]] province (22%) and [[Binh Thuan]] (4.8%).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gso.gov.vn/Modules/Doc_Download.aspx?DocID=12724&lt;/ref&gt;

They are the East and West {{nihongo|Honden Hon-gū|本殿本宮}} and the {{nihongo|Sessha Usa Jingū Honden|摂社宇佐神宮本殿}}. 
It is characterized by a [[hip roof|hip]]-and [[gable]] roof with verandas called ''[[Hisashi (architecture)|hisashi]]'' on the sides.&lt;ref name="kojien"/&gt; It has a ''[[hirairi]]'' structure, that is, the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled-side). 

The building is composed of a 3x2 ''[[Ken (architecture)|ken]]''&lt;ref&gt;The ''ken'' is the distance between one supporting pillar and another, a quantity which can vary from shrine to shrine and even within the same building.&lt;/ref&gt; core called ''[[Moya (architecture)|moya]]'' surrounded on three sides by a 1-''ken'' wide ''hisashi'', totaling 5x3 ''ken'' (see photo).&lt;ref name="jahi"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/h/hiezukuri.htm Hie-zukuri]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-sided ''hisashi'' is unique and typical of this style.

'''Johann Georg Schwarz''' (Иван Григорьевич Шварц; 1751–1784) was a [[philosophy]] professor at [[Moscow University]] who headed the [[Russia]]n branch of the [[Rosicrucian Society]].

A [[Transylvanian Saxon]], Schwarz settled in [[Moscow]] in 1776. He has been described as "the main carrier of esoterica into Russia" and an "emissary of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Boehmist theosophy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lauren G. Leighton. ''The Esoteric Tradition in Russian Romantic Literature: Decembrism and Freemasonry''. Penn State University, 1994. Page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined forces with [[Nikolay Novikov]] in founding the Society of Friendship, a bulwark of [[Russian Freemasonry]] that held secret meetings at the [[Menshikov Tower]]. Schwarz and Novikov moved the Masonic centre of Russia from [[St. Petersburg]] to Moscow, helping emancipate their compatriots from the [[Swedish Rite]] and [[Ivan Yelagin|Yelagin]]'s antics.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal. ''The Occult in Russian and Soviet Culture''. Cornell University Press, 1997. Page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz travelled in Europe to catch up with recent developments in the Rosicrucian doctrine. In 1782, he was present at the [[Wilhelmsbad]] masonic congress where Russia was recognized as the 8th autonomous province of the [[Rite of Strict Observance]].&lt;ref&gt;Raffaella Faggionato. ''A Rosicrucian Utopia in Eighteenth-Century Russia: The Masonic Circle of N.I. Novikov''. Springer, 2005. Page 251.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Russia]] also went to Europe at this time, raising [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s suspicions about Paul's conversion to [[Freemasonry]]. Schwarz died soon after returning to Moscow at the age of 33.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4434">'''Kimberly Hahn''' (née '''Kirk'''; born 1957) is a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] [[apologetics|apologist]] and author. She is the eldest child of Jerry and Patricia Kirk, and is married to apologist and author [[Scott Hahn]].

Hahn was born into a [[Presbyterian]] family and her father was a minister. She studied [[Communication Arts]] at [[Grove City College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1979. She married fellow student [[Scott Hahn]] on 18 August that year. She then worked as a secretary for a year while her husband began studies for a [[Master of Divinity]] degree at [[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary]]. She enrolled the following year and earned a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Theology]] in 1982.

While studying for her M.A., Hahn carried out research into the history of Christian attitudes towards [[contraception]]. She discovered that every Christian Church without exception had condemned the practice until 1930, and that some of the most famous [[Protestant]] reformers &amp;mdash; [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[Zwingli]], and [[John Knox|Knox]] &amp;mdash; had condemned it strongly.  She also read Catholic author John Kippley, who likened contraception to the practice of feasting and deliberately vomiting. At that stage, Scott and Kimberly both had strong objections to many Catholic teachings, but, after prayer, Bible study, and reflection, they both became convinced that on ''that'' issue, at least, the Catholic position was biblical. They changed to [[Natural family planning|Natural Family Planning]] for a while, then decided to leave the timing of pregnancies entirely to God. Their first son was born on December 4, 1982.

Scott Hahn was received into the Catholic Church at Easter 1986. His reception caused a great deal of distress to Hahn, as described in their book, ''Rome Sweet Home''. However, after struggling for a few more years with issues such as [[transubstantiation]] and, in particular, the [[veneration]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], she was herself received into the Catholic Church at Easter 1990. She is now a well-known Catholic apologist, a [[homeschooling]] mother of six children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotthahn.com/about-dr-hahn.html Scott Hahn's website]&lt;/ref&gt; and author of three books. She gives talks about Catholicism, [[feminism]], and contraception, both nationally and internationally.

On November 3, 2015, Kimberly was elected by the people of the City of Steubenville to be Councilwoman-at-Large.  She sits on the Service, Planning, Transportation and Economic Development Committees of Council.

[[Krampus]], the "[[Christmas]] [[Devil]]" of [[German folklore|Austrian and Bavarian folklore]], has entered the [[popular culture]] of [[North America]];&lt;ref name="NG13" /&gt; [[Christian Jacobs]] notes that "[[Internet meme|thanks to the Internet and YouTube]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A short film called ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p1JYvV178E A Krampus Carol]'' was produced in 2011 for [[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]] but never aired, as the [[Travel Channel]] considered it inappropriate; "Luckily, the special lives on on YouTube". {{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5867091/travel-channel-pulls-touching-christmas-special-about-a-child-licking-demon |title=Travel Channel Pulls Touching Christmas Special About a Child-Licking Demon |author=Seth Abramovitch |date=12 December 2011 |website=[[Gawker]] |access-date=16 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218205257/http://gawker.com/5867091/travel-channel-pulls-touching-christmas-special-about-a-child-licking-demon |archivedate=18 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [Krampus] is now very much [[wikt:on the radar|on America's Christmas radar]]".&lt;ref name="aquabats" /&gt; Tanya Basu interprets this as part of a "growing movement of anti-Christmas celebrations": a "[[bah, humbug]]" rejection of – or novel alternative to – mainstream festivities.&lt;ref name="NG13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/12/131217-krampus-christmas-santa-devil|title=Who Is Krampus?

Krampus is often mentioned in media related to Christmas,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Krampus is briefly mentioned in the [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)]] episode "[[A Very Supernatural Christmas]]" (2007) as being one of the anti-Clauses in folklore.&lt;/ref&gt; but the following lists instances where the character is featured significantly.

==Krampus celebrations==

==Costumes==
Costumed characters are a central part of all Krampus celebrations.  These characters include: Krampus, Saint Nikolaus, the woodsman, angels, and the old woman.  As Krampus is half-goat and half-demon, the costume normally shares certain primary elements such as: a fur suit, horns, demon mask, and hooves. Props commonly used are; bells, a  birch switch, basket worn on the back, chains, walking staff, and a horse hair or hemp flogger.  The most traditional Krampus costumes are made from goat/sheep skins, animal horns, and hand carved masks.  More often they are made with modern and less costly materials, such as: fake fur and latex masks.  Several Krampus costume instructional YouTube videos are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITeExdGBcIc/ |title=Fur suit Krampus part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Bat4DaesA/ |title=The Making of Krampus, for the Krampus run in Salzburg Austria |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-12-03 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIcGe2zt8yw/ |title=Making Krampus |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2013-12-06 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=821bETmHpB4/ |title=Woodcarving "Wooden mask" : Timelapse |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-04-21 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOV1yV6NPAM/ |title=Schnitzteufel - Feri Heindl 2012 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-12-13 |accessdate=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Kyabje Khensur Kangurwa Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche''' (25 December 1925 – 22 January 2014), was a Buddhist monk, Abbot of Sera Jey Monastery, and the founder of Tibetan Buddhist Institute&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tibetanbuddhistinstitute.org/|title=Tibetan Buddhist Institute|website=tibetanbuddhistinstitute.org|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Adelaide). Khensur means "former abbot" and [[Rinpoche]] means "precious teacher".

Former Abbot of Sera Je monastery, Holder of the transmission lineage of the Kangyur, considered widely as the greatest scholar of Abhidharma of his age and, perhaps, the foremost Vajrayogini practitioner, Kyabje Khensur Kangyur Rinpoche was one of the very last great practitioners and scholars largely trained in Tibet. He was known at Sera Je as one of the "Three Greats".

Rinpoche taught all over the world including India,&lt;ref name="Tibetan Buddhist Institute Adelaide AUS"&gt;{{Citation|last=Tibetan Buddhist Institute Adelaide AUS|title=Khensur Kangur Rinpoche, Teaching day one|date=2013-09-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9t0L8IzsHQ|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tibetan Buddhist Institute Adelaide AUS|title=Rinpoche's Long Life Puja In India 12/2012|date=2013-10-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5Psh88fRF8|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, USA, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. Because of his extremely high qualifications, advanced knowledge and spiritual insights so rarely found in Lama's today, Rinpoche was often requested to teach at Sera monastery, where thousands of monks flocked to hear him speak.&lt;ref name="Tibetan Buddhist Institute Adelaide AUS"/&gt;

His administrative achievements include his election first as the [[Sera Monastery|Sera Je]] disciplinarian and then, in 1982, his appointment as the monastery's abbot. His charitable achievements include the reestablishment of Sera Je School and founder of the Tibetan Sponsorship scheme.

He was born to a farming family in a mountainous valley of eastern Tibet ([[Kham]]) in what is now the Kartse ([[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Ganzi]]) Prefecture of Western Sichuan. This area was the birthplace of many great lamas of contemporary times, including Khensur Rinpoche Urgyen Tseten, the late Geshe Ngawang Dhargye and the late Geshe Rabten, teacher of many leading western scholars of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Rinpoche was not a recognised reincarnation ([[tulku]]). However, at a very early age, he displayed signs that he very likely was the reincarnation of someone of great spiritual attainment. Among these were an affinity for religious ceremonies such as pujas.

[[File:Kyabje Khensur Kangurwa Lobsang Thubten Rinpoche.tif|thumb|Dalai Lama (left) Kyabje Rinpoche (right)]]

== Early Life, Family and Village&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
Kyabje Rinpoche was born in a village called Rinda which had about 30 houses and some 300 people. Nearby was Dhargey Gompa, the local monastery. Rinpoche's family had ten members i.e. two elder sisters, himself and various other close relatives. His mother died when he was two or three years old from a disease which turned her hands black. His sister Dolma then took care of the family.

His home was confiscated by the Chinese when they invaded Tibet. Rinpoches's village celebrated the various festivals including [[Vesak|Saka Dawa]], Lama [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] Day, Jan chub cho je (celebrating the founder of Sera Monastery), Monlam and [[Losar]] (Tibetan New Year). Rinpoche was a little boy of about three when his first spiritual teacher, Kushog Gyalden Rinpoche cut his hair and gave him the name in religion, Lobsang Thubten. This was done with the understanding that he would become a monk in the future.

== Dhargey Gompa and Ordination&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

At the age of seven he entered his first monastery Dhargey Gompa, two hours away by foot or 1/2 hour by horse, where his hair was shaved off. There were around 1900 monks from all three main [[Lhasa]] Monastic universities, including seven high [[Tulku]]s (reincarnations), and although the young monks (including Rinpoche) called themselves monks, they didn’t take the novice monk ordination (getshul) until they were older. He stayed there for 1 1/2 yrs until the Nationalist Chinese army invaded and completely destroyed the monastery. He then returned home to informal schooling. Some months later, he moved into a small school established by Gyalden Rinpoche with four other students from Dharye Gompa.

Rinpoche left Dhargey in 1944 to study at Sera Monastic University in Lhasa, remaining there for 18 years. In the meantime, Dhargey Gompa was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again around 1965 by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese communists]]. There were about 300 elder monks and 100 younger ones, under Gyalden Tulku, the current incarnation of Rinpoche's first teacher, Gyalden Rinpoche. Rinpoche returned home in 1940, his father having died six months beforehand, spending some time at the rebuilt Dhargey Gompa. In 1965, he completed his Lharampa Geshe, the highest possible degree in Buddhist Philosophic Studies.

== Sera Monastery in Tibet&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

In February 1944, Rinpoche headed for [http://www.serajeymonastery.org/ Sera Monastery], one of three famous monasteries in [[Lhasa]]. Sera is dedicated to the [[Gelug]]pa or [[Yellow Hat Sect|Yellow Hat]] Sect, a branch of Tibetan Buddhism and at the time Rinpoche entered, it had 5,500 monks. When he was 18 yrs old, Rinpoche took the first step to become a Novice Monk, by making three full length prostrations before the Abbot, and was asked many questions to see if he was a suitable candidate for becoming a monk. He was then given a yellow protection thread and told that he should remain humble and study well. Thus he became a full Sera Jey monk.

In 1948, Rinpoche became a [[Gelong]], a fully ordained Buddhist Monk, which meant he took the 253 precepts (vows). Mostly monks from Kham only studied in Lhasa for 3 years, then they returned to their former monastery. However, after returning from a pilgrimage, taken immediately after his full Ordination, his teachers advised him to stay at Sera longer to continue his studies and not return to Kham. By about 1949, Rinpoche was in class 5 and had about 30 students. In 1949 Rinpoche received both [[Yamantaka]] and later, [[Vajrayogini]] Initiations from [[Ling Rinpoche]] (later to become the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lamas]] teacher).

During the next 5 years (1949–53) Rinpoche had many problems because he didn’t have any money, and had to beg for food from his friends.  There wasn’t much food but he studied well because of this ... "they say that when you are hungry your mind is very alert". .

In 1950 most of the monks at Sera became ill, and every day in Trehor Khamzen, 1 or 2 died, suffering from high fever. It spread through both colleges, and more than a hundred died. In 1958 the [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|Chinese had invaded]] [[Tibet]] and the burning of monasteries and killing of monks had started.  Cases of genocide was widespread, and the resistance movement had grown considerably.

== Escape to India&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kyabje Rinpoche and Jen Gibson, 2000 ; Unpublished Work "Fire and Stone; The Life of a Tibetan Abbot" Reproduced with permission from Tibetan Buddhist Institute&lt;/ref&gt; ==

On 17 March 1959 the [[14th Dalai Lama]] escaped in disguise and started his journey to [[Sikkim]], India and Nepal. The day before, the Chinese had fired 2 tank bombs into the [[Norbulingka|Norbulinka]], and on 18 March bombs had landed at Sera, the day after he had escaped to India.

The situation in [[Lhasa]] had become desperate, and Rinpoche and Geshe Ngawang Dhargey went into Lhasa to see for themselves. Because of this, they weren’t in Sera when the Chinese had come to the monastery and arrested monks coming back from the city. In Lhasa, there were bombs, tanks fire, machine guns and flame throwers, especially around the Norbulinka. A day later, Rinpoche made the decision to leave, although many others senior monks didn’t, and most perished in the ensuing onslaught. There were 35 in the group, and only 3 Senior Monks. It was an honour that Rinpoche was asked to throw the [[Mo (divination)|Mo]] to find the way to go to lead them all to safety. Chinese aircraft were patrolling to see if there were any monks escaping ... "it was very frightening". The group travelled day and night for about a month. "Our feet hurt, our eyes were heavy and we had pains in our legs" . We made it to Pempo and a Chinese plane appeared and started firing down on everyone around the village, many of whom were trying to escape.

Along the way, the group came across Rinpoche's teacher, Gyume Unyen Tsetan Rinpoche, and he then joined the party, making 4 Senior Monks in all. They reached Samye in the Lodkhar area, then ferried across a very large river in a yak hide boat. It was here that fortune smiled again. After taking a short detour to visit a Tara statue, they were given as much food as the donkeys could carry. It was extremely dangerous and now urgent that they leave Lodkhar. They eventually made the border into India, and arrived 24 days after the Dalai Lama's party. The locals were amazed to see that they had travelled across the mountains in winter which were covered in ice ... this was unheard of.

==  Life In India&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

[[Buxa]], south of [[Darjeeling]] was the area especially provided by the Indian Government for the refugees. Buxa had been a British prison for important people like [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Pandit Nehru]]. Many monks, including Rinpoche, developed sores, diarrhoea and tuberculosis. Many died, and the rest were emaciated. At first many different countries provided assistance but gradually the overseas countries ceased sending supplies and so it remained the Government of India's responsibility ... "the rest of the world forgot us".

They stayed 11 years at Buxa and over this period the supplies became worse and worse. They were given very old, bad rice and weevily lentils. The flour was full of dead insects and everybody soon began to get sick. There were no fields to cultivate and no money. It was in the extremely harsh conditions that Rinpoche sat for his [[Geshe]] degree in 1963-4. Rinpoche had a dilemma, he could go into the study of tantra, or could stay and teach.  If he didn’t teach, the teaching would degenerate.  So he chose to stay and teach.

In 1966, he stayed for six months in [[Mussoorie]] where he received teachings on grammar and poetry, which became useful later for writing homages to various teachers and composing texts.  He wrote several Long Life Prayers, including one for the reincarnation of his first teacher in Kham. Rinpoche stayed in Buxa until 1970, studying, doing retreats and receiving initiations. Because of the deplorable conditions, and that over a hundred of the older monks had died, and many many more had tuberculosis and other diseases, he developed a plan whereby all of us were to move to the new southern settlements and re-establish [http://www.serajeymonastery.org/ Sera Jey Monastery]. Divinations were performed to see where each monastery should be located, there were 2 areas; one near [[Mysore]] at [[Bylakuppe]] and the other at Mungot, both in [[Karnataka]] state. Monks from Kagur sect went to Bylakuppe.

== Relocation to Sera Monastery in India&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

Upon arrival, the 300 monks discovered they were to live in a jungle, and stayed in army tents.  The monks worked extremely hard for 2–3 years to clear it, prepare ground for planting crops and construct buildings and road. The Indian government gave them 50-60 rupees each a month for food and expenses, and also stones from a nearby quarry for building rooms (small, with just enough room for 4 beds and a fireplace for cooking). There were only two people who didn’t work; the Abbot and Rinpoche. They were designated to teach, meditate and study.  The monks, out of respect, would not let Rinpoche work. A Health Care centre was established and a dispensary, and the water was much better, and Tuberculous became slightly less prevalent, however fever, malaria, tropical sores and other illnesses from the warm climate was still present.

===Oral Transmission of the Complete Works of the Teachings of the Buddha===

In April 1972, Rinpoche was asked to give the Oral Transmission of the Complete Works of the Teachings of the Buddha, 108 volumes each 400 to 500 pages, which took about 8 months, and given in [[Dharamsala|Dharmsala]]. This is an extremely rare teaching, and for this reason he now bears the title of '''Kangyurwa'''. After completing the Kangurwa, he returned to Sera in early 1973 and was appointed by the Dalai Lama to the position of Gigue, Disciplinarian of Sera Je.  It is usual to be in this position for 6 months, however Rinpoche held the position for 2 years. It was at this time that Tenzin (Nawang Thubten), Rinpoche's attendant, became a monk. He was only 5 years old at the time.

===Roles===

Rinpoche was both Sera disciplinarian and teacher at Sera. As Gigue, Rinpoche was able to start up again the debating system used at Sera in Tibet. These debates provide an excellent means of exploring the teachings of the Buddha and expanding one's knowledge of them.

In December 1979, Rinpoche started a 3.3 year retreat on [[Vajrayogini]]. During this time, Rinpoche was visited by [[Ling Rinpoche]] and Trichang Dorje Chang, the Dalai Lama's tutors.  He was very honoured by this visit and rare to have a visitor whilst on a retreat.

In 1982, after finishing the retreat, Rinpoche was asked to teach at Tushita Institute in New Delhi, which was for local Indians and Westerners. Rinpoche had first taught western monks Buddhist philosophy in Sera Je before going to [[Tushita Meditation Centre|Tushita]] Centre.

The current Abbot at Sera asked to be excused from his position, so they had to appoint a new one.  The monks vote first, and Geshe Rabten received the most, then Rinpoche. The highest six names are then taken to Dharmsala and presented to the Dalai Lama.  Through his divination, Rinpoche was chosen as Abbot&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.serajeymonastery.org/abbot/77-about-us-special-picture/former-abbots-picture/127-69th-khensur-lobsang-thupten|title=69th Khensur Lobsang Thupten|last=Kun16Rin20SuperUser|website=www.serajeymonastery.org|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Sera from July 1983 until June 1987.  The Abbot has to take care of everything, including the overseeing the building projects, the buying of supplies for the monastery, meeting with business people and many meetings of the various Abbots to decide the future of the study programs in India.

===Sera Je School===

In 1984, during his time as abbot,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rinpoche restructured Sera Je School,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://serajeschool.net/Portal/Page/About|title=About Sera Je School - Sera Je Secondary School|website=serajeschool.net|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has resulted in an extremely high standard and diverse curriculum, achieving exemplary results in examinations. Because it was only for monks, many children from the nearby Tibetan settlements became monks in order to attend.

== Australia ==

In 1986, when Jampa Gendun (Australian monk) arrived with a letter requesting Rinpoche to teach in the West ... "I was asked to stay for 3 years, but I thought 1 year would be enough, however His Holiness advised that perhaps I should stay for 2 years".  He then spent 6 months teaching at [[Kopan Monastery]], and from there travelled down to Delhi, then to Singapore and Adelaide arriving on 11 September 1988. Rinpoche eventually spent over 2 decades in Australia.

=== Buddhahouse ===

Rinpoche settled in Adelaide South Australia to teach at Buddha-house, an [[FPMT]] centre in Fullarton. Rinpoche was asked to teach at many other FPMT centres in Australasia and overseas.  By doing this, Rinpoche was fulfilling the wish of the 14th Dalai Lama, to spread the Buddha Dharma to as many sentient beings as possible. Rinpoche taught twice a week on most of the Buddhist Canon, and gave many Initiations and retreats. Rinpoche initially only planned to teach at BuddhaHouse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buddhahouse.org|title=Buddha House {{!}} Centre for Advanced Buddhist Studies|website=buddhahouse.org|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Adelaide for a year, but stayed as the resident spiritual teacher for over a decade. Under Rinpoche's guidance, BuddhaHouse grew in stability, prosperity and educational strength.

=== 1992 Visit of the Dalai Lama to Australia ===

A highlight of Rinpoche's Australian stay was the visit in May 1992 of the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dalailamainaustralia.org|title=His Holiness The Dalai Lama in Australia|website=www.dalailamainaustralia.org|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the senior resident monk it was Rinpoche's privilege to welcome him and accompany him around much of the country. "To be here in a western city so far away from Tibet welcoming the Dalai Lama was very strange.  In Tibet it was almost impossible to sit next to him as I did in the Adelaide cathedral, and making a speech of welcome would have been impossible".

== Tibetan Buddhist Institute (TBI) ==

The Tibetan Buddhist Institute&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tibetan Buddhist Institute Adelaide AUS|title=foundation day tbi|date=2011-04-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOBc9TI1P5g|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2005 by Kyabje Rinpoche, in order to fulfil the wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. In March 2009, Tibetan Buddhist Institute found a home with the purchase of the Uniting Church building at Flinders Park South Australia.

===Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen===

Geshe Jampa Gyaltsen was born in 1966 and raised in the Tibetan village of ''Rumbatsa'', within the broader district of ''Trěhor Kham'', original site of the now legendary ''Dhargyay'' Monastery, and birthplace of founder Khensur Kangyurwa Rinpoche Lobsang Thubten, along with several other great Tibetan scholar-yogis of the 20th century.

===Dalai Lama Visit to Tibetan Buddhist Institute===

[[File:Dalai Lama at Tibetan Buddhist Institute.jpg|thumb|Dalai Lama at Tibetan Buddhist Institute June 2013]]
At the request of Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama visited the Tibetan Buddhist Institute in Adelaide Australia on Thursday 20 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TIBET LHASA BOY|title=His Holiness Dalai Lama visit to TBI Adelaide Australia Thursday 20th june 2013|date=4 January 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvyMRZQprFo|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dalailamainaustralia.org/galleries/detail.aspx?GalleryID=15|title=His Holiness The Dalai Lama in Australia|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable Works ==

=== Tibetan Sponsorship Scheme ===

In response the many requests from senior monks for assistance, Rinpoche established a monk sponsorship scheme.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tibetansponsorship.org|title=Tibetan Sponsorship Scheme {{!}} Kyabje Rinpoche Tibetan and Monk Sponsorship Scheme|website=tibetansponsorship.org|access-date=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 950 monks, nuns, lay Tibetans in India and Gyalten Charity School in Tibet on the scheme (December 2005) and over 550 sponsors from 6 countries, the Khensur Kangyurwa Rinpoche Sponsorship Schemes is perhaps the largest and among the most successful Tibetan Sponsorship schemes in the world today. The Tibetan sponsorship scheme (previously Monk Sponsorship Scheme) was originally established to help support exiled monks at Sera Monastery escaping repression in Tibet, and also their relatives who live nearby in camps in India. Today the scheme sponsors exiled Monks, Nuns and lay Tibetans in India, Nuns, at two nunneries in Tibet, and students at Gyalten Charity School in Tibet.

=== Monastery in Kham, Dhargye Gompa ===

Rinpoche has also successfully helped to raise funds to rebuild his first monastery in Kham, Dhargye Gompa, which was destroyed twice during the Chinese invasion and occupation. In addition, he has raised money to support the important philosophical debating program at Sera Je.

'''Gyalten Charity School''' in Tibet has approximately 280 children are enrolled in the school. Mostly monks are sponsored in Rinpoche's schemes, however there are also nuns in India as well as nuns at Nyagye Nunnery in Tibet and many Lay Tibetans in India. Khensur Rinpoche also set up the Emergency Medical Fund, which was established for any monk or lay Tibetan in India that is in urgent need of medical assistance.

On 31 December 2013, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], personally visited the former abbot of Sera Je Monastery, Thubten Rinpoche just prior to his death (video&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=TIBET LHASA BOY|title=TBI Video Part one|date=31 May 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKJ4huZNJM|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at his Labrang. After meeting with Kyabje Khensur Kangyur Rinpoche, before the beginning of the Lam Rim teachings, in front of approximately 10,000 monks and lay people the Dalai Lama detailed Khensur Rinpoche's realizations stating: "His entire life was dedicated to Dharma from childhood. He has all the qualities of Scripture and Realization" before mentioning his advanced realizations of the Completion Stage of Heruka.

Rinpoche died on 22 January 2014 in India. The cremation ceremony&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=TIBET LHASA BOY|title=TBI VIDEO PART 2|date=30 May 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Pz82soKms|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offering of a fire puja to Kyabje Khensur Kangur Lobsang Thubten Rinpcohe's Holy Body, was held at Sera Monastery and attended by hundreds of monks and lay people.

In January 2016 one hundred Geshes in Rinpoche's Labrang at Sera Jey Monastic University dedicated a Heruka Guru Puja for his reincarnation. The 14th Dalai Lama informed that there weren’t any obstacles to the reincarnation, wherever that may be, of Lobsang Thubten. He advised that Rinpoche has appeared, but "there is no rush to find him".

Kyabje Rinpoche's death was reported in the tributes section of the Adelaide Advertiser in 2014 (citation required).

'''Lekha Dodi''' ({{lang-he|לכה דודי}}; also [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as '''''Lecha Dodi''''', '''''L'chah Dodi''''', '''''Lekah Dodi''''', '''''Lechah Dodi'''''; [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation: '''''Lecho Dodi''''') is a [[Hebrew]]-language [[religious Jewish music|Jewish liturgical song]] recited Friday at [[dusk]], usually at [[sunset|sundown]], in [[synagogue]] to welcome ''[[Shabbat]]'' prior to the evening services. It is part of the [[Jewish prayer#Friday night|Kabbalat Shabbat]] ("welcoming of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]").

''Lekhah Dodi'' means "come my beloved," and is a request of a mysterious "beloved" that could mean either [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] or one's friend(s) to join together in welcoming ''Shabbat'' that is referred to as the "[[bride]]": ''likrat kallah'' ("to greet the [''Shabbat''] bride"). During the singing of the last [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], the entire congregation rises and turns to the west towards the setting sun (or toward the entrance to the synagogue),&lt;ref&gt; Macy Nulman, ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer'' (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson Inc.) s.v. "Lekha Dodi", p. 223, col. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; to greet "Queen ''Shabbat''" as she arrives.

It was composed in the 16th century by [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]], who was born in [[Thessaloniki]] and later became a [[Safed]] [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]]. As was common at the time, the song is also an [[acrostic]], with the first letter of the first eight [[stanza]]s spelling the author's name. The author draws from the rabbinic interpretation of [[Song of Songs]] in which the maiden is seen as a metaphor for the [[Jews]] and the lover (''dod'') is a metaphor for God, and from ''[[Nevi'im]]'', which uses the same metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Lawrence A. ''Kabbalat Shabbat: (Welcoming Shabbat in the Synagogue)''. My People's Prayer Book.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem shows Israel asking God to bring upon that great ''Shabbat'' of [[Messiah in Judaism|Messianic deliverance]].&lt;ref name="Hammer"&gt;Hammer, Reuven.  ''Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom For Shabbat and Festivals''.  21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the latest of the Hebrew poems regularly accepted into the liturgy, both in the southern use, which the author followed, and in the more distant northern rite.

== Melody ==

Its importance in the esteem of Jewish worshipers has led every [[hazzan]] and [[choir]]-director to seek to devote his sweetest strains to the Shabbat welcome song. Settings of ''Lekhah Dodi'', usually of great expressiveness and not infrequently of much tenderness and beauty, are accordingly to be found in every published compilation of synagogal melodies.

Among the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic congregations]], the [[hymn]] is sometimes chanted to an ancient [[Moors|Moorish]] melody, which is known to be much older than the text of ''Lekhah Dodi''. This is clear not only from internal evidence, but also from the [[rubric]] in old [[siddur]]im directing the hymn "to be sung to the melody of ''Shuvi Nafshi li-Menukhayekhi'', a composition of [[Judah Halevi]], who died nearly five centuries before Alkabetz. In this rendering, carried to Israel by Spanish refugees before the days of Alkabetz, the hymn is chanted congregationally, the refrain being employed as an introduction only.

In some very old-style Ashkenazic synagogues the verses are ordinarily chanted at elaborate length by the hazzan, and the refrain is used as a congregational response, but in most Asheknazic Orthodox synagogues it is sung by everyone together to any one of a large number of tunes. This includes the Orthodox Synagouges who employ this element and Synagouges under the Modern-Orthodox umbrella.

This beloved [[piyyut]] is sung to many different melodies throughout the world, including melodies from India, [[Central Asia]] (Bukhara), Yemen, Kurdistan, Italy, Bulgaria, Germany, and the [[Mountain Jews]] of the Caucasus. Wherever Jews gather for prayer on a Friday night, there one can find Lecha Dodi being sung.

==Old German and Polish melodies==
At certain periods of the year many northern congregations discard later compositions in favor of two simple older melodies singularly reminiscent of the folk-song of northern Europe in the century succeeding that in which the verses were written. The better known of these is an air, reserved for the [[Counting of the Omer|Omer]] weeks between [[Pesach|Passover]] and [[Shavuot]], which has been variously described, because of certain of its phrases, as an adaptation of the famous political song "[[Lillibullero]]" and of the cavatina in the beginning of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s "[[The Marriage of Figaro|Nozze di Figaro]]." But resemblances to German folk-song of the end of the seventeenth century may be found generally throughout the melody.

Less widely utilized in the present day is the special air traditional for the "[[The Three Weeks|Three Weeks]]" preceding [[Tisha b'Av]], although this is characterized by much tender charm absent from the melody of [[Eli Tziyyon]], which more often takes its place. But it was once very generally sung in the northern congregations of Europe; and a variant was chosen by [[Benedetto Marcello]] for his rendition of Psalm xix. in his "Estro Poetico-Armonico" or "Parafrasi Sopra li Salmi" (Venice, 1724), where it is quoted as an air of the German Jews. Cantor [[Eduard Birnbaum]] ("''Der Jüdische Kantor''", 1883, p.&amp;nbsp;349) has discovered the source of this melody in a Polish folk-song, "''Wezm ja Kontusz, Wezm''", given in [[Oskar Kolberg]]'s "''Piesni Ludu Polskiego''" (Warsaw, 1857). An old melody, of similarly obvious folk-song origin, was favored in the London Jewry a century ago, and was sung in two slightly divergent forms in the old city synagogues. Both of these forms are given by [[Isaac Nathan]] in his setting of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron's]] "''Hebrew Melodies''" (London, 1815), where they constitute the air selected for "''[[She Walks in Beauty]]''", the first verses in the series. The melody has since fallen out of use in English congregations and elsewhere.

==Text==
The full version of the song (note that many [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregations omit verses 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 which make reference to messianic redemption),&lt;ref&gt; Jakob J. Petuchowski, ''Prayerbook Reform in Europe: The Liturgy of European Liberal and Reform Judaism'' (1968, NYC, World Union for Progressive Judaism) p. 121, quoting the 'Synagogenordnung' issued circa 1853 for the Progressive congregation in Mayence, Germany under Rabbi Joseph Aub; R' Eric L. Friedland, ''The Historical and Theological Development of the Non-Orthodox Prayerbooks in the United States'' (1967, Ph.D. dissertation, Brandeis Univ., NYC) p. 108, that Marcus Jastrow, in his 1871 revision of the German edition ''Avodat Yisroel'' (the Reform prayerbook) to reduce Lekhah Dodi to three stanzas, a "which version was later adopted in the 1940 edition of the Union Prayer Book [the American Reform prayerbook]....." &lt;/ref&gt; while Sephardic congregations based in the Jerusalem and Aleppo rites omit verses 4 through 7, as they make reference to agony&lt;ref&gt;R' Eliezer Toledano, ''The Orot Sephardic Shabat Siddur'' (1995, Lakewood, NJ, Orot Inc) p. 68. &lt;/ref&gt;:

== Notes to the Text ==

Verse 1, line 3:  '' 'Safeguard' and 'Remember' in one  utterance'':  The Ten Commandments appears twice in the Torah, in Exodus 20:8 it reads "Remember (''zakhor'') the Sabbath Day" and in Deuteronomy 5:12 it reads "Safeguard (''shamor'') the Sabbath Day"; the folkloric explanation for the difference is that, supernaturally, both words were spoken by God simultaneously.  Here the second expression is used first in the verse to accommodate the acrostic of the composer's name.

Verse 2, line 10:  ''Last made,  but first planned'':  The Sabbath Day, the seventh and last day of Creation, was, essentially, the last thing created in that week and yet it is believed that a day of cessation, reflection, and worship was part of God's plan from the very first.

Verse 8, line 33: ''By the hand of a child of Peretz'':   Meaning a descendant of Peretz, a son of Judah, an ancestor of King David; a poetical description of the Messiah.

== Qur'an ==

The [[Qur'an]] is the central religious text of [[Islam]], which [[Muslims]] consider the verbatim word of [[God in Islam|God]] and the final divine revelation. It is regarded widely as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones, The Koran, London 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-84212-609-7}}, opening page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Arberry, The Koran Interpreted, London 1956, {{ISBN|978-0-684-82507-6}}, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that the Qur'an was verbally revealed through the angel [[Jibrīl]] (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad over a period of approximately twenty-three years beginning in 610 AD. Furthermore, Muslims believe that the Quran was precisely memorized, recited and exactly written down by Muhammad's companions, the [[Sahaba]].

; Text of the Quran
{{main|List of surahs in the Quran}}
The text of the Qur'an consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a [[sura]]. Each sura is formed from several verses, called [[ayah|ayats]].

; Commentaries and exegesis ([[tafsīr]])
{{main|List of tafsir}}
A body of commentary and explication (tafsīr), aimed at explaining the meanings of the Quranic verses.

; Reasons of revelation ([[asbāb al-nuzūl]])

Asbāb al-nuzūl is a secondary genre of Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur'an were revealed.

; Translations
{{main| List of translations of the Qur'an}}

== Sunna ==
[[Sunnah|Sunna]] denotes the practice of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] that he taught and practically instituted as a teacher of the [[sharī‘ah]] and the best exemplar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Islahi|first=Amin Ahsan|title=Mabadi Tadabbur i Hadith (translated as: Fundamentals of Hadith Intrepretation)|year=1989 (tr:2009)|publisher=Al-Mawrid|location=Lahore|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/DownloadContainer.aspx?id=71|authorlink=Amin Ahsan Islahi|accessdate=1 June 2011|language=Urdu|chapter=Difference between Hadith and Sunnah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of sunna are usually [[oral traditions]] found in collections of [[Hadith]] and [[Sīra]] (prophetic biography). Unlike the Qur'an, Muslims do not agree on the same set of texts or sources of Sunnah, and they emphasize different collections of hadith based on to which [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic school or branch]] they belong.

=== [[Hadith]] (Traditions of the prophet) ===

'''Unitarian martyrs''' are individuals who died for their adherence to [[Unitarianism]], a theological position which claims to derive from the Christian Bible and denies the [[Trinity]], instead maintaining that there is one God in one person (the Father). And in modern times as the Unitarian moment broadened to embrace more than simply Christianity, Unitarian martyrs may rightly now also included, individuals who died for their adherence to [[Liberal religion]]. Following is a partial list ordered by date of some of these martyrs.

==Ancient times==
260 AD: [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] - was denounced at Rome for calling Jesus a "creature of God." Later (likely due to pressure), he recanted.&lt;ref name=dio&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05011a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Dionysius of Alexandria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

336 AD: [[Arius]] - claimed to have been murdered by a mob in the streets of [[Constantinople]] shortly after [[Constantine I]]'s death.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} However other accounts suggest that he was poisoned or that he was not murdered at all (see the article on Arius).

339 AD: [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] - is suspected to have been murdered; his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' ends abruptly with the death of [[Constantine I]]. In any case he was definitely excommunicated&lt;ref name="Eusebius"&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Religion/Christian/Fathers/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-03.htm Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series II, Vol. I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907185138/http://www.tparents.org/Library/Religion/Christian/Fathers/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-03.htm |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark Ages==
476 - 1000 AD. - [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. Little history recorded.

There is a lot of recorded history for this period, some relates to the Unitarian belief, or questions regarding the Trinity.

==Renaissance==
1529: [[Ludwig Haetzer]] - beheaded in Konstanz, Germany; believed Jesus was a leader and teacher, not a God due worship

1539: [[Katarzyna Weiglowa]] - burned at the stake at age 80 for "apostasy to Judaism", though her stance was anti-trinitarian, not specifically Jewish.

1553: [[Michael Servetus]] - burned at the stake after a prison term because of writing a book criticizing biblical evidence for a [[Trinity]].

1579: [[Francis David]] - Lutheran pastor in [[Transylvania]]; after [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] King John Sigismund died, orthodox views regained power.  [[Francis David]] was placed in prison, where he ultimately died.

1611: [[Iwan Tyszkiewicz]] - Polish member of the [[Socinianism|Socinian]] church (also see: [[Polish Brethren]]) who was beheaded for the blasphemy of Unitarianism.

==Modern times==
1697: [[Thomas Aikenhead]] - a medical student, executed for dening the Holy [[Trinity]],  an offence under England's [[Blasphemy Act 1697]]. On the morning of January 8, 1697, Thomas wrote to his 'friends' that "it is a principle innate and co-natural to every man to have an insatiable inclination to the truth, and to seek for it as for hid treasure. . . So I proceeded until the more I thought thereon, the further I was from finding the verity I desired. . ." Aikenhead may have read this letter outside [[the Tolbooth]], before making the long walk, under guard, to the gallows. He was said to have died Bible in hand, "with all the Marks of a true Penitent".&lt;ref name=truth&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html Thomas Aikenhead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001011446/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/thomasaikenhead.html |date=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1942: [[Norbert Capek]] &amp;ndash; preached religious freedom (including Unitarianism). Was sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]], and later gassed to death at [[Hartheim Castle]].  Founder of the Czech Unitarian Church, and author of many hymns in Czech. ''Mother Spirit, Father Spirit'' and ''View the Starry Realm'' are both in ''Singing the Living Tradition'', published by the Unitarian Universalist Association.

1965: [[James Reeb]] clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]], after responding to a call by the Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] for a second [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;Montgomery&amp;ndash;march]]. Selma's public hospital refused to treat the Rev. Reeb, who was taken to University Hospital in Birmingham, two hours away. Reeb died on Thursday, March 11, with his wife by his side. His death inspired thousands to join King and other activists in the successful third march to Montgomery.

1965: [[Viola Liuzzo]] was a 39-year-old white mother and a civil rights worker from Detroit who came to Alabama to join in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and help with voter registration. She was murdered March 25, 1965 while driving a fellow activist back from the Alabama Capitol Building, the site of the large rally at the culmination of the third march.

1988:  Toribio Quimada, founder of the UU Church of [[the Philippines]], shot on [[Negros Island]] by unknown assailants believed to have been responding to his social justice ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
|title=Morales visits Unitarian Universalists in the Philippines

|accessdate=September 26, 2011 
|quote  = UUA President Peter Morales is visiting Unitarian Universalists in the Philippines from August 26 to September 2 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Rev. Quimada is listed as a Unitarian martyr, his theology was clearly Universalist, rather than Unitarian.  His church was founded with Universalist beliefs, but became Unitarian Universalist about the same time (1961) that the Unitarian and Universalist denominations in the United States merged.  The church remains affiliated with the denomination in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maglipay Universalist: A History of the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines|author=Muir, Frederic John|date=June 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008: Greg McKendry and Linda Kreager, killed as a result of the [[Terrorism#Politics and terrorism|politically motivated]] [[Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting]].

'''Maple Mountain''' is a [[mountain]], located within [[Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park]], [[Northeastern Ontario]], Canada, estimated {{Convert|642|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]]. It has a higher vertical rise over the surrounding landscape, {{convert|37|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} higher than the [[Ishpatina Ridge]], which is the highest point of land in Ontario rising over [[Scarecrow Lake]]. Maple Mountain rises over [[Tupper Lake (Ontario)|Tupper Lake]] and is considerably better known than Ishpatina Ridge. It ranks thirteenth, but when ranked by vertical rise it is the highest of the top 25 peaks in Ontario. The 100-ft fire tower is also still intact and attracts many hikers. A 3.2 kilometre long [[hiking trail]] leads to the abandoned fire tower.

Located in [[Timiskaming District]] of [[Northeastern Ontario]], the mountain is not very accessible; roads and trails in the remote area are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach routes to Maple Mountain are by [[canoe]] and/or float plane.

The indigenous [[Temagami First Nation]] call the mountain ''Chee-bay-jing'', meaning "the place where the spirits go" and consider it a sacred site. The English name of the mountain was given by Dr. Robert Bell of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] in 1888. Bell was the first known non-aboriginal to scale the mountain.

The '''Nasik inscription of Ushavadata''' is an inscription made in the [[Nasik Caves]] by [[Ushavadata]], a viceroy of the [[Western Satraps]] ruler [[Nahapana]], in the years circa 120 CE. It is the earliest known instance of the usage of [[Sanskrit]], although a rather hybrid form, in western India.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; 

==Characteristics==
The inscription is classified as "Inscription No.10" of the Nasik Caves. It is located on the front porch of Cave No.10, also called the "Nahapana Vihara". It is several meters in length.

===Usage of hybrid Sanskrit===
Altogether, the caves contains six inscriptions of the family of [[Nahapana]], but the Ushavadata inscription is particularly important in that it is the earliest known instance of the usage of [[Sanskrit]], although a rather hybrid form, in western India.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the Other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195099843 |pages=88–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-4RDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other inscriptions made by the Western Satraps were in [[Prakrit]], using the [[Brahmi script]].&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

In what has been described as "the great linguistical [[paradox]] of India", [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions first appeared much later than [[Prakrit]] inscriptions, although Prakrit is considered as a descendant of the Sanskrit language.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}} This is because Prakrit, in its multiple variants, had been favoured since the time of the influential [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (circa 250 BCE).{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86-87}} Besides a few examples from the 1st century BCE, most of the early Sanskrit inscriptions date to the time of the [[Indo-Scythian]] rulers, either the [[Northern Satraps]] around [[Mathura]] for the earliest ones, or, slightly later, the closely related Western Satraps in western and central India.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=93-94}} It is thought that these [[Indo-Scythian]] rulers became promoters of Sanskrit as a way to show their attachment to Indian culture: according to Salomon "their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite".{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=93-94}}

In western India, the first known inscription in Sanskrit appears to have been made by [[Ushavadata]], son-in-law of the Western Satrap ruler [[Nahapana]], at the front of Cave n°10 in the [[Nasik Caves]]. The inscription dates to the early 2nd century CE, and has hybrid features.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=89}} It was followed by the [[Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman|Junagadh rock inscription]], inscribed by [[Rudradaman I]] circa 150 CE, is "the first long inscription recorded entirely in more or less standard Sanskrit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA89 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit inscriptions by the Western Satraps are not found for about two hundred years after the Rudradaman reign, but it is important because its style is the prototype of the [[Prashasti|eulogy-style]] Sanskrit inscriptions found in the [[Gupta Empire]] era.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|p=89}} These inscriptions are all in the Brahmi script.&lt;ref name="Salomon 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Salomon|1998|pp=10, 86–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedication of the cave to Buddhists===
[[File:Nasik_Cave_inscription_No_10.jpg|thumb|[[Pandavleni Caves|Nasik Cave]] inscription No.10. of Nahapana, Cave No.10.]] 
The inscription reveals that Kshatrapa [[Nahapana]]’s son-in-law and Dinika’s son- [[Ushavadata]] built cave No.10 for Buddhist monks and donated 3000 gold coins for this cave as well as for the food and clothing of the monks. 

{{quote|"Success ! [[Ushavadata]], son of Dinika, son-in- law of king Nahapana, the Kshaharata Kshatrapa, (...) inspired by (true) religion, in the Trirasmi hills at [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]], has caused this cave to be made and these cisterns."|Part of inscription No.10 of Ushavadata, Cave No.10, Nasik&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica [https://archive.org/stream/EpigraphiaIndica/Epigraphia_Indica p.78-79]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dedication of the cave to the Buddhist [[Samgha]] is mentioned in another inscription in the same cave, inscription No.12:

{{quote|"Success ! In the year 42, in the month Vesakha, [[Ushavadata]], son of Dinika, son-in- law of king Nahapana, the Kshaharata Kshatrapa, has bestowed this cave on the [[Samgha]] generally...."|Part of inscription No.12 of Ushavadata, Cave No.10, Nasik&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica [https://archive.org/stream/EpigraphiaIndica/Epigraphia_Indica p.82-83]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Thence I went to the Pokshara tanks, and there I bathed and gave three-thousand cows and a village. A field has also been given by him, bought at the hands of the Brahmana Asvibhuti, son of Varahi, for the price of four-thousand - 4,000 - [[karshapana]]s, which (field) belonged to his father, on the boundary of the town towards the north-western side. From it food will be procured for all monks, without distinction, dwelling in my cave."

==Characteristics of Sanskrit in the inscription==
The first three lines of the inscription consist in an [[eulogy]] of Ushavadata, and are written in fairly standard Sanskrit, except for a few hybrid features, including several [[sandhi]] [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]es and hybrid morphology (e.g. ''bhojāpayitrā'').&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; The rest of the inscription records the actual donations, and is more hybrid.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Ushavadatta is otherwise known for making inscriptions in [[Prakrit]] in the [[Karla Caves]], which, especially for the eulogy portion, are largely similar in content.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

According to [[Richard G. Salomon (academic)|Richard Salomon]], Ushavadatta may have followed the example set by the [[Northern Satraps]] of Mathura, in using Sanskrit in some of his inscriptions.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; It would seem the usage of literary Sanskrit may have been a fashionable way of adding some formality to inscriptions which had traditionally been made in Prakrit.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salomon |first1=Richard |title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195356663 |pages=83–84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA83 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Day of Prayer''' ({{usc|36|119}})&lt;ref name="36 U.S.C. § 119"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/36/I/A/1/119 |title=36 U.S.C. § 119 : US Code – Section 119: National Day of Prayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual day of observance held on the first Thursday of May, designated by the [[United States Congress]], when people are asked "to turn to God in [[prayer]] and meditation". Each year since its inception, the [[President of the United States|president]] has signed a proclamation, encouraging all Americans to pray on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationaldayofprayer.org/about/history/ |title=History of the National Day of Prayer |publisher=Nationaldayofprayer.org |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413165629/http://nationaldayofprayer.org/about/history/ |archivedate=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern law formalizing its annual observance was enacted in 1952, although earlier days of [[fasting]] and prayer had been established by the [[Second Continental Congress]] from 1775 until 1783, and by President [[John Adams]] in 1798 and 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=65675 |title=Proclamation – Recommending a National Day of Humiliation, Fasting, and Prayer |last=Adams |first=John |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara |work=The American Presidency Project |date=March 6, 1799 |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJ0wAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA287 |page=287 |title=By the President of the United States of America, a Proclamation |date=March 31, 1798 |last=Adams |first=John |work=The Weekly Magazine |volume=1 |number=9}} John Adams' signed the proclamation on March 3, 1798, with the day of prayer to take place on May 9, 1798.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] established a day of prayer and thanksgiving, but this occurred while he served as governor of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-03-02-0187 "Proclamation Appointing a Day of Thanksgiving and Prayer, 11 November 1779"], ''[[Virginia Gazette]]'', website=Founders Online, November 20, 1779.

The [[constitutionality]] of the National Day of Prayer was unsuccessfully [[Judicial review|challenged in court]] by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] after their first attempt was unanimously dismissed by a federal appellate court in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2011/0414/Legal-challenge-to-National-Day-of-Prayer-thrown-out Legal challenge to National Day of Prayer thrown out], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2011-04-15-prayer_court_14_ST_N.htm Court Dismisses Challenge to National Day of Prayer], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Day of Prayer shares common roots with the celebration of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]; both were national proclamations establishing a day of prayer, but in the [[New England Colonies]] under British rule, traditional observances in late fall called for prayer and thanksgiving, while observances in the spring or summer called for prayer and fasting.&lt;ref name=Davis2000&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9es9WWz8Ac8C&amp;pg=PA83 |pages=83–84 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |title=Religion and the Continental Congress, 1774–1789: Contributions to Original Intent |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780195350883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall observance was established by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as the official Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. The spring observance was established by President [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1952 as the National Day of Prayer.

Friction in 1768–1776 between the American colonists and England spurred some American cities and colonies to proclaim days of prayer. For instance, [[Boston]] declared a day of fasting and prayer in September 1768, as a protest against a British plan to station troops in the city. The [[Colony of Virginia]]'s [[House of Burgesses]] established a day of fasting and prayer to take place on Wednesday, June 1, 1774, to protest the [[Boston Port Act]], such that the people of Virginia would assemble for prayer led by clergymen.&lt;ref name=Davis2000/&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that "the effect of the day through the whole colony was like a shock of electricity," moving the Virginians to choose delegates to establish self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jefferson Himself: The Personal Narrative of a Many-Sided American |last=Jefferson |first=Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QflDAo9iXC8C&amp;pg=PA50 |page=50 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1970 |isbn=9780813903101}} Jefferson is quoted by Derek H. Davis in ''Religion and the Continental Congress, 1774–1789'', page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Provinces of [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] all observed official days of fasting and prayer during 1774–1775.&lt;ref name=Davis2000/&gt;

The observance of a day of fasting and prayer was brought to all of the colonists by the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] in 1775.&lt;ref name=Davis2000/&gt; Congress issued a proclamation recommending "a day of publick {{sic}} humiliation, fasting, and prayer" be observed by the "English Colonies" on Thursday, July 20, 1775, "and to bless our rightful sovereign, King George the Third..."&lt;ref name=Proclamation1775&gt;{{cite book |title=Provincial and State Papers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-47AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA545 |page=545 |first=Nathaniel |last=Bouton |authorlink=Nathaniel Bouton|date=June 12, 1775}} "Proclamation for a day of Fasting and Prayer"&lt;/ref&gt; The text, written by [[John Witherspoon]] and [[John Hancock]], instructed the colonists to pray for a resumption of "the just rights and privileges of the Colonies" in "civil and religious" matters.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A proclamation to this end was sent to every town in the colonies. [[John Adams]] wrote that the popular response was gratifying, that the special day was more widely observed than the practice of going to church on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; After this success, Congress determined to call for a day of fasting and prayer each spring, and a day of thanksgiving and praise each fall.&lt;ref name=Davis2000/&gt;

In his role as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Continental Army]], General [[George Washington]] acknowledged a day of "fasting, humiliation and prayer" proclaimed by the Continental Congress to be held on Thursday, May 6, 1779. To enable his soldiers to observe the day, Washington ordered a one-day cessation of recreation and "unnecessary labor".&lt;ref name="writings of George Washington"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ec7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA369 |page=369 |title=The Writings of George Washington, from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 |volume=14 |date=1779 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1780, Congress announced a day of "fasting, humiliation and prayer" to be held on Wednesday, April 26, 1780.&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania archives"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXAFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131 |page=131 |title=Pennsylvania Archives |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=May 3, 2012|year=1853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of calling for national days of fasting and prayer was abandoned from 1784 until 1789, even though thanksgiving days were observed each fall.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 1789, President Washington called for a national day of prayer and thanksgiving to be observed on Thursday, November 26, 1789; this was an extension of the tradition of thanksgiving which was already customary in New England.&lt;ref name=Davis90&gt;Davis 2000, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RioTGCygpT8C&amp;pg=PA385 |page=385 |title=George Washington: A Biographical Companion |last=Grizzard |first=Frank E. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2002 |isbn=9781576070826}} "Washington's Thanksgiving Proclamation".&lt;/ref&gt; President Adams continued the practice of proclaiming national days of prayer in the spring and fall,&lt;ref name="US_Religion"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Jon |last2=Wacker |first2=Grant |last3=Balmer |first3=Randall |title=Religion in American Life: A Short History |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199913299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74TDK2V3YCQC&amp;pg=PA161 |page=161 |quote=President George Washington, for example, set aside November 26, 1789, as a national day of prayer, repentance, and thanksgiving to God.

After James Madison, none of the next eleven presidents issued prayer proclamations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/proclamations.php|title=Presidential Proclamations|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there was a period of 47 years, from 1815 to 1862, with no presidential prayer proclamations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/curriculum/the-american-calendar/thanksgiving-day-proclamations-1789-present|title=Thanksgiving Day Proclamations 1789–Present|website=www.whatsoproudlywehail.org|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January–February 1952 during the [[Korean War]], the desirability of a united national prayer was stated by Reverend [[Billy Graham]], who said, "What a thrilling, glorious thing it would be to see the leaders of our country today kneeling before Almighty God in prayer. What a thrill would sweep this country. What renewed hope and courage would grip the Americans at this hour of peril." Representative [[Percy Priest]] from [[Tennessee]] observed that Graham had issued a challenge for a national day of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billygraham.org/story/a-legacy-of-revival-in-the-nations-capital/ |title=A Legacy of Revival in the Nation’s Capital |last=Allmond |first=Joy |date=May 3, 2010 |publisher=Billy Graham Evangelistic Association |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the House and Senate introduced a joint resolution for an annual National Day of Prayer, "on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pluralism.org/research/profiles/display.php?profile=74229 |title=The Pluralism Project at Harvard University :America's National Day of Prayer (2006) |publisher=Pluralism.org |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed a bill proclaiming a National Day of Prayer must be declared by each subsequent president at an appropriate date of his choice.&lt;ref name=Davis90/&gt;

In 1982 a conservative evangelical Christian organization called the "National Prayer Committee" was formed to coordinate and implement a fixed annual day of prayer for the purpose of organizing evangelical Christian prayer events with local, state, and federal government entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalprayer.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=44 |title=National Prayer Committee website – Mission, Values, Call and Covenant |publisher=Nationalprayer.org |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Thanks-Giving Foundation]] also collaborated in this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanksgiving.org/thanks-giving-foundation/info/|title=About the Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1983 declaration, Ronald Reagan said, "From General Washington's struggle at Valley Forge to the present, this Nation has fervently sought and received divine guidance as it pursued the course of history. This occasion provides our Nation with an opportunity to further recognize the source of our blessings, and to seek His help for the challenges we face today and in the future."&lt;ref name=proc5017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/12783h.htm |title=Proclamation 5017 – National Day of Prayer, 1983 |publisher=Reagan.utexas.edu |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the law was amended so that the National Day of Prayer would be held on the first Thursday of May. Two stated intentions of the National Day of Prayer were that it would be a day when adherents of all great religions could unite in prayer and that it may one day bring renewed respect for God to all the peoples of the world.&lt;ref name=proc5017/&gt;

==Legal challenge==

The [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] (FFRF) sued to challenge the designation of a National Day of Prayer. On October 3, 2008, the [[Wisconsin]]-based organization filed suit in the [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin|federal district court for western Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], naming as defendants President [[George W. Bush]]; White House press secretary [[Dana Perino]]; Wisconsin governor [[Jim Doyle]]; and evangelist [[James Dobson]]'s wife, Shirley Dobson, in her capacity as chair of the [[National Day of Prayer Task Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-10-06-prayer-day_N.htm |title=Atheist group sues Bush over national prayer day |work=USA Today |date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance Defense Fund]] (ADF) provided defense for Shirley Dobson while government lawyers asked U.S. District Judge [[Barbara Crabb]] to dismiss the case, arguing principally that the group has no [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] to sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/news/2009/NDPcaseproceeds.php|title=FFRF National Day of Prayer Case Proceeds – Freedom From Religion Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2010 U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb stated that FFRF's lawsuit could proceed because the plaintiffs had shown that they suffered "concrete injury" that can potentially be remedied by judicial action. Judge Crabb stated about those supporting the federal law designating the National Day of Prayer, "adopting [the] defendants' view of standing would allow the government to have unrestrained authority to demean members of any religious group without legal consequence. The federal government could declare the 'National Day of Anti-Semitism' or even declare Christianity the official religion of the United States, but no one would have standing to sue because no one would have to 'pass by' those declarations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffrf.org/uploads/legal/dayofprayer_standing.PDF |title=Decision of FFRF v.

The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a notice to appeal the ruling on April 22, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/22/u-s-appeals-ruling-striking-down-national-day-of-prayer/?fbid=9vJShASeaFv |title=CNN.com: U.S. appeals ruling striking down National Day of Prayer |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 14, 2011  a three judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] unanimously overturned Crabb's decision. The panel ruled that FFRF did not have standing to sue because the National Day of Prayer had not caused them harm and stated that "a feeling of alienation cannot suffice as injury." The court further stated that "the President is free to make appeals to the public based on many kinds of grounds, including political and religious, and that such requests do not obligate citizens to comply and do not encroach on citizens' rights."  The federal appeals court also cited Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address, which referenced God seven times and prayer three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/14/ap/national/main20054020.shtml|title=Court dismisses suit over National Day of Prayer – CBS News|date=April 16, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416071913/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/14/ap/national/main20054020.shtml|archivedate=April 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
'''Our Lady of Graces''' (Italian: ''Madonna delle Grazie'' or ''Nostra Signora delle Grazie'') or '''St Mary of Graces''' (Italian: ''Santa Maria delle Grazie'') is a devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  Churches with this dedication often owe their foundation to thankfulness for graces received from the Virgin Mary, and are particularly numerous in Italy, India, Australia, United States, France and the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland.

==Patronage==
Our Lady of Graces is the patron saint of the diocese of [[Faenza]]. According to a legend, in 1412, [[Marian apparition|Mary appeared]] to a local woman. Mary was holding broken arrows symbolizing protection against [[God in Christianity|God]]'s wrath and promised an end to the plagues. [[Faenza Cathedral]] has a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, while residents often place ceramic titles with the image on their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prolocofaenza.it/files/file/depliant%20musei%20monumenti%20ecc/pieghevole_eng.pdf Brochure of Faenza Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Italian towns that have Our Lady of Graces as their patron saint include:
*[[Minturno]]
*[[Cautano]]
*[[Decimoputzu]].
*[[Nettuno]] (where [[Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti]] is part-dedicated to her)
*[[Ricadi]]

===Philippines===
[[File:Diocesan Shrine of Our Lady of Grace (Kalookan Diocese, the Philippines - October 2012).jpg|thumb|right|The old facade of the Diocesan Shrine and Parish of Our Lady of Grace of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan|Diocese of Kalookan]].]]
[[File:3ashrinesjf.JPG|thumb|right|100px|The old statue of Our Lady of Grace inside the church]]

* The [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] established Our Lady of Grace Parish on May 5, 1946, making it the oldest among the five parishes under the Vicariate of the Our Lady of Grace of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan|Diocese of Caloocan]]. The creation of the parish 72 years ago on a 3, 964 sq. m donated lot on the former 11th Avenue, now known as St. [[Eugene de Mazenod]] Avenue marked the beginning of the evangelization of the Missionary Congregation in the heart of Caloocan City.

The Our Lady of Grace Parish was once a small hut where religious services were held in the presence of few people. It commenced when the [[Archbishop of Manila]], Most Rev. Michael J. O’ Doherty, granted the request of the OMI Superior in the Philippines, Rev. Fr. Gerard Mongeau, to establish a house in Grace Park. The Philippine Realty Corporation, administrators of the Grace Park Subdivision, donated the use of eight lots in Block 171 for the church. With the help of the U.S. Signal Corps, a temporary chapel was built.

The first Eucharistic Celebration was done on May 16, 1946, by Rev. Fr. Joseph F. Boyd, OMI, attended by thirty–five people. The small church was blessed on September 1946, with the Good Shepherd Convent taking care of the choir and the church decoration.

But as early as mid–1949, just three years after the inauguration of the church, the need for a bigger space was seen because the number of parishioners can no longer be accommodated. In response to this necessity, the people of Grace Park launched a fund–raising campaign. After two years, a new church was ready to be blessed by the Archbishop of Manila, Rev. Msgr. Gabriel Reyes.

The parish, a product of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1963 – 1965), responded to the call of mounting the dignity of man, being the “People of God”, by renewing the way of Christian Life and Church Structure. Through the active leadership of the OMI Fathers and the Oblates of Notre Dame (OND) Sisters, Basic Ecclesial Communities were organized in eight specific areas of the parish, in order to aid the people regarding the political, environmental, and socio–economical issues. It is also in this period that, the Notre Dame of Greater Manila was established, a school governed by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate that aims to form people of aptitude and morals.

Today, Our Lady of Grace Parish is a clear reflection of what people living in Kalookan are like; industrious, helpful, loving, and faithful. Time may move on, but the spirit of St. Eugene de Mazenod and of our Mother will continue to stir through the lives of his priests and her parishioners.

The church co-patron is St. [[Eugene de Mazenod]] and the feast of Our Lady of Grace is observed every first Sunday of May.

==Paintings==
There are many thousands of paintings by this name throughout Italy. One may be seen at [[Grosseto Cathedral]] (by [[Matteo di Giovanni]], 1470), in the church of San Lorenzo at [[Poggibonsi]], and in [[Perugia Cathedral|the cathedral of Perugia]]. Unlike the Madonna del Soccorso or the Madonna della Misericordia, the Madonna delle Grazie has no particular iconography, although many of these paintings represent just the head or bust of the Virgin.

A full-figure Madonna Lactans, with both of Santa Maria's breasts fully exposed and showering lactating grace down upon souls in purgatory, was painted in Ravello, Italy, by bequest of Don Pietro Marciano (1 October 1572), and placed in a chapel he had built to hold it on Punta Paradiso (1576), overlooking Minori.  A gift to the Madonna for the miraculous deliverance at Lepanto, this village-style icon was restored 
in 2014.  A renewal of its lost devotion and the restoration of the chapel are being contemplated.

==Statues==
There are statues of her by [[Antonello Gagini]] at Chiesa dell'Osservanza, [[Catanzaro]] and the church of Madrice Vecchia, [[Castelbuono]], and by [[Vincenzo Gagini]] at the Church of San Martino, [[Randazzo]]. Another statue sculpted from wood by Mariano Gerada could be found in [[Żabbar]] a Maltese town dedicated to Our Lady of Graces, Il-Madonna tal-Grazzja, as known by the locals.

==Festivals==
Festivals to her are again celebrated in many places. In Italy one of the most famous is at [[Catenanuova]]. In [[Stamford, Connecticut]] she is celebrated by emigrants from [[Minturno]]. In the [[Malta|Maltese Islands]] at Żabbar and Victoria the feast is celebrated on the first Sunday after 8 September every year and is the last feast of the Summer season.

To the Japanese, the term "religion" or "faith" means [[organized religion]]s on the model of Christianity, that is a religion with specific doctrines and requirement for church membership. So, when asked "what is their religion", most of the Japanese answer that they "do not belong to any religion". According to [[NHK]] studies, those Japanese who identify with ''mushūkyō'' and therefore do not belong to any organized religion, actually take part in the folk ritual dimension of ''Shinto''. Ama Toshimaru in ''Nihonjin wa naze mushukyo na no ka'' ("Why are the Japanese non-religious?") of 1996, explains that people who do not belong to organised religions but regularly pray and make offerings to ancestors and protective deities at private altars or Shinto shrines will identify themselves as ''mushukyo''. Ama designates "natural religion" what NHK studies define as "folk religion", and other scholars have named "Nipponism" (''Nipponkyō'') or "common religion". For a complete discussion of "mushūkyō," see LeFebvre, J. (2015). Christian wedding ceremonies: “Nonreligiousness” in contemporary Japan.

Some scholars, such as Jun'ichi Isomae and Jason Ānanda Josephson, have challenged the usefulness of the term "religion" in regard to Japanese "traditions", arguing that the Japanese term and concept of "religion" (''shūkyō'') is an invention of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars, such as Hans Martin Kramer and Ian Reader, regard such claims as overstated and contend that the terms relate to terminology and categorizations that existed in Japan prior to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Krämer|first= Hans Martin|date= 2013|title= How "Religion" Came to Be Translated as "Shūkyō": Shimaji Mokurai and the Appropriation of Religion in Early Meiji Japan|jstor= 41959187|journal= Japan Review|issue= 25|pages= 89–111|doi= 10.2307/41959187}}

With the profound changes that the Japanese society has gone through in the 20th century, and especially after [[World War II]], including rapid industrialisation and urbanisation,&lt;ref name="Earhart, 2013. pp. 286-287"&gt;Earhart, 2013. pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt; traditional religions were challenged by the transformation and underwent a reshaping themselves,&lt;ref name="Earhart, 2013. pp. 286-287"/&gt; and principles of religious freedom articulated by the constitution&lt;ref&gt;Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; provided space for the proliferation of new religious movements.&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"&gt;Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Both new sects of [[Shinto]] and movements claiming a thoroughly independent status, as well as new forms of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] lay societies, provided ways of aggregation for people uprooted from traditional families and village institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Earhart, 2013. pp. 289-290&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional Shinto is residential and hereditary, and a person participates in the worship activities devoted to the local tutelary deity or ancestor, occasionally asking for specific healing or blessing services or participating in pilgrimages, in the new religions groups were formed by individuals without regard to kinship or territorial origins, and required a voluntary decision to join.&lt;ref name="Earhart, 2013. p. 290"&gt;Earhart, 2013. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; These new religions also provided cohesion through a unified doctrine and practice shared by the nationwide community.&lt;ref name="Earhart, 2013. p. 290"/&gt;

The officially recognized new religions number in the hundreds, and total membership is reportedly in the tens of millions.&lt;ref&gt;Shimazono, Susumu (2004). ''From Salvation to Spirituality: Popular Religious Movements in Modern Japan''. Trans Pacific Press. pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; The largest new religion is [[Soka Gakkai]], a Buddhist sect founded in 1930, which has about 10 million members in Japan. Scholars in Japan have estimated that between 10% and 20% of the population belongs to the new religions,&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"/&gt; although more realistic estimates put the number at well below the 10% mark.&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"/&gt; As of 2007, there are 223,831 priests and leaders of the new religions in Japan, three times the number of traditional Shinto priests.&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"/&gt;

Many of these new religions are Shinto-derived and retain the fundamental characters of Shinto, often identifying themselves as forms of Shinto. These include [[Tenrikyo]], [[Konkokyo]], [[Omotokyo]], Shinrikyo, [[Shinreikyo]], [[Sekai Shindokyo]], [[Zenrinkyo]] and others. Others are independent new religions, including [[Aum Shinrikyo]], [[Mahikari]] movements, the [[PL Kyodan|Church of Perfect Liberty]], [[Seicho-no-Ie]], the [[Church of World Messianity]], and others.

{{Main|Buddhism in Japan}}
[[Buddhism]] (仏教 ''Bukkyō'') first arrived in Japan in the 6th century, it was introduced in the year 538 or 552&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 455"&gt;Brown, 1993. p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; from the kingdom of [[Baekje]] in [[Korea]].&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 455"/&gt; The Baekje king sent the Japanese emperor a picture of the Buddha and some sutras. After overcoming brief yet violent oppositions by conservative forces, it was accepted by the Japanese court in 587.&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 455"/&gt; The [[Yamato period|Yamato state]] ruled over clans (''uji'') centered around the worship of ancestral nature deities.&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 456"&gt;Brown, 1993. p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a period of intense immigration from Korea,&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 454"&gt;Brown, 1993. p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; horse riders from northeast Asia,&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 455"/&gt; as well as cultural influence from [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1993. p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; that had been unified under the [[Sui dynasty]] becoming the crucial power on the mainland.&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 454"/&gt; Buddhism was functional to affirm the state's power and mold its position in the broader culture of East Asia.&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 456"/&gt; Japanese aristocrats set about building Buddhist temples in the capital at [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], and then in the later capital at Heian (now [[Kyoto]]).&lt;ref name="Brown, 1993. p. 456"/&gt;

The six Buddhist sects initially established in Nara are today together known as "[[Nanto Rikushū|Nara Buddhism]]" and are relatively small. When the capital moved to Heian, more forms of Buddhism arrived from China, including the still-popular [[Shingon Buddhism]], an esoteric form of Buddhism similar to Tibet's Vajrayana Buddhism, and [[Tendai]], a monastic conservative form known better by its Chinese name, [[Tiantai]].

When the [[Kamakura shogunate|shogunate]] took power in the 12th century and the administrative capital moved to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], more forms of Buddhism arrived. The most popular was [[Zen]], which became the most popular type of Buddhism of that time. Two schools of Zen were established, [[Rinzai]] and [[Sōtō]]; a third, [[Ōbaku]], formed in 1661.

With the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, that involved the centralisation of imperial power and the modernisation of the state, [[State Shinto|Shinto]] was made the state religion and an order of [[shinbutsu bunri|elimination of mutual influence of Shinto and Buddhism]] was enacted, followed by a [[haibutsu kishaku|movement to thoroughly eradicate Buddhism]].

Nowadays, the most popular branch is [[Pure Land Buddhism]], arrived in the [[Kamakura period]]. It emphasizes the role of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and promises that reciting the phrase "''[[nianfo|Namu Amida Butsu]]''" upon death will result in being removed by Amitabha to the "Western Paradise" or "[[Pure Land]]", and then to [[Nirvana]]. Pure Land attracted the merchant and farmer classes. After Honen, Pure Land's head missionary in Japan, died, the form split into two schools: ''[[Jōdo-shū]]'', which focuses on repeating the phrase many times, and the more liberal ''[[Jōdo Shinshū]]'', which claims that only saying the phrase once with a pure heart is necessary. Today, many Japanese adhere to ''Nishi Honganji-ha'', a conservative sect of Jodo Shinshu.

Another prevalent form of Buddhism is [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which was established by the 13th century monk [[Nichiren]] who underlined the importance of the [[Lotus Sutra]]. Main representatives of Nichiren Buddhism are sects like ''[[Nichiren Shū]]'', ''[[Nichiren Shōshū]]'' and lay organisations like [[Risshō Kōsei Kai]] and  ''[[Soka Gakkai]]'', a controversial denomination whose political wing forms the [[Komeito]], Japan's third largest political party. Common to most lineages of Nichiren Buddhism is the chanting of [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō|Nam(u) Myōhō Renge Kyō]] (or Nam Myoho Renge Kyo) and the [[Gohonzon]] inscribed by Nichiren.

As of 2007, there were 315,000+ Buddhist monks, priests and leaders in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"/&gt;

As of 2014, there were 377,000+ Buddhist monks, priests and leaders in Japan, an increase of over 60,000 compared to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Religious Statistics Japan|url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/tokei_hakusho_shuppan/hakusho_nenjihokokusho/shukyo_nenkan/pdf/h26nenkan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Protestantism in Japan|Catholicism in Japan|Kakure Kirishitan|Japanese Orthodox Church}}
[[Christianity]] (キリスト教 ''Kirisutokyō''), in the form of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (カトリック教 ''Katorikkukyō''), was introduced into Japan by [[Jesuit]] missions starting in 1549.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 1"&gt;Higashibaba, 2002. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the three Jesuits [[Francis Xavier]], Cosme de Torres and Juan Fernández, landed in [[Kagoshima]], in [[Kyushu]], on 15 August.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 1"/&gt; [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders were active in Kagoshima since 1543,&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 1"/&gt; welcomed by local ''[[daimyō]]s'' because they imported gunpowder. [[Anjirō]], a Japanese convert, helped the Jesuits understanding Japanese culture and translating the first Japanese catechism.&lt;ref&gt;Higashibaba, 2002. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

These missionaries were successful in converting large numbers of people in Kyushu, including peasants, former Buddhist monks, and members of the warrior class.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12"&gt;Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1559, a mission to the capital, [[Kyoto]], was started.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12"/&gt; By the following year there were nine churches, and the Christian community grew steadily in the 1560s.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12"/&gt; By 1569 there were 30,000 Christians and 40 churches.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12"/&gt; Following the conversion of some lords in Kyushu, mass baptisms of the local populations occurred, and in the 1570s the number of Christians rose rapidly to 100,000.&lt;ref name="Higashibaba, 2002. p. 12"/&gt; In the domains of Christian local lords, non-Christians were forced to accept baptism and shrines; Buddhist temples were converted into churches or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Higashibaba, 2002. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 16th century, [[Franciscan]] missionaries arrived in Kyoto, despite a ban issued by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In 1597, Hideyoshi proclaimed a more serious edict and [[Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan|executed 26 Franciscans]] in [[Nagasaki]] as a warning. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and his successors enforced the prohibition of Christianity with several further edicts, especially after the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] in the 1630s. Many Christians [[Kakure Kirishitan|continued to practice in secret]].

In 1873, following the [[Meiji Restoration]], the ban was rescinded, [[freedom of religion]] was promulgated, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries (プロテスタント ''Purotesutanto'' or 新教 ''Shinkyō'', "renewed teaching") began to proselytise in Japan, intensifying their activities after [[World War II]], yet they were never as successful as in [[religion in South Korea|Korea]].

Today, there are 1 to 3 million Christians in Japan, most of them living in the western part of the country, where the missionaries' activities were greatest during the 16th century. [[Nagasaki Prefecture]] has the highest percentage of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/7770.html Religion in Japan by prefecture]. 1996 statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 there are 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bestor, Yamagata. 2011. p. 65"/&gt; Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including [[marriage in Japan|Western style weddings]], [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Christmas]]) have become popular among many of the Japanese. For example, 60-70% of weddings performed in Japan are Christian-style.&lt;ref&gt;LeFebvre, J. (2015). Christian wedding ceremonies: “Nonreligiousness” in contemporary Japan.

[[Islam]] (イスラム教 ''Isuramukyō'') in Japan is mostly represented by small immigrant communities from other parts of [[Asia]].

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] (バハーイー教 ''Bahāīkyō'') in Japan began after a few mentions of the country by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] first in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author='Abdu'l-Bahá|authorlink='Abdu'l-Bahá|origyear=1875|year=1990|title=The Secret of Divine Civilization|publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust|page= 111|location=Wilmette, Illinois|isbn=0-87743-008-X|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SDC/sdc-6.html.iso8859-1#gr21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Japanese convert was {{nihongo|[[Kanichi Yamamoto]]|山本寛一}}, who lived in [[Honolulu]], and accepted the faith in 1902; the second convert was {{nihongo|[[Saichiro Fujita]]|藤田左弌郎|}}. The first Bahá'í convert on Japanese soil was {{nihongo|Kikutaro Fukuta|福田菊太郎|}} in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Agnes Baldwin|authorlink=Agnes Alexander|editor=Sims, Barbara|title=History of the Bahá'í Faith in Japan 1914-1938|publisher=Japan Bahá'í Publishing Trust|year=1977|location=Osaka, Japan|pages=12–4, 21|url=http://bahai-library.com/alexander_history_bahai_japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a century later, the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 15,700 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Baha'i Nations (2005)|work=QuickLists|publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives|year=2005|url=http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===

{{Main|History of the Jews in Japan|Jewish settlement in Imperial Japan}}
[[Judaism]] (ユダヤ教 ''Yudayakyō'') in Japan is practiced by about 2,000 [[Jews]] living in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/889.pdf|last=Golub|first=Jennifer|title=Japanese Attitudes Toward Jews|publisher=Pacific Rim Institute of the American Jewish Committee|date=August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of Japan to the external world in 1853 and the end of Japan's ''[[sakoku]]'' [[foreign policy]], some Jews immigrated to Japan from abroad, with the first recorded Jewish settlers arriving at [[Yokohama]] in 1861. The Jewish population continued to grow into the 1950s, fueled by immigration from Europe and the Middle East, with [[Tokyo]] and [[Kobe]] forming the largest communities.

During [[World War II]], some European Jews fleeing the [[Holocaust]] found refuge in Japan, with one Japanese diplomat, [[Chiune Sugihara]], the Japanese consul to [[Lithuania]], disregarding his orders and issuing more than 6,000 entry visas to Jews fleeing the Nazis. After World War II, a large portion of Japan's Jewish population emigrated, many going to what would become [[Israel]]. Some of those who remained married locals and were assimilated into Japanese society.

There are community centres serving Jews in Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/|title=Jewish Community of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcckobe.org/|title=Jewish Community of Kansai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] organization has two centres in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.jp/|title=Chabad Japan|publisher=Chabad Jewish Center of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadjapan.org/|title=Chabad Tokyo Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Japan nominated a [[Chief Rabbi]] for the first time, the head of Tokyo's [[Chabad House]], Rabbi Binyamin Edre'i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan Gets First-Ever Chief Rabbi|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/200785|date=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism in Japan}}

[[Hinduism]] (ヒンドゥー教 ''Hindūkyō'' or 印度教 ''Indokyō'') in Japan is practiced by a small number of people, mostly immigrants from [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Nevertheless, Hindu themes have had a significant but indirect role in Japanese culture, through the spread of Buddhism. Four of the Japanese "[[Seven Gods of Fortune]]" originated as Hindu deities, including Benzaiten (Sarasvati), Bishamon (Vaiśravaṇa or Kubera), Daikoku (Mahakala/Shiva), and Kisshoutennyo (Laxmi). Various Hindu deities, including the aforementioned, are worshipped in [[Shingon Buddhism]]. This denomination, and all other forms of Tantric Buddhism, borrow heavily from Tantric Hinduism.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikhism in Japan}}
[[Sikhism]] (シク教 ''Sikukyō'') is presently a minority religion in [[Japan]] mainly followed by families migrated from India.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism in Japan}}
[[Jainism]] (ジャイナ教 ''Jainakyō'') is a minority religion in [[Japan]]. {{Asof|2009}}, there were three Jain temples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.jaina.org/?page=Convention2009|title=2009 Jain Diaspora Conference|location=Los Angeles, USA|accessdate=24 March 2012|publisher=JAINA: Federation of Jain Associations in North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions of East Asia===

====Ryukyuan religion====
[[File:Miyako harimizu utaki.jpg|thumb|150px|''Harimizu [[utaki]]'' (Harimizu Shrine), a Ryukyuan shrine in [[Miyakojima, Okinawa|Miyakojima]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]].]]
{{Main|Ryukyuan religion}}
The Ryukyuan religion is the indigenous belief system of the people of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and the other [[Ryukyu Islands]]. While specific legends and traditions may vary slightly from place to place and island to island, the Ryukyuan religion is generally characterized by [[ancestor worship]] (more accurately termed "ancestor respect") and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world. Some of its beliefs, such as those concerning ''[[genius loci]]'' spirits and many other beings classified between gods and humans, are indicative of its ancient [[animism|animistic]] roots, as is its concern with {{nihongo3||まぶい|mabui}}, or life essence.

One of its most ancient features is the belief {{nihongo4||おなり神|[[onarigami]]}}, the spiritual superiority of women derived from the goddess [[Amamikyu]], which allowed for the development of a class of ''[[noro (priestess)|noro]]'' (priestesses) cult and ''yuta'' (female [[Mediumship|media]]). This differs from Japanese Shinto, where men are seen as the embodiment of purity. Ryukyuan religion has been influenced by Japanese Shinto and Buddhism, and various Chinese religions. It includes sects and reformed movements such as [[Ijun]] or Ijunism ([[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan]]: いじゅん ''Ijun''; Japanese: 違順教 ''Ijunkyō''), founded in the 1970s.

====Ainu folk religion====
{{Main|Ainu religion}}
The Ainu religion {{nihongo|アイヌの宗教|Ainu no shūkyō}} is the indigenous belief system of the [[Ainu people]] of [[Hokkaido]] and [[Ainu in Russia|parts of Far Eastern Russia]]. It is an [[Animism|animistic]] religion centered around the belief that ''[[Kamuy]]'' (spirits or gods) live in everything.

====Chinese folk religion====
{{Main|Chinese folk religion}}
[[File:Yamashitacho, Naka Ward, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture 231-0023, Japan - panoramio - jetsun (5).jpg|thumb|150px|Temple of [[Guan Yu|Guandi]] (關帝廟; Japanese: ''Kanteibyō'', Chinese: ''Guāndìmiào'') in [[Yokohama]].]]
Most [[Chinese people in Japan]] practice the Chinese folk religion ({{cjkv|j=中国の民俗宗教|r=Chūgoku no minzoku shūkyō|c=中国民间宗教 or 中国民间信仰|p=Zhōngguó mínjiān zōngjiào or Zhōngguó mínjiān xìnyǎng}}), also known as Shenism ({{cjkv|c=神教|r=Shinkyō|p=Shénjiào}}), that is very similar to Japanese Shinto.

The Chinese folk religion consists in the worship of the ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors, ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' (神 "[[deity|gods]]", "[[spirit]]s", "awarenesses", "consciousnesses", "[[archetype]]s"; literally "expressions", the energies that generate things and make them thrive), which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], city deities or [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of other human agglomerations, [[national god|national deities]], [[cultural hero|cultural]] [[hero]]es and demigods, [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s of kinships. [[Mythology|Holy narratives]] regarding some of these gods are codified into the body of [[Chinese mythology]].

====Taoism====
[[File:Sakado Xientengong Tenmon 20110203 1.jpg|thumb|150px|''Seitenkyū'' (聖天宮; Chinese: ''Shèngtiāngōng'', "Temple of the Holy Heaven"), a [[Taoist temple]] in [[Sakado, Saitama]].]]
{{Main|Taoism in Japan}}
[[Taoism]] (道教 ''Dōkyō'') was introduced from China between the 7th and 8th centuries, and influenced in varying degrees the Japanese indigenous spirituality. Taoist practices were absorbed into Shinto, and Taoism was the source of the esoteric and mystical religions of [[Onmyōdō]], [[Shugendō]] and [[Kōshin]].

Taoism, being an indigenous religion in China, shares some roots with Shinto, although Taoism is more hermetic while Shinto is more shamanic. Taoism's influence in Japan has been less profound than that of Japanese Neo-Confucianism. Today, institutional Chinese Taoism is present in the country in the form of some temples; the ''[[Seitenkyū]]'' was founded in 1995.

====Confucianism====
[[File:Ashikaga Gakko Koshibyo.JPG|thumb|150px|''Kōshibyō'' (孔子廟, "Temple of Confucius") of the [[Ashikaga Gakko]], the oldest Confucian school in Japan.]]
{{Main|Edo Neo-Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] (儒教 ''Jukyō'') was introduced from China during the [[Edo period]], and developed into an elite religion, yet having a profound influence on the fabric of Japanese society overall. The Confucian philosophy can be characterized as humanistic and rationalistic, with the belief that the universe could be understood through human reason, corresponding to the universal reason (''[[li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]''), and thus it is up to man to create a harmonious relationship between the universe (天 ''[[Tian|Ten]]'') and the individual.&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=552}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationalism of Neo-Confucianism was in contrast to the mysticism of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Unlike the Buddhists, the Neo-Confucians believed that reality existed, and could be understood by mankind, even if the interpretations of reality were slightly different depending on the school of Neo-Confucianism.&lt;ref name="craig"/&gt;

The social aspects of the philosophy are hierarchical with a focus on [[filial piety]]. This created a Confucian [[social stratification]] in Edo society that previously had not existed, dividing Japanese society into four main classes: [[samurai]], farmers, [[artisan]]s and merchants.&lt;ref name="craig2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The samurai were especially avid readers and teachers of Confucian thought in Japan, establishing many Confucian academies.

Neo-Confucianism also introduced elements of [[ethnocentrism]] into Japan. As the Chinese Neo-Confucians had regarded their own culture as the center of the world, the Japanese Neo-Confucians developed a similar national pride.&lt;ref name="craig"/&gt; This national pride would later evolve into the philosophical school of [[Kokugaku]], which would later challenge Neo-Conufucianism, and its perceived foreign Chinese origins, as the dominant philosophy of Japan.

==Religious practices and holidays==
Most Japanese participate in rituals and customs derived from several religious traditions. Life cycle events are often marked by visits to a Shinto shrine. The birth of a new baby is celebrated with a formal shrine visit at the age of about one month, as are the third, fifth, and seventh birthdays (''[[Shichi-Go-San]]'') and the official beginning of [[adulthood]] at age twenty (''[[Seijin shiki]]''). [[Wedding]] ceremonies are often performed by Shinto priests, but Western-style secular wedding ceremonies, called ''howaito uedingu'' ("white wedding"), are also popular. These use Christian-like [[liturgy]] but are usually not presided over by an ordained priest.

[[Japanese funeral]]s are usually performed by Buddhist priests, and Buddhist rites are also common on death day anniversaries of deceased family members. 91% of Japanese funerals take place according to [[Buddhist]] traditions.

There are two categories of holidays in Japan: ''[[matsuri]]'' (temple fairs), which are largely of Shinto origin and relate to the cultivation of rice and the spiritual well-being of the local community; and ''nenjyū gyōji'' (annual feasts), which are largely of Chinese or Buddhist origin. During the [[Heian period]], the ''matsuri'' were organized into a formal calendar, and other festivals were added. Very few ''matsuri'' or annual feasts are national holidays, but they are included in the national calendar of annual events. Most ''matsuri'' are local events and follow local traditions. They may be sponsored by schools, towns, or other groups but are most often associated with Shinto shrines.

Some of the holidays are secular in nature, but the two most significant for the majority of Japanese—[[New Year's Day]] and ''[[Bon Festival|Obon]]''—involve visits to Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples, respectively. The New Year's holiday (January 1–3) is marked by the practice of numerous customs and the consumption of special foods. Visiting Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples to pray for family blessings in the coming year, dressing in a [[kimono]], hanging special decorations, eating noodles on New Year's Eve, and playing a poetry card game are among these practices. During Obon, ''bon'' (spirit altars) are set up in front of Buddhist family altars, which, along with ancestral graves, are cleaned in anticipation of the return of the spirits. People living away from their family homes return for visits with relatives. Celebrations include folk dancing and prayers at Buddhist temples as well as family rituals in the home.

==Religion and law==
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Japan}}
In early [[History of Japan|Japanese history]], the ruling class was responsible for performing propitiatory rituals, which later came to be identified as Shinto, and for the introduction and support of Buddhism. Later, religious organization was used by regimes for political purposes; for instance, the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] government required each family to be registered as a member of a Buddhist temple. In the early 19th century, the government required that each family belong to a shrine instead, and in the early 20th century, this was supplemented with the concept of a divine right to rule bestowed on the emperor. The [[Meiji Constitution]] reads: "Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief".

Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Japan|1947 Constitution]] states: "Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority". The [[United States]] privatized shrines and created the term "[[State Shinto]]" during the [[occupation of Japan]] to reform native Japanese ideas of church and state, under the belief that it had supported the rise of [[Japanese militarism]] before and during [[World War II]].

In postwar years, the issue of the separation of Shinto and state arose in the Self-Defense Force Apotheosis Case. In 1973, Nakaya Takafumi, a member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese Self-Defense Forces]] and husband of Nakaya Yasuko, died in a traffic accident.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shintō and the State, 1868-1988|last=Hardacre|first=Helen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1989|isbn=0691020523|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Yasuko’s refusal to provide relevant documents for her husband’s enshrinement at the [[Yamaguchi Prefecture|Yamaguchi]] prefectural National-Protecting Shrine, the prefectural Veterans’ Association requested the information from the Self-Defense Forces and completed the enshrinement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, in 1973, Yasuko sued the Yamaguchi Prefectural Branch of the Self-Defense Forces, on the grounds that the ceremony of apotheosis violated her religious rights as a Christian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Yasuko won the case at two lower courts, the ruling was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] on June 1, 1988, based on the precedent established by the [http://www.courts.go.jp/app/hanrei_en/detail?id=51 Tsu City Shinto Groundbreaking Ceremony Case]. First, the Supreme Court ruled that because the Veterans’ Association—which was not an organ of the state—had acted alone when arranging the ceremony of apotheosis, no violation of Article 20 had occurred.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shintō and the State, 1868-1988|last=Hardacre|first=Helen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1989|isbn=0691020523|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Supreme Court held that the Self-Defense Forces' provision of Takafumi’s documents to the Veterans’ Association did not constitute a religious activity prohibited by Article 20, because neither the intention nor the effects of its action harmed or patronized any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shintō and the State, 1868-1988|last=Hardacre|first=Helen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1989|isbn=0691020523|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the Supreme Court adopted a narrow interpretation of individual religious rights, by ruling that violation of individual rights to religion did not occur unless the state or its organs coerced individuals to perform some religious activity or limited their religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shintō and the State, 1868-1988|last=Hardacre|first=Helen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1989|isbn=0691020523|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 1988, a report by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the Japanese Supreme Court’s decision as “a major setback for advocates of stronger separation of religion and state in Japan.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-02/news/mn-5840_1_religious-rights-case|title=Japan Widow Loses Religious Rights Case|last=Schoenberger|first=Karl|date=1988-06-02|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 1988, an article published in the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] expressed concern that the Japanese Supreme Court’s decision was likely to encourage the resurgence of [[State Shinto]] and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/07/world/tokyo-journal-shinto-is-thrust-back-onto-the-nationalist-stage.html|title=Tokyo Journal; Shinto Is Thrust Back Onto the Nationalist Stage|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=|work=|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the prefectural National-Protecting Shrines perform the same ceremony of apotheosis as the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] does, the significance of this case also lies in its implications for the constitutionality of state patronage of and official visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Thoughts and movements against organised religion==
Shichihei Yamamoto argues that Japan has shown greater tolerance towards [[irreligion]], saying, "Japan had nothing like the trial of [[Galileo]] or the '[[monkey trial]]' about [[evolution]]. No Japanese [[Giordano Bruno]] was ever burned at the stake for [[atheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shichihei|first=Yamamoto|title=The spirit of Japanese capitalism and selected essays|year=1992|publisher=Madison Books|location=Lanham|isbn=9780819182944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments against religion by notable figures===
*'''[[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]]''', philosopher and scholar who rejected theism, claimed that God or Buddha, as objective beings, are mere illusions.&lt;ref name="furuya"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Japanese theology|first=Yasuo|last=Furuya|page=94|publisher=Eerdmans Publishing|year=1997|isbn=0802841082}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Prince Ito Hirobumi]]''', four-time [[Prime Minister of Japan]], who reportedly said: "I regard religion itself as quite unnecessary for a nation's life; science is far above superstition, and what is religion – Buddhism or Christianity – but superstition, and therefore a possible source of weakness to a nation? I do not regret the tendency to free thought and atheism, which is almost universal in Japan because I do not regard it as a source of danger to the community".&lt;ref name="gulick"&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution of the Japanese, Social and Psychic|first=Sidney L.|last=Gulic|page=198|isbn=9781426474316|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Hiroyuki Kato]]''', who headed the Imperial Academy from 1905–1909 and said: "Religion depends on fear".&lt;ref name="gulick"/&gt;
*'''[[Haruki Murakami]]''', a Japanese novelist who wrote: "God only exists in people’s minds. Especially in Japan, God's always has been a kind of flexible concept. Look at what happened to the war.

===Anti-religious organisations===
The Japan Militant Atheists Alliance (''Nihon Sentoteki Mushinronsha Domei'', also known as ''Senmu'') was founded in September 1931 by a group of [[antireligion|antireligious]] people. The alliance opposed the idea of [[kokutai]], the nation's [[founding myth]], the presence of religion in public education, and the practice of [[State Shinto]]. Their greatest opposition was towards the [[Empire of Japan|imperial system of Japan]].&lt;ref name=ives&gt;{{cite book|last=Ives|first=Christopher|title=Imperial-Way Zen: Ichikawa Hakugen's critique and lingering questions for Buddhist ethics|year=2009|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824833312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, in November 1931, socialist Toshihiko Sakai and Communist Takatsu Seido created the Japan Anti-religion Alliance (''Nihon Hanshukyo Domei''). They opposed "contributions to religious organizations, prayers for practical benefits (kito), preaching in factories, and the religious organizations of all stripes" and viewed religion as a tool used by the upper class to suppress laborers and farmers.&lt;ref name=ives /&gt;

In the 12th century,  in [[Western Chalukya Empire|Chalukya Kingdom]] [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] people were persecuted for their religious beliefs. To escape genocide after [http://lingayatreligion.com/Revolution_of_Kalyana.htm Revolution of Kalyana],  they left in numbers to neighbouring states like [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]. During the same time '''''Salpe''''' families migrated to [[Maharashtra]] , they settled in [https://goo.gl/maps/KxEtZxQjsxz Salpe village]  in [[Satara district]] which is nearby '''''Salpe Ghat''.''' After that they picked up name of village (Name of village as surname is very common practice in [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] religion) as their  identity. Their original [[Kannada]] name could be  difficult to pronounce in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] so they pick up name of village as their surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salpe Village in Lanja (Ratnagiri) Maharashtra {{!}} villageinfo.in|url=https://villageinfo.in/maharashtra/ratnagiri/lanja/salpe.html|website=villageinfo.in|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samantabhadra''' ([[Sanskrit]], "Universal Worthy") is a [[bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] associated with practice and [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. Together with [[Gautama Buddha]] and his fellow bodhisattva [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]], he forms the ''Shakyamuni trinity'' in [[Buddhism]]. He is the patron of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and, according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'', made the ten great vows which are the basis of a bodhisattva. In [[Chinese Buddhism]], Samantabhadra is known as '''Puxian''' and is associated with action, whereas Mañjuśrī is associated with [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (transcendent wisdom). In [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]], this bodhisattva is often venerated in [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]], and as the protector of the ''Lotus Sutra'' by [[Nichiren Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Samantabhadra is also the name of the [[Adi-Buddha]] – in indivisible [[Yab-Yum]] with his consort, [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]].

==Origins==
In the ''Lotus Sūtra'', Samantabhadra is described at length in the epilogue, called the ''[[Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra]]'' ({{zh|c=觀普賢菩薩行法經|p=Guān Pǔxián Púsà Xíngfǎ Jīng}}), with special detail given to visualization of the bodhisattva, and the virtues of devotion to him.&lt;ref&gt;Katō Bunno, Tamura Yoshirō, Miyasaka Kōjirō, tr. (1975), [http://www.rk-world.org/publications/ThreefoldLotusSutra.pdf ''The Threefold Lotus Sutra] : The Sutra of Innumerable Meanings; The Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law; The Sutra of Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue''. New York &amp; Tōkyō: Weatherhill &amp; Kōsei Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Samantabhadra is also a key figure in the ''Āvataṃsaka-sūtra'', particularly the last chapter, the ''Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra''.  In the climax of the ''Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra'', the student [[Sudhana]] meets Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, who teaches him that wisdom only exists for the sake of putting it into practice; that it is only good insofar as it benefits all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|living beings]].

In the ''Āvataṃsaka-sūtra'', the Buddha states that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva made ten great vows in his path to full Buddhahood:

# To pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] and respect to all Buddhas.
# To praise the Thus Come One-[[Tathāgata|Tathagata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoituthienphohien.com/hanhthien.html THỰC HÀNH TỪ THIỆN THEO MƯỜI ĐẠI NGUYỆN CỦA ĐỨC PHỔ HIỀN BỒ TÁT]&lt;/ref&gt;
# To make abundant offerings. (i.e. give generously)
# To repent misdeeds and [[Evil#Buddhism|evil]] [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]s.
# To rejoice in others' merits and [[Virtue#Buddhism|virtue]]s.
# To request the Buddhas to continue teaching.
# To request the Buddhas to remain in the world.
# To follow the teachings of the Buddhas at all times.
# To accommodate and benefit all living beings.
# To transfer all merits and virtues to benefit all beings.

The ten vows have become a common practice in [[East Asian Buddhism]], particularly the tenth vow, with many Buddhists traditionally dedicating their merit and good works to all beings during Buddhist liturgies.

==Iconography==

===In Mahayana Buddhism===
[[File:Fugen the life preserver full view.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{nihongo|Fugen Enmei|普賢延命菩薩}}, the life Preserver.]]
Unlike his more popular counterpart Manjusri, Samantabhadra is only rarely depicted alone and is usually found in a trinity on the right side of [[Shakyamuni]], mounted on a white elephant. In those traditions that accept the Avatamsaka Sutra as its root instruction, Samantabhadra and Manjusri flank [[Vairocana]] Buddha, the central Buddha of this particular sutra.

Known as Pǔxián in Chinese, he is sometimes shown in [[Chinese art]] with feminine characteristics, riding an elephant with six pairs of tusks while carrying a lotus leaf 'parasol' (Sanskrit: ''[[chhatra]]''), bearing similar dress and features to some feminine depictions of [[Kuan Yin]]. It is in this guise that Samantabhadra is revered as the patron bodhisattva of the monasteries associated with [[Mount Emei]] in western China. Some believe that the white elephant mount of Samantabhadra was the same elephant that appeared to [[Maya (mother of Buddha)|Queen Maya]], the mother of the Buddha, to herald his birth.

Mahayana esoteric traditions treat Samantabhada as one of the 'Primordial' (Sanskrit: [[Dharmakaya]]) Buddhas, but the main primordial buddha is considered to be [[Vairocana]].

===In Esoteric Buddhism===
[[Image:Fugen enmei painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Samantabhadra, pictured in ''Bodhisattva of Universal Virtue who Prolongs Life'', 12th-century painting on silk, late Heian period.]]

It is very common that the bodhisattva of the Mahayana tradition with the name of Samantabhadra is conflated with a Buddha with the same name that appears as the primordial buddha, in some of the Tibetan traditions. This comes from the fact that both figures have the same name but their meaning within their respective traditions is quite different. It is not the case that the bodhisattva of the Mahayana has evolved or transformed when assimilated into the Tibetan tradition because in that tradition the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra is present and the Dharmakaya Samantabhadra as well as two separate and distinct entities.

In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, particularly the Nyingma school, Dharmakaya Samantabhadra (not the bodhisattva of the Mahayana) is considered the most primordial Buddha, akin in status to '''[[Vajradhara]]''' for the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] traditions. Samantabhadra appears in the [[Vajrayana]] [[tantras|tantric text]] the [[Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra]], as the [[Primordial Buddha]], the 'embodiment' (Sanskrit: ''[[Kaya (Buddhism)|kaya]]'') or 'field' (Sanskrit: ''[[kṣetra]]'') of 'timeless awareness, [[gnosis]]' (Sanskrit: ''[[jñāna]]'') awakened since before the very beginning. Therefore, in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the Nyingma, or 'Old Translation' school, the [[Sakya]] and the [[Bön]] schools view Samantabhadra as the Primordial Buddha. In the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Vajrayana]], Samantabhadra is considered a [[primordial Buddha]] in indivisible [[yab-yum]] union with his [[Shakti|consort]] [[Samantabhadri]]. However, the [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools use [[Vajradhara]] to represent the Primordial Buddha.

[[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]] following the Nyingmapa [[Dzogchen]] tradition qualifies the nature and essence of Samantabhadra, the Primordial Buddha, as the origin-less wellspring of the timeless and unbounded Atiyoga teachings, and honours the converse view entertained by some interested parties which hold that the Dzogchen teachings originated with either the [[Bonpo]] tradition or the Chinese monk [[Moheyan]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Samantabhadra is not subject to limits of time, place, or physical conditions. Samantabhadra is not a colored being with two eyes, etc. Samantabhadra is the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of appearances and emptiness, the nature of mind, natural clarity with unceasing compassion - that is Samantabhadra from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Khyentse, Dzongsar (1990).

The word "'''''sambandha'''''" is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "relationship". It is a key concept in  Sanskrit grammar, and in [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava theology]]. In the context of this tradition of [[Hinduism]], sambandha-jnana means [[Jnana|knowledge]] of the relationship between [[Svayam Bhagavan|Almighty God]] [[Krishna]], [[Shakti]], [[jiva]]s, and the world. Accordingly, sambandha-jnana includes knowledge of the three [[tattva]]s or truths: Krishna-tattva, Shakti-tattva and jiva-tattva.

==Theology==
Sambandha in Gaudiya Vaishnavism is the relationship between Krishna, a jiva, and the material world. All jivas are eternally and inextricably linked with Krishna, who is the true object of all relations. The basic relationship between Krishna and a jiva is the attitude of a servant. By [[sadhana]], which includes a repetition of [[List of titles and names of Krishna|Names of Lord Krishna]] ([[kirtan]] and [[japa]]), people can be freed from [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] and awakens in their heart their attachment as a servant of Krishna.

[[Vedic literature]] refers to the eternal relationship of a jiva with Krishna. Understanding of the relationship, and any subsequent action on the basis of this understanding, is called "[[abhidheya]]". Reaching [[Prem (Hinduism)|Prem]]a, or pure love of Krishna, and returning to [[Goloka|the spiritual world]] in the company of Krishna and his associates, is the ultimate goal of life, which is called "prayojana".

In the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition [[Sanatana Goswami]] is considered to be the [[Acharya]] of sambandha-jnana. The deity of [[Madan Mohan]], installed by Sanatana in [[Vrindavan]], is associated with sambandha. It is believed that he helps to overcome the influence of material desires and to focus on [[Bhakti Yoga|devotional service]] to Krishna.

==Arrest==
Gillian Gibbons was born in 1953 and gained a [[Bachelor of Education]] degree from the [[C.F.Mott Teachers' Training College|C.F. Mott College]] of Education in [[Prescot]] in 1975 (the college closed in 1992).  Teaching in a school in Sudan, she was arrested for allegedly [[Blasphemy|insulting]] Islam by allowing her class of six-year-olds to name a [[teddy bear]] "Muhammad".&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news |title='Muhammad' teddy teacher arrested |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7112929.stm |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Times&gt;{{cite news| first1 =Rob | last1 = Crilly | first2 = Lucy | last2 = Bannerman |title = Sudan police throw teacher in jail for teddy bear named Muhammad|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article2951262.ece|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2007 | location = Khartoum, London | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially it was thought that the complaint had originated from a parent of one of the children at the school.  However, it was later revealed that an office assistant employed at the school, Sara Khawad, had filed the complaint and was the key witness for the prosecution.&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sudan/story/0,,2219876,00.html|title=Jailed teddy row teacher appeals for tolerance|date=30 November 2007 |accessdate= 1 December 2007 |quote=The complainant was named as Sara Khawad, an office assistant at the school, who was the key prosecution witness | work=The Guardian | location=London | first= Allegra | last= Stratton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khawad was said to be angry with the school's head teacher. "I was used by the secretary to get at the school," Gibbons told [[The Guardian (TV series)|''The Guardian'']] shortly after her release.&lt;ref name=guardian1 /&gt;

Sudan's legal system is strongly influenced by [[sharia]], which prohibits depictions of [[Muhammad]] and other [[prophet]]s.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; However, many Muslim organizations in other countries publicly condemned the Sudanese over their reactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/cross-cultural/intercultural-communication-translation-news/2007/11/29/muhammad-the-teddy-bear-a-case-of-intercultural-incompetence/|title = Muhammad &amp; the teddy bear: a case of intercultural incompetence|date=29 November 2007|accessdate=1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Gibbons did not set out to cause offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7123517.stm | title = Sudanese Views differ in Teddy Row | publisher = BBC | newspaper = News | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the Unity School council, Ezikiel Kondo, indicated that he perceived ulterior motives in the affair, "The thing may be very simple, but they just may make it bigger.

On 25 November 2007, Gibbons was arrested, interrogated and then put in a cell at a local police station.&lt;ref name = "guardian1" /&gt; On 28 November, it was reported that she had been formally charged under Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Act, for "insulting religion, inciting hatred, sexual harassment, racism, prostitution and showing contempt for religious beliefs".&lt;ref name= BBC2&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Muhammad' Teacher charged over teddy row | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7117430.stm |publisher=BBC|date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=UK teacher goes to court in Sudan |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7118245.stm | publisher= BBC| date= 29 November 2007| accessdate= 29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment, a fine, or 40 [[Flagellation|lashes]].

On 30 November approximately 10,000 protesters took to the streets in [[Khartoum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/30/uk.schoolsworldwide|title= Jailed teddy row teacher appeals for tolerance | publisher = [[The Guardian]]|date=30 November 2007|accessdate=9 December 2009 | location=London | first=Allegra | last=Stratton}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of them waving [[sword]]s and [[machetes]], demanding Gibbons's [[Capital punishment|execution]] after [[imam]]s denounced her during [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]]. During the march, chants of "Shame, shame on the UK", "No tolerance – execution" and "Kill her, kill her by firing squad" were heard.  Witnesses reported that government employees were involved in inciting the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/01/world/africa/01sudan.html |title=Calls in Sudan for Execution of British Teacher| work = [[The New York Times]] |date=30 November 2007|accessdate=30 November 2007 | first= Jeffrey | last = Gettleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbons was then moved to a secret location because of fears for her safety.&lt;ref name="Peers" /&gt;

==Release==
In an attempt to push for the release of Gibbons, two [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslim]] peers (members of the [[House of Lords]]), [[Nazir Ahmed, Baron Ahmed|Lord Ahmed]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]) and [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Warsi]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]), visited Sudan with hopes of talking to the country's President [[Omar al-Bashir]].&lt;ref name="Peers"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7122323.stm | title=UK peers in bid to free teacher |publisher = ''[[BBC News]]''| date = 1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the two British politicians were meeting the President on 3 December it was announced that Gibbons was to be released from prison having been granted a [[Presidential pardon]]. After eight days in jail, she was released into the care of the British embassy in [[Khartoum]] and then returned to [[Liverpool]], after issuing a written statement saying: "I have a great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7124447.stm Teddy row teacher freed from jail], ''BBC World Service'', 3 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22076390/ Teddy bear" teacher leaves Sudan after pardon]", ''MSNBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afterwards==
The school was closed until January 2008 for the safety of pupils and staff as reprisals were feared.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/teddy-bear-teacher-found-guilty-article-1.255459|title=Teddy bear teacher found guilty|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''|accessdate=29 November 2007|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
These techniques have some similarities to techniques in [[Sant Mat]] derived movements and may be derived from [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].&lt;ref name=Barret&gt;Barret V. David ''The New Believers: Asurvet of Sects, Cults and Alternative Religions" (2003), pp.327, Octopus Publishing Group , {{ISBN|1-84403-040-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Kranenborg writes that the techniques of Knowledge originated from the [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] or [[Sant Mat]], the Path of the [[Sound Current]], and that some of the techniques are related to the '[[japa]]-' or [[mantra]]-[[yoga]] which are similar to some techniques of [[Transcendental meditation]] and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].&lt;ref name="Kran" /&gt;

The website "Maharaji.org" (1999) included the traceable story of "Masters" that, according to Prem Rawat, referred to the techniques of Knowledge since 1780, including [[Totapuri]], [[Anandpuri Ji]], [[Dayal Ji]], [[Swarupanand Ji]], and his father [[Hans Ji Maharaj]].[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508114904/http://www.maharaji.org/masters/masters.htm]

==Descriptions==
&lt;!-- NOTE: This was a compromise version created by a third party, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides. Please discuss any intended changes on the talk page before making edits to this section to avoid further contention. --&gt;
According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister [[Reender Kranenborg]] and the American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], these techniques are secret and were originally called "Light", "Sound", "Name" or "Word" and "Nectar" but Prem Rawat now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques.&lt;ref name="Kran"&gt;[[Reender Kranenborg|Kranenborg, Reender]] Dr. (1982) ''Oosterse Geloofsbewegingen in het Westen/Eastern faith movements in the West'' (Dutch language) {{ISBN|90-210-4965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankiel, Sandra S. in Lippy, Charles H. and Williams. Peter W. (Eds.) ''Encyclopedia of the American Religious Experience'' p.1521, Charles Scribner's Sons (1988), {{ISBN|0-684-18863-5}} (Vol III)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;Melton, Gordon J., Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America (1992) pp. 143-4, Garland Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8153-1140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prem Rawat asks practitioners to promise "not to reveal these techniques to anyone", but says to "let other people go through their own journey... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready."&lt;ref name=promises/&gt;

Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices.&lt;ref name="Kran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt; "Light" involves careful pressure on the eyes, seeking to open the "[[third eye]]" after a long period of training and practice. This is comparable to similar [[tantra|Tantric]] practices. "Sound" involves positioning the hands over the ears and temples, with the goal of hearing the "heavenly music". This is reported to be related to sabda-[[brahman]] meditation. "Name", or "Word", is a meditation concentrating on breath. Kranenborg additionally states that it employs mantras while exhaling. "Nectar" involves tongue positioning, eventually leading the student to taste the "nectar of life". Michael Drury, describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop "a deep and spiritual self-knowledge." &lt;ref name="Drury"/&gt;

Another description including the details of the four techniques of knowledge is provided by [[Daniel Kriegman|Dr. Daniel Kriegman]] who describes the recruitment process utilized by the Divine Light Mission in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix A to Dr. Kriegman's doctoral thesis describes [http://www.yoism.org/pdf/premie_recruitment.pdf the recruitment process] by which followers were inducted into Guru Mahara Ji's Divine Light Mission.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience==

[[Jeffrey K. Hadden]] cites Prem Rawat in saying that  "Knowledge is a way to be able to take all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you... What you are looking for is inside of you."&lt;ref name=Hadden/&gt;

Glen Whitaker, former national organizer of [[Elan Vital (organization)|Elan Vital]] in the UK, said "That which we seek is already within us. The process of reaching it is one of learning to experience what is already there. It is one the individual needs to perform for him — or herself, with the guidance and help of the teacher".&lt;ref name=Barret/&gt;

According to [[George D. Chryssides]], this Knowledge was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine, and that Prem Rawat emphasizes that Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George D.  ''Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements'' pp.210-1, Scarecrow Press (2001) {{ISBN|0-8108-4095-2}} &lt;br /&gt;"Maharaji [Prem Rawat] progressively dissolved the Divine Light Mission, closing the ashrams, affirming his own status as a master rather than a divine leader, and emphasizing that the Knowledge is universal, non Indian, in nature"[...] "This Knowledge was self-understanding, yielding calmness, peace, and contentment, since the innermost self is identical with the divine. Knowledge is attained through initiation, which provides four techniques that allow the practitioner to go within.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen J. Hunt]] "the major focus of Prem Rawat is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's "own nature." The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full."&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual. The techniques are to be practised privately, with no social structure or hierarchy related to their practice. According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved, but Prem Rawat instructs them to practise the techniques daily for at least one hour to fully benefit from them. They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on or relationship to a student's gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status or national origin. [[Elan Vital (organization)|Elan Vital]], the organization that succeeded the Divine Light Mission, also states that practice of Knowledge will not affect a person's religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elanvital.org/faq/faq_knowledge_e.htm FAQs about Knowledge] Elan Vital website, August 2005. Retrieved November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge sessions==
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his instructors (called [[Mahatma]]s in India) conducted these sessions face-to-face with small groups.

Wim Haan, a student of theology who belonged to a critical movement within the [[Roman Catholic]] Church, wrote that receiving Knowledge involved a formal initiation that the aspirant had to keep secret and that he believed that the reason for the secrecy was a direct connection between the techniques, the initiation and the need to live a life of devotion to Rawat. Haan, who did not receive the techniques of Knowledge, also wrote that the fact that other groups may also use the same techniques would probably not help to increase the interest in them. Haan wrote this article based on observations of the Dutch branch of the defunct DLM between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref name=Haan/&gt;

===Video===
As of 2001 the techniques are taught via a multimedia presentation made by Prem Rawat. It is available in more than 50 languages (of which he speaks five himself: [[English (language)|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese]], [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] and [[Italian (language)|Italian]]. The other languages are dubbed). In this presentation, Prem Rawat explains the techniques step-by-step, demonstrating them in ample detail, to ensure that these are understood and practised correctly. The process takes 2½ hours, of which one hour is dedicated to practicing the techniques, 15 minutes each. Before the presentation starts, people hear Prem Rawat asking for three promises: a) to keep in touch, b) to give Knowledge a fair chance, and c) to not to share these techniques with anyone. He then asks attendees to stay and receive "the gift of Knowledge" if they agree with these three promises.&lt;ref name=promises /&gt;

The Knowledge Sessions are facilitated by volunteers who operate the video equipment and ensure the comfort of the attendees and assist them if needed. Knowledge Sessions are available throughout the year in most Western countries. In India, due to the large numbers, there are Knowledge Sessions every day of the year. In special cases, such as people in hospitals, or bed-ridden, etc., the volunteers go to the people to conduct the Session.

In 2005, Prem Rawat further developed his teaching style by introducing [http://thekeys.maharaji.net/home  The Keys], a program of five DVD packs which prepare the student for receiving Knowledge. The techniques are taught in Key Six. Prem Rawat advises students that for maximum benefit the techniques should be practised daily for at least one hour.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, ''Encyclopedia of American Religions.'' &lt;br /&gt;"Maharaji had made every attempt to abandon the traditional Indian religious trappings in which the techniques originated and to make his presentation acceptable to all the various cultural settings in which followers live. He sees his teachings as independent of culture, religion, beliefs, or lifestyles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, Christopher Partridge (Eds.), ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities.'' pp.201-202, Oxford University Press, USA (2004) {{ISBN|978-0-19-522042-1}}. &lt;br /&gt;"Prem Rawat is insistent that it is not the product of any one culture or the property of any religious tradition and that it can be practiced by anyone. Consequently, Maharaji asserts that he is not teaching a religion and there are no particular rituals, sacred days, pilgrimages, sacred places, doctrines, scriptures or specific dress codes, dietary requirements or any other dimension associated with a religious lifestyle."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geaves, Ron, ''Globalization, Charisma, Innovation, and Tradition.''&lt;br /&gt; "He does not demand obedience, in that no outer requirements or prohibitions are placed on those taught the techniques. The simple axiom, 'If you like it, practice it, if you don’t, try something else,' is applied on frequent occasions in his public discourses. Neither does Prem Rawat regard himself as an exemplary leader, a role often ascribed to religious founders."&lt;/ref&gt;

Whoever has no illusions can have Knowledge.” “No one can reach God without devotion to Satguru.

&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Manav Utthan Sewa Samiti"&gt;''Manav Utthan Sewa Samiti''. Manavdharam [http://www.manavdharam.org/shjm/1_brief_into.html].&lt;br /&gt; "Shri Satpal Ji Maharaj, the teacher of Manav Dharam, travels constantly to inspire and encourage others to experience this inner force which is our true essence. He reveals the same techniques of spiritual insight to all, irrespective of nationality, caste or creed. Manav Dharam encompasses the teachings of all religions and is the source of them all. It is the eternal wisdom flowing from the practical Knowledge of the Soul." Man is essentially spirit, or in other words, consciousness. To know consciousness, to experience it and to realize it is the path of spiritual knowledge. Knowledge has two aspects- material and spiritual. In the material domain it is called 'Apara Vidya' and pertains to all physical and social sciences. In the spiritual domain it is called 'Para Vidya' and pertains to self-realization, the experience of the soul. Science of soul itself implies the science of universal life. The science of the spirit is a sovereign science, a sovereign secret, imperishable, supremely holy, most excellent, directly enjoyable, full of virtues and very easy to practise. It is itself both the means and the end - the immediate and the ultimate. It is all comprehensive and all-inclusive, and knowing it means nothing remains to be known. It is the saturation of the self, the merging of the individual self with the Cosmic Self. It cannot be achieved through senses, mind or intellect. It is experienced by the self through the self by the grace of the realized Master. Knowledge is the means, and Knowledge also is the destination. In Divine Knowledge there must be no duality. It is just one point.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teetotalism''' is the practice or promotion of complete personal [[abstinence]] from [[alcoholic beverage]]s. A person who practices (and possibly advocates) teetotalism is called a ''teetotaler'' (plural ''teetotalers'') or is simply said to be ''teetotal''.  The teetotalism movement was first started in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], England, in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Road to Zion - British Isles, BYU-TV; {{cite web |url=http://byutv.org/watch/801-207 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211095420/http://www.byutv.org/watch/801-207/ |archivedate=2011-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Preston Temperance Society was founded in 1833 by [[Joseph Livesey]], who was to become a leader of the [[temperance movement]] and the author of ''The Pledge'': "We agree to abstain from all liquors of an [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicating]] quality whether [[ale]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], [[wine]] or ardent [[Distilled beverage|spirit]]s, except as [[medicine]]."&lt;ref name="Gotham Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=May 2009|publisher=[[Gotham Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

There is some dispute over the origin of the word "teetotaler." One anecdote attributes the origin of the word to a meeting of the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston Temperance Society]] in 1833. The story attributes the word to Richard Turner,&lt;ref name="Gotham Books"/&gt; a member of the society, who in a speech said "I'll be reet down out-and-out t-t-total for ever and ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|title=Teetotal|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tee1.htm|publisher=worldwidewords.org|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter William Skeat]] noted that the Turner anecdote had been recorded by temperance advocate [[Joseph Livesey]], and posited that the term may have been inspired by the [[teetotum]];&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=OHkKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA628&amp;lpg=PA628&amp;dq=skeat+teetotum+teetotal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sB38SpoFIk&amp;sig=6wyTUUGvSM50nJaw-UnTVYQ4-Mo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilweyz6dTWAhUIwYMKHUt4A4QQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=skeat%20teetotum%20teetotal&amp;f=false An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language], by [[Walter William Skeat]]; published by [[Clarendon Press]], 1893&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[James B. Greenough]] stated that "nobody ever thought ''teetotum'' and ''teetotaler'' were etymologically connected."&lt;ref name=Greenough&gt;[https://arrow.latrobe.edu.au/store/3/4/5/9/3/public/B13517843.pdf ''Words and Their Ways''], by [[James B. Greenough]]; published 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the above account is found on the pages of ''The Charleston Observer'': 
{{cquote|''Teetotalers''.—The origin of this convenient word, (as convenient almost, although not so general in its application as ''loafer'',) is, we imagine, known but to few who use it. It originated, as we learn from the Landmark, with a man named Turner, a member of the Preston Temperance Society, who, having an impediment of speech, in addressing a meeting remarked, that partial abstinence from intoxicating liquors would not do; they must insist upon tee-tee-(stammering) tee total abstinence. Hence total abstainers have been called ''teetotalers.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Charleston Observer'' vol. 10, no. 44 (29 October 1836): 174, columns 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}

An alternative explanation is that ''teetotal'' is simply a [[reduplication]] of the first "T" in ''total'' (T-total). It is said that as early as 1827 in some Temperance Societies signing a "T" after one's name signified one's pledge for total abstinence.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=t&amp;p=5|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - T, page 5|accessdate=2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England in the 1830s, when the word first entered the lexicon, it was also used in other contexts as an emphasized form of ''total''; a comparable [[American English]] locution would be "total with a capital T" (an instance of the "[word] with a capital [word-initial letter]" [[snowclone]]).

According to historian Daniel Walker Howe (''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848'', 2007) the term was derived from the practice of American preacher and temperance advocate [[Lyman Beecher]].  He would take names at his meetings of people who pledged alcoholic temperance and noted those who pledged total abstinence with a T.  Such persons became known as ''Teetotallers''.

==Reasons and justifications==
Some common reasons for choosing teetotalism are [[psychological]], [[religious]], [[health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/news/a40745/health-benefits-give-up-drinking-alcohol/|title=6 great things that happen to your body when you give up drinking|date=20 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, medical, [[family|familial]], [[philosophical]], social, past [[alcoholism]], or sometimes it is simply a matter of taste or preference.  When at [[bar (establishment)|drinking establishments]], teetotalers (or teetotallers) either abstain from drinking completely, or consume [[non-alcoholic beverage]]s such as water, juice, tea, coffee, non-alcoholic [[soft drink]]s, [[non-alcoholic beverages|virgin drinks, mocktails]], and [[Low-alcohol beer|alcohol-free beer]].

Most{{cn|date=September 2017}} teetotaler organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants.

== Organized religion ==
{{main article|Religion and alcohol}}

Abstention from alcohol is a tenet of a number of religious faiths, including [[Hinduism|Hinduism]], such as [[Swaminarayan_(spiritual_tradition)|the Swaminarayans]]; [[Sikhism]]; [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]]; [[Jainism|Jains]]; and [[Meivazhi|Meivazhi-ites]].

"[[Khamr]]" is the term for all intoxicants which are prohibited in [[Islam]]. (See {{slink|Religion and alcohol|Islam}})

Similarly, one of the [[five precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] is abstaining from intoxicating substances that disturb the peace and self-control of the mind, but it is formulated as a training rule to be assumed voluntarily rather than as a commandment.

A number of Christian denominations also forbid the consumption of alcohol, including the [[Amish]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], Mennonites (both [[Old Order Mennonite|Old Order]] and [[Conservative Mennonites|Conservative]]), [[Church of the Brethren]] members, and [[Christian Scientists]].  Many Christian groups, such as [[United Methodist Church|Methodists]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], and [[Quaker]]s, are often associated with teetotalism due to their traditionally strong support for [[temperance movement]]s and [[prohibition]]. However, tenets forbidding the consumption of alcohol are variably practiced. For example, [[Church of the Nazarene]], an offshoot of Methodism does teach abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017-2021 Manual|url=http://www.nazarene.org/sites/default/files/docs/GenSec/Manual/2017%20-2021%20Manual|publisher=Church of the Nazarene|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Christian denominations, abstinence is not a religious requirement, but the tradition is strong enough to make ritual and recreational alcohol consumption a controversial issue among members. Members of the [[Salvation Army]] make a promise on joining the movement to observe lifelong abstinence from alcohol. The [[Catholic Church]], [[Orthodox church]]es, and [[Anglicanism]] all require wine in their central religious rite of the [[eucharist]], and while many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches often allow grape juice or alcohol-free wine in their communion services, only a few Protestants require a non-alcoholic beverage as official policy. (See [[Christianity and alcohol]].)

Many members of these religious groups are also required to refrain from selling such products. A translation of the [[New Testament]], the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], translates in a way that promotes teetotalism.

== Research on non-drinkers ==
Dominic Conroy and Richard de Visser published research in ''Psychology and Health'' which studied strategies used by college students who would like to resist peer pressure to drink alcohol in social settings. The research hinted that students are less likely to give in to peer pressure if they have strong friendships and make a decision not to drink before social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conroy    | first1 = Dominic | last2 = de Visser | first2 = Richard | journal = Psychology and Health | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 536–551

Caroline H. McClave published a comparison of three studies entitled ''Asexuality as a Spectrum: A National Probability Sample Comparison to the Sexual Community in the UK''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | title = Asexuality as a Spectrum: A National Probability Sample Comparison to the Sexual Community in the UK | url = http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac%3A162382}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that [[asexuality|asexuals]] and [[Gray asexuality|gray-asexuals]] drank significantly less and were more likely to abstain from drinking than the people not of those [[Sexual orientation|sexual orientations]].

A 2015 study by the [[Office for National Statistics]] showed that young Britons were more likely to be teetotalers than their parents.&lt;ref name="nevilleftyoungbritons"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neville|first1=Sarah|title=Young Britons turning teetotal in growing numbers, survey says|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2804037a-b38a-11e4-9449-00144feab7de|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=Financial Times|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, increased teetotalism within a family was associated with a lower level of alcoholism and vice versa. This suggests there is an inverse relationship between teetotalism and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1971-27103-001|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==

In the first chapter of the book, Richard Dawkins explains what he means with the title ''The Magic of Reality'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''The Magic of Reality'', [[Black Swan (imprint)|Black Swan]] ([[Transworld Publishers]]), 2012, pages 19, 21 and 31-32 ({{ISBN|978-0-552-77890-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|Magic is a slippery word: it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic'. [...] What I hope to show you in this book is that reality&amp;nbsp;– the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science&amp;nbsp;– is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense. [...] In the rest of this book I want to show you that the real world, as understood scientifically, has magic of its own&amp;nbsp;– the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. Next to the true beauty and magic of the real world, supernatural spells and stage tricks seem cheap and tawdry by comparison. The magic of reality is neither supernatural nor a trick, but&amp;nbsp;– quite simply&amp;nbsp;– wonderful. Wonderful, and real. Wonderful ''because'' real.}}

==Synopsis==
Most chapters begin with brief re-tellings of [[list of creation myths|creation myths]] that emerged as attempts to explain the origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including [[Mesopotamian religion|Babylonian]], [[Christianity and Judaism|Judeo-Christian]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Māori mythology|Maori]], [[Ancient Egyptian]], [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian Aboriginal]], [[Norse mythology|Nordic]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenic]], [[Pangu|Chinese]], [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]], and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary [[alien abduction|alien-abduction]] mythology; Chapter 4 ("What are things made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical [[microscope|magnification equipment]], any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits his childhood and recalls his initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by his young contemporaries. Dawkins gives his critique of many of the myths, such as when he points out that much mythology involves some god's symbolic transgressive act performed just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.

In the opening chapter Dawkins explains that although mythic narratives and make-believe are fun parts of growing up, reality&amp;nbsp;— with its fundamental capacity for beauty&amp;nbsp;— is much more magical than anything impossible. The Fairy Godmother from [[Cinderella]] cannot magically turn a pumpkin into a carriage outside the bounds of fiction, because pumpkins and carriages possess internal organisation that is fundamentally [[Complexity|complex]]. A large pumpkin randomly reassembled at the most minute level would be much more likely to result in a featureless pile of ash or sludge than in a complex and intricately organised carriage.

In the subsequent chapters Dawkins addresses topics that range from [[evolutionary biology]] and [[speciation]] to physical phenomena such as [[atomic theory]], [[optics]], [[planetary motion]], [[gravitation]], [[stellar evolution]], [[spectroscopy]], and [[plate tectonics]], as well as speculation on [[exobiology]]. Dawkins characterises his understanding of [[quantum mechanics]] as foggy&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
and so declines to delve very far into that topic. Dawkins declares that there was no first person, to make the point that evolutionary biologists use the term ''species'' to demark differences in gene composition&amp;nbsp;— over often thousands of generations of separation&amp;nbsp;— rather than from any one generation to the next. To illustrate this he undertakes a thought-experiment involving family photographs. If, hypothetically, there existed a complete set of photographs of all one's direct male ancestors arranged in order of birth date (or hatch date) from youngest to oldest stretching back millions of generations, from one generation to the next one would not perceive much difference between any two adjacent pictures—looking at a picture of one's grandfather or great-grandfather one is looking at a picture of a human—but if one looked at a picture from 185 million generations back one would see an image of some kind of fish-like animal. Dawkins stresses this point by saying the offspring of any sexually reproducing life form belongs in almost all cases to the same ''species'' as do its parents, with the exception of unviable [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] such as [[mule]]s.

The last two chapters discuss [[Chaos theory|chaos]] and the human [[psychology]] behind so-called [[miracle]] claims such as the examples of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] and the [[Cottingley Fairies]]. Dawkins presents philosopher [[David Hume]]'s argument that miracle claims should only be seriously accepted if it would be a bigger miracle that the claimant was either lying or mistaken. Dawkins regards miracle claims written down in texts subsequently deemed sacred as not exempt from this standard.

==Reception==
[[Tim Radford]], in his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review, calls the presentation of the physical book "prodigiously illustrated and beautifully designed", and regarding the content says "it is a distillation of so much that Dawkins has written and argued since the publication of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' ... The strength is that he knows his ground. The weakness is that&amp;nbsp;– for a 'family audience'&amp;nbsp;– he deliberately constrains his vocabulary along with the exuberant imagery and belligerence that made his reputation from the start."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radford|first=Tim|title=The Magic of Reality by Richard Dawkins – review: A brilliant introduction to science for children|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/21/richard-dawkins-magic-reality-review?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Scientist]]'' article collates the reviews of Andy Coghlan and those of his 20-year-old daughter Phoebe and his 13-year-old son Callum. Coghlan calls the book "a triumph" but wishes Dawkins had a chapter entitled "Why do people do bad things to others?" saying "The book provides a golden opportunity for Dawkins to ask whether we can evolve to treat one another more civilly. Alas, he doesn't seize it." Coghlan also supports Dawkins "encouraging readers to be bowled over by the stunning beauty of reality&amp;nbsp;– a sentiment I thoroughly support. Too few of us wake up each day and reflect on how amazing it is that we are not only alive, but aware of being alive." Phoebe liked the book, she writes "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life. The vibrant illustrations reinforce this, as do the fun font styles... His style is colloquial, creating a relaxed, lighter tone." Callum, who is closest to the intended age for the book, doesn't need to be persuaded about the bounds of reality, he writes: "Miracles don't exist. Simple as that. ''The Magic of Reality'' hasn't changed my views on anything."&lt;ref name = "new scientist"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coghlan|first1=Andy|author2=Phoebe Coghlan &amp; Callum Coghlan|title=A Dawkins family affair: Andy Coghlan and his children review the latest offering from arch-atheist Richard Dawkins: ''The God Delusion'' in teen-friendly form|journal=New Scientist|date=17 September 2011|volume=21|issue=2830|url= https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2011/09/bringing-dawkins-home-to-the-kids.html|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville Hawcock for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' praises Dawkins' clarity in explanation: "He really is very good at this. The chapter on rainbows has the clearest explanation of how they appear that I’ve ever seen." Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are not up to the job of accounting for reality but at least give McKean some great subject matter."&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawcock|first=Neville|title=The Magic of Reality|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e7ffbf28-ea81-11e0-b0f5-00144feab49a.html#axzz1ZTJ0nROy|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' says: "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish your children to have of the cosmos, then ''The Magic of Reality'' will suit you very well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox Gurdon|first=Meghan|title=Natural Enchantment|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204422404576597143620504666?mod=googlenews_wsj|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=1 October 2011|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130412044710/http://online.wsj.com/article/APb1485ec9c39b451e9849280550298743.html|archivedate=12 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wyndgate Country Club controversy==
During Richard Dawkins' October 2011 book tour, its sponsor [[Center for Inquiry]] signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site. After seeing an interview with Dawkins on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance.

'''"Usermontu"''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies|mummy]] exhibited at the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]] of [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name=c&gt;Caption of the remains, from the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum (inv. No: RC 1779).&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Usermontu'' – which means, "Powerful is [[Montu]]" – almost certainly does not match the still-unknown name originally belonged to the mummified man. The mistake arose because long after death the mummy was placed in a [[coffin]] originally belonged to another man, a priest named Usermontu, and was still inside of it at the time of rediscovery.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mummy is very well preserved, and is also known for having an ancient but sophisticated [[prosthetic]] pin in its left knee.

==History==
In 1971 the Rosicrucian Museum acquired two sealed ancient Egyptian coffins from [[Neiman-Marcus]]. Unbeknownst to all, one of the coffin still contained the mummy which was discovered soon after the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hillinger |first=Charles |date=May 31, 1988 |title=Mummy Just Spent 50 Years in Attic : At 3500, She's All Wrapped Up in California

For a reason that remains unknown to us, several centuries after death his corpse was put inside the coffin of the “real” Usermontu who lived during the [[26th Dynasty]]. Some time around 400 BCE, as suggested by [[radiocarbon dating]], the body underwent another wrapping with [[linen]] bandages which are still visible today.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no clue of where the coffin and the mummy originally came from. In life the man should have been a natural [[red hair|redhead]]&lt;ref name=c/&gt; and his mummy is about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

===Prosthetic pin===
In August 1995 [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] professor [[C. Wilfred Griggs]] performed some [[Radiography|X-ray scan]]s on the Rosicrucian mummies and discovered the presence of a {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[Implant (medicine)|iron-made orthopedic screw]] inside “Usermontu”'s left knee. Griggs initially believed that the pin was inserted in modern times in order to reattach the leg to the rest of the body, so he later obtained permission to unwrap the leg and directly examine the pin in order to solve the mystery.&lt;ref name=byu/&gt; After the examination Griggs realized that the pin could not be inserted in modern times, and must have been placed after the man's death but before his burial, a hypothesis confirmed by further analysis. The pin was held in place by an organic resin, analogous to modern [[bone cement]]. By doing so, those who performed the operation ensured the integrity of the body, required for the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife|ancient Egyptian afterlife]].&lt;ref name=byu&gt;{{cite web |url=https://magazine.byu.edu/article/byu-professor-finds-evidence-of-advanced-surgery-in-ancient-mummy/ |title= BYU professor finds evidence of advanced surgery in ancient mummy |last=Snow |first=Karen |publisher=Brigham Young University |date= June 1996 |website=BYU Magazine |access-date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships''''' is a 1999 book by [[Eric Ludy|Eric]] and [[Leslie Ludy]], an American married couple. After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market, the book was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009. It tells the story of the authors' first meeting, [[courtship]], and marriage. The authors advise [[Single person|single people]] not to be [[Physical intimacy|physically]] or [[Emotional intimacy|emotionally intimate]] with others, but to wait for the spouse that [[Will of God|God has planned]] for them. The first edition was packaged with a [[CD single]] by the Ludys: "Faithfully", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book.

The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie wrote seven, as well as the introduction. The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's [[Personal god#Christianity|relationship with God]]. Leslie writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly [[Chastity|unchaste]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]] individuals.

Other American Christian authors, such as [[Mark Matlock]] and [[Jason Evert]], wrote highly of ''When God Writes Your Love Story''. Leah Andrews of the ''Lewiston Morning Tribune'' compared ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to other popular Christian books providing alternatives to [[dating]], including [[Joshua Harris (pastor)|Joshua Harris]]'s ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship|Boy Meets Girl]]''. [[Eastern University (United States)|Eastern University]] Christian studies professors Margaret and Dwight Peterson responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story," in which the Petersons argue that the book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment. Rick Holland, an instructor at [[The Master's College and Seminary]] and pastor of College and Student Ministries at [[Grace Community Church (California)|Grace Community Church]], criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on [[anecdote]]s and not enough on the [[Bible]].

==Background==
''When God Writes Your Love Story'', first published in the United States in 1999,&lt;ref name=Primary&gt;Ludy and Ludy (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  is the third book written by [[Eric Ludy|Eric]] and [[Leslie Ludy]], an American married couple.&lt;ref&gt;Raunikar (2000), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Ludys' previous two books, ''His Perfect Faithfulness: The Story of our Courtship'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Romance God's Way'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; its major themes are [[Romance (love)|romance]] and [[Christianity]]; it tells the story of the authors' first meeting, [[courtship]], and marriage.&lt;ref name=Charisma&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]]|title=Voices of a New Generation|author=Adrienne Gaines|date=October 31, 2008|url=http://www.charismamag.com/life/culture/2714-voices-of-a-new-generation|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a bestseller on the Christian book market,&lt;ref name=Charisma/&gt; ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' was republished in 2004 and then revised and expanded in 2009.&lt;ref name=Ludy&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 350,000 copies were sold worldwide by 2009.&lt;ref name=Ludy/&gt; Translations of the book have been published in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2006), ''Cuando Dios Escribe Tu Historia de Amor''.&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2005), ''Wenn Gott deine Liebesgeschichte schreibt''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric and Leslie Ludy met when Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16.&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2005), ''Teaching True Love to a Sex-at-13 Generation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singled/&gt; They pursued a [[friendship]] for several months before starting to court,&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (1999), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who is Eric Ludy? |publisher=Ellerslie |url=http://ericludy.com/ |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728124659/http://ericludy.com/ |archivedate=July 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''When God Writes Your Love Story'', the Ludys advise [[Single person|single people]] not to be [[Physical intimacy|physically]] or [[Emotional intimacy|emotionally intimate]] with others, but to wait for the [[life partner]] that [[Will of God|God has planned]] for them;&lt;ref name=Grayson/&gt; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate.&lt;ref name=demoss279/&gt; Also focusing on premarital [[Promiscuity#Human promiscuity|physical]] and [[Emotional promiscuity|emotional]] purity,&lt;ref name=demoss279&gt;DeMoss and Gresh (2007), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; the authors do not discuss the physical processes of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Manila Times]]|author=RJ Ledesma|title=Playing with my Tools Pickled Parts|date=November 6, 2005|url=http://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9DAL000300&amp;an=MANI000020060111e1b60000k&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool in the creation of the reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.&lt;ref&gt;Irby (2013), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the book's release, it was [[Testimonial|endorsed]] by Leslie and [[Les Parrott]], authors of ''[[Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts]]''; [[Beverly LaHaye]] of [[Concerned Women for America]]; and Joe White, President of Kanakuk Kamps.&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt; The first edition was packaged with a [[CD single]] by the Ludys: "Faithfully", a song they had written specifically to accompany the book, with lyrics discussing the beauty of having a life partner.&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2006), ''A Perfect Wedding'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, "Desiring a Love Story", addresses [[sexual desire]] and [[lovesickness]], suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of [[fidelity]] to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of [[sexual abstinence]] and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is never too late to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.

Early in the book, Eric retells a portion of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', describing the episode in which [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] sails near the land of the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s: creatures whose song so attracts seafarers that they sail towards them and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with [[beeswax]] and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source. Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of [[Orpheus]]'s encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a "sweeter song" than that of the Sirens;&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; his ship also passes unharmed, his men so entranced by his song that they do not notice the Sirens. Eric then [[Argument from analogy|argues from analogy]] that, normally, those who force themselves to resist [[premarital sex]]ual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for [[marriage]] much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). Eric expands on the concept of the "sweeter song" throughout the book and often refers to it. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is "the beautiful side of love";&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; the Ludys use this phrase to refer to a lasting, satisfying romance and contrast this state with such other experiences as [[breakup]]s, [[unrequited love]], and [[sexual frustration]].

The Ludys argue that one's love life should be both guided by and subordinate to one's [[Personal god#Christianity|relationship with God]]. They suggest that, "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry&amp;nbsp;... is alive and wandering the earth" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludys contest the definition of "true love" as an emotion; instead, they define "true love" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied&amp;nbsp;... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others&amp;nbsp;... our deepest needs are met as well!"&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (2009), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving physical or emotional intimacy (or both) result in long-term [[psychological pain]] and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the [[Greek myths|Greek myth]] of the [[suitors of Penelope]], in which [[Penelope]], whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of [[marriage proposal]]s until Ulysses returns and kills the suitors. Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that [[selfless service]] is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that she is commonly asked the question "How will I know when a relationship is from God?" and her response is that people are likelier to recognize that a relationship is from God when they have a "team&amp;nbsp;... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Ludy and Ludy (1999), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other [[Christian]]s of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to formerly [[Chastity|unchaste]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]] individuals.

===Discussions of context===

[[File:Joshua Harris cropped.png|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of a bald man facing right and looking right while covering his mouth with his left hand and wearing a dress shirt all on a black background|''When God Writes Your Love Story'' is often compared to books by [[Joshua Harris (pastor)|Joshua Harris]] ''(pictured)'', such as ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship|Boy Meets Girl]]''.]]

''When God Writes Your Love Story'' is a popular Christian book that provides alternatives to [[dating]]. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the ''Lewiston Morning Tribune'' compared the book to [[Joshua Harris (pastor)|Joshua Harris]]'s ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship|Boy Meets Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Lewiston Morning Tribune|title=Relearning the dating game|author=Leah Andrews|date=March 31, 2002|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. [[Christine Gardner]], a communications professor at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Religion &amp; Politics|author=Amy Frykholm|title=Can Sex Sell Abstinence?|date=May 21, 2012|url=http://religionandpolitics.org/2012/05/21/can-sex-sell-abstinence/|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigates such teachings in ''[[Making Chastity Sexy|Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns]]'', and discusses the Ludys' book as part of this investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and "desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks." Gardner argues that the result "was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (2011), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''Critical Research on Religion'', Courtney Ann Irby of [[Loyola University Chicago]] writes that the Ludys disparage secular [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] as overtly sexual and thus an obstacle to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and [[hookup culture]] is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, since the publication of the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of [[casual sex]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Irby180/&gt; Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own [[personal experience]] as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Irby (2013), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] books about premarital romantic relationships, such as [[Dannah Gresh]]'s ''And the Bride Wore White'', [[Elisabeth Elliot]]'s ''[[Passion and Purity]]'' and ''Quest for Love'', [[Don Raunikar]]'s ''Choosing God's Best'', Ben Young's and Sam Adams' ''The Ten Commandments of Dating'', Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's ''Boundaries in Dating'', Alex Chediak's ''5 Paths to the Love of Your Life'', and Joshua Harris's ''I Kissed Dating Goodbye'' and ''Boy Meets Girl''.&lt;ref name=Irby180&gt;Irby (2013), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colón and Bonnie E. Field suggest that older singles are unlikely to gather hope from their story.]]

Christine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two single women in their thirties,&lt;ref&gt;Colón and Field (2009), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed their frustrations with the Ludys' book in ''Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church''.&lt;ref name=Singled/&gt; Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Christine Colón, Ph.D.|publisher=[[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/C/Christine-Colon|accessdate=July 8, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805112354/http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/C/Christine-Colon|archivedate=August 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Field, a former English professor at [[Wayland Baptist University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bonnie E.

They argue that "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Cymbeline]]'', which states "the more delay'd, delighted."&lt;ref name=Singled/&gt; ''Singled Out'' suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.&lt;ref name=Singled/&gt;

Colón and Field compare ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to [[Derek Prince]]'s ''God Is a Matchmaker'', and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their [[soulmate]]s quickly, while requiring others to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Colón and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that doing so [[Test (assessment)|tests]] one's [[faith]] and that "God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose."&lt;ref name=Singled&gt;Colón and Field (2009), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

They responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story." They write therein that, while they read ''When God Writes Your Love Story'', "it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage."&lt;ref name=Peterson84/&gt; In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy often results in disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; While referencing ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that "it is the entire genre that is problematic."&lt;ref name=Peterson84&gt;Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] they do quote and he argued that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound&lt;ref&gt;Holland (2005), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; and that their story is an encouraging one.&lt;ref&gt;Holland (2005), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

''When God Writes Your Love Story'' was received positively by some American Christian authors. In ''Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom'', [[Mark Matlock]], an [[Ordination|ordained]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Baptist Standard |title=Many teens dabbling in psychics and the occult, youth study finds |author=John Hall |date=October 28, 2002 |url=http://assets.baptiststandard.com/archived/2002/10_28/print/matlock_occult.html |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316050918/http://assets.baptiststandard.com/archived/2002/10_28/print/matlock_occult.html |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[youth pastor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Baptist Press]] |author=Shannon Baker |date=January 24, 2002 |title=Youth ministers challenged to color outside the lines |url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=12603 |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316054243/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=12603 |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recommends ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid.&lt;ref&gt;Matlock (2005), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Evert]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] author and chastity speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130306/LIVING/303069995/1008|title=Noted chastity speaker will present programs here Thursday and Friday|date=March 6, 2013|work=[[The News-Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923024710/http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20130306%2FLIVING%2F303069995%2F1008|archivedate=September 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote positively of ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in his book ''If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity''. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to [[Voice of God|God's voice]] in seeking discernment about romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Evert (2003), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in ''If You Really Loved Me'', Evert praises a passage from ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Evert (2003), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have also noted the song "Faithfully" that accompanied the book. The Petersons criticized it, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of unachievable perfection in their future marriage and spouse.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Peterson (2009), pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity'', Brienne Murk, a [[Christian music]]ian and [[Public speaking|public speaker]], identifies "Faithfully" as one of her favourite songs.&lt;ref&gt;Murk (2011), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''22 and Single: A Coming of Age Story'', Katie Kiesler wrote that, after reading the first chapter of ''When God Writes Your Love Story'', she stopped because "it was too hard to hear about the wonderful way in which God brought another perfect couple together — because it wasn't happening for me."&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler (2012), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that her friends kept recommending the book to her, even after she had tried starting it. She eventually decided that the reason she didn't like the book was her own [[selfishness]] in seeking to fulfill her own desires rather than leaving her desires for God to work out.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler (2012), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; She then read the book again, and wrote that God used her reading of it to make her thankful for her time as a single person. She also wrote that she found the book to be "mostly about letting God's love overflow into all areas of your life rather than tales of perfect Christian couples."&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012,&lt;ref name=Grayson/&gt; Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an [[United States pro-life movement|American pro-life]] [[crisis pregnancy center]] operated by Christians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Record|author=DeAnna Lasley|date=February 22, 2012|title=Help for unplanned pregnancy offered|url=http://www.graysonrecord.com/content/help-unplanned-pregnancy-offered|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Grayson County, Kentucky|Grayson County]], [[Kentucky]], offered a course on the topic of sexual [[integrity]] that employed ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and two other [[Christian literature|Christian books]] as its basis, the other two being [[Gary Chapman (author)|Gary Chapman]]'s ''[[The Five Love Languages]]'' and Bill and Pam Farrel's ''[[Men Are Like Waffles — Women Are Like Spaghetti|Single Men Are Like Waffles — Single Women Are Like Spaghetti]]''.&lt;ref name=Grayson&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Grayson County News Gazette]]|author=Rebecca Morris|title=Courses offered on male/female relationships|date=July 16, 2012|url=http://www.gcnewsgazette.com/view/full_story/19332366/article-Courses-offered-on-male-female-relationships?instance=commented|accessdate=March 18, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411001946/http://www.gcnewsgazette.com/view/full_story/19332366/article-Courses-offered-on-male-female-relationships?instance=commented|archivedate=April 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3959">'''Wilhelm Bousset''' (3 September 1865, [[Lübeck]] – 8 March 1920, [[Gießen]]) was a German [[theologian]] and [[New Testament]] scholar. He was of [[Huguenot]] ancestry and a native of [[Lübeck]].

==Biography==
He began his studies at the [[University of Erlangen]], where he met [[Ernst Troeltsch]] (1865–1923), with whom he would maintain a friendship that would last throughout his career. Later on, he studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], where he was student of [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851–1930), and afterwards continued his education at the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 1890 he became a professor of [[New Testament]] exegesis at [[Göttingen]], later relocating to the [[University of Giessen]] (1916).

Bousset was a prominent figure in the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' ([[history of religions school]]), a group that included scholars such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), [[Albert Eichhorn]] (1856–1926) and [[Hermann Gunkel]] (1862–1932). His better known work involved comparative studies between the [[Early Christian Church]] and other religious beliefs, particularly [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. Bousset demonstrated in his writings that Christian thought was profoundly influenced by neighboring cultures and belief systems.

== Publications ==
Bousset was a prolific writer, and among his books that were translated into English were ''Kyrios Christos: Geschichte des Christusglaubens von den Anfängen des Christentums bis Irenäus'' (Kyrios Christos; A History of the Belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] from the Beginnings of [[Christianity]] to [[Irenaeus]]), and ''Der Antichrist in Der Uberlieferung Des Judentums, Des Neuen Testaments Und Der Alten Kirche'' ([[Antichrist]] Legend: A Chapter in Christian and Jewish Folklore). Other noted works by Bousset include:
* ''Jesu Predigt in ihrem Gegensatz zum Judentum. Ein religionsgeschichtlicher Vergleich'' (1893).
* [https://archive.org/stream/derantichristin01bousgoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''Der Antichrist in der Ueberlieferung des Judentums, des neuen Testaments und der alten Kirche''] (1895).
* [https://archive.org/details/dieoffenbarungj00bousgoog ''Offenbarung Johannis (Kritisch-Exegetischer Kommentar Über Das Neue Testament)''] (1896).
* Contributions to the ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'' (1903).
* ''Die Religion des Judentums im neutestamentlichen Zeitalter'' (1903).
* ''Das Wesen Der Religion Dargestellt an Ihrer Geschichte'' (1904).
* ''Wilhelm Bousset, Was Wissen Wir von Jesus?'' (1904)
* ''Hauptprobleme Der Gnosis'' (1907).
* Contributions to "[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]".
* ''Kyrios Christos. Geschichte des Christusglaubens von den Anfängen des Christentums bis Irenaeus'', (1913).
