      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8662">{{short description|The partitioning of a seabed acoustic image into discrete physical entities or classes}}
{{No footnotes|date=March 2015}}
'''Acoustic seabed classification''' is the partitioning of a [[seabed]] acoustic [[image]] into discrete physical entities or classes. This is a particularly active area of development in the field of [[hydrographic surveying|seabed mapping]], [[geophysics|marine geophysics]], [[underwater acoustics]] and benthic '''[http://www.searchmesh.net/default.aspx?page=1654 habitat mapping]'''. Seabed [[classification in machine learning| classification]] is one route to characterizing the seabed and its [[habitats]]. '''Seabed characterization''' makes the link between the classified regions and the seabed physical, geological, chemical or biological properties. Acoustic seabed classification is possible using a wide range of [[sonar|acoustic imaging]] systems including [[multibeam echosounders]], [[sidescan sonar]],  [[scientific echosounder|single-beam echosounders]], [[interferometric]] systems and [[sonar|sub-bottom profilers]]. Seabed classification based on acoustic properties can be divided into two main categories; surficial seabed classification and sub-surface seabed classification. Sub-surface imaging technologies use lower [[frequency]] [[sound]] to provide higher penetration, whereas surficial imaging technologies provide higher resolution imagery by utilizing higher frequencies (especially in shallow water).

==Surficial seabed classification==
===Classification methods===
Surficial seabed classification is concerned primarily with distinguishing marine [[benthic]] habitat characteristics (e.g. hard, soft, rough, smooth, [[mud]], [[sand]], [[clay]], [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]) of the surveyed area. [[Multibeam echosounders]], [[sidescan sonar]] systems and [https://dx.doi.org/10.4031/002533201788058053 acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS)] are the most commonly used technologies. The use of optical sensors has been restricted to depths less than 40&amp;nbsp;m due to absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by water. Despite this limitation, processing tools have been developed to classify data acquired using airborne bathymetric [[LiDAR]] systems.&lt;ref name="classify"&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/Xxxviii/part1/03/03_01_Paper_153.pdf  Radiometric Calibration of Airborne LIDAR Intensity Data for Land Cover Classification], by Wai Yeung Yan &amp; Ahmed Shaker&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, acoustics remain the preferred method of imaging the seafloor because data can be acquired over a much larger area (than in-situ sampling) from almost any depth.

Multibeam systems acquire both [[bathymetry]] (depth) and [[backscatter]] (intensity) data. Multibeam backscatter was previously considered to be a by-product of a multibeam survey, with bathymetry being the primary information. Recent advances in multibeam backscatter processing and analysis methods have increased the range of applications for which multibeam systems can be used. New methods of analyzing backscatter data, have increased its potential for seabed characterization. Backscatter data resolution has also increased significantly with the introduction of snippet data. Snippet data is raw backscatter time-series data for each beam footprint and each ping [https://web.archive.org/web/20120329110211/http://www.fugro-pelagos.com/papers/newdevinmulitbeambackscatter/tgpi_backscatter.htm (Lockhart et. al., 2007)]. These advances have allowed some multibeam backscatter data to achieve a quality comparable to that of sidescan sonar imagery.

Different classification approaches and algorithms can yield different results. These approaches include image-based seabed classification methods such as [[Texture (geology)|texture]] analysis, [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN); and other methods, such as angular response characterization [http://www.omg.unb.ca/orig/omg/papers/HFSW_1997_Lerici.pdf (Hughes-Clarke et al., 1997)]. [[Image processing]] methods traditionally used in satellite [[remote sensing]] are often adapted to quantitatively analyze multibeam backscatter intensity data. After [[image segmentation]] and classification, acoustic imagery can be used to discriminate between areas with different [[geomorphology|morphological]] properties. No classification method produces a map that is 100% accurate and some attempt must always be made to assess the [[accuracy]] of classification results (e.g. [[confusion matrix]]).

===Seabed characterization===
Classification maps are subject to ground-verification in order to identify the compositions and bottom type that characterize each class. The functionality of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) can be used to integrate data from different sources, including [[ground truth]] data. Such data may come from in-situ sediment grab sampling, the use of a dredge, trawl net, visual imagery or surveys using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle| Remotely Operated Vehicles]] (ROVs). The seabed classification map can be combined with other information about the area, such as fish distribution and abundance or vegetation characteristics, to establish habitat groups based on associations. This process allows classification maps derived from multibeam data to help characterize the seabed and more effectively manage its use.

==Sub-surface seabed classification== 
Sub-surface seabed classification is commonly referred to as sub-bottom profiling and is generally used for [[Geology|geological]] assessment of the sub-surface characteristics. Sub-bottom profiling can return information from tens to hundreds of meters below the seafloor, and is often used to complement [[reflection seismology]]. From sub-surface classifications, scientists and engineers can characterize rock and sediment types, as well as pore fluids. This information is used for many applications, such as slope failure analysis and [[hydrocarbon exploration]].

'''Bear Butte''' is a [[geological]] [[laccolith]] feature located near [[Sturgis, South Dakota]], United States, that was established as a [[State Park]] in 1961. An important landmark and religious site for the [[Plains Indians]] tribes long before [[Europe]]ans reached South Dakota, Bear Butte is called '''Mathó Pahá''',&lt;ref&gt;''Elementary Bilingual Dictionary'' (1976) University of Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Bear Mountain''', by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], or [[Sioux]]. To the [[Cheyenne]], it is known as '''Noahȧ-vose''' ("giving hill") or '''Náhkȯhe-vose''' ("bear hill"),&lt;ref&gt;''English-Cheyenne Student Dictionary'' (1976) Northern Cheyenne Bilingual Education Program&lt;/ref&gt; and is the place where Ma'heo'o (God) imparted to [[Sweet Medicine (Cheyenne)|Sweet Medicine]], a Cheyenne prophet, the knowledge from which the Cheyenne derive their religious, political, social, and economic customs.

The mountain is sacred to many indigenous peoples, who make pilgrimages to leave prayer cloths and tobacco bundles tied to the branches of the trees along the mountain's flanks. Other offerings are often left at the top of the mountain. The site is associated with various religious ceremonies throughout the year. The mountain is a place of prayer, meditation, and peace.

The park includes a campsite west of [[South Dakota Highway 79]]  where horseback riding, fishing, and boating are permitted. On the summit side of Highway 79, a moderately sized herd of [[American Bison|buffalo]] roams the base of the mountain. An education center and a summit trail are available. Official park policy advises visitors to Bear Butte to respect worshipers and to leave religious offerings undisturbed. Park fees are waived for those undertaking religious activities.

In 2007, Gov. [[Mike Rounds]] of South Dakota announced a proposal to use state, federal and private money to buy a perpetual easement  in order to prevent commercial and residential development of some land on the western side of Bear Butte. This would cost more than $1 million, but would prevent development of nuisance businesses (such as potentially lucrative biker bars) on ranch land near the mountain on the northern edge of the Black Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071217/ap_on_re_us/sacred_mountain;_ylt=ApvBRmPyFt0Bi7CjZrbxKeEXIr0F Associated Press article]  {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, 12/17/07.

==Geological history==

Bear Butte is not strictly a butte (created primarily by erosion of sedimentary strata), but a [[laccolith]]: an [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] body of igneous rock, uplifting the earlier sedimentary layers, which have since largely eroded away. This is the result of the forcible entry (or intrusion) of [[magma]] into cooler crustal rock in the Black Hills area during the [[Eocene]] Epoch. In this, Bear Butte shares a similar geological history with other formations in the region, including the [[Black Hills]], [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]], the [[Missouri Buttes]], and some parts of the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gries |first=John Paul |date=1996 |title=Roadside Geology of South Dakota |location=Missoula |publisher=Mountain Press |pages=187–189 |isbn=0878423389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that when the intrusion was emplaced, some magma may have breached the surface, forming a volcano; however, it would have eroded away long ago.

The peak rises {{convert|1253.5|ft}} above the surrounding plain and is {{convert|4426|ft|m}} above sea level.

==Modern history==
Human artifacts have been found on or near Bear Butte that date back 10,000 years, indicating a long and continuous interest in the mountain. The Cheyenne and Lakota people have maintained a spiritual interest in Bear Butte from their earliest recorded history.

Notable visitors like [[Red Cloud]], [[Crazy Horse]], and [[Sitting Bull]] made pilgrimages to the site. In 1857, a council of many Indian nations gathered at Bear Butte to discuss the growing presence of white settlers in the Black Hills.

Violating a treaty of 1868, [[George Armstrong Custer]] led an expedition to the Black Hills region in 1874, and according to custom he camped near Bear Butte. Custer verified the rumors of gold in the Black Hills, and Bear Butte then served as an easily identifiable landmark for the rush of invading [[Prospecting|prospector]]s and settlers into the region. Indian reaction to the illegal movements of whites into the area was intense and hostile. Ultimately the government reneged on its treaty obligations regarding the Black Hills and instead embarked on a program to confine all northern Plains tribes to reservations.

Ezra Bovee homesteaded on the southern slopes of the mountain, and by the time of [[World War II]], he and his family were the legal owners of the site. In the spring of 1945, the Northern Cheyenne received permission from Bovee to hold a ceremony at Bear Butte to pray for the end of World War II. The Cheyenne found that the Bovee family welcomed their interest in the mountain, and over the years the Bovees continued to encourage native religious ceremonies.

By the mid-1950s Ezra Bovee was attempting to stir up interest in making Bear Butte a national park. After his death, his family continued the effort. When federal interest in the project waned, the state government in Pierre took action, and Bear Butte became a state park in 1961 and was registered as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1981.

[[Frank Fools Crow]], the Lakota ceremonial chief (d. 1989), made pilgrimages to Bear Butte throughout his lifetime. Fools Crow taught racial harmony not just between whites and Indians, but among all the peoples of the world. He believed the Lakota should never sell the Black Hills. A bust and plaque in front of the education center at [[Bear Butte State Park]] honor Fools Crow's efforts.

Frank Fools Crow was the plaintiff in one of the most prominent attempts by Native Americans to gain access to sacred lands under the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978. The case, ''Fools Crow v. Gullett'', related to the introduction in 1982 of limits on when and for how long Lakota and Cheyenne religious ceremonies could take place on the Bluff. The Indian Americans argued that both the American Indian Religious Freedom Act and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected their right to unlimited access to the Bluff. They also wanted the Bluff to remain untouched as it was sacred. The plaintiffs lost their case on both the District and Appellate level and were denied a hearing by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prox1.harper.cc.il.us:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=3177031&amp;site=ehost-live |title= Fools Crow versus Gullett: A critical analysis of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act |author= Forbes-Boyte, Kari |journal= Antipode |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] included Bear Butte on its list of the [[America's Most Endangered Places|11 Most Endangered Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/mountains-plains-region/bear-butte.html |title=America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places 2011: Bear Butte |accessdate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712193436/http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/mountains-plains-region/bear-butte.html |archivedate=2011-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Society of Natural History''' (1830–1948) in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], was an organization dedicated to the study and promotion of natural history. It published a scholarly journal and established a museum. In its first few decades, the society occupied several successive locations in Boston's [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]], including Pearl Street, [[Tremont Street]] and Mason Street. In 1864 it moved into a newly constructed museum building at [[234 Berkeley Street, Boston|234 Berkeley Street]] in the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], designed by architect [[William G. Preston|William Gibbons Preston]]. In 1951 the society evolved into the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]], and relocated to its current site on the Charles River.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Emerson]]; [[Joshua B. Flint]]; [[Benjamin D. Greene]]; [[Simon E. Greene]]; William Grigg; George Hayward; [[D. Humphreys Storer]]; and John Ware. Several had previously been involved with the [[Linnaean Society of New England]]. By 1838, the society held "regular meetings on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each month."&lt;ref name=almanac1838&gt;Boston Almanac. 1838.&lt;/ref&gt; "In its collection are about 700 specimens in mineralogy and geology, besides the rich collection of Dr. C.T. Jackson, and the state collection; botany, 5,000; mammalia, 30 entire skeletons and 30 crania; birds, 200 species; reptiles, 130; insects, about 15,000; crustacea, 130; radiata, 190. Library, 600 volumes and pamphlets. The room ... gratuitously opened to the public every Wednesday from 12 to 2 o'clock."&lt;ref name=almanac1838 /&gt;

Among the many scholars and curators affiliated with the society: [[Alexander Emanuel Agassiz]]; [[T.T. Bouve]]; [[Thomas Mayo Brewer]]; George Emerson; [[Augustus Addison Gould|A.A.

"After World War II, under the leadership of [[Bradford Washburn]], the society sold the Berkeley Street building, changed its name to the Boston Museum of Science. ... The cornerstone for the new Museum was laid at Science Park [in 1949] and a temporary building was erected to house the Museum's collections and staff. In 1951, the first wing of the new Museum officially opened."&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Science, Boston.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CTAIDI is the average total duration of interruption ''for customers who had at least one interruption during the period of analysis'', and is calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{CTAIDI} = \frac{\sum{U_i N_i}}{N_{io}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of customers and &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual outage time for location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N_{io}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of customers at location &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that were interrupted. In other words,

&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{CTAIDI} = \frac{\mbox{sum of durations of customer interruptions}}{\mbox{number of distinct customers interrupted}}
&lt;/math&gt;

CTAIDI is measured in units of time, such as minutes or hours.  It is similar to [[CAIDI]], but CAIDI divides the total duration of interruptions by the number of interruptions whereas CTAIDI divides by the number of interrupted customers.  When CTAIDI is much greater than [[CAIDI]], the service outages are more concentrated among certain customers.

CTAIDI also has the same numerator as [[SAIDI]], but SAIDI divides the total duration of interruptions by the total number of customers served.  The fraction of distinct customers interrupted illustrates the relationship between several reliability indicators:

&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{N_{io}}{N_i} = \frac{\mbox{SAIDI}}{\mbox{CTAIDI}} = \frac{\mbox{SAIFI}}{\mbox{CAIFI}}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Dead zones''' are [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (low-[[oxygen]]) areas in the world's [[ocean]]s and [[List of lakes by area|large lakes]], caused by "excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, many of these sites were naturally occurring.  However, in the 1970s, [[oceanographer]]s began noting increased instances and expanses of dead zones. These occur near inhabited [[coastline]]s, where [[aquatic life]] is most concentrated. (The vast middle portions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered "dead zones".)
[[File:Non Dead Zone vs Dead Zone.svg|thumb|Dead zones are bodies of water that do not have sufficient oxygen (3) levels in order to support most marine life. Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced (2).]]

In March 2004, when the recently established [[UN Environment Programme]] published its first [[UN Environment Programme|Global Environment Outlook Year Book]] (''GEO Year Book 2003''), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where [[marine life]] could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4&amp;nbsp;mi²), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000&amp;nbsp;mi²). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diaz" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, as sunlight increases during the spring, algal growth in the dead zones increases dramatically. In fall months, tropical storms begin to enter the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and break up the dead zones, and the cycle repeats again in the spring.]]

Aquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as [[eutrophication]]. These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these [[phytoplankton]], a phenomenon known as an [[algal bloom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Limnologist]] Dr. [[David Schindler]], whose research at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, &lt;blockquote&gt;"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising rapidly."&lt;ref&gt;

The major groups of algae are [[Cyanobacteria]], [[green algae]], [[Dinoflagellates]], [[Coccolithophore]]s and [[Diatom#Algae_and_plants|Diatom algae]]. Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Other algae are consumed and hence do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cees.iupui.edu/Research/Water_Resources/CIWRP/Algae_Information/Presentations/2010-06-17-Symposium/2010-06-17_Lehman-Whole_Lake_Experiments.pdf  "Whole Lake Experiment, Ford Lake, Prof Lehman"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, www.cees.iupui.edu, 2010-06-17&lt;/ref&gt; Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22301669 Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf] msnbc.msn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt; surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.

Additionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as [[fjords]] or the [[Black Sea]], have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, G.L. and Emery, W.J. 1982. Description Physical Oceanography: An Introduction. Pergamon Press, Oxford, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semipermanent areas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Remains of organisms found within [[sediment]] layers near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] indicate four hypoxic events before the advent of synthetic fertilizer. In these sediment layers, [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]]-tolerant species are the most prevalent remains found. The periods indicated by the sediment record correspond to historic records of high river flow recorded by instruments at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Changes in ocean circulation triggered by ongoing [[climate change]] could also add or magnify other causes of oxygen reductions in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Mora2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mora |first1=C. |title=Biotic and Human Vulnerability to Projected Changes in Ocean Biogeochemistry over the 21st Century |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=11 |pages=e1001682 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001682|display-authors=etal |pmid=24143135 |pmc=3797030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low oxygen levels recorded along the [[Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]] have led to reproductive problems in fish involving decreased size of reproductive organs, low egg counts and lack of spawning.

In a study of the Gulf [[killifish]] by the [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] done in three bays along the Gulf Coast, fish living in bays where the oxygen levels in the water dropped to 1 to 2 parts per million (ppm) for three or more hours per day were found to have smaller [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]]. The male gonads were 34% to 50% as large as males of similar size in bays where the oxygen levels were normal (6 to 8 ppm). Females were found to have ovaries that were half as large as those in normal oxygen levels. The number of eggs in females living in hypoxic waters were only one-seventh the number of eggs in fish living in normal oxygen levels.&lt;ref&gt;Landry, C.A., S. Manning, and A.O. Cheek. 2004. Hypoxia suppresses reproduction in Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis. e.hormone 2004 conference. Oct. 27–30. New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish raised in laboratory-created hypoxic conditions showed extremely low [[hormone|sex hormone]] concentrations and increased elevation of activity in two [[gene]]s triggered by the hypoxia-inductile factor (HIF) [[protein]]. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF pairs with another protein, ARNT. The two then bind to DNA in cells, activating genes in those plant cells.

Under normal oxygen conditions, ARNT combines with estrogen to activate genes. Hypoxic cells ''in vitro'' did not react to estrogen placed in the tube. HIF appears to render ARNT unavailable to interact with estrogen, providing a mechanism by which hypoxic conditions alter reproduction in fish.&lt;ref&gt;Johanning, K., et al. 2004. Assessment of molecular interaction between low oxygen and estrogen in fish cell culture. Fourth SETAC World Congress, 25th Annual Meeting in North America. Nov. 14–18. Portland, Ore.&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be expected that fish would flee the potential suffocation, but they are often quickly rendered unconscious and doomed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Slow moving bottom-dwelling creatures like clams, lobsters and oysters are unable to escape. All colonial animals are extinguished. The normal re-mineralization and recycling that occurs among [[benthos|benthic]] life-forms is stifled.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Despite most other life forms being killed by the lack of oxygen, [[jellyfish]] can thrive and are sometimes present in dead zones in vast numbers. These jellyfish blooms produce mucus and waste, leading to major changes in [[food web]]s in the ocean. The organic carbon is metabolised by bacteria which return it to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide in what has been termed a "jelly carbon shunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yong |first1=Ed |title=Jellyfish shift ocean food webs by feeding bacteria with mucus and excrement |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/06/06/jellyfish-shift-ocean-food-webs-by-feeding-bacteria-with-mucus-and-excrement/ |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=4 October 2018 |date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from Baltic Nest Institute published in one of [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] issues reports that the dead zones in the Baltic Sea have grown from approximately 5,000 km2 to more than 60,000 km2 in recent years.

Some of the causes behind the elevated increase of dead zones can be attributed to the use of fertilizers, large animal farms, the burning of fossil fuels, and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balticnest.org/balticnest/activities/news/news/deadzoneshaveincreasedbymorethan10foldinthelastcentury.5.3186f824143d05551ad52e7.html|title=Dead zones have increased by more than 10-fold in the last century - Baltic Nest Institute|date=2014-04-01|website=www.balticnest.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth River, Virginia===
The [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] estuary is important for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. It has been polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus, but also toxic deposits from the shipbuilding industry, the military, the world's largest coal export facility, refineries, loading docks, container-repair facilities and others, so fish had been "offlimits since the 1920s". In 1993, a group formed to clean it up, adopting the [[mummichog]] as a mascot, and has removed thousands of tons of contaminated sediment. In 2006, a 35-acre biological dead zone called Money Point was dredged out, and this let fish return, and the wetland recover&lt;ref&gt;Rona Kobell [http://www.bayjournal.com/article/elizabeth_river_rises_from_the_depths Elizabeth River rises from the depths.

A dead zone exists in the central part of [[Lake Erie]] from east of [[Point Pelee]] to [[Long Point, Ontario|Long Point]] and stretches to shores in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=05-P13-00040&amp;segmentID=8|title= Dead Zones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone has been noticed since the 1950s to 1960s, but efforts since the 1970s have been made by Canada and the US to reduce runoff pollution into the lake as means to reverse the dead zone growth. Overall the lake's oxygen level is poor with only a small area to the east of Long Point that has better levels. The biggest impact of the poor oxygen levels is to lacustrine life and fisheries industry.

===Lower St. Lawrence Estuary===

"Missouri River Basin has had hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and wetlands (66,000,000 acres) replaced with agriculture activity [. . .] In the Lower Mississippi one-third of the valley's forests were converted to agriculture between 1950 and 1976." &lt;ref name="The Gulf of Mexico's Hypoxic Zone"/&gt;

In July 2007, a dead zone was discovered off the coast of [[Texas]] where the [[Brazos River]] empties into the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Tony |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a4Tb2AFv6CRk&amp;refer=home |title=Exclusive |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609030628/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007==
The [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] calls for the production of {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuels by 2022, including {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3}} of corn-based ethanol, a tripling of current production that would require a similar increase in corn production.&lt;ref name="Potera, 2008"&gt;{{cite news | last = Potera | first = Carol | title = Corn Ethanol Goal Revives Dead Zone Concerns | work = Environmental Health Prospectives | date = June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the plan poses a new problem; the increase in demand for corn production results in a proportional increase in nitrogen runoff. Although nitrogen, which makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, is an inert gas, it has more reactive forms, two of which (nitrate and ammonia) are used to make fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Economist, 2008"&gt;{{cite news | title = Dead Water | work = Economist | date = May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{Citation/make link|http://cropsci.illinois.edu/faculty/below/|Fred Below}}, a professor of crop physiology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], corn requires more nitrogen-based fertilizer because it produces a higher grain per unit area than other crops and, unlike other crops, corn is completely dependent on available nitrogen in soil. The results, reported 18 March 2008 in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], showed that scaling up corn production to meet the {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3|adj=on}} goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10–18%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force ([[Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs]]), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.&lt;ref name="Potera, 2008" /&gt;

==Reversal==
Dead zones are reversible, though the extinction of organisms that are lost due to its appearance is not. The [[Black Sea]] dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the demise of centrally planned economies in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Fishing has again become a major economic activity in the region.&lt;ref name="Mee 2006"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mee | first = Laurence | title = Reviving Dead Zones | work = Scientific American | date = November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Black Sea "cleanup" was largely unintentional and involved a drop in hard-to-control fertilizer usage, the U.N. has advocated other cleanups by reducing large industrial emissions.&lt;ref name="Mee 2006"/&gt; From 1985 to 2000, the [[North Sea]] dead zone had nitrogen reduced by 37% when policy efforts by countries on the [[Rhine|Rhine River]] reduced sewage and industrial emissions of nitrogen into the water. Other cleanups have taken place along the [[Hudson River]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93619388 'Dead Zones' Multiplying In World's Oceans] by John Nielsen. 15 Aug 2008, Morning Edition, NPR.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

The chemical [[aluminium sulfate]] can be used to reduce phosphates in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf |title=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128030217/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/fhp/papers/alum_brochure.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duga''' ({{lang-rus|Дуга}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet [[missile defense]] [[early-warning radar]] network. The system operated from July 1976 to December 1989. Two operational Duga radars were deployed, one near [[Chernobyl]] and [[Chernihiv]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]), the other in eastern [[Siberia]].

The Duga systems were extremely powerful, over 10&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] in some cases, and broadcast in the [[shortwave radio]] bands. They appeared without warning, sounding like a sharp, repetitive tapping noise at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The "Russian" (sic) Woodpecker... A Closer Look | author = David L. Wilson | journal= Monitoring Times | date = Summer 1985 | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker5.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to it being nicknamed by shortwave listeners the '''Russian Woodpecker'''. The random frequency hops disrupted legitimate broadcasts, [[amateur radio]] operations, oceanic commercial aviation communications, utility transmissions, and resulted in thousands of complaints by many countries worldwide. The signal became such a nuisance that some receivers such as amateur radios and televisions actually began including 'Woodpecker Blankers' in their circuit designs in an effort to filter out the interference.

The unclaimed signal was a source for much speculation, giving rise to theories such as Soviet [[mind control]] and [[weather control]] experiments. However, because of its distinctive transmission pattern, many experts and amateur radio hobbyists quickly realized it to be an over-the-horizon radar system.  [[NATO]] [[military intelligence]] had already given it the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] ''STEEL WORK'' or ''STEEL YARD''. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, this theory was not publicly confirmed until after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

== History ==

===Genesis===
The Soviets had been working on [[early warning radar]] for their [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning [[satellite]] network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.

The first experimental system, Duga, was built outside [[Mykolaiv]] in [[Ukraine]], successfully detecting rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 2,500 kilometers. This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="PodvigBook"&gt;{{Cite book

==="Russian Woodpecker"===
At some point in 1976, a new and powerful radio signal was detected simultaneously worldwide, and quickly dubbed 'the Woodpecker' by [[amateur radio]] operators. Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this "the Russian Woodpecker". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but is probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.

[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and NATO quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being alternately located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.&lt;ref name=mystery/&gt;

The radar system was given the code 5Н32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to civilian observers at the time, [[NATO]] was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.

===NATO Reporting Name===
The NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any "official" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, deconflicting this will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.&lt;ref name="The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition"&gt;{{Cite book

===Civilian identification===
Even from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests
 | journal= Wireless World
 | pages = 53

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.

As more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Letter from J. P. Martinez

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence is usable for a 100&amp;nbsp;μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15&amp;nbsp;km (10&amp;nbsp;mi) (the distance light travels in 50&amp;nbsp;μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.

In 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&amp;nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&amp;nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.
* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.
* The most common rate was 10&amp;nbsp;Hz, while the 16&amp;nbsp;Hz and 20&amp;nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.
* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===Jamming the Woodpecker===
[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]

To combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core group members would frame the "Official Practice Target" in their radio shacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/Wpecker3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
Starting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.

According to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands, however, and has been used by amateurs as a transmission tower (using their own antennas) and has been extensively photographed.

The original Duga was the first experimental system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A. Karpenko Nevsky Bastion|volume=No. 4|year=1999|pages=2–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built outside the Black Sea port of [[Mykolaiv]] in the southern [[Ukraine]], and successfully detected rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] about 2,500 kilometers away. Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire which seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.

The original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2, with the receiver at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} located a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. 

Duga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&amp;nbsp;km north of the city.

== Appearances in media ==
The Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game heavily features actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.

[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].

In ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map "Grid" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.

In the movie ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'', the fence around Chicago is derived from photographs of the Duga-1 array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.qrz.com/showthread.php?430504-The-quot-Woodpecker-quot-moves-to-fururistic-Chicago!

The 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.

The Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.

'''Eko Atlantic''', officially '''Nigeria International Commerce city''', also known as '''Eko Atlantic City''', or the initials '''E.A.C.''' and '''E.A.''', is a [[planned city]] of [[Lagos State]], Nigeria, being constructed on land reclaimed from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Deji |last=Elumoye |title='Eko Atlantic city Underway' |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200709260377.html |work= [[Thisday]] (via allAfrica.com) |publisher=AllAfrica Global Media |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the new [[peninsula]], which is still under development is anticipating at least 250,000 residents and a daily flow of 150,000 commuters.  The development will also have a positive environmental impact, as it will help in stopping the erosion of Lagos State's coastline.&lt;ref name="Dada"&gt;{{cite news|first=Akinpelu |last=Dada |title='Construction work on Eko Atlantic city to commence soon' |url=http://www.punchng.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art20090518128280 |work=[[The Punch]] |publisher= |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-05-21 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city adjoins [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]] district of [[Lagos|Lagos city]] and the Phase 1 area of [[Lekki]], to the north, while the entire Western, eastern and southern borders is a coastline. Eko Atlantic is expected to rise as the next generation of property on the African continent; having a total of 10 districts, spread across a land area of approximately {{convert|10|km2|sqmi}}, the city will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations.&lt;ref name="elect"&gt;{{cite news |first=Akinpelu |last=Dada |title='Eko Atlantic City Project has expanded Nigeria’s territory – Fashola' |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/03/eko-atlantic-city-project-has-expanded-nigeria%e2%80%99s-territory-fashola/ |work=[[The Punch]]|publisher= |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eko Atlantic development is being carried out as a [[Public–private partnership]], with private companies and investors providing the funding, whilst [[Lagos State Government]] is a strategic partner, with the support of the [[Federal Government of Nigeria|Federal Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ekoatlantic.com/about-us/ | title=Eko Atlantic - About Us | publisher=Eko Atlantic | accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Contractors are [[China Communications Construction|China Communications Construction Group]], a company that works in the field of marine dredging and landfill operation. Consultants are [[Royal Haskoning]] (traffic and transport expertise) and ''ar+h Architects''. ''South Energyx Nigeria Ltd.'' a subsidiary of the [[Chagoury group]] was specifically created to undertake the development. Testing of the [[Coastal management|sea defence system]] took place at the [[DHI Water &amp; Environment|DHI Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where models were successfully tested for one-in-a-hundred-year [[Storm surge|ocean surges]], and one-in-120-year, one-in-150-year and one-in-1,000-year storms.

==Overview==
[[File:Eko Atlantic Masterplan.jpg|thumbnail|Masterplan of Eko Atlantic (2015 revision)|left|300px]]
Eko Atlantic will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations, with infrastructure in line with modern and environmental standards. These standards will offer the city’s residents water, waste management, security and transportation systems. The city will also have an independent source of energy generated specifically for the city.&lt;ref name="elect"/&gt;

The Eko Atlantic City project received global attention in 2009, as the [[Lagos State Government]] and its private sector partners on the Project, South Energyx, received the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative .28CGI.29|Clinton Global Initiative]] Commitment Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200909290203.html|title=Fashola Receives Clinton Award For Eko Atlantic City|date=29 September 2009|work=[[AllAfrica.com]]|publisher=[[ThisDay]]|accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5569:a-fairy-tale-dream-home-for-the-super-rich-a-fairy-tale-dream-home-for-the-super-rich&amp;catid=44:feature&amp;Itemid=135 |title=A Fairy Tale, Dream Home for the Super-Rich |last=Akinola |first=Femi |date=19 December 2010 |work=[[Media Trust|Sunday Trust]] |accessdate=11 October 2012 |location=Abuja, Nigeria |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212131334/http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5569%3Aa-fairy-tale-dream-home-for-the-super-rich-a-fairy-tale-dream-home-for-the-super-rich&amp;catid=44%3Afeature&amp;Itemid=135 |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalmirroronline.net/index.php/business/real-estate/29723.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221220400/http://nationalmirroronline.net/index.php/business/real-estate/29723.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 2013 |title=Projects that will shape real estate sector in 2012 |last=Ayeyemi |first=Dayo |date=24 January 2012 |work=[[National Mirror]] |accessdate=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Districts===
Eko Atlantic is master-planned to contain ten districts which are as follows:

*Harbour Lights
*Business District
*Marina 
*Downtown
*Eko Island

As of May 2009 while the project was still in its dredging phase, about {{convert|3000000|m3|yd3}} have been sand-filled and placed in the reclamation area, while about 35,000 tonnes of rock have been delivered to the site.&lt;ref name="Dada" /&gt;  In certain parts of Bar Beach the land being reclaimed can already be seen. [[Dredgers]] are working around the clock to fill the site with sand.

On 21 February 2013, a dedication ceremony was held at the reclaimed land of Eko Atlantic, with [[Goodluck Jonathan]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Babatunde Fashola]], [[Bola Tinubu]], [[Aminu Waziri Tambuwal|Aminu Tambuwal]], and [[Ibikunle Amosun]] attending.&lt;ref name=Thisday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/clinton-eko-atlantic-city-destination-for-global-investment/140277/ |title=Clinton: Eko Atlantic City, Destination for Global Investment |author=Gboyega Akinsanmi |newspaper=[[Thisday]] |publisher=Leaders &amp; Company |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224020642/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/clinton-eko-atlantic-city-destination-for-global-investment/140277/ |archivedate=24 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheSun&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/cover/jonathan-clinton-fashola-tip-lagos-as-world-tourists-destination/ |title=Jonathan, Clinton, Fashola tip Lagos as world tourists’ destination |author=Oluwole Farotimi |author2=Maduka Nweke |last-author-amp=yes |newspaper=[[The Sun (Nigeria)]] |publisher=The Sun Publishing Ltd. |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224173615/http://sunnewsonline.com/new/cover/jonathan-clinton-fashola-tip-lagos-as-world-tourists-destination/ |archivedate=24 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

'''''Elaeocarpus ganitrus''''', is a large evergreen broad-leaved tree whose seed is traditionally used for prayer beads in Hinduism and Buddhism. The seeds are known as '''[[rudraksha]]''', or '''rudraksh''', Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|rudrākṣa}}'' ("Rudra's Tear Drops"). Rudraksha may be produced by several species of ''[[Elaeocarpus]]''; however, ''E. ganitrus'' is the principal species used in the making of organic jewellery or ''[[Hindu prayer beads|mala]]''.

==Etymology==
Rudraksha is a [[Sanskrit]] compound consisting of the name [[Rudra]] ("[[Shiva]]") and ''{{IAST|akṣha}}'' ("Tear Drops").&lt;ref&gt;The translation of ''{{IAST|rudrākṣa}}'' as "Rudra's eyes" and definition as berries of ''Elaeocarpus ganitrus'' see: Stutley, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stutley | first = M. | title = The Illustrated Dictionary of Hindu Iconography | year = 1985 | publisher = Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers | location = New Delhi, India | isbn = 81-215-1087-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific epithet ''ganitrus'' is derived from ''ganitri'', the name for this species in [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]].

==Description==
''Elaeocarpus ganitrus'' grows in the area from [[Indo-Gangetic plain|the Gangetic plain]] in the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s to South-East Asia, [[Nepal]], Indonesia, New Guinea to Australia, Guam, and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010513/spectrum/main3.htm | title = Bond with the beads | author = Koul, M. K. | publisher = The Tribune | location = India | date = 2001-05-13 | work = Spectrum }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudraksha [[seed]]s are covered by an outer husk of blue colour when fully ripe, and for this reason are also known as blueberry beads. The blue colour is not derived from pigment but is [[Structural color|structural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lee, D. W. | title = Ultrastructural Basis and Function of Iridescent Blue Color of Fruits in ''Elaeocarpus'' | journal = Nature | year = 1991 | volume = 349 | issue = 6306 | pages = 260–262 | doi = 10.1038/349260a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evergreen tree that grows quickly. The rudraksha tree starts bearing fruit in three to four years. As the tree matures, the roots buttress rising up narrowly near the trunk and radiating out along the surface of the ground.

==Chemical constituents==
Chemical constituents present in ''E. ganitrus'' are [[elaeocarpidine]], [[isoelaeocarpine]], [[epiisoelaeocarpiline]], [[rudrakine]], [[flavonoids]], [[quercetin]], [[phytosterols]], fat, [[alkaloids]], carbohydrates, ethanol, proteins, tannins, [[gallic acid]] and [[ellagic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Navin_Kumar23/publication/236107802_A_comprehensive_report_on_therapeutic_potential_of_Elaeocarpus_ganitrus_Roxb._(Rudraksha)/links/0deec515fae789097b000000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Australia''' is the production in [[Australia]] of [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]], for consumption or export. [[Energy policy of Australia]] describes the [[politics of Australia]] as it relates to energy.

Australia is a net energy exporter, and was the fourth-highest coal producer in the world in 2009.

Historically&amp;ndash;and until recent times&amp;ndash;energy in Australia was sourced largely from coal and natural gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/australia/AustraliaCountryAnalysisBrief.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402162924/http://geni.org/globalenergy/library/national_energy_grid/australia/AustraliaCountryAnalysisBrief.shtml |title=Australia Country Analysis Brief |date=2002 |archivedate=2 April 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=19 October 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; however due to the increasing [[effects of global warming]] and human-induced [[climate change]] on the global environment, there has been a greater shift towards [[renewable energy]] such as [[solar power]] and [[wind power]] both in Australia and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand says goodbye to coal power|url=http://antinuclear.net/2015/08/07/new-zealand-says-goodbye-to-coal-power/ |work=antinuclear.net|accessdate=26 November 2015|date=2015-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/sep/13/china-starts-moving-away-from-coal-based-energy/|title=China starts moving away from coal based energy|work=Spokesman.com|date=13 September 2013|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has led to a decrease in the demand of coal worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Diessendorf|url= http://www.theage.com.au/comment/say-goodbye-to-coal-power-20150703-gi4wuz.html |title=Say goodbye to coal power in Australia|work=[[The Age]]|date=5 July 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Australia had the highest per capita CO2 emissions in the world. At that time, Maplecroft's CO2 Energy Emissions Index (CEEI) showed that Australia releases 20.58 tons of CO2 per person per year, more than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Biggest Polluters|url=http://www.thenewecologist.com/2009/10/the-worlds-biggest-polluters/|website=The New Ecologist|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, however, emissions have been reduced. From 1990 to 2017, emissions per capita fell by one-third, with most of that drop occurring in the more recent years. Additionally, the emissions intensity of the economy fell by 58.4 percent during the same time period. These are the lowest values in 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-mar-2017|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|last=Energy|first=Department of the Environment and|date=2017-07-26|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy sector in Australia increased its carbon dioxide emissions by 8.2% from 2004 to 2010 on average.

===Coal===
{{Further|Coal in Australia}}
According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), global coal production increased 23% from 2005 to 2010 and 4.7% from 2009 to 2010. In Australia, coal production increased 12.9% between 2005 and 2010 and 5.3% between 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref name=IEA2011&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf IEA Key World Energy Statistics 2011] October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Australia was the fourth-highest coal producer in the world, producing 335 [[Tonne|megatonnes]] (Mt) of [[anthracite]] (black coal) and 64 Mt of [[lignite]] (brown coal).&lt;ref name=coal&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Pages: 15&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was the biggest anthracite exporter, with 31% of global exports (262 Mt out of 836 Mt total). Lignite is not exported. 78% of its 2009 anthracite production was exported (262 Mt out of 335 Mt total). In this respect, Australia is an exception to most anthracite exporters. Australia's global anthracite export share was 14% of all production (836 Mt out of 5,990 Mt total).&lt;ref name=coal2&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Pages:15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Australia was the biggest net exporter of coal, with 33% of global exports (392 Mt out of 1,193 Mt total). It was still the fourth-highest anthracite producer with 6.6% of global production (509 Mt out of 7,709 Mt total). 77% of production was exported (392 Mt out of 509 Mt total).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=IEA Key World Energy Statistics 2016|last=|first=|publisher=International Energy Agency |year=2016 |isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Australia.pdf|title=Key Coal Trends.

[[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New South Wales]], is the world’s largest coal-export port. The [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valley region]] in New South Wales is the chief coal region. Most coal mining in Australia is [[Open-pit mining|open cut]].

===Oil===
Australia's oil production peaked in 2000, after gradually increasing since 1980.&lt;ref name="ausep"&gt;[http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10069 Australia: Energy profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001080326/http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10069 |date=1 October 2011 }} 26 June 2007, Energy Publisher accessdate 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Net oil imports rose from 7% of total consumption in 2000 to 39% in 2006. Decreasing domestic oil production is the result of the decline of oil-producing basins and few new fields going online.&lt;ref name="ausep"/&gt;

===Natural gas===

Australia's natural-gas reserves are an estimated 3,921 billion cubic meters (bcm), of which 20% are considered commercially proven (783 bcm). The gas basins with the largest recoverable reserves are the Carnarvon and Browse basins in Western Australia; the Bonaparte basin in the [[Northern Territory]]; the Gippsland and Otway basins in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Cooper Basin|Cooper]]-[[Eromanga Basin|Eromanga]] basin in South Australia and [[Queensland]]. In 2014–2015 Australia produced 66 bcm of natural gas, of which approximately 80% was produced in Western Australia and Queensland regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Pages/Australian-energy-statistics.aspx|title=Australian Energy Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia also produces LNG; LNG exports in 2004 were 7.9 Mt (10.7 bcm), 6% of world LNG trade.&lt;ref name=iea131&gt;OECD/IEA, p. 131-137&lt;/ref&gt; Australia also has large deposits of coal seam methane (CSM), most of which are located in the anthracite deposits of Queensland and New South Wales.&lt;ref name=iea131/&gt;

===Oil shale===
{{main|Oil shale in Australia}}
Australia's [[oil shale]] resources are estimated at about 58 billion barrels, or 4,531 million tonnes of [[shale oil]]. The deposits are located in the eastern and southern states, with the greatest feasibility in the eastern Queensland deposits. Between 1862 and 1952, Australia mined four million tonnes of oil shale. The mining stopped when government support ceased. Since the 1970s, oil companies have been exploring possible reserves. From 2000 to 2004, the [[Stuart Oil Shale Project]] near [[Gladstone, Queensland]] produced over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million barrels of oil. The facility, in operable condition, is on [[care and maintenance]] and its operator ([[Queensland Energy Resources]]) is conducting research and design studies for the next phase of its oil-shale operations.&lt;ref name=aimr&gt;[http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/info/aimr/shale_oil.jsp Shale oil.

From 2003 to 2013 real electric prices for households increased by an average of 72%. Much of this increase in price has been attributed to over-investment in increasing distribution networks and capacity, and environmental policy impacts. Further price increases are predicted to be moderate over the next few years (2017 on) due to changes in the regulation of transmission and distribution networks as well as increased competition in electricity wholesale markets as supply and demand merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BriefingBook44p/EnergyPrices|title=Energy prices—the story behind rising costs|last=Swoboda|first=Kai|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the number of people employed in electricity supply, which includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution, was 64,200 (47,700 males, 16,600 females). &lt;ref name=LabourForceNov17Table06&gt;{{cite report |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |author-link=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2017 |title=6291.0.55.003 - Labour Force, Australia, Detailed, Quarterly, Nov 2017, Table 06.

In 2016, the major occupations in this Division were truck drivers (9,900), electricians (7,700), electrical distribution trades workers (5,400), and electrical engineers (4,400).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Department of Employment, Australian Government |author-link=Department of Employment (Australia) |date=2016 |title=4.

=== Employment in renewable energy activities ===

In 2015–16, annual [[Permanent employment|direct]] [[Full-time equivalent|full-time equivalent]] employment in renewable energy in Australia was estimated at 11,150. Employment in renewables peaked in 2011–12, probably due to the employment of construction workers to build renewable energy facilities. However, it decreased by 36 per cent in 2014–15, and by a further 16 per cent in 2015–16. The decline is attributed to a decrease in the number of [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top solar photovoltaic systems]] being installed on the roofs of homes. Once construction of renewable energy facilities is completed, and only ongoing maintenance is required, employment falls quite significantly.&lt;ref name="EmploymentinRenewableEnergyActivities"&gt;{{cite report |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |author-link=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2017 |title=4631.0 - Employment in Renewable Energy Activities, Australia, 2015-16|url= http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4631.0|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most Australian states and territories the major contributor to employment in renewable energy is [[solar power]]. Employment in roof-top solar photovoltaic systems, including [[Solar hot water in Australia|solar hot water systems]], comprised half of all employment in renewable energy in 2015–16. Employment in large scale solar and wind power is driven primarily by installation activity, rather than ongoing operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="EmploymentinRenewableEnergyActivities" /&gt;.

In [[Western Australia]], 93 per cent of all jobs in renewable energy are in solar power. The proportion of employment in [[biomass]] is significantly greater in [[Queensland]] (42 per cent), where the [[sugar industry]] makes great use of [[sugar cane]] to generate electricity for sugar milling and to return to the grid. Most jobs in [[Tasmania|Tasmania’s]] renewable energy industry are in [[hydropower]] (87 per cent).&lt;ref name="EmploymentinRenewableEnergyActivities" /&gt;

Jobs in the renewable energy industry are forecast to grow substantially by 2030, driven by growth in electricity demand and new renewable energy capacity.&lt;ref name=ClimateCouncilRE&gt;{{cite book |author=Climate Council of Australia |author-link=Climate Council |date=2016 |title=Renewable Energy Jobs: Future Growth in Australia |url=https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/uploads/7b40d7bbefbdd94979ce4de2fad52414.pdf |publisher=Climate Council of Australia |isbn=978-0-9945973-3-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} Conversely, jobs associated with [[Fossil fuel power station|coal-fired power stations]] are forecast to decline as those plants age and close. Such job losses would disproportionately affect some regional areas, such as the [[Latrobe Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales |Newcastle]] and the [[Hunter Region |Hunter Valley]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Gladstone, Queensland |Gladstone]] and [[Rockhampton]] in [[Queensland]], and [[Collie, Western Australia |Collie]] in [[Western Australia]]. However, it is expected that the number of jobs created in renewable energy will far exceed the number of jobs lost in coal-based generation.&lt;ref name=ClimateCouncilRE /&gt;{{rp|35}}

==Energy policy of Australia==
{{main article|Energy policy of Australia}}

=== Finkel Report ===
In June 2017 [[Alan Finkel]] released ''The Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market'' (commonly referred to as the Finkel Report), which proposed an approach to increasing energy security and reliability through four outcomes. These would be: increased security, future reliability, rewarding consumers, and lower emissions. The report ultimately recommended a [[Clean Energy Target]] (CET) to provide incentives for growth in renewable energies.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finkel|first1=Alan|title=Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/1d6b0464-6162-4223-ac08-3395a6b1c7fa/files/electricity-market-review-final-report.pdf|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to the report by scientific experts in the field leaned more towards positive. Positive reactions to the Report were due to the national strategy plan that provides a CET for Australia, creating customer incentives, and takes politics out of energy policy to help meet the Paris Agreement. Additionally, the Finkel Report was commended for recognizing the current technologies available and including market forces in its solutions by the [[Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering|Australian Academy of Technology Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-finkel-report-independent-review-into-the-future-security-of-the-national-electricity-market|title=EXPERT REACTION: Finkel Report - Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market|last=SCIMEX|date=9 June 2017|work=Scimex|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Energy Guarantee===
On 17 October 2017, the Australian Government rejected Finkel's CET proposal, in favour of what it called the [[National Energy Guarantee]] (NEG), to reduce power prices and prevent blackouts. The strategy calls on electricity retailers to meet separate reliability and emissions requirements, rather than Dr Finkel’s CET recommendation. Under the plan, retailers will have to provide a minimum amount of baseload power from coal, gas or hydro, while also providing a specified level of low emissions energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2017/10/17/national-energy-guarantee-alan-finkel/ Government ditches chief scientist’s energy plan, but Alan Finkel backs the new one]&lt;/ref&gt; NEG has been criticised as turning away from renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41647712?ocid=global_bbccom_email_17102017_top+news+stories+australia+ |title=Australia rejects chief scientist's clean energy proposal |last= |date=17 October 2017|work=BBC|access-date=17 October 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torfmoos_Schlammseggenried.jpg|thumb|[[Peat moss]] floating mat on a silted up raised bog kolk]]

A '''floating mat''' ({{lang-de|Schwingrasen}}) is a layer of [[moss]]es and other, especially [[stoloniferous]], plants that grows out from the shore across the surface of a lake or pond. This type of habitat is protected and is designated in the European [[Habitats Directive]] as "LRT No.&amp;nbsp;7140 Transition and Floating Mat [[Bog]]s".

Floating mats are not always capable of bearing weight. There is a risk of drowning when walking on them.

== Formation ==
The formation of floating mats is a process of [[sedimentation]] in water bodies. In [[bog pond]]s, floating mats of [[peat moss]] form as water levels fall and [[nutrient (plant)|nutrients]] accumulate. In [[eutrophic]] waters, the formation of floating mats is caused by underwater peat that floats to the surface and is colonised by plants. The vegetative mats are held together by their root systems. [[Phragmites|Reeds]] or [[juncus|rushes]] growing by the lakeshore can eventually cut these mats off, which results in a [[floating island]]. If the floating mats are stable and large enough, even trees can grow on them, as at the [[Kleiner Arbersee]]. Beneath the floating mats, [[peat]] is formed, which slowly sinks downwards and gradually fills the water body.

== Flora and fauna ==
In nutrient-poor to moderately nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats form out of [[peat moss]]es, ([[feathery bogmoss]] ''Sphagnum cuspidatum'', species of the complex ''Sphagnum recurvum'' s.l.) or brown mosses (''Scorpidium scorpioides''). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the [[bog sedge]] (''Carex limosa''), (''Carex rostrata''), [[beak sedge]] (''Rhynchospora'' ssp.), [[Rannoch-rush]] (''Scheuchzeria palustris'') and [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (''Phragmites australis''), [[bulrush]]es (''Typha'' ssp.), [[hop sedge]] (''Carex pseudocyperus'') and [[cowbane]] (''Circuta virosa''). Floating mats are habitats for shelly [[amoeba]] such as ''Amphitrema'' sp. and [[lake fly]] larvae.

The '''gadfly''', a type of fly plaguing cattle, typically ones belonging to either the family Tabanidae ([[Horse-fly|horse-flies]]) or the family Oestridae ([[Botfly|bot flies]]), appears in [[Greek mythology]] as a tormenter to [[Io (mythology)|Io]], the heifer maiden. [[Zeus]] lusts after Io and eventually turns her into a white heifer to hide her from his jealous wife, [[Hera]]. Hera is not fooled, and demands Io as a gift from Zeus. She then assigns [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]], the 100-eyed monster, the job of guarding Io. [[Hermes]] (ordered by Zeus) kills Argus and frees Io. When Hera finds out, she sends a gadfly to torment and sting Io, forcing her to wander farther and farther away from home.

The gadfly also plays a role in the [[myth]] of how [[Bellerophon]] loses [[Pegasus]] and the gods' favor. Bellerophon attempts to ride Pegasus to the top of [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mt. Olympus]], arrogantly believing himself worthy of entering the realm of the gods. Zeus is enraged by the human's audacity and sends a gadfly to sting Pegasus. The winged horse is startled and he rears backward. Bellerophon loses his grip and falls back to Earth. [[Athena]] spares his life by causing him to land on soft ground, but he becomes blind and wanders the earth alone until he dies, hated by both men and gods.&lt;ref&gt;Felson, Nancy. "Pegasus."

'''HOME STAR''', (also spelled ''HOMESTAR''), informally known as '''Cash for Caulkers''', is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] program proposed in November 2009 to encourage economic growth by offering incentives to [[Owner-occupier|homeowners]] and retailers for improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of existing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/091204-PERAB-Home-Retrofits-Memo-Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206115039/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/091204-PERAB-Home-Retrofits-Memo-Final.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In late 2009 there was a broad perception that the United States economy was beginning to recover from the [[Late-2000s recession]]. There was a broad perception that government spending authorized by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] had contributed to the recovery, and some desire for the government to do more to encourage job growth and a faster recovery.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In mid-November former president [[Bill Clinton]], and [[John Doerr]] of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board]], proposed different versions of an [[economic stimulus]] program by which the government would offer [[tax incentive]]s to encourage people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=A Stimulus That Could Save Money|author=[[David Leonhardt]]|date=2009-11-17|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/business/economy/18leonhardt.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doerr, in public speeches, called the proposal "cash for caulkers". Separately [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Peter Welch]] proposed a system of energy rebates to [[Rahm Emanuel]], Obama’s [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]].&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aNGrRkT7GyQ0|title=Obama’s ‘Cash for Caulkers’ May Help Insulation Sales, Dow Says|author=Daniel Whitten|date=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obama, in turn, proposed the idea as part of a larger new stimulus program, at a speech at the [[Brookings Institution]] on December 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/us/politics/09jobs.html?dbk|date=2009-12-09|title=Obama Offers Help for Small Businesses | first=Jackie | last=Calmes | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated goals of the proposed program are to reduce pollution, particularly [[greenhouse gas]]es, by reducing household energy use, to save consumers money in the long term through lower power bills, and to stimulate American businesses through the money spent on appliances, materials, and installation. Improving the energy efficiency of "fixed infrastructure", which accounts for approximately 40% of all energy use in the United States, is considered the "low hanging fruit" of energy conservation - a step that achieves results relatively inexpensively and does not require any new technologies or changes to production or consumption methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justin Moresco|publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS370360146420091118|title="Cash for Caulkers" Could Deliver $23B for Home Energy Efficiency|date=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Homestar" is a reference to the popular [[energy star]] electronic device efficiency rating system, and the nickname "Cash for Caulkers" is a play on the earlier [[cash for clunkers]] automobile trade-in incentive.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

==Structure==
As of December 2009, no proposed legislation had been released, and there were few specific details of how the program would be administered, which federal agencies would be involved, or how the tax incentives would be paid (or to whom).&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;  The program is expected to involve preliminary [[energy audit]]s by private contractor energy experts, who then recommend a series of steps for each homeowner to upgrade their home's energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;  As proposed the plan was for the government to pay 50% of the cost of each home improvement project through a rebate, [[tax credit]], or funds paid to manufacturers and retailers, up to a maximum of $12,000 paid for each home.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;  Alternatively, there was speculation that the federal government might give funds to local governments to run their own programs. There was no limitation on eligibility based on [[tax bracket]] or [[household income|income]].&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

Items under consideration for the program included [[weatherization]] of home by installing additional insulation, new doors, and windows, and replacing old appliances with more energy-efficient new ones. Expensive items such as washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, air conditioners, and heaters, would be covered.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/12/08/news/economy/president_energy/|title=Cash for Caulkers could seal $12,000 a home|publisher=CNN|author=Steve Hargreaves|date=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was expected to cost approximately $10 billion over the course of one year, paid for out of unspent [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] funds, and would reduce energy consumption of homes that took full advantage of the program by up to 20%. To become effective it would have to be part of a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] passed by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

The '''Hitler Stalingrad Speech''' was an address made by [[Adolf Hitler]] to senior members of the [[Nazi Party]] on November 8, 1942.  The speech took place at the Löwenbräukeller in [[Stiglmaierplatz]] in [[Munich]] during the height of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. For three-quarters of his oratory, Hitler speaks in a normal tone of voice, at one point making a joke, and only raising his voice at the end of his narrative. The speech is, along with the [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Mannerheim recording]], one of very few recordings in which Hitler is heard speaking completely normally.

==Text of speech==

The first segment of Hitlers speech berates Soviet military ability, and Hitler cites several examples of Soviet military leaders exaggerating casualty figures.

:''If we follow our enemies' propaganda, then I must say that is to be compared
:''with "Rejoicing towards Heaven, depressed until Death".''
:''The slightest success anywhere, and they literally turn somersaults in joy.''
:''They have already destroyed us, and then the page turns and again they are cast down''
:''and depressed.  I did not want to attack in the center, not only because Stalin''
:''knew I would.  I provide one such example.  If you read the Russian telegrams''
:''every day since June 22nd, they say the following each day: "Fighting of unimportant''
:''character".  Or maybe of important character.  "We have shot down three times as many''
:''German planes.  The amount of sunken tonnage is already greater than the entire naval''
:''tonnage, of all the German tonnage from before."  They have so many of us missing that''
:''this amounts to more divisions than we can ever muster.  But, above all, they are always''
:''fighting in the same place.  "Here and there", they say modestly, "after fourteen days we have''
:''evacuated the city."  But, in general, since June 22nd they have been fighting in the same''
:''place.  Always successful, we are constantly being beaten back.  And in this continued retreat''
:''we have slowly come to the [[Caucasus]].''

After a brief applause, Hitler resumes his speech and explains his reasoning for attacking Stalingrad.  In his narrative, Hitler becomes almost comical, and suggests that the city of Stalingrad could have had another name (from Stalin) and this wasn't why he ordered his Army to attack.  The comment drew a round of laughter from the assembled audience.

:''I should say that for our enemies, and not for your soldiers, that the speed at which our soldiers''
:''have now traversed territory is gigantic.  And what has transcribed this past year is vast and''
:''historically unique.  Now, I do not always do things just as others want them done.  I consider''
:''what the others probably believe and then do the opposite on principle.  So, if I did not want to''
:''attack in the center, not only because Mr. Stalin probably believed I would, but because I didn't''
:''care about it at all.  But I wanted to come to the Volga, to a specific place and a specific city.''
:''It happened to have Stalin's name, but that's not why I went there.  It could have had another name.''

In the final segment of the speech, Hitler provides statistics for the strategic importance of Stalingrad and then proclaims that Germany now holds the city.

:''But, now this is a very important point.  Because from here comes 30 millions tons of traffic, including''
:''about nine millions tons of oil shipments.  From there the wheat pours in from these enormous territories of''
:''the Ukraine and from the [[Kuban]] region then to be transported north.  From here comes [[magnesium]] ore.''
:''A gigantic terminal is there and I wanted to take it.  But, as you know, we are modest.  That is to say that''
:''we have it now.  Only a few small pockets of resistance are left.  Some would say "Why not fight onwards?"  Because''
:''I don't want [[Battle of Verdun|a second Verdun]]!  I would rather hold this with small combat patrols!  Time''
:''does not matter, no ships are coming up the Volga!  That is the important point.''

==Media references==

The Hitler Stalingrad Speech is portrayed in the film ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad]]'' where a group of embattled [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers, entrenched from positions within the city of Stalingrad itself, listen to Hitler while they are in turn surrounded by Soviet forces. This speech is also featured in an episode of the 1988 miniseries "War and Remembrance," when Hitler was addressing party faithful. It occurred on the same day as the Allied invasion of North Africa.

An '''iron–nickel alloy''' or '''nickel–iron alloy''', abbreviated '''FeNi''' or '''NiFe''', is a group of [[alloy]]s consisting primarily of the [[chemical element|elements]] [[nickel]] (Ni) and [[iron]] (Fe). It is the main constituent of the "iron" [[planetary core]]s and [[iron meteorite]]s. The acronym NiFe refers to various [[chemical reaction]]s that involve an iron–nickel [[Catalysis|catalyst]] or component, or in [[geology]], to the general composition of planetary cores (including [[Structure of the Earth#Core|Earth's]]).

Some iron–nickel alloys are called '''nickel steel''' and usually contain additional elements, depending on the purpose.

==Astronomy and geology==
[[Iron]] and [[nickel]] are notable for being the final elements produced by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], and the heaviest elements formed with a [[supernova]] or similarly cataclysmic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.18.090180.002151|title=Nuclear Abundances and Evolution of the Interstellar Medium|date=1980|last1=Wannier|first1=P G|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=18|pages=399|bibcode = 1980ARA&amp;A..18..399W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron and nickel are the most abundant metals in metallic [[meteorite]]s&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Brian Harold (1971) ''Handbook of Elemental Abundances in Meteorites'' Gordon and Breach, New York, {{ISBN|0-677-14950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth.

Nickel–iron alloys occur naturally on Earth's surface as [[telluric iron|telluric]] or [[meteoric iron]].

The affinity of nickel atoms ([[atomic number]] 28) for iron (atomic number 26) results in natural occurring [[alloy]]s and a large number of [[List of alloys|commercial alloys]], and provides a complex electron environment for catalyzing chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16511689|date=2006|last1=Pardo|first1=A|last2=De Lacey|first2=AL|last3=Fernández|first3=VM|last4=Fan|first4=HJ|last5=Fan|first5=Y|last6=Hall|first6=MB|title=Density functional study of the catalytic cycle of nickel-iron NiFe hydrogenases and the involvement of high-spin nickel(II)|volume=11|issue=3|pages=286–306|doi=10.1007/s00775-005-0076-3|journal=Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[steel]] metallurgy, nickel is alloyed with iron to produce [[maraging steel]] and some [[low-alloy steel]]s. Other technological uses include [[Invar]] and [[Mu-metal]].

==Overview==
The following table is an overview of different iron–nickel alloys. Naturally occurring alloys are a type of [[mineral]] and called [[Native element minerals|native elements]] or [[native metal]]s. Some of the entries have more than one crystal structure (e.g. [[meteoric iron]] is a mixture of two crystal structures).

'''''Island of the Blue Dolphins''''' is a 1960  [[children's literature|children's novel]] by American writer [[Scott O'Dell]], which tells the story of a 12-year-old girl stranded alone for years on an island off the [[California]] coast. It is based on the true story of [[Juana Maria]], a [[Nicoleño]] Native American left alone for 18 years on [[San Nicolas Island]] during the 19th century.

''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' won the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=isbndb&gt;
[http://isbndb.com/d/book/island_of_the_blue_dolphins_a02.html Island of the Blue Dolphins]. ISBNdb (2009). Retrieved 2009-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a [[Island of the Blue Dolphins (film)|film of the same name]] in 1964. O'Dell later wrote a sequel, ''[[Zia (novel)|Zia]]'', published in 1976.

The 50th Anniversary edition of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' includes a new introduction by Newbery Medalist [[Lois Lowry]] and also includes extracts from Father Gonzales Rubio in the [[Santa Barbara Mission]]'s Book of Burials. ''Island of the Blue Dolphins: The Complete Reader's Edition'', a [[critical edition]] edited by Sara L. Schwebel, was published in October 2016 by the [[University of California Press]]. It includes two chapters deleted from the book before publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Island-Blue-Dolphins-Complete-Readers/dp/0520289374/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479571694&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=island+of+the+blue+dolphins+readers+edition|title=Island of the Blue Dolphins: The Complete Reader's Edition: Scott O'Dell, Sara L.

==Historical basis==
The novel is based on the true story of "The Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island," a [[Nicoleño]] [[Native California]]n left alone for 18 years on [[San Nicolas Island]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] off the [[California]] coast, before being discovered and taken to the mainland in 1853 by sea otter hunter George Nidever and his crew. She is on record under the Christian name [[Juana Maria]], assigned to her by the Santa Barbara Mission where she eventually was brought. No one alive spoke her language. According to Nidever, the Lone Woman lived in a structure supported by whale ribs and stashed useful objects around the island. In 2009, University of Oregon archaeologist [[Jon M. Erlandson|Jon Erlandson]] found two old redwood boxes eroding from an island sea cliff, with a whale bone placed on top of them. With colleagues René Vellanoweth, Lisa Barnett-Thomas, and Troy Davis, Erlandson salvaged the boxes and other artifacts before they were destroyed by erosion. Vellanoweth and Barnett-Thomas later excavated the interior of the boxes in a San Nicolas Island laboratory and documented nearly 200 artifacts of Nicoleño, Euro-American, and Native Alaskan manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Erlandson, Jon M., Lisa Thomas-Barnett, René L. Vellanoweth, Steven J. Schwartz, &amp; Daniel R. Muhs. 2013. From the Island of the Blue Dolphins: a unique 19th century cache feature from San Nicolas Island, California. ''Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology'' 8:66-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The boxes appear to have been cached intentionally some time between 1815 and 1853, quite possibly by Juana Maria herself. It was also believed the Lone Woman lived in a cave on the island. In 2012, Naval archaeologist Steve Schwartz believed he discovered the buried location of that cave and began an investigation, working with archaeologist René Vellanoweth and his students from California State University, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chawkins |first=Steve |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lone-woman-cave-20121027,0,1564818.story |title='Island of the Blue Dolphins' woman's cave believed found |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commanders at the Navy base on the island about 65 miles southwest of Point Mugu ordered Schwartz to halt the dig in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sott.net/article/253022-Island-of-Blue-Dolphins-cave-possibly-found|title='Island of Blue Dolphins' cave possibly found -- Secret History -- Sott.net|work=SOTT.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Louis |last=Sahagun |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-c1-cave-artifacts-20150305-story.html#page=1|title=With island dig halted, Lone Woman still a stinging mystery|date=March 5, 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The main character is a Native American girl named Won-a-pa-lei, secret name is Karana. She has a brother named Ramo, whose curiosity usually leads to trouble, and a sister named Ulape. Her people live in a village called Ghalas-at and the tribe survives by means of gathering roots and fishing.

One day, a ship of Russian fur hunters and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] people led by Captain Orlov arrive and persuade the natives to let them hunt [[sea otter]] in exchange for other goods. However, the Russians attempt to swindle the islanders and leave without paying. When they are confronted by Karana's father [[Tribal chief|Chief]] Chowig, a battle breaks out. The tribe is reduced with Karana's father and many other men in the tribe dying in battle against the well-armed Russians who escape largely unscathed.

Later, the "replacement chief" Chief Kimki leaves the island on a canoe for new land in the East. Eventually, he sends a "giant canoe" to bring his people to the mainland even though he himself does not return. The white men who are missionaries come to Karana's village and tell them to pack their goods and go to the ship. Karana's brother Ramo misses the ship to retrieve his fishing spear. Although Karana urges the captain to wait for Ramo to return, the ship must leave before a storm approaches. Despite restraint, Karana jumps off the ship and swims to shore and the ship departs without them.

The siblings live alone on the island, hoping the ship will return. However, Ramo is brutally killed by a pack of [[Free-ranging dog|feral dogs]]. Alone on the island, Karana takes on traditionally male tasks, such as hunting, making [[spear]]s, and building [[canoes]] to survive. She vows to avenge her brother's death and kills several of the dogs, but has a change of heart when she encounters the leader of the pack. She tames him and names him Rontu (meaning "Fox Eyes" in her language).

Over time, Karana makes a life for herself. She builds a home made of [[whale]] bones and stocks a cave with provisions in case the Aleuts come back, so she can hide from them. As she explores her island, Karana discovers ancient artifacts and a large [[squid]] (which she calls a devilfish). As time passes, she decides to hunt the devilfish. She also tames some [[bird]]s and an otter while feeling a close kinship to the animals (the only inhabitants of the island beside herself).

One summer, the Aleuts return and Karana takes refuge in the cave. She observes the Aleuts closely and realizes that a girl named Tutok takes care of the domestic duties including getting water from the pool near Karana's cave. Fearful of being discovered, Karana goes out only at night, yet the curious girl stalks Karana and the two meet. Karana and Tutok meet several days in a row. However, when she lets Rontu out with her, Tutok calls him hers. Karana and Tutok exchange gifts, and she realizes how lonely she has been. Karana wishes that Tutok would not leave, yet the next day when Karana makes food for her she does not come. Karana goes searching and sees the ship departing. Sadly, she returns to her house and starts rebuilding.
 
More time passes and Rontu dies. Karana soon finds a young [[dog]] that looks like Rontu and takes him in naming him Rontu-Aru (meaning "Son of Rontu"). One day, Karana sees the sails of a ship. It docks at the shore, but then leaves. Two years later in the spring, the boat comes back, so Karana dresses in her finest attire and goes to the shore to meet the boat. Her rescuers see that her dress made of [[cormorant]] feathers is not appropriate for the mainland and they have a dress made for her. She does not like the dress, but Karana realizes that it is part of her new life. The ship takes Karana and Rontu-Aru to the [[Mission Santa Barbara|mission]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]]. There, she finds out that the ship that had taken her people away had later sunk before it could return from the mainland for her.

==Film adaptation==
{{main article|Island of the Blue Dolphins (film)}}
A film adaptation of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' was released on July 3, 1964. It was directed by [[James B. Clark (director)|James B. Clark]] and starred [[Celia Kaye]] as Karana. Jane Klove and Ted Sherdeman adapted the script from O'Dell's novel, and the film was produced by [[Robert B. Radnitz]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. The film was made on a slight budget but did receive a wide release three months after its New York premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/island_of_the_blue_dolphins/ "Island of the Blue Dolphins"].

'''John Stewart Collis''' (1900–1984) was an Irish biographer, rural author, and pioneer of the [[ecology movement]]. He is known for his book ''The Worm Forgives the Plough'' based on his wartime experience working in the [[Women's Land Army|Land Army]] in the [[Second World War]].

==Early life, biographer==

The son of an Irish solicitor, Collis was born at Kilmore on the borders of [[County Dublin]] and [[County Wicklow]], Ireland. He was educated at Bray preparatory school,&lt;ref name=Holroyd&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to 'The Worm Forgives the Plough' | publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins | year=1988 | author=Holroyd, Michael (Introduction); Collis, John Stewart (text) | chapter=Introduction | pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. At the Oxford Union he learnt the art of public speaking, hearing politicians and authors including [[H. H. Asquith]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Lloyd George]] and [[W. B. Yeats]] in the debating chamber.&lt;ref name=Holroyd/&gt; In the 1920s he became a close friend of the Guernsey-born [[Gerald Basil Edwards|G.B. Edwards]], who lodged at his flat in Guildford Street. Both men became protégés of [[John Middleton Murry]] and contributed to ''The Adelphi'' magazine but later drifted apart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], ''Genius Friend: G.B. Edwards and The Book of Ebenezer Le Page'', ([http://www.blueormer.co.uk/ Blue Ormer Publishing], 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Collis, however, wrote an enthusiastic review of Edwards's ''[[The Book of Ebenezer Le Page]]'' in the ''Spectator'' when this novel was posthumously published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Collis, 'Memories of a Genius Friend', ''The Spectator'', 31 July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collis's first book, a biography of [[George Bernard Shaw]], was published in 1925, followed by biographies of [[Havelock Ellis]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], the [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyles]] and [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref name=Drabble&gt;''[[The Oxford Companion to English Literature]]'', ed. [[Margaret Drabble]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country writing==

Collis is remembered largely for ''While Following the Plough'' (1946) and ''Down to Earth'' (1947: as one volume, ''The Worm Forgives the Plough'', 1973).&lt;ref name=Holroyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macfarlane&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to 'The Worm Forgives the Plough' | publisher=Random House, Vintage imprint | year=2009 | author=Macfarlane, Robert (Introduction); Collis, John Stewart (text) | authorlink=Robert Macfarlane (writer) | chapter=Introduction | pages=xi–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''While Following the Plough'' was inspired by the years he chose to spend working as a farm labourer in the [[Women's Land Army|Land Army]] (which mainly consisted of women, known as "land girls") in [[Sussex]] and [[Dorset]] during the [[Second World War]]. He worked at J. G. Maynard's farm at Stonegate in Sussex in 1940 for a year, and then moved to [[Tarrant Hinton]] in Dorset for the rest of the war. The manuscript of the book was rejected by twelve publishers. At last, [[Jonathan Cape]] accepted it, but requested much revision. Collis waited for a while and returned the manuscript largely unchanged, thanking the publisher for their suggestions; Jonathan Cape answered saying they were "delighted with the improvements".&lt;ref name=Holroyd/&gt;

''Down to Earth'' was inspired by the year he spent working for [[Rolf Gardiner]] after the war, thinning a fourteen-acre wood on his own, using only an axe and other hand tools.&lt;ref name=Macfarlane/&gt;

==Reception==

The novelist [[Margaret Drabble]] states that Collis wrote with imagination and authenticity about rural life, and that Collis's autobiography ''Bound upon a Course'' brought him belated recognition as a pioneer in the [[ecology movement]].&lt;ref name=Drabble/&gt;

The [[travel writer]] [[Robert Macfarlane (travel writer)|Robert Macfarlane]] praises his country writing as follows:

{{quote|Two remarkable books emerged from these years ... Both books are structured as a mosaic of tiny essaylets, riffs, visions, meditations and comic set-pieces (such as 'My Furrow', where he describes ploughing his first field-length, the result resembling a woozy sine-wave rather than a furrow, or his account of the blustery farmer Arthur Miles, whose favourite – and often only – word was 'bugger').&lt;ref name=Macfarlane/&gt;}}

The biographer [[Michael Holroyd]] comments that ''While Following the Plough'' and ''Down to Earth'' were "acclaimed on their appearance", and are now considered classics.&lt;ref name=Holroyd/&gt;

==Family==

The writer and [[paediatrician]] [[Robert Collis]] was his twin and [[Maurice Collis]], writer and biographer, was his elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/kildarenationalist/2006/11/02/story24207.asp Other News ...

==Legacy==

In 1986 [[Richard Ingrams]] wrote ''John Stewart Collis: A Memoir'' (Chatto &amp; Windus). A 2009 edition of ''The Worm Forgives the Plough'', with an introduction by Robert Macfarlane, was issued by Vintage Classics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vintageclassics.com.au/Author-Detail.aspx?Author=Collis,%20John%20Stewart John Stewart Collis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112031503/http://www.vintageclassics.com.au/Author-Detail.aspx?Author=Collis%2C+John+Stewart |date=12 November 2009 }} vintageclassics.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">'''Korravai''' ({{IAST|Korṛawai}}) or Korravi was the goddess of war and victory in ancient Tamil pantheon. She was considered the mother of [[Murugan]], the Hindu god of war, now patron god of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Korravai was perhaps the earliest and the most widely worshipped goddess of the ancient Tamil people." Tiwari (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest references to Korravai are found in the ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar [[Tolkappiyam]], considered to be the earliest work of the ancient [[Sangam literature]]. Korravai is identified with goddess [[Durga]]. In early iconography, Korravai is presented as fierce and bloodthirsty.

https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Durga_Korravai.jpg

Harvest and war was an important aspect in life of the ancient [[Tamils]] and they worshiped Korravai for the success on field and battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Dictionary of the Tamils" Vijaya Ramaswamy, 119 p.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a custom among ancient Tamil warriors and chieftains to offer the heads of slain enemies to goddess Korravai.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Dictionary of the Tamils" Vijaya Ramaswamy, 281 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Tamil script mentions that the devotees in a frenzy offer their own head to the goddess. [[Avipalli]] was mentioned in all the works except ''Veera Soliyam''. It was a self-sacrifice of a warrior to the goddess of war for the victory of his commander.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Insurgency and National Integration: A Study of Selected Ethnic Problems in South Asia (1997) p.114&lt;/ref&gt; During the Brahmanization of [[Tamilakam|Tamil country]], Korravai was adopted in Hindu pantheon and assigned to the goddess [[Durga]], [[Kali]] and Parameswari. The epic [[Silappadikaram]], clearly show that Korravai was completely absorbed in brahmanical tradition by merging with [[Durga]], which makes here to sister of [[Vishnu]] and consort of [[Shiva]]&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Dictionary of the Tamils" Vijaya Ramaswamy, 120 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tamil Nadu,  the [[blackbuck]] (Kalaimaan) is considered to be the vehicle of the Hindu goddess Korravai &lt;ref name=geer&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Geer|first1=A.|title=Animals in Stone : Indian Mammals Sculptured through Time |year=2008 |publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, South Holland (Netherlands)|isbn=9789004168190|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="krishna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishna|first1=N.|title=Sacred Animals of India|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Books India|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=9780143066194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate Korravai's place in the metaphysical world of the earliest sources, Kersenboom-Story provides a "tentative" fivefold classification of the disposition of the major spiritual powers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
According to the early Tamil literature, the divine manifests itself in various shapes, shades and degrees of intensity. In most cases it is thought of as a power that is highly ambivalent: possibly benevolent, but usually dangerous and even malevolant. The most striking aspect of man's relation to these different manifestations is his attempt to control them by means of some type of 'dramatic performance'. True evil is too powerful to be dealt with by humans and has to be subdued by the god Murugaṇ. ... Tentatively, we classify the manifestations of the divine as follows:
# benevolent: the god Murugaṇ; the king
# mildly ambivalent: [[Hero stone|hero-stone]]; ''kantu'' (stump of a tree)
# ambivalent: ''[[ananku (Tamil)|aṇaṅku]]'' 'sacred power'
# dangerous: ''pēy'', ''pūtam'' (demon); Koṛṛavai
# evil: ''cūr'', [[Cūraṇ]]&lt;ref&gt;Kersenboom-Story (1987): 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:İğneadaFloodplainForestsNP (2).JPG|thumb|Directional road sign for Lake Saka at the entrance of [[İğneada Floodplain Forests National Park]] near [[İğneada]].]]
The '''Lake Saka Nature Reserve''' ({{lang-tr|Saka Gölü Tabiatı Koruma Alanı}}) is a [[nature reserve]] at [[Sivriler, Demirköy|Sivriler]] village of [[Demirköy, Kırklareli|Demirköy]] district in [[Kırklareli Province]] of [[Turkey]] close to [[İğneada]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast. It gets its name from the Lake Saka ({{lang-tr|Saka Gölü}}), which is in the boundaries of the [[İğneada Floodplain Forests National Park]]. It is {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Demirköy, and {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} from İğneada.&lt;ref name="kyn"/&gt;

It covers an area of {{convert|1345|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. The sits is on a [[floodplain]] of a river that flows into the Black Sea, and seasonally floods thus rendering it a unique and one of the very few remaining floodplain forests in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="koi"/&gt;

==Flora==
In addition to the main flora of [[alder]] (''Alnus''), [[elm]] (''Ulmus'') and ash (''[[Fraxinus]]''), trees such as [[oak]] (''Quercus''), [[hornbeam]] (''Carpinus''), [[beech]] (''Fagaceae''), black poplar (''[[Populus nigra]]''), white poplar (''[[Populus alba]]''), [[willow]] (''Salix''), linden (''Tilia'') and [[walnut]] (''Juglans'') are found in the nature reserve.&lt;ref name="kyn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koi"/&gt;

==Fauna==
The fauna of the protected area consists of the [[mammal]]s: [[deer]] (''Cervidae''), [[roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), [[fox]] (''Canidae''), [[gray wolf]] ((''Canis lupus''), [[hare]] (''Lepus''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), [[wildcat]]  (''Felis silvestris'') and the birds [[swan]] (''Cygnus''), [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos''), [[greylag goose]] (''Anser anser''), [[woodcock]] (''Scolopax'') and [[common wood pigeon]] (''Columba palumbus''). The nature reserve is habitat for the [[reptile]]s such as viper ([[Viperidae]]), slow-worm (''[[Anguis fragilis]]'') and water snake. The lake is home to the fish species of [[carp]] (''Cyprinidae''), [[red seabream]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] (''Perciformes'') as well as to [[crustacean]]s like [[crayfish]].&lt;ref name="kyn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5304">[[File:Southern African Cratons.svg|thumb|300px|Southern Africa showing location of Limpopo belt]]
The '''Limpopo Belt''' is located in [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]], runs E-NE, and joins the [[Kaapvaal craton]] to the south with the [[Zimbabwe craton]] to the north. The belt is of high-grade [[metamorphic rocks]] that have undergone a long cycle of metamorphism and deformation that ended 2.0 billion years ago, after the stabilisation of the adjacent massifs. The belt comprises 3 components: the Central Zone, the North Marginal Zone and the South Marginal Zone.

==Ca. 3.2-2.9 Ga Limpopo Central Zone==
The 250&amp;nbsp;km wide Limpopo belt of southern Africa is an east-northeast trending zone of granulite facies [[tectonite]]s separating the granitoid-greenstone terranes of the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe cratons. Large scale ductile [[shear zone]]s are an integral part of Limpopo belt architecture. They define the boundaries between the belt and the adjacent cratons and separate internal zones within the belt. The shear zones forming the external (northern, southern and western) margins of the belt are interpreted as uplift structures of the overthickened crust.

The crustal evolution of the Limpopo Central Zone can be summarized into three main periods: 3.2-2.9 Ga, ~2.6 Ga, and ~2.0 Ga. The two first periods are mainly characterized by [[magma]]tic activity leading to the formation of [[Archean|Archaean]] [[Tonalite]]-[[Trondhjemite]]-[[Granodiorite]] (TTG) such as the Sand River Gneisses or the Bulai Granite intrusion. The Early [[Proterozoic]] event took place under high-grade [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] conditions during which partial melting formed large amount of [[granitic]] melt.&lt;ref&gt;Chavagnac, Valerie, Jan D. Kramers, and Thomas F. Naegler. (1999) "Can we Still Trust Nd Model Ages on Migmatized Proterozoic Rocks?" Journal of Conference Abstracts, Vol. 4, No. 1, Symposium A08, Early Evolution of the Continental Crust. Online: {{cite web |url=http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514104020/http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |archivedate=2006-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Limpopo Central Zone shows relics of late Archean high grade metamorphism. In the Northern (NMZ) and Southern Marginal Zones (SMZ) that adjoin the Zimbabwe and Kaapvaal cratons, respectively, the last high grade metamorphic episodes were late Archean. The relics in the Central Zone are characterised by an anticlockwise p-T-evolution, at ca. 2.55 Ga. In the NMZ repeated crustal remelting and intrusion of charnoenderbitic magmas continued to 2.58 Ga, producing counterclockwise p-T paths. In contrast the SMZ consists of medium to [[high pressure]] granulites, which underwent a clockwise p-T-evolution at ca. 2.69 Ga, followed by decompression and isobaric cooling. In the Northern Kaapvaal Craton (Renosterkoppies Greenstone Belt, Pietersburg area) [[Plate tectonics|tectonism]] took place under amphibolite facies conditions at ca. 2.75 Ga and can therefore not be related to any events in the Limpopo belt. Thus the different tectonic units have different late Archean tectonometamorphic histories. [[Trace element]] geochemistry as well as Pb + Nd isotope characteristics of the SMZ are similar to those of the Kaapvaal Craton, with low Th and U concentrations around 2 and 0.7 ppm. Low U concentrations in the SMZ are not a consequence of high grade metamorphism. The NMZ, with high Th, U concentrations (10.8 and 2.5 ppm) and radiogenic Pb, resembles the adjoining Zimbabwe craton more. The differences in late Archean tectonic styles between NMZ and SMZ+KC is a possible consequence of the differences in Th and U content of these provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, Lorenz, Jan D. Kramers, Katharina Kreissig and Mathis Passeraub. (1999) "The Two Marginal Zones of the Limpopo Belt Show Contrasting Styles of Archean Tectonometamorphism." {{cite web |url=http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514104020/http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |archivedate=2006-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The Mahalapye granite in the extreme western part of the Central Zone is a post-tectonic intrusion that crystallized at 2.023 Ga. This suggests that mineral ages of ca 2.0 Ga from the eastern part of the Central Zone date metamorphism during reworking of Archaean age shear zones rather than a collision between the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe cratons as has been earlier suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Richard and Stephen McCourt. (1999) "SHRIMP U-Pb Zircon Geochronology of Granites from the Western Part of the Limpopo Belt Southern Africa: Implications for the Age of the Limpopo Orogeny." {{cite web |url=http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514104020/http://www.the-conference.com/JConfAbs/4/140.html |archivedate=2006-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' 3rd Edition (see [[editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|editions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']]) was released in 2000. The first book containing monsters to be published was the ''[[Monster Manual]]'', released along with the other two "core" rulebooks. [[Wizards of the Coast]] officially discontinued the 3rd Edition line upon the release of a revision, known as version 3.5, in 2003, with the ''[[List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 edition monsters#WTC 17755 – Monster Manual (2003)|Monster Manual]]'' reprinted for the revised edition.

| [[Spanish Armada]] storms
| 1588
| After the Battle of Gravelines, the Armada was forced to flee northwards, and attempted to return to Spain by sailing around [[Scotland]] and Ireland. Here, the ships ran into a series of powerful westerly gales. Already in poor condition after an extended period at sea, many ships were sunk, or driven onto the coast and wrecked, with over 50 ships lost. The late 16th century, and especially 1588, was marked by unusually strong North Atlantic storms, perhaps associated with a high accumulation of polar ice off the coast of [[Greenland]], a characteristic phenomenon of the "[[Little Ice Age]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian | last=Fagan | title=The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History 1300–1850 | location=New York | publisher=Basic Books | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Christmas Hurricane of 1902]]
| 25-26&amp;nbsp;December 1902
| The [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] report a single measurement from a balloon at Hald in central [[Jutland]] with an hourly mean wind value of {{convert|35|m/s|km/h}}. DMI estimate the strongest winds probably reached {{convert|50|m/s|km/h}} or more. The storm was relatively short-lived and caused extensive damage to forestry as it passed from southern Norway to the [[Gulf of Riga]], with a swathe of damage stretching from north Jutland to [[Bornholm]]. The storm also saw significant flooding.&lt;ref name="Cappelen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cappelen|first=John|title=Bodil og det beskidte dusin|url=http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2013/12/bodil-og-det-beskidte-dusin/|accessdate=16 December 2013|newspaper=DMI|date=11 December 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Probably the most severe to affect Ireland since the [[Night of the Big Wind]], with an estimated 1000-3000 trees uprooted in [[Phoenix Park]], [[Dublin]]. Following a stormy period between the 18-26 which saw several depressions pass close by to the west coast of Ireland. The storm's low pressure was estimated at 975&amp;nbsp;mb (Lamb, 1991). A quote from [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]] by [[James joyce|James Joyce]] is likely based on the aftermath of this storm- "O yes, J.J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exceptional weather events|url=http://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/weather-events/Feb1903_storm.pdf|publisher=Met Éireann|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| 31&amp;nbsp;January–1 February 1953
| Considered to be the worst natural disaster of the 20th century both in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, claiming over two thousand lives altogether. A storm originating over Ireland moved around the Scottish west coast, over Orkney, down the east coast of Scotland and England and across the North Sea to the Netherlands. Sea defences in the Netherlands and eastern England were overwhelmed. The ferry ''[[MV Princess Victoria]]'', travelling between Scotland and Northern Ireland, was lost with 133 people drowned, and over a quarter of the Scottish fishing fleet was also lost. In the Netherlands, flooding killed 1,835&amp;nbsp;people and forced the emergency evacuation of 70,000 more as sea water inundated 1,365&amp;nbsp;km² of land. An estimated 30,000 animals drowned, and 47,300 buildings were damaged of which 10,000 were destroyed. Total damage was estimated at that time at 895&amp;nbsp;million Dutch guilders.

| [[Great Storm of 1987]]
| 15–16&amp;nbsp;October 1987
| This storm mainly affected southeastern England and northern France. In England maximum mean wind speeds of 70&amp;nbsp;knots (an average over 10&amp;nbsp;minutes) were recorded. The highest gust of {{convert|117|kn|km/h}} was recorded at [[Pointe du Raz]] in [[Brittany]]. In all, 19&amp;nbsp;people were killed in England and 4 in France. 15&amp;nbsp;million trees were uprooted in England. This storm received much media attention, not so much because of its severity, but because these storms do not usually track so far south, the trees and buildings are not used to such winds (indeed, in mid-October most [[deciduous]] trees still have their leaves and were therefore more susceptible to windstorm damage and, following weeks of wet weather, the ground was sodden, providing little grip for the trees' roots), the severity of the storm was not forecast until approximately 3 hrs before it hit and it struck after midnight, meaning few people had advance warning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

| During this storm, a gust of {{convert|123|kn|km/h}} was recorded at the [[Kinnaird Head|Kinnaird]] Lighthouse ([[Fraserburgh]]) on the north-east coast of Scotland. This broke the highest low-level wind speed record for the British Isles. Much higher (unofficial) windspeeds have been recorded on the summit of [[Cairn Gorm]] and on [[Unst]] in [[Shetland]].

Very few fatalities occurred, mainly due to the very low population of the islands and the fact that the islanders are used to very high winds.

The first storm in the series, dubbed Lothar by European forecasters, rapidly developed just off of the French coast and swept inland. Each of these systems was associated with an intense [[jet stream]] aloft and benefitted from latent heat release through atmosphere-ocean exchange processes. "Lothar" and "Martin", as the second storm was dubbed, were extratropical cyclones and had a hurricane-like shape, with an eye at the center {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. In the first storm, a gust of 184&amp;nbsp;km/h was recorded at [[Ushant]] (Fr. Ouessant) in [[Brittany]] and in the second storm, the highest gust was of 200&amp;nbsp;km/h at [[Île de Ré]] in France.

* [[Cyclone Gudrun|Erwin]] (Gudrun) 5–12 January 2005. Northern Europe was hit by the storm Erwin ([[Free University of Berlin]]), also called ''Gudrun'' by the Norwegian weather service, with sustained wind speeds of 126&amp;nbsp;km/h and wind gusts of 165&amp;nbsp;km/h. About 341,000 homes lost power in Sweden and several thousand of these were out of power for many days and even weeks; about 10,000 homes were still without power after three weeks. The international death toll was at least 17. The storm caused a lot of financial damage in Sweden, where the forest industry suffered greatly from damaged trees. In the south, 75 million m³ (98 million yd³) of trees blew down. In the space of 6 hrs, 250,000,000 trees were blown down, and after months of hard work, lorries and drivers from across Europe eventually transported the logs to several sites across the south of Sweden. One huge site was situated on a disused airfield, stretched for 2&amp;nbsp;km, 14&amp;nbsp;metres in height, and 10 piles in width. This was only 2% of the total logs stored, enough to create a 3&amp;nbsp;m x 3&amp;nbsp;m pile all the way to Australia.
* Gero 10–19 January 2005 On the evening of the 11th and early morning of the 12th, a ferocious gale swept across Northern Ireland and northwest Scotland.

One fatality occurred in Ireland and six in Scotland, including a family of five who were swept into the sea after fleeing their house on South Uist. At the height of the storm, 85,000 households in Scotland were without power. On the 13th, all [[Caledonian MacBrayne]] ferry services and train services in Scotland were suspended, and many roads were closed due to fallen trees. The [[Forth Road Bridge]] was closed for the first time since the 1998 [[Boxing Day Storm]], and the [[Tay Road Bridge|Tay]] ([[Dundee]]) and [[Friarton Bridge|Friarton]] ([[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]) bridges were also closed to all traffic.

A strong [[jet stream]] was also present at the time. This system was one of several strong storms to hit the United Kingdom during the winter of 2006–2007, linked to the strong [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] event taking place at the time. With a central pressure of 951 hPa, sustained winds exceeded {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a gust of {{convert|94|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was recorded in [[Benbecula]] late on 10 January. Additional hurricane-force gusts were recorded in Scotland. Gale-force winds were recorded in the south of the United Kingdom and in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], and gusts of over {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} affected the entire country. Northern areas received gusts of between 60 and {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The depression was named Franz by the Free University of Berlin.

Six fatalities have been confirmed, along with several injuries. Five people were killed when a trawler sank off the coast near [[Wexford]], in Ireland and another person was killed near [[Taunton]], [[Somerset]] when a tree crushed his car. Another trawler went missing. Two survivors were recovered. One woman went missing after falling overboard on a ferry near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. A supermarket in Wales had its roof damaged, and residents across the United Kingdom reported other minor damage. 80,000 homes lost power in Wales. Flooding occurred in several areas, with several rivers overflowing. The [[Environment Agency]] issued 59 flood warnings.

The storm exacerbated existing flooding problems (caused by violent thunderstorms a week earlier) and areas such as Sheffield were worst affected. Over 102 flood warnings were issued, and by 29 June, five people were dead, many areas flooded and there was severe damage to the [[Ulley reservoir]], where cracks appeared in the dam wall, causing fears that it might collapse. 700&amp;nbsp;people were evacuated from the area.

The [[NorthLink Ferries|Northlink]] ferry company cancelled sailings between Lerwick and Aberdeen. There were also reports of trees and roofs being blown down, such as in Grampian. The combination of Northwesterly winds exceeding {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, low pressure and high spring tides led authorities to expect severe flooding in the east of England, to close the [[Thames Barrier]]. Many said that these conditions mirrored the [[North Sea Flood of 1953]]. In the Netherlands, the [[Oosterscheldekering|Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier]] and the gigantic [[Maeslantkering]] (sealing off the Rotterdam harbor) were closed. For the first time since 1976, the entire coastline was put on alert and under round-the-clock surveillance. The tidal surge traveling down the North Sea turned out to be too weak to cause any significant problems to the strong Dutch coastal defenses.

From 24 March an area of high pressure began to build across southern and mid Norway.&lt;ref name="Toppe" /&gt; The low passed over Finland leaving 20,000 without power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sähkökatkot Pentti-myrskyn jäljiltä pääosin korjattu|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/sahkokatkot_pentti-myrskyn_jaljilta_paaosin_korjattu/7150597|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=YLE|date=22 March 2014|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gannet Peak with Gannett Glacier.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Gannett Peak]] is the highest summit of the [[Wind River Range]], the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Wyoming|State of Wyoming]], and the [[Central Rocky Mountains]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Wyoming|State of Wyoming]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 40 highest major summits of Wyoming by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 40 most prominent summits of Wyoming.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 40 most isolated major summits of Wyoming.

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of Wyoming, five peaks exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, 16 peaks exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 38 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

==History==

The development has been undertaken from a project on Modern Diffraction Methods for the Investigation of Thermo-Mechanical Processes,&lt;ref&gt;ThermoMech.Pro http://www.ansto.gov.au/ResearchHub/Bragg/CurrentResearch/ScientificProjects/Thermo-MecPro/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and started with cold deformation of a copper specimen at the ESRF in 2007, followed by hot deformation of zirconium alloy at APS in 2008. Soon afterwards, a series of other materials has been tested and experience with the timeline traces gained. While [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility|ESRF]] and [[Advanced Photon Source|APS]] played the major role in experimental facilities,the Japanese high-energy synchrotron in the round, [[SPring-8]] followed in 2013 by performing feasibility studies of this kind.  Meanwhile, the new [[DESY#PETRA III|PETRA-III]] synchrotron at DESY built a dedicated beamline for this purpose, opening the Materials Oscilloscope investigations to a larger public. The name [[Materials Oscilloscope]] has been introduced in 2013 and used onward upon conferences such as MRS and TMS,.&lt;ref&gt;17. September 2013, Neutron Industrial Promotion Workshop on Residual Stress and Strain Analysis, Tokyo, Japan, invited talk: Klaus-Dieter  Liss: "Modern Diffraction Methods for the Investigation of Thermo-Mechanical Processes"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neutron and synchrotron radiation with applications for in-situ studies in materials science http://www.campnano.org/web/en/communication/invited_visitors/2014/1016/728.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

Besides setups in multi-purpose facilities, the first dedicated end-station as been built at the PETRA-III storage ring, where this technique is routinely applied.

In [[Canada]], [[motor vehicle]]s are primarily powered by [[gasoline]] or [[diesel fuel]]. Other energy sources include [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], [[propane]], [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG), [[battery electric vehicle|electric batteries]] charged from an external source, and [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen]]. Canada, like most countries, has [[excise tax]]es and other taxes on gasoline, diesel, and other liquid and gas motor fuels (collectively called [[fuel tax]]es), and also taxes [[electricity]] at various administrative levels. Most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] in Canada also have taxes on these motor fuels, and some [[metropolitan area]]s such as [[Montreal]], [[TransLink (British Columbia)|Greater Vancouver]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] impose additional taxes.

Additionally, Canada's [[Government of Canada|federal (national) government]] collects [[value-added tax]] ([[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|GST]]) across the country, and some provincial governments also collect a [[Sales taxes in Canada#Provincial sales taxes|provincial sales tax]] (PST), which may be combined with the GST into a single [[harmonized sales tax]] (HST). HST, GST, or GST + PST where applicable, are calculated on the retail price ''including'' the excise taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Oil and Gas Prices, Taxes and Consumers | date=July 2006 | publisher=Department of Finance (Canada) | url =http://www.fin.gc.ca/toce/2006/gas_tax-e.html | work = | pages =6b) Application of the GST | accessdate = 2007-12-13 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071120021637/http://www.fin.gc.ca/toce/2006/gas_tax-e.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Canada, motor fuel taxes can vary greatly between locales. On average, about one-third of the total price of gasoline at the pump is tax. Total minimum taxes (taxes before GST/HST/PST is added at the retail level, but including GST/HST/PST on the excise taxes themselves) vary from 17.0¢/litre (64.4¢/US gallon) in the [[Yukon]] to 41.01¢/L ($1.552/US gallon) in Greater Vancouver.

==Tax revenues==

{{see also|Sales taxes in Canada}}

The [[Government of Canada]] collects about $5 billion per year in excise taxes on gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ARCHIVED - BACKGROUNDER – OIL AND GAS PRICES, TAXES AND CONSUMERS | publisher=[[Department of Finance Canada]] |date=October 2005 | url=http://www.fin.gc.ca/toc/2005/gas_tax-eng.asp | accessdate = 7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as approximately $1.6 billion per year from GST revenues on gasoline and diesel (net of input tax credits). The [[Canada Revenue Agency]], a part of the government, collects these taxes.

Collectively, the provincial governments collect approximately $8 billion per year from excise taxes on gasoline and diesel.

The federal taxes go into general coffers and help to fund a range of programs: $2 billion of the approximately $5 billion collected from federal excise taxes goes into the now permanent annual Gas Tax Fund for municipal infrastructure. Provincial tax revenues usually go to fund road repair and construction, and additionally in some provinces a portion of revenues (for example, 2 cents/litre in Ontario) is also distributed directly to municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |author=Ministry of Transportation | title=Backgrounder - How municipalities benefit from provincial gas tax funding | date= | publisher=Government of Ontario, Canada | url =http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/news/provincial/2004/102204a.shtml | work =Canada NewsWire | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''natural environment''' encompasses all [[life|living]] and non-living things occurring [[nature|naturally]], meaning in this case not [[Artificiality|artificial]]. The term is most often applied to the [[Earth]] or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [[species]], [[climate]], weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D. L.|first2=S. H.|last2=Ambrose|first3=T. J.|last3=Bassett|first4=M. L.|last4=Bowen|first5=D. E.|last5=Crummey|first6=J. S.|last6=Isaacson|first7=D.

E.|last10=Winter-Nelson|year=1997|title=Meanings of Environmental Terms|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|volume=26|issue=3|pages=581–589|doi=10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600030002x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of the ''natural environment'' can be distinguished as components:
* Complete [[ecological units]] that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [[microorganism]]s, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries and their nature. 
* Universal [[natural resource]]s and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from civilized human actions

In contrast to the natural environment is the [[built environment]]. In such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment.  Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [[hut]] or a [[photovoltaic system]] in the [[desert]], the modified environment becomes an artificial one.  Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [[beaver dam|beaver dams,]] and the works of [[Mound-building termites]], are thought of as natural.

People seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from  100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Symons |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=31 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-502535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the [[mineralogy|mineralogic composition]] and the [[soil structure|structure]] of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

''Natural environment'' is often used as a synonym for [[habitat]]. For instance, when we say that the natural environment of giraffes is the [[savanna]].

Earth science generally recognizes 4 spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]]&lt;ref name="wheeling"&gt;
[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html     Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=2007-08-31 }}. ©1997-2000.

Some scientists include, as part of the spheres of the Earth, the [[cryosphere]] (corresponding to [[ice]]) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the [[pedosphere]] (corresponding to [[soil]]) as an active and intermixed sphere. [[Earth science]] (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four major [[discipline]]s in earth sciences, namely [[geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]] and [[geodesy]]. These major disciplines use [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or ''[[Outline of Earth sciences#Earth's spheres|spheres]]'' of Earth.

{{clear}}

==Geological activity==
{{Main|Geology}}
The Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]]  cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.

==Water on Earth==
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright=0.55|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Coral reef]]s have significant marine [[biodiversity]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Most water is found in one or another natural kind of [[body of water]].

=== Oceans ===
{{Main|Ocean}}
An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233027/http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]].

=== Rivers ===
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], a [[sea]] or another river.  A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water. 
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky stream in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]]]

The water in a river is usually in a [[channel (geography)|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook.  Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.  Streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113503/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lácar Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuquén|Argentina}}.]]

{{Main|Lake}}

A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]].  A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake
|author=Britannica Online
|accessdate=2008-06-25
|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Dictionary.com definition
|accessdate=2008-06-25
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lake
|quote=a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
{{clear}}

==== Ponds ====
{{Main|Pond}}
A pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=203 - 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for humans, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.&lt;ref name=Goudie/&gt;

== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|Atmospheric gases [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter blue light more than other wavelengths]], creating a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space.]]
[[File:Troposphere CIMG1853.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Earth's [[troposphere]] from an [[airplane]].]]

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the Atmosphere===
{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}

====Principal layers====
Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.
* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties.
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.

====Effects of global warming====
[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The Retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]].]]
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}

The potential dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly.–This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]]. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:

* The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention Treaty]] and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html Kyoto Protocol] from [http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Climate Initiative]], to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative], Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

===Climate===

Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Thornthwaite]], "An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate", ''Geographical Review'', 38:55-94, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; in use since 1948, uses [[evapotranspiration]] as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of [[climate change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCs5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=The+Thornthwaite+system,+in+use+since+1948,+incorporates+evapotranspiration+in+addition+to+temperature+and+precipitation+information+and+is+used+in+studying+animal+species+diversity+and+potential+impacts+of+climate+changes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o21x1valsx&amp;sig=L9fJcuBCNchRY8bf7kSRcnWA7VQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_05vijqndAhXTMn0KHf00BboQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Thornthwaite%20system,%20in%20use%20since%201948,%20incorporates%20evapotranspiration%20in%20addition%20to%20temperature%20and%20precipitation%20information%20and%20is%20used%20in%20studying%20animal%20species%20diversity%20and%20potential%20impacts%20of%20climate%20changes&amp;f=false|title=English for geographers|last=García|first=Carmen Isabel Luján|date=2013-06-19|publisher=Editorial Club Universitario|isbn=9788499485676|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate

Surface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

==Life==
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;There are many [[plant species]] on the planet.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;An example of the many [[animal species]] on the [[Earth]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Evidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]". University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s. In [[biology]], the science of living organisms, "life" is the condition which distinguishes active [[organism]]s from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic matter]], including the capacity for growth, [[Physiology|functional activity]] and the continual change preceding death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary. English Edition 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |access-date=2009-06-21 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the [[biosphere]] on [[Earth]], and properties common to these organisms—[[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]—are a [[Carbon-based life|carbon]]- and [[Water and life|water]]-based [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] form with complex [[organization]] and heritable [[gene]]tic information. Living organisms undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[Cell growth|grow]], respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduce]] and, through [[natural selection]], adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

==Ecosystems==
[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|left|[[Rainforest]]s often have a great deal of [[biodiversity]] with many plant and animal species. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]
{{Main|Ecosystem}}

An [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]] The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].

A greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

==Biomes==
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to ''as'' ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

==Biogeochemical cycles==

{{Main|Biogeochemical cycles}}

Global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V. (2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

==Wilderness==

[[File:Togiak Wilderness.jpg|thumb|The [[Ahklun Mountains]] and the [[Togiak Wilderness]] within the [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}

[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

{{See also|List of environmental issues}}
It is the common understanding of ''natural environment'' that underlies [[environmentalism]] — a broad [[politics|political]], [[sociology|social]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, ''wild'' nature (e.g., unmanaged [[forests]], uncultivated [[grasslands]], [[wildlife]], [[wildflower]]s) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [[environmental scientist]]s and [[environmentalist]]s include:

* Elimination of [[pollution]] and [[toxicant]]s in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of [[biodiversity]] and protection of [[endangered species]].
* [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of resources such as [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Escolero, O. |author2=Kralisch, S. |author3=Martínez, S.E. |author4=Perevochtchikova, M.|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced [[global warming]], which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from [[fossil fuels]] to [[renewable energy]] in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability.  This may include [[public transportation]] and [[distributed generation]], which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Establishment of [[nature reserve]]s for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting [[waste management]] including [[waste reduction]] (or even [[zero waste]]), [[reuse]], [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] of sewage sludge.

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dale. (2007). The Heart of Environmentalism. In R. Sandler &amp; P. C. Pezzullo. Environmental Justice and Environmentalism. (pp. 85-101).

'''Negative energy''' is a concept used in [[physics]] to explain the nature of certain [[field (physics)|fields]], including the [[gravitational field]] and various [[quantum field]] effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in [[wormhole]]s which may allow for [[time travel]] and [[warp drive]]s for faster-than-light space travel.

==Gravitational energy==
{{Main|Gravitational energy}}
The strength of the gravitational attraction between two objects represents the amount of [[gravitational energy]] in the field which attracts them towards each other. When they are infinitely far apart, the gravitational attraction and hence energy approach zero. As two such massive objects move towards each other, the motion accelerates under [[gravity]] causing an increase in the positive kinetic energy of the system. At the same time, the gravitational attraction - and hence energy - also increase in magnitude, but the [[law of energy conservation]] requires that the net energy of the system not change. This issue can only be resolved if the change in gravitational energy is negative, thus cancelling out the positive change in kinetic energy. Since the gravitational energy is getting stronger, this decrease can only mean that it is negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[universe]] in which positive energy dominates will eventually collapse in a "[[big crunch]]", while an "open" universe in which negative energy dominates will either expand indefinitely or eventually disintegrate in a "[[big rip]]". In the [[zero-energy universe]] model ("flat" or "Euclidean"), the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly [[zero]]: its amount of positive energy in the form of [[matter]] is exactly cancelled out by its negative energy in the form of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''The Grand Design'', 2010, Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field effects==
Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual particles===
{{Main|Virtual particles}}
In quantum theory, the [[uncertainty principle]] allows the vacuum of space to be filled with [[virtual particles|virtual]] particle-antiparticle pairs which appear spontaneously and exist for only a short time before, typically, annihilating themselves again. Some of these virtual particles can have negative energy. Their behaviour plays a role in several important phenomena, as described below.

===Casimir effect===
{{Main|Casimir effect}}
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of [[virtual particle]] pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. This causes an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured.&lt;ref name="fordroman"&gt;Ford and Roman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawking radiation===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}
[[Virtual particles]] with negative energy can exist for a short period. This phenomenon is a part of the mechanism involved in [[Hawking radiation]] by which [[black hole]]s evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''A Brief History of Time'', Bantam 1988, Pages 105-107. {{ISBN|0-593-01518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squeezed light===
{{Main|Squeezed light}}
It is possible to arrange multiple beams of laser light such that destructive [[quantum interference]] suppresses the [[vacuum fluctuations]]. Such a squeezed vacuum state involves negative energy. The repetitive waveform of light leads to alternating regions of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

===Dirac sea===
{{Main|Dirac sea}}
According to the theory of the [[Dirac sea]], developed by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930, the [[vacuum]] of space is full of negative energy. This theory was developed to explain the anomaly of negative-energy [[quantum states]] predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

The Dirac sea theory correctly predicted the existence of [[antimatter]] two years prior to the discovery of the [[positron]] in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. However, the Dirac sea theory treats antimatter as a hole where there is the absence of a particle rather than as a real particle. [[Quantum field theory]] (QFT), developed in the 1930s, deals with antimatter in a way that treats antimatter as made of real particles rather than the absence of particles, and treats a vacuum as being empty of particles rather than full of negative-energy particles like in the Dirac sea theory.

Quantum field theory has displaced the Dirac sea theory as a more popular explanation of these aspects of physics. Both the Dirac sea theory and quantum field theory are equivalent by means of a [[Bogoliubov transformation]], so the Dirac sea can be viewed as an alternative formulation of quantum field theory, and is thus consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López de Recalde|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=The Standard Electro-Weak Theory, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=mNevDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=dirac+sea+equivalent+transformation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dirac%20sea%20equivalent%20transformation&amp;f=false|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|publisher=LuLu Press, Inc.|page=65|isbn=978-1-365-65887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative suggestions==
===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Negative energy appears in the speculative theory of [[wormhole]]s, where it is needed to keep the wormhole open. A wormhole directly connects two locations which may be separated arbitrarily far apart in both space and time, and in principle allows near-instantaneous travel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269288/STEPHEN-HAWKING-How-build-time-machine.html How to build a time machine]", ''Mail Online'' 27 April 2010(retrieved 4 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp drive===
{{Main|Warp drive}}
A theoretical principle for a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) warp drive for spaceships has been suggested, involving negative energy. The [[Alcubierre drive]] comprises a solution to Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]], in which a bubble of spacetime is moved rapidly by expanding space behind it and shrinking space in front of it.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

'''Nuisance wildlife management''' is the term given to the process of selective removal of problem individuals or populations of specific species of wildlife. Other terms for the field, include '''wildlife damage management''', '''wildlife control''', and '''animal damage control''' to name a few. Some species of wildlife may become habituated to man's presence, causing property damage or risking transfer of disease to humans or pets ([[zoonosis]]). Many wildlife species coexist with humans very successfully, such as [[commensal]] rodents which have become more or less dependent on humans.

==Characteristics of nuisance species==
[[File:Deer-damaged tomato.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Deer-damaged tomato plant has been stripped of developing fruit]]
Typically, species that are most likely to be considered a nuisance by humans have the following characteristics. First, they are adaptable to [[fragmented habitat]]. Animals such as [[Canada geese]] (''Branta canadensis'') love ponds with low sloping banks leading to lush green grass. Humans love this sort of landscaping too, so it is not surprising that Canada geese have thrived (not to mention the decline in hunting).

Second, these animals are not tied to eating a specific type of food. For example, [[lynx]] do not thrive in human impacted environments because they rely so heavily on [[snowshoe hares]]. In contrast, [[raccoon]]s have been very successful in urban landscapes because they can live in attics, chimneys, and even sewers, and can sustain themselves with food gained from trashcans and discarded litter. 

Third, successful animals must not pose an obvious significant risk to human health and safety. Animals perceived as grave threats will incur the extreme ire of humans and be under constant threat of humans seeking to eliminate them.

Finally, successful animals in humanized landscapes are often perceived as "cute", at least until they become so numerous that their preferential status becomes diminished. Many wildlife species have the potential of becoming a "nuisance" species, and whether or not a species is regarded as a pest can be directly correlated with the degree to which that animal can be tolerated by humans. For many people, [[tree squirrels]] feeding in their yards or gardens are not a problem; a neighbor may feel that these same squirrels nesting in the attic of their house are a nuisance and a fire hazard, due to their habit of gnawing on electrical cables.

==Common nuisance species ==&lt;!-- Add wild hogs/boars that have become prevalent from Texas to Mississippi and carry numerous diseases dangerous to other animals and humans. Go to Texas A&amp;M wildlife management reports...--&gt;
[[File:Protected Puerto Rican Boa.jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Rican Boa]] came through toilet]]
Common wildlife pests include [[armadillo]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[boar]]s, [[fox]]es, [[squirrel]]s, [[snake]]s, [[rat]]s, [[groundhog]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[bat]]s, [[Mole (animal)|mole]]s, [[deer]], [[mouse|mice]], [[coyote]]s, [[bear]]s, [[raven]]s, [[seagull]]s, [[woodpecker]]s and [[pigeon]]s. Some of these species are protected by state or federal regulations, such as bears, ravens, bats, deer, woodpeckers, and coyotes, and a permit may be required to control some species.

Wildlife are usually only pests in certain situations, such as when their numbers become "excessive" in a particular area. Human-induced changes in the environment will often result in increased numbers of a species. For example, piles of scrap building material make excellent sites where rodents can nest. Food left out for household pets is often equally attractive to some wildlife species. In these situations, the wildlife have suitable food and habitat and may become a nuisance.

==Controlling wildlife damage==
 [[File:Waschbaer auf dem Dach.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Raccoon]] on a roof.]]
The primary objective of any control program should be to reduce damage in a practical, humane and environmentally acceptable manner. Wildlife managers and wildlife control operators (WCOs) use control methods based on the habits and biology of the animals causing damage. By using methods matched to the nuisance species, control efforts will be more effective and will serve to maximize safety to the environment, humans and other animals.

A key to controlling wildlife damage is prompt and accurate determination of which animal is causing the damage. Even someone with no training or experience can sometimes identify the pest by thoroughly examining the damaged area. Because feeding indications of many wildlife species are similar, other signs – such as droppings, tracks, burrows, nests or food caches – are usually needed to make a positive species identification.

After the wildlife pest is identified, control methods can be chosen appropriate to the animal species involved. Improper control methods may harm but not kill the animal, causing it to become leery of those and other methods in the future. For example, using traps and poison baits improperly or in the wrong situation may teach the animal that the control method is harmful. This may make the animal difficult to control later, even with the correct method.

:Four steps lead to a successful nuisance wildlife control program:
*Correctly identify the species causing the problem.
*Alter the habitat, if possible, to make the area less attractive to the wildlife pest.
*Use a control method appropriate to the location, time of year, and other environmental conditions.
*Monitor the site for re-infestation in order to determine if additional control is necessary.

==Control methods==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
The most commonly used methods for controlling nuisance wildlife around homes and gardens include exclusion, habitat modification, repellents, toxic baits, glue boards, traps and frightening.  Wildlife control involves human risks both from possible injury to person and property, but also from [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] disease.

===Exclusion===
Physically excluding an offending animal from the area being damaged or disturbed is often the best and most permanent way to control the problem. Depending upon size of the area to be protected, this control method can range from inexpensive to prohibitively costly.

For example, damage by birds or rabbits to ornamental shrubs or garden plants can be reduced inexpensively by placing bird netting over the plants to keep the pests away. On the other hand, fencing out deer from a lawn or garden can be more costly. Materials needed for exclusion will depend upon the species causing the problem. Large mammals can be excluded with woven wire fences, poly-tape fences, and electric fences; but many communities forbid the use of electric fencing in their jurisdictions. Small mammals and some birds can be excluded with netting, tarp, hardware cloth or any other suitable material; nets come in different weave sizes suitable for different animals to be excluded.

However, exclusion can interfere with the natural movement of wildlife, particularly when exclusion covers large areas of land.

===Habitat modification===
Modifying an animal’s habitat often provides lasting and cost-effective relief from damage caused by nuisance wildlife. Habitat modification is effective because it limits access to one or more of the requirements for life – food, water or shelter. However, habitat modification, while limiting nuisance wildlife, may also limit desirable species such as songbirds as well.

Rodent- or bat-proofing buildings by sealing cracks and holes prevents these animals from gaining access to suitable habitats where they are not welcome. Storing seed and pet food in tightly closed containers, controlling weeds and garden debris around homes and buildings, and storing firewood and building supplies on racks or pallets above ground level are also practices that can limit or remove the animals’ sources of food, water or shelter.

===Repellents===
Using a repellent that changes the behavior of an animal may lead to a reduction or elimination of damage. Several available repellents, such as objectionable-tasting coatings or odor repellents, may deter wildlife from feeding on plants. Other repellents such as sticky, tacky substances placed on or near windows, trees or buildings may deter many birds and small mammals. Unfortunately, most wildlife soon discover that repellents are not actually harmful, and the animals may quickly become accustomed to the smell, taste or feel of these deterrents.

Chemical repellents applied outdoors will have to be reapplied due to rain or heavy dew, or applied often to new plant growth to be effective.  Failure to carefully follow the directions included with repellents can drastically diminish the effectiveness of the product. Some repellents contain toxic chemicals, such as [[paradichlorobenzene]], and are ineffective unless used at hazardous concentrations.  Other more natural repellents contain [[chili pepper]] or [[capsaicin]] extracted from hot peppers.

However, even under the best of conditions, repellents frequently fail to live up to user expectations. The reason for this is twofold. First, many repellents simply don't work. For example, peer-reviewed publications have consistently shown that ultrasonic devices do not drive unwanted animals away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Second, even when the repellent has been shown to work, animals in dire need of food will "hold their nose" and eat anyway because the alternative is essentially death by starvation. Repellents are most successful (referring to products actually demonstrated by peer-reviewed research to be effective) when animals have access to alternative food sources in a different location.

===Glue traps and boards===
Glue traps and boards can be either a lethal or non-lethal method of control. Glue boards can be used to trap small mammals and snakes. Applying [[vegetable oil]] will dissolve the glue, allowing for release, but caution must be taken to avoid scratches and bites from the trapped animal.

===Live trapping===
Using traps can be very effective in reducing actual population numbers of certain species. However, many species cannot be trapped without a permit. In most cases, homeowners may trap an offending animal within 100 yards of their residence without a permit, however relocation is often illegal.

Traditional live traps such as cage or box traps are easily purchased at most garden centers or hardware stores. These traps allow for safe release of the trapped animal. The release of the animal to another area may be prohibited by state law, or may be regulated by the local Department of Fish and Game. Leghold traps may allow for either release or euthanasia of the trapped animal. Traps such as body-gripping traps, scissor and harpoon traps, as well as rat/mouse snap traps, are nearly always lethal. Knowledge of animal behavior, trapping techniques, and baits is essential for a successful trapping program.(Bornheimer, Shane P. "PreferredWildlifeservices.com" July 2013)

===Frightening devices===
Frightening devices such as bells, whistles, horns, clappers, sonic emitters, audio tapes and other sound devices may be quite successful in the short term for repelling an animal from an area. Other objects such as effigies, lights, reflectors and windmills rely on visual stimulation to scare a problem animal away. Often nuisance animals become accustomed to these tactics, and will return later if exposed to these devices daily.

===Sonic nets===
In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary created a new method of deterring birds and other animals using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dieckman |first=E. |last2=Skinner |first2=E. |last3=Mahjoub |first3=G. |last4=Swaddle |first4=J. |last5=Hinders |first5=M. |title=Benign exclusion of birds using parametric arrays |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=133 |issue=5 |pages=3536 |date=June 2013 |doi=10.1121/1.4806387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial objectives of the technology were to displace problematic birds from airfields to reduce bird strike risks, minimize agricultural losses due to pest bird foraging, displace nuisance birds that cause extensive repair and chronic clean-up costs, and reduce bird mortality from flying into man-made structures.   The sounds, referred to as a “Sonic Net,” do not have to be loud and are a combination of wave forms - collectively called "colored" noise - forming non-constructive and constructive interference with how birds and other animals such as deer talk to each other. Technically, the Sonic Nets technology is not a bird or wildlife scarer, but discourages birds and animals from going into or spending time in the target area.  The impact to the animals is similar to talking in a crowded room, and since they cannot understand each other they go somewhere else.  Early tests at an aviary and initial field trials at a landfill and airfield indicate that the technology is effective and that birds do not habituate to the sound.  The provisional and full patents were filed in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and further research and commercialization of the technology are ongoing.{{fact|date=September 2014}}

==Laws==
Before initiating any wildlife control activities, a person must become familiar with applicable federal, state, and local laws. One way to learn these rules is to contact the state's wildlife agency, which is usually responsible for selling hunting and fishing licenses.  In general, property owners are permitted to prevent wildlife damage through exclusion and habitat modification, though they may be prohibited from disturbing an occupied nest or den, or directly harming an animal.

Many regulations exist in the United States concerning animal trapping including trap check intervals, usually requiring all traps be checked at least once during a 24-hour period.  Some governments permit relocation of wildlife, however humane considerations must be taken into account before relocating wildlife, including population and habitat.

==Ethics==
There are many ethical considerations in nuisance wildlife management. Some species of wildlife cannot be ethically relocated due to overabundance of competing species, or lack of availability of proper food and habitat. Control during the spring months does run the risk of killing the young by starvation. Proper euthanasia of animals when necessary is also a controversial and sensitive consideration to be taken prior to engaging in nuisance wildlife management, and requires training and certification in some areas of the United States. {{Citation needed|reason=Too vague|date=October 2017}}

[[Image:PeleTears large.jpg|thumb|Assorted shapes of Pele's tears from [[Mauna Ulu]]. [[Dime (United States coin)|U.S. dime]] for scale in lower right.]]

'''Pele’s tears''' are small pieces of solidified [[lava]] drops formed when airborne particles of molten material fuse into tearlike drops of [[volcanic glass]]. Pele’s tears are jet black in color and are often found on one end of a strand of [[Pele's hair]]. Pele's tears is primarily a scientific term used by [[volcanologist]]s. 

Pele's tears, like Pele's hair, are named after [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian]] fire goddess of [[volcanoes]].

==Formation==

The formation of these tears is a complex process depending on a number of different factors as a tiny droplet of [[lava]] is being erupted from a [[Lava#Lava fountains|lava fountain]].  Whilst it is travelling through the air two things are happening:  It is cooling down very rapidly (a process known as quenching) and it is being deformed.  The deformation of a droplet depends on the speed at which it is erupted from the volcano, its [[surface tension]], the [[viscosity]] (thickness) of the magma and the resistance it experiences as it travels through the air.

Pele's tears are also found entangled within fine strands of volcanic glass known as Pele’s hair and it was considered that they formed together under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="shimozura"/&gt;  Shimozura (1994) investigated this further and found that the velocity of the erupting lava was the main factor in determining whether Pele’s tears or Pele's hair were formed.  If the velocity of the erupting magma is high then Pele’s hair is formed and if the velocity is low the formation of Pele’s tears is favoured.&lt;ref name="shimozura"&gt;Shimozuru, D. Physical parameters governing the formation of Pele's hair and tears. Bulletin of Volcanology (1994) 56:217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the microscope very tiny Pele’s tears (less than 1&amp;nbsp;μm) can be found within the cavities of Pele’s hair.&lt;ref name='Moune'&gt;Moune et al, (2007) Pele's hair and tears: Natural probe of volcanic plume. Journal of Geothermal Research 164, 244-253&lt;/ref&gt;  This would suggest they formed prior to being trapped within the strand and supports a different mechanism for formation.  It has been considered that they became trapped during transport in the eruptive plume.

==Scientific importance==
[[File:Book-Hawaii-Vtorov-peletears.jpg|thumb|Pele's tears]]
Pele’s tears are interesting to [[volcanologist]]s because trapped within the glass droplet are bubbles of gas and particles called vesicles.&lt;ref name='Shea'&gt;Shea, T et al (2010) Textural studies of vesicles in volcanic rocks:An integrated methodology. Journal of volcanology and geothermal research. 190:271-289&lt;/ref&gt;  When these are analysed they can provide a great deal of information about the mechanisms of an [[Types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]].  For instance, the shape of a vesicle can provide an indication of the velocity of the eruption.  When vesicles form within the lava they are spherical in shape.  If the eruption is turbulent the vesicles will deform and become elongated in shape.  If the velocity is low they will retain their spherical shape as in the case of Pele’s tears.

The composition of a [[magma chamber]] includes [[lava]], [[crystal]]s and gases known as volatiles.  At high pressures within the [[magma chamber]], gases are dissolved in the melt and are soluble.  As the [[magma]] rises, the pressure decreases and the gases come out of solution.  Some of these gases escape and some become trapped in the [[Magma|melt]].  When the gases trapped within the vesicles of Pele’s tears are analysed they can provide a great deal of information about the chemical composition of the [[magma chamber]].&lt;ref name="Moune"/&gt;  This information can be used to determine the [[Volcanic eruption|explosive nature of an eruption]] and help to understand the complex processes occurring within [[volcano]]s.  This is important in the management of [[natural hazards]].

[[File:2010-09-04 Ringkoebing 01.jpg|thumb|Ringkøbing Fjord seen from [[Ringkøbing]].]]
'''Ringkøbing Fjord''', despite its name, is in fact a shallow [[lagoon]] on the westcoast of [[Jutland]]. 

[[Skjern River]] terminates in Ringkøbing Fjord with a large river delta system to the east, and the lagoon is shielded from the [[North Sea]] by a long [[isthmus]] named [[Holmsland Dunes]] to the west. On the [[Hvide Sande]] Canal in the middle of the isthmus, there is a floodgate that provides access to the sea to the west. The fjord is about 30 kilometers long and 2 to 3 meters deep. In the southwestern corner is the [[Tipperne]] peninsula, where there is a bird reservation. The town of [[Ringkøbing]] lies to the north-east. Ringkøbing Fjord was once affected by [[Hypoxia (environmental)|oxygen depletion]], but today both plant and fish life abounds.

Ringkøbing Fjord was originally a [[bay]], around which two sandbars have gradually built up, with a [[sandbank]] that has shifted repeatedly over time as a result of shifting water currents. In the mid-17th century, the bank was near Sønder Havrvig, but it gradually moved south as sand was deposited on the shoal from the north. By the late 18th century, it was close to the town of [[Nymindegab]]. On several occasions, the surrounding dunes collapsed from the effects of the water, causing the old outflow to fill with sand and creating problems for local fisherman.  In 1891, a channel was therefore dug south of Nymindegab but, in 1910, it was replaced by a channel in Hvide Sande.  A [[storm surge]] in 1911 created an opening of 230 meters and extensive flooding around the fjord. In 1915, the passage at the southern end of the fjord was therefore reopended while the one near Hvide Sande was closed. It was, however, later reopened with the establishment of a [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] in 1931.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24697">'''Ripple''' (specifically '''ripple voltage''') in [[electronics]] is the residual [[periodic function|periodic]] variation of the [[Direct current|DC voltage]] within  a power supply which has been derived from an [[alternating current]] (AC) source. This ripple is due to incomplete suppression of the alternating [[waveform]] after rectification.  Ripple voltage originates as the output of a rectifier or from generation and commutation of DC power.

Ripple (specifically '''ripple current''' or '''surge current''') may also refer to the pulsed current consumption of non-linear devices like capacitor-input rectifiers.

As well as these time-varying phenomena, there is a '''[[frequency domain]] ripple''' that arises in some classes of [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] and other [[signal processing]] networks. In this case the periodic variation is a variation in the [[insertion loss]] of the network against increasing [[frequency]]. The variation may not be strictly linearly periodic. In this meaning also, ripple is usually to be considered an incidental effect, its existence being a compromise between the amount of ripple and other design parameters.

Ripple is wasted power, and has many undesirable effects in a DC circuit: it heats components, causes noise and distortion, and may cause digital circuits to operate improperly. Ripple may be reduced by an [[electronic filter]], and eliminated by a [[voltage regulator]].

==Ripple voltage==
Ripple voltage is an alternating (AC) voltage which is a constituent part of a composite voltage waveform with a constant DC component (offset) which may be positive or negative, but for analysis is usually considered to be an absolute value. The ripple component is often small relative to the DC component, but in absolute terms, ripple (as in the case of [[HVDC]] transmission systems) may be thousands of volts.  Ripple itself is a composite (non-sinusoidal) waveform consisting of harmonics of some fundamental frequency which is usually the AC line frequency of 50/60Hz, but in the case of [[switched-mode power supplies]], the fundamental frequency can be tens of kilohertz to megahertz. The characteristics and components of ripple depend on its source: there is single-phase half- and full-wave rectification, and three-phase half- and full-wave rectification.  Rectification can be controlled (uses Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) or uncontrolled (uses diodes).  There is in addition, [[active rectification]] which uses transistors.

Various properties of ripple voltage may be important depending on application: the equation of the ripple for Fourier analysis to determine the constituent harmonics; the peak (usually peak-to-peak) value of the voltage; the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value of the voltage which is a component of power transmitted; the ripple factor &lt;big&gt;''γ''&lt;/big&gt;, the ratio of RMS value to DC voltage output; the conversion ratio (also called the rectification ratio or "efficiency") &lt;big&gt;''η''&lt;/big&gt;, the ratio of DC output power to AC input power; and form-factor, the ratio of the RMS value of the output voltage to the average value of the output voltage.  Analogous ratios for output ripple current may also be computed.

An electronic filter with high impedance at the ripple frequency may be used to reduce ripple voltage and increase or decrease DC output; such a filter is often called a [[Rectifier#Rectifier output smoothing|smoothing filter]].

The initial step in AC to DC conversion is to send the AC current through a [[rectifier]]. The ripple voltage output is very large in this situation; the peak-to-peak ripple voltage is equal to the peak AC voltage minus the forward voltage of the rectifier diodes. In the case of a SS silicon diode, the forward voltage is 0.7V; for vacuum tube rectifiers, forward voltage usually ranges between 25 and 67V (5R4).  The output voltage is a sine wave with the negative half-cycles inverted.  The equation is:

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{L}(t) = V_\mathrm{AC_p}\cdot |sin(t)|&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier expansion of the function is:

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{L}(t) = \frac {2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi} + \frac{4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi} \cdot \sum_{n=1}^\infin \frac{\cos(n\pi)}{1-4n^2}\cdot \cos(2 n \omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

Several relevant properties are apparent on inspection of the Fourier series:
* the constant (largest) term &lt;math&gt;\frac {2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; must be the DC voltage
* the fundamental (line frequency) is not present
* the expansion consists of only even harmonics of the fundamental
* the amplitude of the harmonics is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the order of the harmonic
* the term for the second order harmonic &lt;math&gt; \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \pi}\cos(2 \omega t)&lt;/math&gt; is often used to represent the entire ripple voltage to simplify computation

The output voltages are:

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{L} = V_\mathrm{AC} = \frac{V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\sqrt 2}&lt;/math&gt; (ignoring diode drop and losses)
::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{DC} = \frac {1}{T} \int_0^T \! V_\mathrm{L}(t)\,dt = \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ -\cos(t)\right]_{0}^{\pi} = -\cos(\pi) - -\cos(0) \, = \frac{2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{ \frac {1}{T} \int_0^T \! (V_\mathrm{L}(t)\, - K)^2 dt} = \sqrt{ \frac {1}{T} \int_0^T \! V_\mathrm{L}(t)^2\, - 2 K V_\mathrm{L}(t) + K^2 dt} =\sqrt {\frac {1}{\pi} \left [ \frac {1}{2}t - \frac {1}{4}\sin(t) +2K\cos(t) +K^2t\right ]_0^\pi}&lt;/math&gt; 
::::&lt;math&gt;= \sqrt {\frac {1}{\pi}\left ( \frac {\pi}{2} -4KV_\mathrm{AC_p}+K^2\pi\right)}&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;K = V_\mathrm{DC}&lt;/math&gt;, and substitute in terms of &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{AC_p}&lt;/math&gt;, so
::::= &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {\frac {1}{2} - \frac {8}{\pi^2}V_\mathrm{AC_p}^2 + \frac {4}{\pi^2}V_\mathrm{AC_p}^2}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {\left (\frac {V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\sqrt 2} \right)^2 - \left ( \frac{2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
::::{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;V_{rms} = \frac {2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi} \sqrt {\frac{\pi^2}{8} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;}}

where
:*&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the time varying voltage across the load, &lt;math&gt;|\sin(t)|&lt;/math&gt; for period 0 to T 
:*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the period of &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;, may be taken as &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians

The ripple factor is:

::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac {V_\mathrm{rms}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \sqrt {\frac {\pi^2}{8} - 1} &lt;/math&gt;
{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx 0.483&lt;/math&gt;}}

The form factor is:

::&lt;math&gt; FF = \frac {V_\mathrm{L}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \frac {\frac{V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\sqrt 2}}{\frac {2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}}&lt;/math&gt;
{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;FF = \frac{\pi}{2 \sqrt 2} \approx 1.11 &lt;/math&gt;}}

The peak factor is: 
::&lt;math&gt;PF = \frac {V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\frac {V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\sqrt 2}}&lt;/math&gt;
{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;PF = \sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;}}

The conversion ratio is:
::{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;\eta \approx .812 (81.2\%)&lt;/math&gt;}}

The transformer utilization factor is:
::{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;TUF \approx .812\ (\text{bridge}); .692\ (\text{center-tapped})&lt;/math&gt;}}

===Filtering===

[[Image:Rectifier with reservoir.svg|thumb|300px|Full-wave center-tapped rectifier with capacitor filter]]
Reducing ripple is only one of several principal considerations in power supply filter design.&lt;ref&gt;Power supply output requirements usually specify a minimum DC voltage, an output voltage range or percentage of voltage regulation, ripple factor.  The filter must also take into account the load impedance, source voltage and voltage regulation, and power factor (i.e. for a transformer), line voltage variation, and any necessary filtering of source noise or harmonic distortion.&lt;/ref&gt; The filtering of ripple voltage is analogous to filtering other kinds of signals.  However, in AC/DC power conversion as well as DC power generation, high voltages and currents or both may be output as ripple.  Therefore, large discrete components like high ripple-current rated electrolytic capacitors, large iron-core chokes and wire-wound power resistors are best suited to reduce ripple to manageable proportions before passing the current to an [[Integrated circuit|IC]] component like a voltage regulator, or on to the load.  The kind of filtering required depends on the amplitude of the various harmonics of the ripple and the demands of the load.  For example, a [[moving coil]] (MC) input circuit of a phono [[preamplifier]] may require that ripple be reduced to no more than a few hundred nanovolts (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;V).  In contrast, a [[battery charger]], being a wholly resistive circuit, does not require any ripple filtering.  Since the desired output is direct current (essentially 0Hz), ripple filters are usually configured as [[low pass filter]]s characterized by shunt capacitors and series chokes.  Series resistors may replace chokes for reducing the output DC voltage, and shunt resistors may be used for voltage regulation.

==Filtering in power supplies==
Most power supplies are now switched mode designs. The filtering requirements for such power supplies are much easier to meet owing to the high frequency of the ripple waveform. The ripple frequency in switch-mode power supplies is not related to the line frequency, but is instead a multiple of the frequency of the [[chopper (electronics)|chopper circuit]], which is usually in the range of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz - 1Mhz.
==Capacitor vs choke input filters==
A capacitor input filter (in which the first component is a shunt capacitor) and choke input filter (which has a series choke as the first component) can both reduce ripple, but have opposing effects on voltage and current, and the choice between them depends on the characteristics of the load.  Capacitor input filters have poor voltage regulation, so are preferred for use in circuits with stable loads and low currents (because low currents reduce ripple here). Choke input filters are preferred for circuits with variable loads and high currents (since a choke outputs a stable voltage and higher current means less ripple in this case).

The number of reactive components in a filter is called its ''order''.  Each reactive component reduces signal strength by 6db/octave above (or below for a high-pass filter) the [[corner frequency]] of the filter, so that a 2nd order low pass filter for example, reduces signal strength by 12db/octave above the corner frequency.  Resistive components (including resistors and parasitic elements like DCR of chokes and ESR of capacitors) also reduce signal strength, but their effect is ''linear'', and does not vary with frequency.

A common arrangement is to allow the rectifier to work into a large smoothing [[capacitor]] which acts as a reservoir. After a peak in output voltage the capacitor (C) supplies the current to the load (R) and continues to do so until the capacitor voltage has fallen to the value of the now rising next half-cycle of rectified voltage. At that point the rectifier conducts again and delivers current to the reservoir until peak voltage is again reached.

=== As a function of load resistance ===
If the [[RC time constant]] is large in comparison to the period of the AC waveform, then a reasonably accurate approximation can be made by assuming that the capacitor voltage falls linearly. A further useful assumption can be made if the ripple is small compared to the DC voltage. In this case the [[phase angle]] through which the rectifier conducts will be small and it can be assumed that the capacitor is discharging all the way from one peak to the next with little loss of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, pp&amp;nbsp;107–115&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Smoothed ripple gray background.svg|thumb|400px|Ripple voltage from a full-wave rectifier, before and after the application of a smoothing capacitor]]  
With the above assumptions the peak-to-peak ripple voltage can be calculated as:

The definition of [[capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;and [[Electric current|current]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourelectrichome.com/2012/05/capacitor-input-filter-part3.html|title=Capacitor Input Filter : Part3|website=www.yourelectrichome.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} Q = CV_{pp} \\ Q=I_{ave}t_{ave} \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;is the amount of charge. The current and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;is taken from start of capacitor discharge until the minimum voltage on a full wave rectified signal as shown on the figure to the right. The time &lt;math&gt;t_{ave}&lt;/math&gt;would then be equal to half the period of the full wave input.

:&lt;math&gt;t_{ave}=\frac{t_{fullwave}}{2}=\frac{1}{f}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the three equations above to determine &lt;math&gt;V_{pp}&lt;/math&gt; gives,

:&lt;math&gt;V_{pp}=\frac{Q}{C}=\frac{I_{ave}t_{ave}}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for a full-wave rectifier:&lt;ref&gt;Millman-Halkias, pp&amp;nbsp;112–114&lt;/ref&gt;

::{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{pp} = \frac{I}{2fC}&lt;/math&gt;}}

where
:*&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{pp}&lt;/math&gt; is the peak-to-peak ripple voltage
:*&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the current in the circuit
:*&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the source (line) frequency of the AC power
:*&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the capacitance

For the rms value of the ripple voltage, the calculation is more involved as the shape of the ripple waveform has a bearing on the result. Assuming a [[sawtooth wave]]form is a similar assumption to the ones above.  The RMS value of a sawtooth wave is &lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm{p}}{\sqrt 3}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{p}&lt;/math&gt; is peak voltage. With the further approximation that &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{p}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm{pp}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, it yields the result:&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, p&amp;nbsp;113&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms} = \frac{V_\mathrm{pp}}{2 \sqrt 3} = \frac{I}{4 \sqrt 3 fC} = \frac{V_\mathrm{DC}}{4 \sqrt 3 fCR}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{DC} = IR&lt;/math&gt;
::{{equation box 1|equation=&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac {V_\mathrm{rms}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \frac{1}{4\sqrt 3 fCR}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\approx .453 \frac {X_\mathrm{C}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;}}

where

:*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ripple factor
:*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the load
:*For the approximated formula, it is assumed that X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt; R; this is a little larger than the actual value because a sawtooth wave comprises odd harmonics that aren't present in the rectified voltage.

=== As a function of series choke ===
Another approach to reducing ripple is to use a series [[choke (electronics)|choke]]. A choke has a filtering action{{clarify|date=November 2017}} and consequently produces a smoother waveform with fewer high-order [[harmonics]]. Against this, the DC output is close to the average input voltage as opposed to the voltage with the [[reservoir capacitor]] which is close to the peak input voltage.  Starting with the Fourier term for the second harmonic, and ignoring higher order harmonics,

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{2f}(t) = \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \pi}\cos(2 \omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

the ripple factor is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, pp&amp;nbsp;115&amp;ndash;117&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt {\frac {1}{T}\int_0^T \left ( \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \pi}\cos(2 \omega t) \right )^2 dt} \cdot Z_\mathrm {RL}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{RL}&lt;/math&gt; is the impedance of the RL filter formed by the choke and load
::&lt;math&gt; = \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \pi}\sqrt { \frac {1}{\pi}\left [ \frac {t}{2} + \frac {\sin 2\omega t}{4\omega}\right]_0^\pi} \cdot \frac {R}{\sqrt {R^2 + X_\mathrm{L}^2} }=\frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \pi} \sqrt {\frac {1}{2}} \cdot \frac {R}{\sqrt {R^2 + X_\mathrm{L}^2} } = \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \sqrt 2 \pi} \cdot \frac {R}{X_\mathrm{L}}&lt;/math&gt; for R &lt;&lt; X&lt;sub&gt;L &lt;/sub&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{DC} = \sqrt {\left (\frac{2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}\right )^2 - V_\mathrm{rms}^2} = \frac{2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}^2 = K \frac{R^2}{X_\mathrm{L}^2}&lt;/math&gt; is negligible for R &lt;&lt; X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac {V_\mathrm{rms}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \frac {4 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{3 \sqrt 2 \pi} \cdot \frac {R}{2 \omega L} / \frac{2 V_\mathrm{AC_p}}{\pi} = \frac{R}{3 \sqrt 2 \omega L}&lt;/math&gt; substituting &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{L} = 2 \omega L&lt;/math&gt;; in the more familiar form, &lt;math&gt;\approx .471 \frac {R}{X_\mathrm{L}}&lt;/math&gt; , for R &lt;&lt; X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; ; this is a little less than .483 because higher order harmonics were omitted from consideration

where
:*&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inductance]] of the choke

There is a minimum inductance which is relative to the resistance of the load required in order for a series choke to continuously conduct current.  If the inductance falls below that value, current will be intermittent and output DC voltage will rise from the average input voltage to the peak input voltage - in effect, the inductor will behave like a capacitor.  That minimum inductance, called the ''critical inductance'' is &lt;math&gt; L = \frac {R}{2 \pi (3f)}&lt;/math&gt; where R is the load resistance and f the line frequency.  This gives values of L = R/1131 (often stated as R/1130) for 60Hz mains rectification, and L = R/942 for 50Hz mains rectification. Additionally, interrupting current to an inductor will cause its magnetic flux to collapse exponentially; as current falls, a voltage spike composed of very high harmonics results which can damage other components of the power supply or circuit.  This phenomenon is called [[flyback voltage]].

The complex impedance of a series choke is effectively part of the load impedance, so that lightly loaded circuits have increased ripple (just the opposite of a capacitor input filter).  For that reason, a choke input filter is almost always part of an LC filter section, whose ripple reduction is independent of load current.  The ripple factor is:
 
::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac {V_\mathrm{rms}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \frac {\sqrt 2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4 \omega^2 CL} \approx .471 \frac {X_\mathrm{C}}{X_\mathrm{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:*&lt;math&gt;\omega  = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;

In high voltage/low current circuits, a resistor may replace the series choke in an LC filter section (creating an RC filter section).  This has the effect of reducing the DC output as well as ripple.  The ripple factor is

::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac {V_\mathrm{rms}}{V_\mathrm{DC}} = \frac {\left( 1 + \frac {R}{R_\mathrm L} \right)}{3 \sqrt 2 \omega C R} = \frac {1}{3 \sqrt 2 \omega C R}\approx .471 \frac{X_\mathrm{C}}{R}&lt;/math&gt; if R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R, which makes an RC filter section ''practically'' independent of load

where 
:*&lt;math&gt;\omega  = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the filter resistor

Similarly because of the independence of LC filter sections with respect to load, a reservoir capacitor is also commonly followed by one resulting in a [[low-pass]] [[Topology (electronics)#Simple filter topologies|Π-filter]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryder pp&amp;nbsp;117&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt; A Π-filter results in a much lower ripple factor than a capacitor or choke input filter alone.  It may be followed by additional LC or RC filter sections to further reduce ripple to a level tolerable by the load.  However, use of chokes is deprecated in contemporary designs for economic reasons.

===Voltage regulation===
{{main|voltage regulator}}
A more common solution where good ripple rejection is required is to use a reservoir capacitor to reduce the ripple to something manageable and then pass the current through a voltage regulator circuit. The regulator circuit, as well as providing a stable output voltage, will incidentally filter out nearly all of the ripple as long as the minimum level of the ripple waveform does not go below the voltage being regulated to.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder pp&amp;nbsp;353&amp;ndash;355&lt;/ref&gt; Switched-mode power supplies usually include a voltage regulator as part of the circuit.

Voltage regulation is based on a different principle than filtering: it relies on the peak inverse voltage of a diode or series of diodes to set a maximum output voltage; it may also use one or more voltage amplification devices like transistors to boost voltage during sags.  Because of the non-linear characteristics of these devices, the output of a regulator is free of ripple.  A simple voltage regulator may be made with a series resistor to drop voltage followed by a shunt zener diode whose Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) sets the maximum output voltage; if voltage rises, the diode shunts away current to maintain regulation.

===Effects of ripple===
Ripple is undesirable in many electronic applications for a variety of reasons:
* ripple represents wasted power that cannot be utilized by a circuit that requires direct current
* ripple will cause heating in DC circuit components due to current passing through parasitic elements like ESR of capacitors 
* in power supplies, ripple voltage requires peak voltage of components to be higher; ripple current requires parasitic elements of components to be lower and dissipation capacity to be higher (components will be bigger, and quality will have to be higher)
* transformers that supply ripple current to capacitive input circuits will need to have VA ratings that exceed their load (watt) ratings 
*The ripple frequency and its harmonics are within the audio band and will therefore be audible on equipment such as radio receivers, equipment for playing recordings and professional studio equipment.
*The ripple frequency is within television video bandwidth. Analogue TV receivers will exhibit a pattern of moving wavy lines if too much ripple is present.&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, W &amp; Howorth, D, ''Principles of Television Reception'', p70, Pitman Publishing, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
*The presence of ripple can reduce the resolution of electronic test and measurement instruments. On an oscilloscope it will manifest itself as a visible pattern on screen.
*Within digital circuits, it reduces the threshold, as does any form of supply rail noise, at which logic circuits give incorrect outputs and data is corrupted.

==Ripple current==
Ripple current is a periodic non-sinusoidal waveform derived from an AC power source characterized by high amplitude narrow bandwidth pulses.
The pulses coincide with peak or near peak amplitude of an accompanying sinusoidal voltage waveform.

Ripple current results in increased dissipation in parasitic resistive portions of circuits like ESR of capacitors, DCR of transformers and inductors, internal resistance of storage batteries.  The dissipation is proportional to the current squared times resistance ( I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R ).  The RMS value of ripple current can be many times the RMS of the load current.

==Frequency-domain ripple==
{{see also|Ringing (signal)}}
[[Image:Tchebyscheff5.png|thumb|Ripple on a fifth order [[prototype filter|prototype]] Chebyshev filter]]
Ripple in the context of the frequency domain refers to the periodic variation in [[insertion loss]] with frequency of a filter or some other [[two-port network]]. Not all filters exhibit ripple, some have [[monotonic function|monotonically]] increasing insertion loss with frequency such as the [[Butterworth filter]]. Common classes of filter which exhibit ripple are the [[Chebyshev filter]], [[inverse Chebyshev filter]] and the [[Elliptical filter]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei et al., pp&amp;nbsp;85&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt; The ripple is not usually strictly linearly periodic as can be seen from the example plot. Other examples of networks exhibiting ripple are [[impedance matching]] networks that have been designed using [[Chebyshev polynomials]]. The ripple of these networks, unlike regular filters, will never reach 0&amp;nbsp;dB at minimum loss if designed for optimum transmission across the [[passband]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=Matt120&gt;Matthaei et al., pp&amp;nbsp;120&amp;ndash;135&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of ripple can be traded for other parameters in the filter design. For instance, the rate of [[roll-off]] from the [[passband]] to the [[stopband]] can be increased at the expense of increasing the ripple without increasing the order of the filter (that is, the number of components has stayed the same). On the other hand, the ripple can be reduced by increasing the order of the filter while at the same time maintaining the same rate of roll-off.&lt;ref name=Matt120/&gt;

[[File:Iwan Nikolajewitsch Kramskoj 002.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Ivan Kramskoi]], Русалки ('Rusalki'), 1871]]

In [[Slavic folklore]], the '''rusalka''' (plural ''rusalki'') ({{lang-ru|руса́лка|translit=rusálka|}}; {{lang-pl|rusałka|}}) is a female entity, often malicious toward humankind and frequently associated with water. Folklorists have proposed a variety of origins for the entity, including that they may originally stem from [[Slavic paganism]], where they may have been seen as benevolent spirits. Rusalki appear in a variety of media in modern popular culture, particularly in Slavic language-speaking countries, where they frequently resemble the concept of the [[mermaid]].

== Origin and appearance ==
[[File:Witold Pruszkowski-Rusalki.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Witold Pruszkowski]] "Rusałki" 1877]]

According to [[Vladimir Propp]], the original "rusalka" was an appellation used by [[pagan]] Slavic peoples, who linked them with fertility and did not consider rusalki evil before the 19th century. They came out of the water in the spring to transfer life-giving moisture to the fields and thus helped nurture the crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda J. Ivanits|title=Russian Folk Belief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=15 February 1989|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3088-9|pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barber2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Elizabeth Wayland Barber]]|title=The Dancing Goddesses: Folklore, Archaeology, and the Origins of European Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abHEnOiPAmsC|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=11 February 2013|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-08921-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 19th century versions, a rusalka is an unquiet, dangerous being who is no longer alive, associated with the [[unclean spirit]]. According to [[Dmitry Zelenin (ethnographer)|Dmitry Zelenin]],&lt;ref name="Ivanits"&gt;Zelenin, D.K, cited in {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&amp;pg=PA76 | title=Russian Folk Belief | publisher=M.E. Sharpe | author=Ivanits, Linda J. | year=1992 | page=76 | isbn=978-0765630889}}&lt;/ref&gt; young women, who either committed suicide by drowning due to an unhappy marriage (they might have been jilted by their lovers or abused and harassed by their much older husbands) or who were violently drowned against their will (especially after becoming pregnant with unwanted children), must live out their designated time on earth as rusalki. However, the initial Slavic lore suggests that not all rusalki occurrences were linked with death from water.&lt;ref name="Barber2013" /&gt;

It is accounted by most stories that the [[soul]] of a young woman who had died in or near a river or a lake would come back to haunt that waterway. This [[undead]] rusalka is not invariably malevolent, and would be allowed to die in peace if her death is avenged. Her main purpose is, however, to lure young men, seduced by either her looks or her voice, into the depths of said waterways where she would entangle their feet with her long red hair and submerge them. Her body would instantly become very slippery and not allow the victim to cling on to her body in order to reach the surface. She would then wait until the victim had drowned, or, on some occasions, tickle them to death, as she laughed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rusalka|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\R\U\RusalkaIT.htm|website=Internet [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]], Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed, by a few accounts, that rusalki can change their appearance to match the tastes of men they are about to seduce,{{cn|date=April 2018}} although a rusalka is generally considered to represent universal beauty, therefore is highly feared yet respected in Slavic culture.

== Variations ==
[[File:Rusalka Bilibin.jpg|thumb|''Rusalka'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]], 1934]]
While lore often says that the rusalki could not completely stand out of water, some fiction works tell of rusalki that could climb trees and sing songs, sit on docks with only submerged feet and comb their hair, or even join other rusalki in [[Circle Dance|circle dance]]s in the field. A particular feature of such stories revolves around the fact that this behaviour would be limited to only certain periods of the year, usually the [[summer]] (see Rusalka Week section).

=== Region-specific ===
Specifics pertaining to rusalki differed among regions. Although in most tales they lived without men, in [[Ukraine]] they were often linked with water (in [[Belarus]] they were linked with the forest and field). Where land was fertile, the maidens appeared naked and beautiful. In harsher areas of [[Russia]], they appeared as "large breasted [[amazons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Hubbs|title=Mother Russia: The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVQz3I4FCWUC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=22 September 1993|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-11578-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusalka Week ==
{{main article|Green week}}
The ''rusalki'' were believed to be at their most dangerous during the [[Semik|Rusalka Week]] (''Rusalnaya nedelja'') in early June. At this time, they were supposed to have left their watery depths in order to swing on branches of birch and willow trees by night. Swimming during this week was strictly forbidden, lest mermaids would drag a swimmer down to the river floor. A common feature of the celebration of Rusalnaya was the ritual banishment or burial of the rusalki at the end of the week, which remained as entertainment in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanits, Linda, ''Russian Folk Belief'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern popular culture ==
Regarding representations of the rusalka in modern popular culture, folklorist Natalie Kononenko says, "the currently dominant presents her as something like a mermaid, though she is pictured as having legs rather than a fish tail ... The current view of the ''rusalka'' as a seductive or seduced woman was probably influenced by written literature. In the past, her image was more complex and she more closely resembled a nature spirit, found not only near water but in fields, forests, and mountains, rather like the [[Samodiva (mythology)|vila]] ...".&lt;ref name="KONONENKO-18-19"&gt;Kononenko, Natalie. 2007. ''Slavic Folkore: A Handbook'', p. 18-19. [[Greenwood Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33610-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helmand River - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Helmand River]], known in ancient Iranian Avestan as ''Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;atī'' and ''Harahvaiti'', is identified by some as the ancient Sarasvati river.]]
'''Sarasvati River''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|सरस्वती नदी}}, ''[[IAST]]: sárasvatī nadī́'') was one of the  [[Rigvedic rivers]] mentioned in the [[Rig Veda]] and later [[Vedic]] and post-Vedic texts. The Sarasvati River played an important role in [[Hinduism]] since [[Vedic Sanskrit]]. The first part of the Rig Veda is believed to have originated when the [[Vedic people]] lived on its banks, during the 2nd millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LFhzHGbj23EC&amp;pg=PT154&amp;dq=sarasvati+10,000+years+ago&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NhvCVOSAKY758QWmg4KwCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sarasvati%2010%2C000%20years%20ago&amp;f=false ''Global Warming Trends: Ecological Footprints''], by Julie Kerr Casper&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess [[Sarasvati]] was originally a personification of this river, but later developed an independent identity.{{sfn|Kinsley|1998|p=10, 55-57}} The Sarasvati is also considered by [[Hindus]] to exist in a [[metaphysical]] form, in which it formed a confluence with the sacred rivers [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]], at the [[Triveni Sangam]].&lt;ref name="EB-Sarasvati"/&gt; According to Michael Witzel, superimposed on the Vedic Sarasvati river is the heavenly river Milky Way, which is seen as "a road to immortality and heavenly after-life."&lt;ref name="Witzel 2012"/&gt;

Rigvedic and later Vedic texts have been used to propose identification with present-day rivers, or ancient riverbeds. The [[Nadistuti]] hymn in the [[Rigveda]] (10.75) mentions the Sarasvati between the [[Yamuna]] in the east and the [[Sutlej]] in the west. Later Vedic texts like the [[Tandya Brahmana|Tandya]] and [[Jaiminiya Brahmana]]s, as well as the [[Mahabharata]], mention that the Sarasvati dried up in a desert.

Since the late 19th-century, scholars have conjectured that the Vedic Saraswati river is the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] system, which flows through northwestern [[India]] and eastern [[Pakistan]]. Satellite images have pointed to the more significant river once following the course of the present day Ghaggar River.&lt;ref&gt;Vedic River Sarasvati and Hindu Civilization, edited by S. Kalyanaraman (2008), {{ISBN|978-81-7305-365-8}} PP.308&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have observed that major [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites at [[Kalibangan]] ([[Rajasthan]]), [[Banawali]] and [[Rakhigarhi]] ([[Haryana]]), [[Dholavira]] and [[Lothal]] ([[Gujarat]]) also lay along this course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=94098 Mythical Saraswati River] | "The work on delineation of entire course of Sarasvati River in North West India was carried out using [[Indian Remote Sensing]] Satellite data along with digital elevation model. Satellite images are multi-spectral, multi-temporal and have advantages of synoptic view, which are useful to detect palaeochannels. The palaeochannels are validated using historical maps, archaeological sites, hydro-geological and drilling data. It was observed that major Harappan sites of Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Banawali and Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Dholavira and Lothal (Gujarat) lie along the River Saraswati." — Department of Space, Government of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/oct25/articles20.htm "Saraswati – The ancient river lost in the desert"] | A.V.Shankaran.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, identification of the Vedic Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra system is problematic, since the Ghaggar-Hakra is not only mentioned separately in the ''Rig Veda'' river, but is described as having dried-up by the time of the composition of the Vedas and [[Hindu epic]]s.{{sfn|Wilke|2011}} In the words of Annette Wilke, the Ghaggar-Hakra had been reduced to a "small, sorry trickle in the desert", by the time that the Vedic people migrated into north-west India.&lt;ref name="Wilke"/&gt; {{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=93}}{{refn|group=note|name=Witzel1}}{{refn|group=note|name=Witzel2}}{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=2, 8-9}} Recent geophysical research suggests that the Ghaggar-Hakra system was a system of monsoon-fed rivers and that the Indus Valley Civilisation may have declined as a result of [[climate change]]. That is, the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished at around the time civilisation diminished some 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Giosan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giosan|first=L. et al|title=Fluvial landscapes of the Harappan Civilization|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA|year=2012|volume=109|issue=26|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/26/E1688.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.1112743109|pages=E1688–E1694|pmid=22645375|pmc=3387054}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Giosan (2012): "Numerous speculations have advanced the idea that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system, at times identified with the lost mythical river of Sarasvati (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 19), was a large glacier fed Himalayan river. Potential sources for this river include the Yamuna River, the Sutlej River, or both rivers. However, the lack of large-scale incision on the interfluve demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene. ....  The present Ghaggar-Hakra valley and its tributary rivers are currently dry or have seasonal flows. Yet rivers were undoubtedly active in this region during the Urban Harappan Phase. We recovered sandy fluvial deposits approximately 5;400 y old at Fort Abbas in Pakistan (SI Text), and recent work (33) on the upper Ghaggar-Hakra interfluve in India also documented Holocene channel sands that are approximately 4;300 y old. On the upper interfluve, fine-grained floodplain deposition continued until the end of the Late Harappan Phase, as recent as 2,900 y ago (33) (Fig. 2B). This widespread fluvial redistribution of sediment suggests that reliable monsoon rains were able to sustain perennial rivers earlier during the Holocene and explains why Harappan settlements flourished along the entire Ghaggar-Hakra system without access to a glacier-fed river."&lt;ref name="Giosan2012"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=agu-198&gt;{{citation|last1=Maemoku|first1=Hideaki|last2=Shitaoka|first2=Yorinao|last3=Nagatomo|first3=Tsuneto|last4=Yagi|first4=Hiroshi|editor1=Giosan, Liviu|editor2=Fuller, Dorian Q.|editor3=Nicoll, Kathleen|editor4=Flad, Rowan K.|editor5=Clift, Peter D. |title=Climates, Landscapes, and Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7aw5mfscBMC|series=American Geophysical Union Monograph Series 198|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-70443-1|chapter=Geomorphological Constraints on the Ghaggar River Regime During the Mature Harappan Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sarasvati" may also be identified with the [[Helmand River|Helmand]] or Haraxvati river in southern [[Afghanistan]].,&lt;ref name=Kochhar/&gt; the name of which may have been reused in its Sanskrit form as the name of the Ghaggar-Hakra river, after the Vedic tribes moved to the [[Punjab]].&lt;ref name=Kochhar&gt;{{citation |last=Kochhar |first=Rajesh |chapter=On the identity and chronology of the Ṛgvedic river Sarasvatī |title=Archaeology and Language III; Artefacts, languages and texts |editor1=Roger Blench |editor2=Matthew Spriggs |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-10054-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8jfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thapar2004"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Helmand river historically, besides Avestan ''Haetumant'', bore the name ''Haraxvaiti'', which is the [[Avestan]] form cognate to Sanskrit ''Sarasvati''.}} ''Sarasvati'' of the Rig Veda may also refer to two distinct rivers, with the family books referring to the Helmand River, and the more recent 10th mandala referring to the Ghaggar-Hakra.

== Etymology ==
''{{IAST|Sarasvatī}}'' is the feminine of an adjective ''{{IAST|sarasvant-}}'' (which occurs in the [[Rigveda]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. 7.96.4, 10.66.5&lt;/ref&gt; as the name of the keeper of the [[celestial waters]]), derived from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] *''{{lang|iir|sáras-wat-iH}}'' (and earlier, [[PIE]] ''{{PIE|*séles-u̯n̥t-ih₂}}''), meaning ‘marshy, full of pools’, or ‘she with many lakes’. The other term ''{{IAST|-vatī}}'' is the Sanskrit grammatical feminine possessor suffix.

[[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|sáras}}'' means ‘pool, pond or lake’; the feminine ''{{IAST|sarasī́}}'' means ‘stagnant pool, swamp’.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].103.2b&lt;/ref&gt;  Like its cognates [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''hêl, heledd'' ‘river meadow’ and Greek {{lang|grc|ἕλος}} (''hélos'') ‘swamp’, the Rigvedic term refers mostly to stagnant waters, and [[Manfred Mayrhofer|Mayrhofer]] considers unlikely a connection with the root *''{{IAST|sar-}}'' ‘run, flow’.&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer, ''[[EWAia]]'', s.v.; the root is otherwise often connected with rivers (also in river names, such as [[Sarayu]] or [[Susartu]]); the suggestion has been revived in the connection  of an  "[[out of India]]" argument, [http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/english/documents/RVpH.pdf  N. Kazanas, "Rig-Veda is pre-Harappan"], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{IAST|Sarasvatī}}'' may be a cognate of Avestan ''Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;atī'', perhaps&lt;ref&gt;by Lommel (1927); Lommel, Herman (1927), ''Die Yašts des Awesta'', Göttingen-Leipzig: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht/JC Hinrichs&lt;/ref&gt; originally referring to [[Anahita|Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā]] (modern ''Ardwisur Anahid''), the [[Zoroastrian]] mythological world river, which would point to a common Indo-Iranian myth of a cosmic or mystical ''{{lang|iir|Sáras-vat-ī}}'' river.  In the younger Avesta, ''Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;atī'' is [[Arachosia]], a region described to be rich in rivers, and its [[Old Persian]] cognate ''Harauvati'', which gave its name to the present-day [[Harut River|Hārūt]] River in [[Afghanistan]], may have referred to the entire [[Helmand River|Helmand]] drainage basin (the center of Arachosia).

However, the Avestan x&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; generally cognates with Sanskrit "ksha". The usual cognate to "sva/sa" syllable of Sanskrit is "ngha/ŋh" syllable of Avestan, as generally found in cognate-pairs like Vivasvan-Vivanghat and Rasa-Rangha.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Importance in Hinduism==
The Saraswati river was revered and considered important for Hindus because it is said that it was on this river's banks, along with its tributary [[Drishadwati]], in the Vedic state of [[Brahmavarta]], that Vedic Sanskrit had its genesis,&lt;ref&gt;Manu (2004). Olivelle, Patrick, ed. The Law Code of Manu. Oxford University Press. p. 24. {{ISBN|978-0-19280-271-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and important Vedic scriptures like initial part of [[Rigveda]] and several [[Upanishads]] were supposed to have been composed by Vedic seers. In the Manusmriti, Brahmavarta is portrayed as the "pure" centre of Vedic culture. Bridget and Raymond Allchin in ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan'' took the view that "The earliest Aryan homeland in India-Pakistan (Aryavarta or Brahmavarta) was in the Punjab and in the valleys of the Sarasvati and [[Drishadvati]] rivers in the time of the Rigveda."&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Allchin, Raymond Allchin, ''The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan'', Cambridge University Press, 1982, P.358.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rigveda ===
[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|Map of northern India in the late Vedic period]]

The Sarasvati River is mentioned in all but the fourth book of the [[Rigveda]]. The most important hymns related to Sarasvati are [[Mandala 6|RV 6]].61, [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95 and RV 7.96.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ludvík|2007|p= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonell and Keith provided a comprehensive survey of Vedic references to the Sarasvati River in their ''Vedic Index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/vedic-index-of-names-and-subjects/oclc/1014995385|title=Vedic Index of names and subjects|last=Macdonell|first=Arthur Anthony|last2=Keith|first2=Arthur Berriedale|date=1912|publisher=Murray|year=|isbn=|volume=2|location=London|pages=434|language=English|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/vedicindexofname02macduoft/page/434|archive-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Praise ====
* The Sarasvati is praised lavishly in the Rigveda as the best of all the rivers. In [[Mandala 2|RV 2]].41.16, 
-Ambitame Naditame Devitame Sarasvati, Aparaastasya Iva Smaasi Yashastim Amba Naskruteem-
:''"Oh Mother Saraswati you are the greatest of mothers, greatest of rivers, greatest of goddesses. Even though we are not worthy, please grant us distinction"''. 
* Other verses of praise include [[Mandala 6|RV 6]].61.8-13, [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].96 and [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].17. In some hymns, the Indus river seems to be more important than the Sarasavati, especially in the [[Nadistuti sukta]]. In RV 8.26.18, the white flowing Sindhu 'with golden wheels' is the most conveying or attractive of the rivers.
* [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95.2. and other verses (e.g. [[Mandala 8|RV 8]].21.18) speak of the Sarasvati pouring "milk and [[ghee]]." Rivers are often likened to cows in the Rigveda, for example in [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].33.1,
: ''"Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling,''
: ''[[Vipas]] and [[Sutudri]] speed down their waters."''
* Rigveda,4.58.1 says 
:''"May purifying Sarasvati with all the plenitude of her forms of plenty, rich in substance by the thought, desire our sacrifice."''
:''"She, the impeller to happy truths, the awakener in consciousness to right mentalisings, Sarasvati, upholds the sacrifice."''
:''"Sarasvati by the perception awakens in consciousness the great flood (the vast movement of the ritam) and illumines entirely all the thoughts"''&lt;ref&gt;translation by Sri Aurobindo, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As a goddess ====
[[File:Saraswati.jpg|thumb|Painting of Goddess Saraswati by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]
{{main|Saraswati}}

The Sarasvati is mentioned some fifty times in the hymns of the Rig Veda.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  It is mentioned in thirteen hymns of the late books (1 and 10) of the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;1.3, 13, 89, 164; 10.17, 30, 64, 65, 66, 75, 110, 131, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Only two of these references are unambiguously to the river: 10.64.9, calling for the aid of three  "great rivers", Sindhu, Sarasvati and [[Sarayu]]; and 10.75.5, the geographical list of the Nadistuti sukta. The others invoke Sarasvati as a goddess without direct connection to a specific river.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 10.30.12, her origin as a river goddess may explain her invocation as a protective deity in a hymn to the celestial waters. In 10.135.5, as Indra drinks [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] he is described as refreshed by Sarasvati. The invocations in 10.17 address Sarasvati as a goddess of the forefathers as well as of the present generation. In 1.13, 1.89, 10.85, 10.66 and 10.141, she is listed with other gods and goddesses, not with rivers. In 10.65, she is invoked together with "holy thoughts" (''{{IAST|dhī}}'') and "munificence" (''{{IAST|puraṃdhi}}''), consistent with her role as a goddess of both knowledge and fertility.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Though Sarasvati initially emerged as a river goddess in the Vedic scriptures, in later Hinduism of the [[Purana]]s, she was rarely associated with the river. Instead she emerged as an independent goddess of knowledge, learning, wisdom, music and the arts. The evolution of the river goddess into the goddess of knowledge started with later [[Brahmanas]], which identified her as ''Vāgdevī'', the goddess of speech, perhaps due to the centrality of speech in the Vedic cult and the development of the cult on the banks of the river.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  It is also possible that two independently postulated goddesses were fused into one in later Vedic times.{{sfn|Kinsley|1998|p=10, 55-57}} [[Aurobindo]] has proposed, on the other hand, that "the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati...She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration...".&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Jayaswal, Hindu Polity, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Vedic texts ===
In post-Rigvedic literature, the disappearance of the Sarasvati is mentioned.  Also the origin of the Sarasvati is identified as [[Plaksa]] Prasravana (Peepal tree or Ashwattha tree as known in India and Nepal).&lt;ref&gt;Pancavimsa Brahmana, Jaiminiya Upanisad Brahmana, Katyayana Srauta Sutra, Latyayana Srauta; Macdonell and Keith 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asvalayana Srauta Sutra, Sankhayana Srauta Sutra; Macdonell and Keith 1912, II:55&lt;/ref&gt;

In a supplementary chapter of the [[Vajasaneyi-Samhita]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (34.11), Sarasvati is mentioned in a context apparently meaning the Sindhu: "Five rivers flowing on their way speed onward to Sarasvati, but then become Sarasvati a fivefold river in the land."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p.492&lt;/ref&gt; According to the medieval commentator Uvata, the five tributaries of the Sarasvati were the Punjab rivers [[Drishadvati]], [[Satudri]] ([[Sutlej]]), Chandrabhaga ([[Chenab River|Chenab]]), [[Vipasa]] ([[Beas River|Beas]]) and the [[Iravati]] ([[Ravi River|Ravi]]).

The first reference to the disappearance of the lower course of the Sarasvati is from the [[Brahmana]]s, texts that are composed in [[Vedic Sanskrit]], but dating to a later date than the Veda Samhitas. The Jaiminiya Brahmana (2.297) speaks of the 'diving under (upamajjana) of the Sarasvati', and the [[Tandya Brahmana]] (or Pancavimsa Br.) calls this the 'disappearance' (vinasana). The same text (25.10.11-16) records that the Sarasvati  is 'so to say  meandering' (kubjimati) as it could not sustain heaven which it had  propped up.{{sfn|Witzel|1984}}{{refn|group=note|name="Witzel"|See Witzel (1984){{sfn|Witzel|1984}} for discussion; for maps (1984) of the area, p. 42 sqq.}}

The Plaksa Prasravana (place of appearance/source of the river) may refer to a spring in the Siwalik mountains. The distance between the source and the Vinasana (place of disappearance of the river) is said to be 44 [[Ashwin]](between several hundred and 1600 miles) (Tandya Br. 25.10.16; cf. Av. 6.131.3; Pancavimsa Br.).&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Chauhan in Radhakrishna, B.P. and Merh, S.S. (editors): Vedic Saraswati 1999. According to this reference, 44 asvins may be over 2600 km&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Latyayana Srautasutra]] (10.15-19) the Sarasvati seems to be a perennial river up to the Vinasana, which is west of its confluence with the Drshadvati (Chautang). The Drshadvati is described as a seasonal stream (10.17), meaning it was not from Himalayas. Bhargava&lt;ref&gt;Sudhir Bhargava, "Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati river is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati river" Seminar, Saraswati river-a perspective, Nov. 20-22, 2009, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana, Seminar Report: pages 114-117&lt;/ref&gt; has identified Drashadwati river as present day Sahibi river originating from Jaipur hills in Rajasthan. The Asvalayana Srautasutra and Sankhayana Srautasutra contain verses that are similar to the Latyayana Srautasutra.

=== Post-Vedic texts ===

====Mahabharata====
According to the [[Mahabharata]], the Sarasvati dried up to a  desert (at a place named Vinasana or Adarsana)&lt;ref&gt;Mhb. 3.82.111; 3.130.3; 6.7.47; 6.37.1-4., 9.34.81; 9.37.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mbh. 3.80.118&lt;/ref&gt; and joins the sea "impetuously".&lt;ref&gt;Mbh. 3.88.2&lt;/ref&gt; The desert made when Saraswati dried up was the Thar desert. MB.3.81.115 locates the state of Kurupradesh or [[Kuru Kingdom]] to the south of the Sarasvati and north of the [[Drishadvati]]. The dried-up, seasonal [[Ghaggar River]] in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Haryana]] reflects the same geographical view described in the [[Mahabharata]].

According to Hindu scriptures, a journey was made during the Mahabharata by Balrama along the banks of the Saraswati from Dwarka to Mathura. There were ancient kingdoms too (the era of the Mahajanapads) that lay in parts of north Rajasthan and that were named on the Saraswati River.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/1615237Haigh_M._2011._Interpreting_the_Sarasvati_Tirthayatra_of_Shri_Balar%C4%81ma._Itihas_Darpan_Research_Journal_of_Akhil_Bhartiya_Itihas_Sankalan_Yojana_ABISY_New_Delhi_16_2_pp.179-193_ISSN_0974-3065_{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhancock.com/forum/DMisraB5.php|title=The journey of Jagannath from India to Egypt: The Untold Saga of the Kussites - Graham Hancock Official Website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indology.info/email/members/kalyanaraman/|title=INDOLOGY - Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization (c. 3000 B.C.)|first=Richard MAHONEY - r dot mahoney at indica-et-buddhica dot|last=org|website=indology.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Proto-Indo-Mediterranean culture, Volume 2, page 398&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Purana]]s describe the Sarasvati River, and also record that the river separated into a number of lakes (''saras'').&lt;ref name="Radhakrishna, B.P 1999, p.35-44"&gt;D.S. Chauhan in Radhakrishna, B.P. and Merh, S.S. (editors): Vedic Saraswati, 1999, p.35-44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Skanda Purana]], the Sarasvati originates from the water pot of [[Brahma]] and flows from [[Plaksa]] on the Himalayas. It then turns west at Kedara and also flows underground.  Five distributaries of the Sarasvati are mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;compare also with Yajurveda 34.11, D.S. Chauhan in Radhakrishna, B.P. and Merh, S.S. (editors): Vedic Saraswati, 1999, p.35-44&lt;/ref&gt; The text regards Sarasvati as a form of Brahma's consort [[Brahmi]].&lt;ref name="Eck149"/&gt; According to the [[Vamana Purana]] 32.1-4, the Sarasvati rose from the [[Plaksa tree]] ([[Pipal tree]]).&lt;ref name="Radhakrishna, B.P 1999, p.35-44"/&gt;

The ''[[Padma Purana]]'' proclaims:
{{quote|One who bathes and drinks there where the Gangā, Yamunā and Sarasvati join enjoys [[Moksha|liberation]]. Of this there is no doubt."{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=147}}}}

====Smritis====
* In the [[Manu Smriti]], the sage [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]], escaping from a flood, founded the Vedic culture between the Sarasvati and [[Drishadvati]] rivers. The Sarasvati River was thus the western boundary of [[Brahmavarta]]: "the land between the Sarasvati and Drishadvati is created by God; this land is Brahmavarta."&lt;ref&gt;Manusmriti 2.17-18&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, the [[Vasistha Dharma Sutra]] I.8-9 and 12-13 locates [[Aryavarta]] to the east of the disappearance of the Sarasvati in the desert, to the west of [[Kalakavana]], to the north of the mountains of [[Pariyatra]] and [[Vindhya]] and to the south of the [[Himalaya]]. [[Patanjali]]'s [[Mahābhāṣya]] defines Aryavarta like the Vasistha Dharma Sutra.
* The [[Baudhayana]] ''Dharmasutra'' gives similar definitions,  declaring that Aryavarta is the land that lies west of [[Kalakavana]], east of [[Adarsana]] (where the Sarasvati disappears in the desert), south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the [[Vindhyas]].

=== Contemporary mythological meaning ===
[[File:NorthIndiaCircuit 250.jpg|thumb|Triveni Sangam, Allahabad - the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and the "unseen" Sarasvati.]]

Diana Eck notes that the power and significance of the Sarasvati for present-day India is in the persistent symbolic presence at the confluence of rivers all over India.{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=145}} Although "materially missing",{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=148}} she is the third river, which emerges to join in the meeting of rivers, thereby making the waters triple holy.{{sfn|Eck|2012|p=148}}

After the Vedic Sarasvati dried, new myths about the rivers arose. Sarasvati is described to flow in the [[Patala|underworld]] and rise to the surface at some places.&lt;ref name="Wilke"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilke|2011|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, the Sarasvati river existed in a "subtle or mythic" form, since it corresponds with none of the major rivers of present-day South Asia.&lt;ref name="EB-Sarasvati"/&gt; The [[confluence]] (''sangam'') or joining together of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers at [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], is believed to also converge with the unseen Sarasvati river, which is believed to flow underground.  This despite Allahabad being a considerable distance from the possible historic routes of an actual Sarasvati river.

At the [[Kumbh Mela]], a mass bathing festival is held at Triveni Sangam, literally "confluence of the three rivers", every 12 years.&lt;ref name="EB-Sarasvati"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ludvík|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798222,00.html At the Three Rivers] ''[[TIME]]'', February 23, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The belief of Sarasvati joining at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna originates from the [[Puranas|Puranic scriptures]] and denotes the "powerful legacy" the Vedic river left after her disappearance. The belief is interpreted as "symbolic".&lt;ref name="Eck2012"/&gt; The three rivers Sarasvati, Yamuna, Ganga are considered consorts of the Hindu Trinity ([[Trimurti]]) [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] (as [[Krishna]]) and [[Shiva]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Eck149"&gt;Eck p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In lesser known configuration, Sarasvati is said to form the ''Triveni'' confluence with rivers Hiranya and Kapila at [[Somnath]]. There are several other ''Triveni''s in India where two physical rivers are joined by the "unseen" Sarasvati, which adds to the sanctity of the confluence.&lt;ref&gt;Eck p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Michael Witzel, superimposed on the Vedic Sarasvati river is the heavenly river Milky Way, which is seen as "a road to immortality and heavenly after-life."&lt;ref name="Witzel 2012"&gt;{{harvtxt|Witzel|2012|pp=74, 125, 133}}: "It can easily be understood, as the Sarasvatī, the river on earth and in the nighttime sky, emerges, just as in Germanic myth, from the roots of the world tree. In the Middle Vedic texts, this is acted out in the Yātsattra... along the Rivers Sarasvatī and Dṛṣadvatī (northwest of Delhi)..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ludvík|2007|p=85}}: "The Sarasvatī river, which, according to Witzel,... personifies the Milky Way, falls down to this world at Plakṣa Prāsarvaṇa, "the world tree at the center of heaven and earth," and flows through the land of the Kurus, the center of this world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilke|2011|p=310, note 574}}: "Witzel suggests that Sarasvatī is not an earthly river, but the Milky Way that is seen as a road to immortality and heavenly after-life. In `mythical logic,' as outlined above, the two interpretations are not however mutually exclusive. There are passages which clearly suggest a river."&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the Sarasvati as the river of heavens, is interpreted to suggest its mythical nature.&lt;ref name="AgarwalSingh2007"/&gt;

Romila Thapar notes that "once the river had been mythologized through invoking the memory of the earlier river, its name - Sarasvati - could be applied to many rivers, which is what happened in various parts of the [Indian] subcontinent."&lt;ref name="Thapar2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Romila Thapar|title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24225-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several present-day rivers are also named Sarasvati, after the Vedic Sarasvati:
* Sarsuti is the present-day name of a river originating in a submontane region ([[Ambala]] district) and joining the Ghaggar near [[Shatrana]] in [[PEPSU]]. Near [[Sadulgarh]] ([[Hanumangarh]]) the Naiwala channel, a dried out channel of the [[Sutlej]], joins the [[Ghaggar]]. Near [[Suratgarh]] the Ghaggar is then joined by the dried up [[Drishadvati]] river.
* Sarasvati is the name of a river originating in the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] mountain range in [[Rajasthan]], passing through [[Sidhpur]] and [[Patan, Rajasthan|Patan]] before submerging in the [[Rann of Kutch]].
* [[Saraswati River (Uttarakhand)|Saraswati River]], a tributary of [[Alaknanda River]], originates near [[Badrinath]]
* [[Saraswati River (Bengal)|Saraswati River]] in [[Bengal]], formerly a distributary of the [[Hooghly River]], has dried up since the 17th century.

== Identification theories ==
Already since the 19th century, attempts have been made to identify the mythical Sarasvati of the Vedas with physical rivers.{{sfn|Giosan et al.|2012}} Many think that the Vedic Sarasvati river once flowed east of the [[Indus]] (Sindhu) river.&lt;ref name="Eck2012"&gt;Eck p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists, geologists as well as scholars have identified the Sarasvati with many present-day or now defunct rivers.

Two theories are popular in the attempts to identify the Sarasvati. Several scholars have identified the river with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River or dried up part of it, which is located in Northwestern India and Pakistan.{{sfn|Darian|2001|p=58}}&lt;ref name="AgarwalSingh2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pushpendra K. Agarwal|author2=Vijay P. Singh|title=Hydrology and Water Resources of India|date=16 May 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-5180-7|pages=311–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maisels2003"/&gt; A second popular theory associates the river with the Helmand river or an ancient river in the present Helmand Valley in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Kochhar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darian p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider Sarasvati a mythical river.

The identification with the Ghaggar-Hakra system took on new significance in the early 21st century,&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sarasvati#ref946781 ''Sarasvati'']&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting an earlier dating of the Rig Veda, and renaming the Indus Valley Civilisation as the "Sarasvati culture", the "Sarasvati Civilization", the "Indus-Sarasvati Civilization" or the "Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization,"&lt;ref name="Singh2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maisels2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008"/&gt; suggesting that the Indus Valley and [[Vedic period|Vedic cultures]] can be equated.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=258}}

===Rig Vedic course===
[[File:Rigvedic geography.jpg|thumb|right|Vedic rivers]]

The Rig Veda contains several hymns which give an indication of the flow of the geography of the river, and an identification with the Ghaggra-Hakra:
* [[Mandala 3|RV 3]].23.4 mentions the Sarasvati River together with the [[Drsadvati River]] and the Āpayā River. 
* [[Mandala 6|RV 6]].52.6 describes the Sarasvati as swollen (pinvamānā) by the rivers (sindhubhih).
* [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].36.6, ''"sárasvatī saptáthī síndhumātā"'' can be translated as "Sarasvati the Seventh, Mother of Floods,"&lt;ref&gt;Griffith&lt;/ref&gt; but also as "whose mother is the Sindhu", which would indicate that the Sarasvati is here a tributary of the Indus.{{refn|group=note|While the first translation takes a [[tatpurusha]] interpretation of ''síndhumātā'', the word is actually a [[bahuvrihi]]. Hans Hock (1999) translates ''síndhumātā'' as a [[bahuvrihi]], giving the second translation. A translation as a [[tatpurusha]] ("mother of rivers", with ''sindhu'' still with its generic meaning) would be less common in RV speech.}}
* [[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95.1-2, describes the Sarasvati as flowing to the [[samudra]], a word now usually translated as "ocean."{{refn|group=note|[[Mandala 7|RV 7]].95.1-2:
: ''"This stream Sarasvati with fostering current comes forth, our sure defence, our fort of iron.''
: ''As on a [[chariot]], the flood flows on, surpassing in majesty and might all other waters.''
: ''Pure in her course from mountains to the ocean, alone of streams Sarasvati hath listened.''
: ''Thinking of wealth and the great world of creatures, she poured for [[Nahusa]] her [[milk]] and fatness."''}}
* [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].75.5, the late Rigvedic [[Nadistuti sukta]], enumerates all important rivers from the Ganges in the east up to the Indus in the west in a clear geographical order. The sequence "Ganges, [[Yamuna]], Sarasvati, [[Shutudri]]" places the Sarasvati between the Yamuna and the [[Sutlej]], which is consistent with the Ghaggar identification.

Yet, the Rig Veda also contains clues for an identification with the Helmand river in Afghanistan: 
* The Sarasvati River is perceived to be a great river with perennial water, which does not apply to the Hakra and Ghaggar.&lt;ref name= "Kalyanaraman"/&gt; 
* The Rig Veda seems to contain descriptions of several Sarasvati's. The earliest Sararvati is said to be similar to the Helmand in Afghanistan which is called the Harakhwati in the Āvestā.&lt;ref name= "Kalyanaraman"&gt;S. Kalyanaraman (ed.), ''Vedic River Sarasvati and Hindu Civilization'', {{ISBN|978-81-7305-365-8}} PP.96&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verses in [[Mandala 6|RV 6]].61 indicate that the Sarasvati river originated in the hills or mountains (giri), where she "burst with her strong waves the ridges of the hills (giri)". It is a matter of interpretation whether this refers only to the Himalayan [[foothills]], where the present-day Sarasvati (Sarsuti) river flows, or to higher mountains.

The Rig Veda was written during the latter part of the late Harappan period, and according to Shaffer, the reason for the predominance of the Sarasvati in the [[Rigveda]] is the [[late Harappan]] (1900-1300 BCE) population shift eastwards to [[Haryana]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Shaffer, in: J. Bronkhorst &amp; M. Deshpande (eds.), Aryans and Non-Non-Aryans, Evidence, Interpretation and Ideology. Cambridge ([[Harvard Oriental Series]], Opera Minora 3) 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Identification with the Sarasvati====
A number of archaeologists and geologists have identified the Sarasvati river with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River, or the dried up part of it.&lt;ref name="AgarwalSingh2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singh2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maisels2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darian p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/ad526e/ad526e09.htm |title=Proceedings of the second international symposium on the management of large rivers for fisheries: Volume II |publisher=Fao.org |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mughal, M.

Valdiya (2013) have identified the Sarasvati with Ghaggar.{{sfn|Prasad|2017| p=13}} [[Michel Danino|Danino]] notes that "the 1500 km-long bed of the Sarasvati" was "rediscovered" in the 19th century.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=252}} According to Danino, "most Indologists" were convinced in the 19th century that "the bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra was the relic of the Sarasvati."{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=252}}

According to Valdiya, "it is plausible to conclude that once upon a time the Ghagghar was known as "Sarsutī"," which is "a corruption of "Sarasvati"," because "at Sirsā on the bank of the Ghagghar stands a fortress called "Sarsutī".

====Tectonics====
Some paleo-environmental scientists have proposed that the Hakkra was fed by Himalayan sources, which made it a mighty river,{{refn|group=note|Puri and Verma (1998) argued that the present-day [[Tons River]] was the ancient upper-part of the Ghaggar-Hakra river, identified with the Sarasvati river by them. The Ghaggar-Haggar would then had been fed with Himalayan glaciers, which would make it the mighty river described in the Vedas. The terrain of this river contains pebbles of quartzite and metamorphic rocks, while the lower terraces in these valleys do not contain such rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Puri |first=V. M.

According to this theory, the Sutlej moved westward and became a tributary of the Indus River,{{refn|group=note|name=Sutlej|According to Misra, there are several dried out river beds (paleochannels) between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, some of them two to ten kilometres wide.

Misra in Gupta 1995, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Pal, the course of the Sutlej suggests that "the Satluj periodically was the main tributary of the Ghaggar and that subsequently the tectonic movements may have forced the Satluj westward and the Ghaggar dried." At [[Ropar]] the Sutlej river suddenly turns sharply away from the Ghaggar. The narrow Ghaggar river bed itself is becoming suddenly wider at the conjunction where the Sutlej should have met the Ghaggar river.

====Objections====
[[Romila Thapar]] terms the identification "controversial" and dismisses it, noticing that the descriptions of Sarasvati flowing through the "high mountains" does not tally with Ghaggar's course and suggests that Sarasvati is Haraxvati of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Thapar2004"/&gt; Wilke suggests that the identification is problematic since the Ghaggar-Hakra river was already dried up at the time of the composition of the Vedas,{{sfn|Wilke|2011}} let alone the migration of the Vedic people into northern India.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=93}}{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=2, 8-9}}

Giosan et al., in their study ''Fluvial landscapes of the Harappan civilisation'',{{sfn|Giosan et al.|2012}} make clear that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system was not a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, but a monsoonal-fed river.{{refn|group=note|{{harvtxt|Giosan et al.|2012|pp=1688, 1689}}:
* "Contrary to earlier assumptions that a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, identified by some with the mythical Sarasvati, watered the Harappan heartland on the interfluve between the Indus and Ganges basins, we show that only monsoonal-fed rivers were active there during the Holocene." ({{harvnb|Giosan et al.|2012|p=1688}})
* "Numerous speculations have advanced the idea that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system, at times identified with the lost mythical river of Sarasvati (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 19), was a large glacierfed Himalayan river. Potential sources for this river include the Yamuna River, the Sutlej River, or both rivers. However, the lack of large-scale incision on the interfluve demonstrates that large, glacier-fed rivers did not flow across the Ghaggar-Hakra region during the Holocene." ({{harvnb|Giosan et al.|2012|p=1689}})}}{{refn|group=note|name="Valdiya"|{{harvtxt|Valdiya|2013}} dispute this, arguing that it was a large perennial river draining the high mountains as late as 3700–2500 years ago.}} They concluded that the Indus Valley Civilisation died out because the monsoons, which fed the rivers that supported the civilisation, diminished. With the rivers drying out as a result, the civilisation diminished some 4000 years ago.{{sfn|Giosan et al.|2012}} This in particular effected the Ghaggar-Hakra system, which became ephemeral and was largely abandoned.{{sfn|Giosan et al.|2012|p=1693}} The Indus Valley Civilisation had the option to migrate east toward the more humid regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where the decentralized late Harappan phase took place.{{sfn|Giosan et al.|2012|p=1693}}

Clift et al. (2012), using dating of zircon sand grains, have shown that subsurface river channels near the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] sites in [[Cholistan]] immediately below the presumed Ghaggar-Hakra channel show sediment affinity not with the Ghagger-Hakra, but instead with the [[Beas River]] in the western sites and the Sutlej and the Yamuna in the eastern ones, further weakening the hypothesis that the Ghaggar-Hakra was once a large river, but suggesting that the Yamuna itself, or a channel of the Yamuna, along with a channel of the Sutlej may have flowed west some time between 47,000 BCE and 10,000 BCE. The drainage from the Yamuna may have been lost from the Ghaggar-Hakra well before the beginnings of Indus civilization.&lt;ref name=zircon&gt;{{cite journal|title=U-Pb zircon dating evidence for a Pleistocene Sarasvati River and capture of the Yamuna River|last1=Clift|first1=Peter D.|last2=Carter|first2=Andrew|last3=Giosan|first3=Liviu|last4 = Durcan|first4= Julie|journal=Geology|year=2012|volume= 40|issue=3|pages=211–214|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Clift/publication/229062223_Pb_zircon_dating_evidence_for_a_Pleistocene_Sarasvati_River_and_Capture_of_the_Yamuna_River/links/00b7d51ba682dd3e01000000.pdf|doi=10.1130/g32840.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajit Singh et al. (2017) show that the paleochannel of the Ghaggar-Hakra is a former course of the Sutlej, which diverted to its present course between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago, well before the development of the Harappan Civilisation. Ajit Singh et al. conclude that the urban populations settled not along a perennial river, but a monsoon-fed seasonal river that was not subject to devastating floods.{{sfn|Singh|2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Malavika Vyawahare (Nov 29, 2017), [https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-study-challenges-existence-of-saraswati-river-says-it-was-sutlej-s-old-course/story-D1I3r9VVvr29V0v7dugLvJ.html ''New study challenges existence of Saraswati river, says it was Sutlej’s old course''], HindustanTimes&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajesh Kocchar further notes that, even if the Sutlej and the Yamuna had drained into the Ghaggar during Rig Vedic, it still would not fit the Rig Vedic descriptions because "the snow-fed Satluj and Yamuna would strengthen lower Ghaggar. Upper Ghaggar would still be as puny as it is today."&lt;ref name="Kocchar"/&gt;

=== Helmand river ===
[[File:Afghanistan_physical_en.png|thumb|[[Helmund]] river basin with tributary [[Arghandab River]] originate in [[Hindu Kush]] mountain in north [[Afghanistan]] and fall in to [[Hamun Lake]] in southern Afghanistan at the border of [[Iran]]. [[Helmund]] basin in ancient Iranian Avestan ''Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;atī'' and ''Harahvaiti'', is cognate with the mythological Iranian Avestan [[Anahita|Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā]] river and Sarasvati river.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}]]
{{main|Helmand River|Arghandab River}}

An alternative suggestion for the identity of the early Rigvedic Sarasvati River is the [[Helmand River]] and its tributary [[Arghandab River|Arghandab]]{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=260}} in the [[Arachosia]] region in [[Afghanistan]], separated from the watershed of the Indus by the [[Sanglakh Range]]. The Helmand  historically besides Avestan ''Haetumant'' bore the name ''Haraxvaiti'', which is the [[Avestan]] form cognate to Sanskrit ''Sarasvati''. The [[Avesta]] extols the Helmand in similar terms to those used in the Rigveda with respect to the Sarasvati: "the bountiful, glorious Haetumant swelling its white waves rolling down its copious flood".&lt;ref&gt;[[Avesta|Yasht]] 10.67&lt;/ref&gt; However unlike the Rigvedic Sarasvati, Helmand river never attained the status of a deity despite the praises in the Avesta.{{sfn | Prasad | 2017 | p=42}}

The identification of the ''Sarasvati'' river with the ''Helmand'' river was first proposed by E. Thomas in 1886, followed by Alfred Hillebrandt a couple of years thereafter. However, in the same year, Geologist R.D. Oldham, refuted this Afghan Sarasvatī thesis. {{sfn|Danino|2010|p=260}} Indologist [[A.B. Keith]] (1879-1944) also didn't subscribe to this theory and stated that there is no conclusive evidence to identify the Sarasvati with the Helmand river. &lt;ref name="Prasad 2017 p. 43"&gt;{{cite book | last=Prasad | first=R.U.S. | title=River and Goddess Worship in India: Changing Perceptions and Manifestations of Sarasvati | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | series=Routledge Hindu Studies Series | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-351-80654-1 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UTYlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43 | access-date=2018-08-13 | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Konrad Klaus, the geographic situation of the Sarasvati and the Helmand rivers are similar. Both flow into a terminal lakes: the Helmand into a swamp in the [[Iranian plateau]] (the extended [[wetland]] and lake system of [[Hamun-i-Helmand]]). This matches the Rigvedic  description of the Sarasvati flowing to the ''[[samudra]]'', which according to him at that time meant 'confluence', 'lake', 'heavenly lake, ocean'; the current meaning of 'terrestrial ocean' was not even felt in the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus, K. Die altindische Kosmologie, nach den Brāhmaṇas dargestellt. Bonn 1986; Samudra, XXIII Deutscher Orientalistentag Würzburg, ZDMG Suppl. Volume VII, Stuttgart 1989, 367-371&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajesh Kocchar, after a detailed analysis of the Vedic texts and geological environments of the rivers, concludes that there are two Sarasvati rivers mentioned in the Rigveda. The early Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls ''Naditama Sarasvati'', is described in suktas 2.41, 7.36 etc. of the family books of the Rigveda, and drains into a [[samudra]]. The description of the ''Naditama Sarasvati'' in the Rigveda matches the physical features of the [[Helmand River]] in Afghanistan, more precisely its tributary the [[Harut River]], whose older name was ''Harax&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;atī'' in Avestan. The later Rigvedic Sarasvati, which he calls ''Vinasana Sarasvati'', is described in the Rigvedic Nadistuti sukta (10.75), which was composed centuries later, after an eastward migration of the bearers of the Rigvedic culture to the western [[Ganges River|Gangetic]] plain some 600&amp;nbsp;km to the east. The Sarasvati by this time had become a mythical "disappeared" river, and the name was transferred to the [[Ghaggar]] which disappeared in the desert.&lt;ref name=Kochhar/&gt; The later Rigvedic Sarasvati is only in the post-Rig Vedic Brahmanas said to disappear in the sands. According to Kocchar the Ganga and Yamuna were small streams in the vicinity of the Harut River. When the Vedic people moved east into Punjab, they named the new rivers they encountered after the old rivers they knew from Helmand, and the ''Vinasana Sarasvati'' may correspond with the Ghaggar-Hakra river.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kochhar |first=Rajesh |chapter=On the identity and chronology of the Ṛgvedic river Sarasvatī |title=Archaeology and Language III; Artefacts, languages and texts |editor1=Roger Blench |editor2=Matthew Spriggs |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-10054-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8jfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kocchar"&gt;Rajesh Kocchar, [http://rajeshkochhar.com/tag/rigveda/ The rivers Sarasvati: Reconciling the sacred texts], blog post based on ''The Vedic People: Their History and Geography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romila Thapar has also suggested that the Sarasvati river is the ancient Haraxvati river of Afghanistan, noticing that the descriptions of the Sarasvati flowing through the "high mountains" cannot be reconciled with the actual course of the present-day Ghaggar-Hakkar river.&lt;ref name="Thapar2004"/&gt;

===Contemporary politico-religious meaning ===

==== Drying-up and dating of the Vedas ====
The Vedic and Puranic statements about the drying-up and diving-under of the Sarasvati have been used as a reference point for the dating of the Harappan civilisation and the Vedic culture.&lt;ref name="EB-Sarasvati"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523994/Sarasvati#ref946781 The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Sarasvati'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Some see these texts as evidence for an earlier dating of the Rig Veda, identifying the Sarasvati with the Ghaggar-Hakra River, rejecting the [[Indo-Aryan migration hypothesis|Indo-Aryan migrations theory]], which postulates a migration at 1500 BCE.{{refn|group=note|name=IE|According to David Anthony, the [[Yamna culture]] was the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|"Urheimat"]] of the Indo-Europeans at the Pontic steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} From this area, which already included various subcultures, Indo-European languages spread west, south and east starting around 4,000 BCE.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=29}} These languages may have been carried by small groups of males, with patron-client systems which allowed for the inclusion of other groups into their cultural system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Eastward emerged the [[Sintashta culture]] (2100–1800 BCE), from which developed the [[Andronovo culture]] (1800–1400 BCE). This culture interacted with the [[BMAC]] (2300–1700 BCE); out of this interaction developed the Indo-Iranians, which split around 1800 BCE into the Indo-Aryans and the Iranians.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=408}} The Indo-Aryans migrated to the Levant, northern India, and possibly south Asia.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="scale"|The migration into northern India was not a large-scale immigration, but may have consisted of small groups,{{sfn|Witzel|2005|p=342-343}} which were genetically diverse. Their culture and language spread by the same mechanisms of acculturalisation, and the absorption of other groups into their patron-client system.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} }}

[[Michel Danino]] places the composition of the Vedas in the third millennium BCE, a millennium earlier than the conventional dates.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}} Danino notes that accepting the Rig Veda accounts as factual descriptions, and dating the drying up late in the third millennium, are incompatible.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}} According to Danino, this suggests that the Vedic people were present in northern India in the third millennium BCE,{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256, 258}} a conclusion which is controversial amongst professional archaeologists.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}} Danino states that there is an absence of "any intrusive material culture in the Northwest during the second millennium BCE,"{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Witzel points out that this is to expected from a ''mobile'' society, but that the [[Gandhara grave culture]] is a clear indication of new cultural elements.{{sfn|Witzel|2005}} Michaels points out that there are linguistic and archaeological data that shows a cultural change after 1750 BCE,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=33}} and Flood notices that the linguistic and religious data clearly show links with Indo-European languages and religion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=33}}}} a biological continuity in the skeletal remains,{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}}{{refn|group=note|name="scale"}} and a cultural continuity. Danino then states that if the "testimony of the Sarasvati is added to this,"
{{quote|[T]he simplest and most natural conclusion is that the Vedic culture was present in the region in the third millennium.{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=258}} }}

Danino acknowledges that this asks for "studying its tentacular ramifications into linguistics, archaeoastronomy, anthropology and genetics, besides a few other fields".{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=258}}

Annette Wilke notes that the "historical river" Sarasvati was a "topographically tangible mythogeme", which was already reduced to a "small, sorry tickle in the desert", by the time of composition of the [[Hindu epic]]s. These post-Vedic texts regularly talk about drying up of the river, and start associating the goddess Sarasvati with language, rather than the river.&lt;ref name="Wilke"/&gt;

Michael Witzel also notes that the Rig Veda indicates that the Sarswati "had already lost its main source of water supply and must have ended in a terminal lake (samudra)."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=93}}{{refn|group=note|name=Witzel1|Witzel: "The autochthonous theory overlooks that RV 3.33206 already speaks of a necessarily smaller Sarasvatī: the Sudås hymn 3.33 refers to the confluence of the Beas and Sutlej (Vipåś, Śutudrī). This means that the Beas had already captured the Sutlej away from the Sarasvatī, dwarfing its water supply. While the Sutlej is fed by Himalayan glaciers, the Sarsuti is but a small local river depending on rain water.&lt;br&gt;In sum, the middle and later RV (books 3, 7 and the late book, 10.75) already depict the present day situation, with the Sarasvatī having lost most of its water to the Sutlej (and even earlier, much of it also to the Yamunå). It was no longer the large river it might have been before the early Rgvedic period.{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=81}}}}{{refn|group=note|name=Witzel2|Witzel further notes: "If the RV is to be located in the Panjab, and supposedly to be dated well before the supposed 1900 BCE drying up of the Sarasvatī, at 4-5000 BCE (Kak 1994, Misra 1992), the text should not contain evidence of the domesticated horse (not found in the subcontinent before c. 1700 BCE, see Meadow 1997,1998, Anreiter 1998: 675 sqq.), of the horse drawn chariot (developed only about 2000 BCE in S. Russia, Anthony and Vinogradov 1995, or Mesopotamia), of well developed copper/bronze technology, etc."{{sfn|Witzel|2001|p=31}}}}

====Identification with the Indus Valley Civilisation====
The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (Harrapan Civilisation), which is named after the Indus, was largely located on the banks of and in the proximity of the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/oct252004/1141.pdf | title=Is River Ghaggar, Saraswati? Geochemical constraints | author1=Jayant K. Tripathi|author2=Barbara Bock|author3=V. Rajamani|author4=A. Eisenhauer | journal=Current Science | date=25 October 2004 | volume=87 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indus Valley Civilisation is sometimes called the "Sarasvati culture", the "Sarasvati Civilization", the "Indus-Sarasvati Civilization" or the "Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization", as it is theorized that the civilisation flourished on banks of the Sarasvati river, along with the Indus.&lt;ref name="Singh2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maisels2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CushRobinson2008"/&gt; Danino notes that the dating of the Vedas to the third millennium BCE coincides with the mature phase of the Indus Valley civilisation,{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=256}} and that it is "tempting" to equate the Indus Valley and [[Vedic period|Vedic cultures]].{{sfn|Danino|2010|p=258}}

==== Revival ====
In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that "members of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] believe that proof of the physical existence of the Vedic river would bolster their concept of a golden age of Hindu India, before invasions by Muslims and Christians." The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] Government had therefore ordered archaeologists to search for the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rss-specialreport/special-report-battling-for-indias-soul-state-by-state-idUSKCN0S700A20151013 |title= Special Report: Battling for India's soul, state by state |author= Rupam Jain Nair, Frank Jack Daniel |work= [[Rueters]] |date= 12 October 2015 |accessdate= 29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the government of Indian state of [[Haryana]], research and satellite imagery of the region has confirmed to have found the lost river when water was detected during digging of the dry river bed at [[Yamunanagar]]. The government constituted [[Saraswati]] Heritage Development Board (SHDB) had conducted a trial run on July 30, 2016 filling the river bed with 100 [[cusec]]s of water which was pumped into a dug-up channel from tubewells at Uncha Chandna village in [[Yamunanagar]]. The water is expected to fill the channel until [[Kurukshetra]], a distance of 40 kilometres. Once confirmed that there is no obstructions in the flow of  the water, the government proposes to flow in another 100 cusecs after a fortnight. There also are plans to build three dams on the river route to keep it flowing perennially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zee Media Bureau|title='Lost' Saraswati river brought 'back to life'|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/lost-saraswati-river-brought-back-to-life_1915729.html|accessdate=19 August 2016|agency=Zee Media|date=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Ashoke Mukherjee (2001), is critical of the attempts to identify the Rigvedic Sarasvati. Mukherjee notes that many historians and archaeologists, both Indian and foreign, concluded that the word "Sarasvati" (literally "being full of water") is not a [[noun]], a specific "thing". However, Mukherjee believes that "Sarasvati" is initially used by the Rig Vedic people as an adjective to the Indus as a large river and later evolved into a "noun". Mukherjee concludes that the Vedic poets had not seen the palaeo-Sarasvati, and that what they described in the Vedic verses refers to something else. He also suggests that in the post-Vedic and Puranic tradition the "disappearance" of Sarasvati, which to refers to "[going] under [the] ground in the sands", was created as a complementary myth to explain the visible non-existence of the river.{{sfn|Mukherjee|2001|p=2, 6-9}}

'''Satellite imagery''' (also '''Earth observation imagery''' or '''spaceborne photography''') are [[image]]s of [[Earth]] or other planets collected by [[Earth observation satellite|imaging satellite]]s operated by governments and businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as [[Apple Maps]] and [[Google Maps]].

== History ==
[[Image:First satellite photo - Explorer VI.jpg|thumb| The satellite images were made from pixels. The first crude image taken by the satellite [[Explorer 6]] shows a sunlit area of the Central Pacific Ocean and its cloud cover. The photo was taken when the satellite was about {{convert|17000|mi|km|abbr=on}} above the surface of the earth on August 14, 1959. At the time, the satellite was crossing Mexico.]]

The first images from space were taken on [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital flights]]. The U.S-launched [[V-2]] flight on October 24, 1946 took one image every 1.5 seconds. With an apogee of 65 miles (105&amp;nbsp;km), these photos were from five times higher than the previous record, the 13.7 miles (22&amp;nbsp;km) by the Explorer II balloon mission in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/FEATURE-FirstPhoto.html The First Photo From Space], Tony Reichhardt, ''Air &amp; Space Magazine'', November 01, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first satellite (orbital) photographs of Earth were made on August 14, 1959 by the U.S. [[Explorer 6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Year_2007/SEMP4FEVL2F_0.html | title=50 years of Earth Observation | work=2007: A Space Jubilee | publisher=[[European Space Agency]] | date=October 3, 2007 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html |title=First Picture from Explorer VI Satellite |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130171224/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html |archivedate=2009-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first satellite photographs of the [[Moon]] might have been made on October 6, 1959 by the Soviet satellite [[Luna 3]], on a mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. [[The Blue Marble]] photograph was taken from space in 1972, and has become very popular in the media and among the public. Also in 1972 the United States started the [[Landsat program]], the largest program for acquisition of imagery of Earth from space. [[Landsat Data Continuity Mission]], the most recent Landsat satellite, was launched on 11 February 2013. In 1977, the first real time satellite imagery was acquired by the United States's [[KH-11]] satellite system.

[[Image:TIROS-1-Earth.png|thumb|left|The first television image of Earth from space transmitted by the [[TIROS-1]] weather satellite in 1960.]]
All satellite images produced by [[NASA]] are published by [[NASA Earth Observatory]] and are freely available to the public. Several other countries have satellite imaging programs, and a collaborative European effort launched the [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]] and [[Envisat]] satellites carrying various sensors. There are also private companies that provide commercial satellite imagery. In the early 21st century satellite imagery became widely available when affordable, easy to use software with access to satellite imagery databases was offered by several companies and organizations.

== Uses ==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|width=200|align=right|image1=Nasa blue marble.jpg|image2=Crops Kansas AST 20010624.jpg|caption1=Satellite photography can be used to produce composite images of an entire hemisphere|caption2=...or to map a small area of the Earth, such as this photo of the countryside of [[Haskell County, Kansas|Haskell County]], [[Kansas]], United States.}}

Satellite images have many applications in [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]], [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], [[Biodiversity#Conservation|biodiversity conservation]], [[forestry]], [[landscape]], [[geology]], [[cartography]], [[regional planning]], [[education]], [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and [[war]]fare. Images can be in visible colors and in other [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]]. There are also elevation maps, usually made by radar images. Interpretation and analysis of satellite imagery is conducted using specialized [[remote sensing software]].

== Resolution and data ==
There are four types of resolution when discussing satellite imagery in remote sensing:  spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric.  Campbell (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J.  B.  2002.  Introduction to Remote Sensing.  New York  London: The Guilford Press{{Pages needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines these as follows:
* spatial resolution is defined as the pixel size of an image representing the size of the surface area (i.e. m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) being measured on the ground, determined by the sensors' instantaneous field of view (IFOV);
* spectral resolution is defined by the wavelength interval size (discrete segment of the Electromagnetic Spectrum) and number of intervals that the sensor is measuring;
* temporal resolution is defined by the amount of time (e.g. days) that passes between imagery collection periods for a given surface location
*Radiometric resolution is defined as the ability of an imaging system to record many levels of brightness (contrast for example) and to the effective bit-depth of the sensor (number of grayscale levels) and is typically expressed as 8-bit (0-255), 11-bit (0-2047), 12-bit (0-4095) or 16-bit (0-65,535).
* Geometric resolution refers to the satellite sensor's ability to effectively image a portion of the Earth's surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of [[Ground sample distance]], or GSD. GSD is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can "see" an object on the ground within a single pixel. For example, the GSD of Landsat is ~30m, which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is ~30m x 30m. The latest commercial satellite (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m. This compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based [[Reconnaissance satellite]] such as [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]].{{Citation needed|reason=Campbell, J.  B.  2002, above, is said to define only spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions.|date=September 2016}}

The [[image resolution|resolution]] of satellite images varies depending on the instrument used and the altitude of the satellite's orbit. For example, the [[Landsat]] archive offers repeated imagery at 30 meter resolution for the planet, but most of it has not been processed from the raw data. [[Landsat 7]] has an average return period of 16 days. For many smaller areas, images with resolution as high as 41&amp;nbsp;cm can be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=grayaudio on Mar 15, 2010 |url=http://hothardware.com/News/Worlds-HighestResolution-Satellite-Imagery/ |title=World's Highest-Resolution Satellite Imagery |publisher=HotHardware |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite imagery is sometimes supplemented with [[aerial photography]], which has higher resolution, but is more expensive per square meter. Satellite imagery can be combined with vector or raster data in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] provided that the imagery has been spatially rectified so that it will properly align with other data sets.

==Imaging satellites==
{{main|Earth observing satellites}}

===GeoEye===

GeoEye's [[GeoEye-1]] satellite was launched on September 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN0633403420080906?sp=true |last=Shall |first=Andrea |title=GeoEye launches high-resolution satellite |agency= Reuters |accessdate=2008-11-07 | date=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GeoEye-1 satellite has the high resolution imaging system and is able to collect images with a ground resolution of 0.41&amp;nbsp;meters (16&amp;nbsp;inches) in the panchromatic or black and white mode. It collects multispectral or color imagery at 1.65-meter resolution or about 64&amp;nbsp;inches.

===DigitalGlobe===

DigitalGlobe's [[WorldView-2]] satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.46 m spatial resolution (panchromatic only).&lt;ref name="urlBall Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=81 |title=Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. |accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 0.46 meters resolution of WorldView-2's [[panchromatic]] images allows the satellite to distinguish between objects on the ground that are at least 46&amp;nbsp;cm apart. Similarly DigitalGlobe's [[QuickBird]] satellite provides 0.6 meter resolution (at NADIR) panchromatic images.

DigitalGlobe's [[WorldView-3]] satellite provides high resolution commercial satellite imagery with 0.31 m spatial resolution. WVIII also carries a short wave infrared sensor and an atmospheric sensor&lt;ref name="urlDigitalGlobe WorldView3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldview3.digitalglobe.com/|title=High Resolution Aerial Satellite Images &amp; Photos|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spot Image===
[[File:Bratislava SPOT 1027.jpg|thumb|right|SPOT image of [[Bratislava]]]]
The 3 [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellites]] in orbit (Spot 2, 4 and 5) provide images with a large choice of resolutions – from 2.5 m to 1&amp;nbsp;km. Spot Image also distributes multiresolution data from other optical satellites, in particular from Formosat-2 (Taiwan) and Kompsat-2 (South Korea) and from radar satellites (TerraSar-X, ERS, Envisat, Radarsat). [[Spot Image]] is also the exclusive distributor of data from the high resolution [[Pleiades satellites]] with a resolution of 0.50 meter or about 20&amp;nbsp;inches. The launches occurred in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The company also offers infrastructures for receiving and processing, as well as added value options.

===ASTER===

The [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer]] (ASTER) is an imaging instrument onboard Terra, the flagship satellite of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) launched in December 1999. ASTER is a cooperative effort between NASA, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems). ASTER data is used to create detailed maps of land surface temperature, reflectance, and elevation. The coordinated system of EOS satellites, including Terra, is a major component of NASA's Science Mission Directorate and the Earth Science Division. The goal of NASA Earth Science is to develop a scientific understanding of the Earth as an integrated system, its response to change, and to better predict variability and trends in climate, weather, and natural hazards.&lt;ref name="Jet Propulsion Laboratory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/mission.asp |title=ASTER Project |access-date=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Land surface climatology—investigation of land surface parameters, surface temperature, etc., to understand land-surface interaction and energy and moisture fluxes
* Vegetation and ecosystem dynamics—investigations of vegetation and soil distribution and their changes to estimate biological productivity, understand land-atmosphere interactions, and detect ecosystem change
* Volcano monitoring—monitoring of eruptions and precursor events, such as gas emissions, eruption plumes, development of lava lakes, eruptive history and eruptive potential
* Hazard monitoring—observation of the extent and effects of wildfires, flooding, coastal erosion, earthquake damage, and tsunami damage
* Hydrology—understanding global energy and hydrologic processes and their relationship to global change; included is evapotranspiration from plants
* Geology and soils—the detailed composition and geomorphologic mapping of surface soils and bedrocks to study land surface processes and earth's history
* Land surface and land cover change—monitoring desertification, deforestation, and urbanization; providing data for conservation managers to monitor protected areas, national parks, and wilderness areas

===BlackBridge===

[[BlackBridge]], previously known as [[RapidEye]], operates a constellation of five satellites, launched in August 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapideye.net/upload/Press_Releases/2008/PR_Announcement_SuccessfulLaunch_EN_29.08.2008.pdf |title=RapidEye Press Release |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the RapidEye constellation contains identical [[multispectral]]  sensors which are equally calibrated. Therefore, an image from one satellite will be equivalent to an image from any of the other four, allowing for a large amount of imagery to be collected (4 million km² per day), and daily revisit to an area. Each travel on the same orbital plane at 630&amp;nbsp;km, and deliver images in 5 meter pixel size. [[RapidEye]] satellite imagery is especially suited for agricultural, environmental, cartographic and disaster management applications. The company not only offers their imagery, but consults their customers to create services and solutions based on analysis of this imagery .

===ImageSat International===
[[EROS (satellite)|Earth Resource Observation Satellites]], better known as “EROS” satellites, are lightweight, low earth orbiting, high-resolution satellites designed for fast maneuvering between imaging targets. In the commercial high-resolution satellite market, EROS is the smallest very high resolution satellite; it is very agile and thus enables very high performances. The satellites are deployed in a circular sun-synchronous near polar orbit at an altitude of 510&amp;nbsp;km (+/- 40&amp;nbsp;km).
EROS satellites imagery applications are primarily for intelligence, homeland security and national development purposes but also employed in a wide range of civilian applications, including: mapping, border control, infrastructure planning, agricultural monitoring, [[environmental monitoring]], disaster response, training and simulations, etc.

EROS A – a high resolution satellite with 1.9-1.2m resolution panchromatic was launched on December 5, 2000.

EROS B - the second generation of Very High Resolution satellites with 70&amp;nbsp;cm resolution panchromatic, was launched on April 25, 2006.

===Meteosat===
[[File:EUMETSAT Meteosat model.jpg|thumb|Model of a first generation Meteosat geostationary satellite.]]

The [[Meteosat]]-2 geostationary weather satellite began operationally to supply imagery data on 16 August 1981. [[Eumetsat]] has operated the Meteosats since 1987.
*The ''[[Meteosat visible and infrared imager]] (MVIRI)'', three-channel imager: visible, infrared and water vapour; It operates on the first generation [[Meteosat]], Meteosat-7 being still active. 
*The 12-channel ''Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI)'' includes similar channels to those used by MVIRI, providing continuity in climate data over three decades; [[Meteosat Second Generation]] (MSG).
*The ''Flexible Combined Imager (FCI)'' on [[Meteosat#Third Generation ("MTG")|Meteosat Third Generation]] (MTG) will also include similar channels, meaning that all three generations will have provided over 60 years of climate data.

==Disadvantages==
Because the total area of the land on Earth is so large and because resolution is relatively high, satellite databases are huge and [[image processing]] (creating useful images from the raw data) is time-consuming.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Depending on the [[sensor]] used, weather conditions can affect image quality: for example, it is difficult to obtain images for areas of frequent cloud cover such as mountain-tops.  For such reasons, publicly available satellite image datasets are typically processed for visual or scientific commercial use by third parties.

Commercial satellite companies do not place their imagery into the public domain and do not sell their imagery; instead, one must be licensed to use their imagery. Thus, the ability to legally make derivative products from commercial satellite imagery is minimized.

[[Privacy]] concerns have been brought up by some who wish not to have their property shown from above. Google Maps responds to such concerns in their [[FAQ]] with the following statement: "''We understand your privacy concerns... The images that Google Maps displays are no different from what can be seen by anyone who flies over or drives by a specific geographic location.''"&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Betts told the Associated Press (2007) http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070312-google-censor_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''social season''', or '''season''', refers to the traditional annual period when it is customary for members of a social [[elite]] of society to hold [[ball (dance)|balls]], [[Party#Dinner party|dinner parties]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] events. Until [[World War I]], it was also the appropriate time to be resident in the city rather than in the country in order to attend such events.

In modern times in the [[United Kingdom]], "the Season" is known to encompass various prestigious events that take place during the spring and summer. According to [http://www.sloaneyseason.com Sloaney Season], it starts with [[Cheltenham Festival]] (March), and includes [[Grand National]] (April), [[Badminton Horse Trials]] (May), [[Chelsea Flower Show]] (May), [[Epsom Derby]], [[Royal Ascot]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]] (July), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cheltenham Festival marks the start of Sloaney Season |url=https://www.thesloaney.com/events/cheltenham-festival-2018.html |work=The Sloaney |date=13 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social season of London==
[[File:1870-London-season-cartoon.gif|thumb|1870 cartoon satirizing the coming of the [[London]] season.]]
[[File:Polo players.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Polo]]]]
[[File:Wimbledon ballgirl 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]]]
[[File:Qubathenley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henley Royal Regatta]]]]
[[File:Royalascot.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Royal Ascot]]]]
The London social season evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in its traditional form it peaked in the 19th century.  In this era the British elite was dominated by landowning aristocratic and [[gentry]] families who generally regarded their [[country house]] as their main home, but spent several months of the year in the capital to socialise and to engage in [[British politics|politics]]. The most exclusive events were held at the town [[mansion]]s of leading members of the aristocracy. Exclusive public venues such as [[Almack's]] played a secondary role. The Season coincided with the sitting of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] and began some time after [[Christmas]] and ran until [[midsummer]], roughly late June.&lt;ref&gt;'The Social Character of the Estate: The London Season in 1841′, Survey of London: volume 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), pp. 89-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social season played a role in the political life of the country: the members of the two [[Houses of Parliament]] were almost all participants in the season. But the Season also provided an opportunity for the children of marriageable age of the [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] to be launched into society. [[Debutantes]] were formally introduced into society by presentation to the monarch at [[British royal court|royal court]] until it was abolished by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1958. 

The traditional Season went into decline after the [[First World War]], when many aristocratic families gave up their London mansions. From this time on an increasing number of society events took place at public venues, making it harder to maintain social exclusivity.

Many events that take place far from [[central London]] came to be regarded as part of the social season, including [[Royal Ascot]] and the [[Henley Royal Regatta]]. The events that now constitute the London social season are increasingly hosted or sponsored by large companies (i.e. "corporate hospitality"). [[Western dress codes]] still apply to certain events in the season, especially where the Queen maintains an official role.

According to the [[peerage]] guide [[Debrett's]], the traditional social season runs from April to August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/social-season/the-traditional-season.aspx |title=Traditional Season |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Debrett's |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.thesloaney.com The Sloaney] runs a detailed guide to the British Social Season, known as [http://www.sloaneyseason.com Sloaney Season]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thesloaney.com/the-season-a-guide-to-the-british-summer-social-season |title=The Season: Our leading guide to the British Summer Social Season |publisher=The Sloaney |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sloaneyseason.com/about-us |title=Sloaney Season|publisher=Sloaney Season |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05zhhht |title=Morning Brief: Today Programme|publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although several of these events are not actually held in London, such as the [[Hurlingham Polo Association]] at [[Guards Polo Club]], the organisers of most events attempt to avoid date clashes, so it is generally possible to visit all of them in the same year.

The traditional end of the London Season is the [[Glorious Twelfth]] of August, which marks the beginning of the [[Hunting and shooting in the United Kingdom|shooting]] season. Society would retire to the country to [[shoot birds]] during the autumn and [[fox hunting|hunt foxes]] during the winter before coming back to London again with the spring.

===Dress codes===
Many events of the season have traditional expectations with regard to [[Western dress codes]].
*At [[Royal Ascot]], for example, [[hat]]s are compulsory in most enclosures, and to be admitted to the Royal Enclosure for the first time one must either be a guest of a member or be sponsored for membership by two members who have attended for at least six years as a member. This continues to maintain a socially exclusive character to the Royal Enclosure. If permitted to enter, gentlemen are required to wear either black or grey [[morning dress]] with [[waistcoat]] and a [[top hat]]. A gentleman may remove his top hat within a restaurant, a private box, a private club or that facility's terrace, balcony or garden. Hats may also be removed within any enclosed external seating area within the Royal Enclosure Garden. Ladies must not show bare midriffs or shoulders and must wear hats. In the Queen Anne Enclosure (Formerly known as the Grandstand), gentlemen are required to wear [[lounge suit]]s with [[Necktie|ties]] and ladies must wear a hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascot.co.uk/royal/enclosure.html |title=Royal Ascot 14-18th June 2011 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Royal Ascot |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[Henley Royal Regatta]], in the [[Henley Royal Regatta#Stewards' Enclosure|Stewards' Enclosure]] gentlemen must wear a [[lounge jacket]] and tie. Rowing club colours on a blazer or cap are encouraged, as is the wearing of [[boater]]s. A lady's skirt hem must reach below the knee and is checked before entry by the Stewards' Officers and both ladies and gentlemen will be turned away if they fail to comply with the dress code, no matter their prestige in rowing or elsewhere. Hats are encouraged but not required for ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/fashionnews/5700665/What-to-wear-Henley-Royal-Regatta.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=What to wear: Henley Royal Regatta | first=Olivia | last=Bergin | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a student protested being denied entry to the Stewards' Enclosure for failing to meet the dress code, saying she had worn the dress "in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot and nobody said anything," a spokesman defended the dress code saying "The intention is to maintain the atmosphere of an English Garden party of the [[Edwardian period]] by wearing a more traditional dress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5712444/Student-falls-foul-of-Henley-Royal-Regatta-dress-code-wearing-Ascot-outfit.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Student falls foul of Henley Royal Regatta dress code wearing Ascot outfit | first=Murray | last=Wardrop | date=July 2, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members must display their enamel [[badge]]s at all times. Anyone found using a [[mobile phone]] is asked to leave immediately and their Stewards' Enclosure host, identified by the number on the guests badge, may have his membership withdrawn as a result.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*At [[Polo|polo matches]], it is usual for gentlemen to wear a [[blazer]] and always white trousers. Ladies should wear flat shoes, as the tradition of "treading in the divots" precludes wearing heels. The famous Club House at [[Guards Polo Club]] in [[Windsor Great Park]] is for the use of club members only, who wear individually made gold and enamel badges. Members' guests are given special gold-embossed tags.

==In popular culture==
*A London Season features in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' and is often a key plot device in [[Regency romance]] novels.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
*The novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia|Lucia in London]]'' by [[E. F. Benson]] is set during the London season in the 1920s.
*[[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' uses the [[New York City|New York]] social season as a backdrop.
*The novel ''[[The Leopard]]'' by [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa]], and the ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|film]]'' by [[Luchino Visconti]], portray the [[Palermo|Palermitan]] season during the [[Risorgimento]].
*[[Julian Fellowes]]'s novel ''Past Imperfect'' takes place during the 1968 season in London.
*In the 2003 film ''[[What a Girl Wants (film)|What a Girl Wants]]'', Lord Henry Dashwood invites his new-found daughter Daphne to attend the London Season.
*The 2009 young-adult novel ''The Season'' by [[Sarah MacLean]] portrays a young woman entering her first London Season.
*[[Vincente Minnelli]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Debutante (film)|The Reluctant Debutante]]''
*The British [[period drama]] ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' the outspoken youngest daughter of the  fictional [[Earl of Grantham]], Lady Sybil, is presented as a [[debutante]] at court in London during her first season. The family are also portrayed to move to London for the duration of the season, returning to their country seat at the end of it. The show's 2013 Christmas Special (set in the summer of 1923) focuses on cousin Lady Rose McClare's [[debutante ball]] and presentation at court.
*[[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'', and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.
* In [[The Crimson Petal and the White|Michel Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White]], the Season is part and parcel of the plot.
*The ''Malory-Anderson Family Saga Series'' of historical romance novels by [[Johanna Lindsey]] is set primarily in London, the first one opening up in 1817. Throughout the series, one Season or another, and the balls thrown during them, are mentioned in dialogue, to being central to the plot lines themselves.
*[[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel The Muse of the Department contains a description of the London Season:
&lt;blockquote&gt;London is the capital of shops and of speculation, the government is made there. The aristocracy inscribes itself there only during sixty days, it there takes its orders, it inspects the government kitchen, it passes in review its daughters to marry, and equipages to sell, it says good-day and goes away promptly ; - it is so little amusing that it supports itself only for the few days called the season.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Most of the [[Regency Romance]] novels by [[Georgette Heyer]] features the London Season.
*The Royal Ascot racecourse was used as a filming location in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985), where Bond (played for the last time by [[Roger Moore]]) was beginning his mission to defeat the villainous [[Max Zorin]] ([[Christopher Walken]]), whose horse was racing there.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">'''Stream gradient''' is the [[grade (slope)|grade]] measured by the ratio of drop in elevation of a [[stream]] per unit horizontal distance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VriHqlCehQC&amp;q=Stream+gradient+measured+by+ratio+of+drop+in+elevation+of+a+stream+per+horizontal+distance&amp;dq=Stream+gradient+measured+by+ratio+of+drop+in+elevation+of+a+stream+per+horizontal+distance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_qbktf3UAhUJ2WMKHXkLAEcQ6AEIJDAA|title=A Study of the Effects of Stream Channelization and Bank Stabilization on Warm Water Sport Fish in Iowa: the effects of long-reach channelization on habitat and invertebrate drift in some Iowa streams|last=Zimmer|first=David William|last2=Bachmann|first2=Roger W.|date=1976|publisher=Iowa Cooperative Fishery Research Unit, Iowa State University|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually expressed as [[metre|meter]]s per [[kilometre|kilometer]] or [[Foot (length)|feet]] per [[mile]].

==Hydrology and geology==
A high gradient indicates a steep slope and rapid [[volumetric flow rate|flow]] of [[water]] (i.e. more ability to erode); where as a low gradient indicates a more nearly level [[stream bed]] and sluggishly moving water, that may be able to carry only small amounts of very fine [[sediment]].  High gradient streams tend to have steep, narrow V-shaped [[valley]]s, and are referred to as young streams. Low gradient streams have wider and less rugged [[valley]]s, with a tendency for the stream to [[meander]]. Many rivers involve, to some extent, a flattening of the river gradient as approach the terminus at sea level.

==Fluvial erosion==
A stream that flows upon a uniformly [[erosion|erodible]] substrate will tend to have a steep gradient near its source, and a low gradient nearing zero as it reaches its [[base level]]. Of course, a uniform substrate would be rare in nature; hard layers of [[rock (geology)|rock]] along the way may establish a temporary base level, followed by a high gradient, or even a [[waterfall]], as softer materials are encountered below the hard layer.

Human [[dam]]s, [[glaciation]], changes in [[sea level]], and many other factors can also change the "normal" or ''natural'' gradient pattern.

==Topographic mapping==
On [[topographic map]]s, stream [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] can be easily approximated if the scale of the map and the contour intervals are known. [[Contour lines#Elevation and depth|Contour lines]] form a V-shape on the map, pointing upstream. By counting the number of lines that cross a certain segment of a stream, multiplying this by the contour interval, and dividing that quantity by the length of the stream segment, one obtains an approximation to the stream gradient.

Because stream gradient is customarily given in feet per 1000 feet,  one should then measure the amount a stream segment rises and the length of the stream segment in feet, then multiply feet per foot gradient by 1000. For example, if one measures a scale mile along the stream length, and counts three contour lines crossed on a map with ten-foot contours, the gradient is approximately 5.7 feet per 1000 feet, a fairly steep gradient.

'''Tube sockets''' are [[Electrical connector|electrical sockets]] into which [[vacuum tube]]s (also known as valves) can be plugged, holding them in place and providing terminals, which can be soldered into the circuit, for each of the pins. Sockets are designed to allow tubes to be inserted in only one orientation. They were used in all tube electronic equipment to allow tubes, which failed relatively frequently, to be quickly tested and replaced. In the day of tube radio and television it was common in the US for local [[drug store]]s to have vacuum [[tube tester]]s, and sell replacement tubes. Many [[nixie tube]]s were also designed to use sockets.

Throughout the tube era, as technology developed, sometimes differently in different parts of the world, many tube bases and sockets came into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tube sockets were typically mounted in holes on a sheet metal chassis and wires or other components were hand [[solder]]ed to lugs on the underside of the socket. In the 1950s, [[printed circuit board]]s were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the [[integrated circuit]] era.

In the 1930s, tubes often had the connection to the [[control grid]] brought out through a metal [[top cap]] on the top of the tube. This was connected by using a clip with an attached wire lead. An example would be the 6A7 [[pentagrid converter]]. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or [[anode]] lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube's output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for color television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage regulator tubes.) A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.

[[Image:Tube 75.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tube 75 from the 1930s with UX-6 base and top grid cap]]

==The first tubes==
The earliest tubes, like the ''[[Lee de Forest|Deforest]] Spherical [[Audion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Deforest Spherical Audion|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=97&amp;UID=20130720104245|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads for the other elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the ''Cunningham AudioTron'' from 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Cunningham Tubular Audio Tron|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=170&amp;UID=20130720104245|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Deforest Oscillion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Howard|title=Deforest Oscillion 250 W Transmitting Tube|url=http://www.stonevintageradio.com/description.php?II=542&amp;UID=20130720104247|work=Stone Vintage Radio Museum|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type C6A xenon [[Thyratron|thyratrons]], used in servos for the U.S. Navy [[Ship gun fire-control system|Stable Element Mark 6]], had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).
==Early bases==
[[File:4-6 pin.jpg|thumb|251x251px|Two early tubes with four and six pin bases]]When tubes became more widespread, and new electrodes were added, more connections were required. Specially designed bases were created to account for this need. However, as the world was suffering from [[World War I]], and the new electronics technology was just emerging, designs were far from being standardized. Usually, each company had their own tubes and sockets, which were not interchangeable with tubes from other companies. By the early 1920s, this situation was finally changing, and several standard bases were created. They consisted of a base (ceramic, metal, [[bakelite]], etc.) with a number of prongs ranging from three to seven, with either a non-regular distribution or with one or two of the prongs of bigger diameter than the other, so that the tube could only be inserted in a certain position. Sometimes they relied on a bayonet on the side of the base. Examples of these are the very common USA bases UX4, UV4, UY5 and UX6, and the European B5, B6, B7, B8, C7, G8A, etc. Tubes in the USA typically had from four to seven pins in a circular array, with adjacent pairs of larger pins for heater connections.

Before AC line/mains-powered radios were developed, some four-pin tubes (in particular, the very common UX-201A ('01A)) had a bayonet pin on the side of a cylindrical base. The socket used that pin for retaining the tube; insertion finished with a slight clockwise turn. Leaf springs, essentially all in the same plane, pressed upward on the bottoms of the pins, also keeping the bayonet pin engaged.

The first hot-cathode CRT, the [[Western Electric]] 224-B, had a standard four-pin bayonet base, and the bayonet pin was a live connection. (Five effective pins: It was an electrostatic-deflection gas-focused type, with a diode gun and single-ended deflection. The anode and the other two plates were common.)&lt;!-- Ref.: Rider's Encyclopedia on C.R. Oscilloscopes and Their Uses; sorry; I'm exhausted! --&gt;

An early exception to these types of bases is the Peanut 215, which instead of using prongs had a tiny bayonet base with four drop-like contacts. Another exception is the European Side Contact series commonly known as P, which instead of using a prong, relied on side contacts at 90 degrees from the tube axis with four to twelve contacts.

[[File:6P3S.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An octal base tube, Russian 6Π3C, similar to the [[6L6]].]]
In 1935, [[RCA]] introduced a new type of tube base for their new metal envelope tubes, which they called an ''octal base''. As the name implies it had eight pins&amp;mdash;more than were usually used previously. Octal bases, as defined in IEC 60067,&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60067: "Dimensions of electronic tubes and valves. IEC dimensions" (1966). Also published as BS 448-1:1981.&lt;/ref&gt; diagram IEC 67-I-5a, have a 45-degree angle between pins, which form a {{convert|17.45|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} diameter circle around a {{convert|7.82|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} diameter keyed post (sometimes called a ''spigot'') in the center. Octal sockets were designed to accept octal tubes, the rib in the keyed post fitting an indexing slot in the socket so the tube could only be inserted in one orientation.

When used on metal tubes, pin 1 was always reserved for a connection to the metal shell, which was usually grounded for shielding purposes. The octal base soon caught on for glass tubes, where the large central post could also house and protect the "[[evacuation tip]]" of the glass tube. The eight available pins allowed more complex tubes than before, such as dual triodes, to be constructed. The glass envelope of an octal base tube was cemented into a [[bakelite]] or plastic base with a hollow post in the center, surrounded by eight metal pins. The wire leads from the tube were soldered into the pins, and the evacuation tip was protected inside the post.

Matching plugs were also manufactured that let tube sockets be used as eight-pin [[electrical connector]]s; penurious experimenters would sometimes salvage the base from a discarded tube for this purpose. Octal sockets were used to mount other components, particularly [[electrolytic capacitor]] assemblies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmid|first=Kurt|title=R-390A plug-in multi-section electrolytic capacitor kit|url=http://www.schmid-mainz.de/elco.pdf|work=Schmid-Mainz|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and electrical [[relay]]s; octal-mount relays are still common.&lt;ref&gt;A socket similar to the standard otcal but with 11 pins also exists, and is also called "octal". It is an industry standard, developed mainly for industrial 3-phase relays (3PDT or TPDT) in order to accommodate three changeover contacts. It was also used in some older power supplies but was never used for tubes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most octal tubes following the widespread European designation system have penultimate digit "3" as in ECC34 (full details in the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] article). There is a different, totally obsolete, pre-world-war-II German octal type.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Octal and miniature tubes are still in use in tube-type audio [[hi fi|hi-fi]] and [[guitar amplifier]]s. Relays were historically manufactured in a vacuum tube form,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amperite {{!}} Time Delay Relays {{!}} Flashers {{!}} Controlling Devices {{!}} Relay Requirements|url = http://www.amperite.com/history.html|website = www.amperite.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and industrial grade relays continue to use the octal base for their pinout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advantages of a Full Featured, Octal 700 Series Relay|last = |first = |publisher = Magnecraft|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.serelays.com/library/section1/105A_750.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Amperite Relay Catalog|last = |first = |publisher = Amperite|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.amperite.com/assets/Documents/Amperite%20Catalog%20Printed%206.0%20Reduced.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loctal==
[[File:Heksoda i trioda UCH21.jpeg|thumb|upright|A loctal-base tube, Polish Telam UCH21 next to a wooden match for size comparison]]
A variant of the octal base, the B8G '''loctal base''' or ''lock-in'' base (sometimes spelled "loktal"&amp;nbsp;— trademarked by Sylvania), was developed by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Staff of 'Wireless World'|title=Radio Valve Data|date=1958|publisher=Iliffe $ Sons Ltd|location=London|page=87|edition=Sixth|chapter=Explanation of Valve-Base Connections}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pin geometry was the same as for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also mechanically locked (hence "loctal") the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably [[Philco]], which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark on the side of the base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the [[Fernico]] or [[Cunife]] lead-out wires from the tube, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.

The loctal tube's structure was supported directly by the connecting pins passing through the glass "button" base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass "pinch", formed by heating the bottom of the envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the connecting wires in the pinch's glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The connecting wires then passed through the hollow base pins, where they were soldered to make permanent connections.

Loctal tubes had shorter connecting lengths between the socket pins and the internal elements than did their octal counterparts. This allowed them to operate at higher frequencies than octal tubes. The advent of miniature "all-glass" seven- and nine-pin tubes overtook both octals and loctals, so the loctal's higher-frequency potential was never fully exploited.

Loctal tube type numbers in the USA typically begin with "7" (for 6.3-volt types) or "14" for 12.6-volt types. This was fudged by specifying the heater voltage as ''nominally'' 7 or 14 volts so that the tube nomenclature fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sylvania Type 7A8|url=http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/108/7/7A8.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battery types (mostly 1.4-volt) are coded "1Lxn", where ''x'' is a letter and "n" a number, such as "1LA4". Russian loctals ''end'' in L, e.g. 6J1L. European designations are ambiguous; all B8G loctals have numbers either in the range:
* 20–29, (such as EBL21, ECH21, EF22) except for early tubes in the series: DAC21, DBC21, DCH21, DF21, DF22, DL21, DLL21, DM21 which have either B9G or octal bases, the change to Sylvania's locktal standard coming in 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC21|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_dac21.html|accessdate=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* or 50–59 (special bases, including the European 9-pin lock-in base), but other types are in the same range (e.g. while EF51 is B8G loctal, the EF55 is 9-pin loctal, B9G, and the EL51 has a side-contact P8A base).

===Other loctals===
* Nine-pin loctal bases, B9G, include the 1938 Philips [[EF50]], EL60 and some type numbers in the European 20–29 and 50–59 range;
* There is a different "loctal Lorenz" in the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] &lt;!--COMMENT (B8D, given numbers in the 70–79 range?)--&gt;.

==Miniature tubes==
[[File:12AU7.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of 12AU7As (ECC82) showing both triodes.]]
Efforts to introduce small tubes into the marketplace date from the 1920s, when experimenters and hobbyists made radios with so-called '''peanut tubes'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonevintageradio.com/images/573.jpg Photo of 1920s era peanut tube.]&lt;/ref&gt; like the Peanut 215 mentioned above. Because of the primitive manufacturing techniques of the time, these tubes were too unreliable for commercial use.

RCA announced in "Electronics" magazine, new miniature tubes, which proved reliable. The first ones, such as the 6J6 ECC91 [[Very high frequency|VHF]] dual triode, were introduced in 1939. The bases commonly referred to as "miniature" are the 7-pin B7G type, and the slightly later 9-pin B9A (Noval). The pins are arranged evenly in a circle of eight or ten evenly spaced positions, with one pin omitted; this allows the tube to be inserted in only one orientation. Keying by omitting a pin is also used in 8 (subminiature), 10, and 12-pin ([[Compactron]]) tubes (a variant 10-pin form, "Noval+1", is basically a 9-pin socket with an added center contact).

As with loctal tubes, the pins of miniature tube are stiff wires protruding through the bottom of the glass envelope which plug directly into the socket. However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base is an integral part of the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the Compactron series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature tube sockets had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal electrostatic shield that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with thermal contacts to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a [[heat sink]], which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.

Electrolytic effects from the differing metal alloys used for the miniature tube pins (usually [[Cunife]] or [[Fernico]]) and the tube base could cause intermittent contact due to local corrosion, especially in relatively low current tubes, such as were used in battery-operated radio sets. Malfunctioning equipment with miniature tubes can sometimes be brought back to life by removing and reinserting the tubes, disturbing the insulating layer of corrosion.

Miniature tubes were widely manufactured for military use during World War II,&lt;ref name=sixj6&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aaa0399.htm The National Valve Museum: 6J6]&lt;/ref&gt; and also used in consumer equipment. The Sonora Radio and Television Corporation produced the first radio using these miniature tubes, the "Candid", in April 1940.&lt;ref name=schiffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiffer|first=Michael Brian|title=The Portable Radio in American Life|year=1992|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0816512843|pages=123–125|url=https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Radio-American-Culture-Technology/dp/0816512841}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1940 RCA released its battery-operated '''Model BP-10''', the first [[superheterodyne receiver]] small enough to fit in a handbag or coat pocket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/428/M0015428.pdf Schematic of RCA Model BP-10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vintage-electronics.com/photos/1183.JPG Photo of RCA Model BP-10]&lt;/ref&gt;  This model had the following tube lineup:  '''1R5'''&amp;nbsp;— [[pentagrid converter]]; '''1T4'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Intermediate-Frequency_(IF)_amplifier|I.F. amplifier]];  '''1S5'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Detector_(radio)|Detector]]/AVC/AF Amplifier;  '''1S4'''&amp;nbsp;— Audio Output. The BP-10 proved so popular that Zenith, Motorola, Emerson, and other radio manufacturers produced similar pocket radios based on RCA's miniature tubes.&lt;ref name="schiffer" /&gt; Several of these pocket radios were introduced in 1941 and sold until the suspension of radio production in April 1942 for the duration of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Miniature Radio Tubes|journal=Radio Age|date=April 1945|pages=19|url=http://www.vacuumtubeera.net/RadioAge-1945-04.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war miniature tubes continued to be manufactured for civilian use, regardless of any technical advantage, as they were cheaper than octals and loctals.&lt;ref name=sixj6/&gt;

=== Miniature 7-pin base ===
The '''B7G''' (or "'''small-button'''" or "'''heptal'''") seven-pin miniature tubes are smaller than Noval, with seven pins arranged at 45-degree spacing in a 9.53&amp;nbsp;mm (3/8th inch) diameter arc, the "missing" pin position being used to position the tube in its socket (unlike octal, loctal and rimlock sockets). Examples include the 6AQ5/EL90 and 6BE6/EK90. European tubes of this type have numbers 90-99, 100-109, 190-199, 900-999. A few in the  100-109 series have unusual, non-B7G bases, ''e.g.'', Wehrmacht base.

=== Noval base ===
The nine-pin miniature '''Noval''' B9A base, sometimes called button 9-pin, B9-1, offered a useful reduction in physical size compared to previous common types, such as octal (especially important in TV receivers where space was limited), while also providing a sufficient number of connections (unlike B7G) to allow effectively unrestricted access to all the electrodes, even of relatively complex tubes such as double triodes and triode-hexodes. It could also provide multiple connections to an electrode of a simpler device where useful, as in the four connections to the grid of a conventional grounded-grid UHF triode, ''e.g.'', 6AM4, to minimise the deleterious effects of lead inductance on the high-frequency performance.

This base type was used by many of the [[United States]] and most of the European tubes, ''e.g.'', [[12AX7]]-ECC83, [[EF86]] and [[EL84]], produced commercially towards the end of the era before [[transistor]]s largely displaced their use.

The IEC 67-I-12a specification calls for a 36-degree angle between the nine pins of 1.016&amp;nbsp;mm thickness, in an arc of diameter 11.89&amp;nbsp;mm.

European tubes of this type have numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 800-899, 8000-8999.

=== Duodecar base ===
The '''Duodecar''' B12C base (IEC 67-I-17a) has 12 pins in a 19.1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle and dates from 1961. It was also called the [[Compactron]] T-9 construction/E12-70 base&lt;ref&gt;Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual, 14th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally similar in form to a Noval socket, but larger. In the center is a clearance hole for a tube evacuation pip, which is typically on the bottom of a Compactron tube. &lt;!-- also CRTs, fairly sure. Regards, user:nikevich --&gt; (It should not be confused with the similar-sounding but differently sized '''Duodecal''' B12A base.)

=== Rimlock base ===
The '''Rimlock''' (B8A) base is an 8-pin design with a pin circle diameter close to Noval, and uses a nub on the side of the envelope to engage with a guide and retaining spring in the socket wall. This provides pin registration (since the pins are equi-spaced) and also a fair degree of retention. Early tubes with this base type typically had a metal skirt around the lower ~15mm of the envelope to match the socket wall, and this offered a degree of built-in screening, but these were fairly soon replaced by "skirtless" versions, which had a characteristic widening in the glass to compensate physically for the absence of the skirt. In the European naming scheme, rimlock tubes are numbered in the ranges 40-49, 110-119 (with exceptions), and 400-499, ''e.g.'', EF40. Although virtually unknown elsewhere, this was a very common base type in European radios of the late 1940s through the 1950s, but was eventually displaced by the ubiquitous B7G and Noval (B9A) base types.

==UHF tubes==
[[File:AcornTubeSockets.agr.jpg|thumb|upright|A box of Acorn sockets.]]
By 1935 new tube technologies were required for the development of radar and telecommunications. [[UHF]] requirements severely limited the existing tubes, so radical ideas were implemented which affected how these tubes connected to the host system. Two new bases appeared, the [[955 acorn triode|acorn tube]] and the lighthouse tube, both solving the same problems but with different approaches. Thompson, G.M. Rose, Saltzberg and Burnside from RCA created the acorn tube by using far smaller electrodes, with radial short connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Electron Tubes|year=1994|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-9051991451|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHFyngmO95YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Sōgo Okamura}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach was taken by the designers of the lighthouse tube, such as the octal-base [[2C43]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/pdfs/2c43.pdf 2C43 data sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; which relied on using concentric cylindrical metal contacts in connections that minimized inductance, thus allowing a much higher frequency.

[[Nuvistor]]s were very small, reducing stray capacitances and lead inductances. The base and socket were so compact that they were widely used in UHF TV tuners. They could also be used in small-signal applications at lower frequencies, as in the [[Ampex]] MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors.

==Other socket styles==
There are many other socket types, of which a few are:
* '''Decal''' B10B base (IEC 67-I-41a) 10 pins with 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in an 11.89&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle, e.g. PFL200
* '''Decar''' B10G base (IEC E10-73) A 10th pin added to the center of a standard 9-pin miniature base, e.g. 6C9
* '''Magnoval''' B9D base (IEC 67-I-36a) 9 pins with 1.27&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in a 17.45&amp;nbsp;mm pin circle diameter arc, e.g. EL503, EL509, PD500, etc. - not to be confused with...
* '''Novar''' B9E base, 9 pins with 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm diameter in a 17.45&amp;nbsp;mm pin circle diameter arc, one of several Compactron types, which looks similar to Magnoval (but a Novar tube in a Magnoval socket will not make good pin contect, and a Magnoval tube in a Novar socket may damage the socket).
* '''Sub-Magnal''' B11A base (American), 11-pins.  Also used as industrial relay socket and HV power supplies. Amphenol / WirePro (WPI) / Eaton 78-series, Socket (female) part number: 78-S-11.  Matching Plug (male) is part number: 86-CP-11
* '''Neo Eightar''' base (IEC 67-I-31a) 8 pins in a 15.24&amp;nbsp;mm diameter circle
* 5-pin sub-miniature wire-ended B5A base (no socket used; e.g. EA76)

A remarkably wide variety of tube and similar sockets is listed and described, with some informal application notes, at a commercial site, Pacific T.V.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacifictv.ca/socket.htm&lt;/ref&gt; including nuvistor, 8-pin subminiature, vidicon, reflex klystron, nine-pin octal-like, 10-pin miniature (two types), 11-pin sub-magnal, diheptal 14-pin, and many display tubes such as Nixies and vacuum fluorescent types (and even more). As well, each socket has a link to a clear, high-quality picture. &lt;!-- I'm not keen on offering commercial sites, but this is seriously exceptional! I'm a 75-year-old retired lifetime electronic tech, and several of the tube sockets, much less exotica such as 20-pin relay sockets (iirc!) were new to me. Regards, user:nikevich --&gt;

Some subminiature tubes with flexible wire leads all exiting in the same plane were connected by subminiature inline sockets. &lt;!-- No luck with a Google image search -- user:nikevich - Does the EA76 fit this description?--&gt;

Some low-power [[reflex klystron]]s such as the 2K25 and 2K45 had small-diameter rigid coaxial outputs parallel to octal base pins. To accommodate the coax, one contact was replaced by a clearance hole.

Vacuum tubes for high-power applications often required custom socket designs. A jumbo four-prong socket was used for various industrial tubes. A specialized 7-pin socket (Septar or B7A), with all pins in a circle with one pin wider than the others, was used for transmitting tubes. Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards. Sockets were made for early [[transistor]]s, but quickly fell out of favor as transistor reliability became established. This also happened with early integrated circuits; IC sockets later became used only for devices that may need to be upgraded.

A '''yellow hypergiant''' is a massive [[star]] with an extended [[atmosphere]], a [[spectral class]] from A to K, and an initial mass of about 20–60 [[solar masses]] but having lost as much as half that mass.  They are amongst the most visually luminous stars, with [[absolute magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) around &amp;minus;9, but also one of the rarest with just 15 known in the [[Milky Way]] and six of those in just [[Westerlund 1|a single cluster]]. They are sometimes referred to as cool hypergiants in comparison to O- and B-type stars, and sometimes as warm hypergiants in comparison to red supergiants.

==Classification==
The term "hypergiant"" was used as early as 1929, but not for the stars currently known as hypergiants.&lt;ref name=wallenquist&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1929BAN.....5...67W|title=An attempt to determine the mean masses of the stars in the globular cluster M 3|journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands|volume=5|pages=67|author1=Wallenquist|first1=Aå|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypergiants are defined by their '0' [[luminosity class]], and are higher in luminosity than the brightest [[supergiant]]s of class Ia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1943assw.book.....M|title=An atlas of stellar spectra, with an outline of spectral classification|journal=Chicago|author1=Morgan|first1=William Wilson|last2=Keenan|first2=Philip Childs|last3=Kellman|first3=Edith|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were not referred to as hypergiants until the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="dejager1980"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-9030-2_2|chapter=The Main Observational Characteristics of the Most Luminous Stars|title=The Brightest Stars|pages=18|year=1980|last1=De Jager|first1=Cornelis|isbn=978-90-277-1110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criterion for hypergiants was also suggested in 1979 for some other highly luminous mass-losing hot stars,&lt;ref name=desandres&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1979A&amp;AS...38..367L|title=Line Blocking in the Near Ultraviolet Spectrum of Early-Type Stars - Part Two - the Dependence on Spectral Type and Luminosity for Normal Stars|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement|volume=38|pages=367|author1=Llorente De Andres|first1=F.|last2=Lamers|first2=H. J. G. L. M.|last3=Muller|first3=E. A.|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but was not applied to cooler stars. In 1991, [[Rho Cassiopeiae]] was the first to be described as a yellow hypergiant,&lt;ref name=zsoldos&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1991A&amp;A...246..441Z|title=Photometry of yellow semiregular variables - Rho Cassiopeiae|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |issn=0004-6361|volume=246|pages=441|author1=Zsoldos|first1=E.|last2=Percy|first2=J. R.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; likely becoming grouped as a new class of luminous stars during discussions at the ''Solar physics and astrophysics at interferometric resolution'' workshop in 1992.&lt;ref name=dejager&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992ESASP.344..109D|title=Yellow hypergiant interferometry: A clue to understanding evolutionary instability|journal=In ESA|volume=344|pages=109|author1=De Jager|first1=Cornelis|last2=Nieuwenhuijzen|first2=Hans|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of the term hypergiant remains vague, and although luminosity class 0 is for hypergiants, they are more commonly designated by the alternative luminosity classes Ia-0 and Ia&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=achmad&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&amp;A...259..600A|title=A photometric study of the G0-4 Ia(+) hypergiant HD 96918 (V382 Carinae)|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |issn=0004-6361|volume=259|pages=600|author1=Achmad|first1=L.|last2=Lamers|first2=H. J. G. L. M.|last3=Nieuwenhuijzen|first3=H.|last4=Van Genderen|first4=A. M.|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their great stellar luminosities are determined from various spectral features, which are sensitive to surface gravity, such as Hβ line widths in hot stars or a strong [[Balmer discontinuity]] in cooler stars.  Lower surface gravity often indicates larger stars, and hence, higher luminosities.&lt;ref name=ubvy&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1993A&amp;A...268..653N|title=On the determination of effective temperature and surface gravity of B, A, and F stars using Stromgren UVBY beta photometry|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |issn=0004-6361|volume=268|pages=653|author1=Napiwotzki|first1=R.|last2=Schoenberner|first2=D.|last3=Wenske|first3=V.|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cooler stars, the width of observed oxygen lines, such as O I at 777.4&amp;nbsp;nm., can be used to calibrate directly against stellar luminosity.&lt;ref name=ferro&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2003RMxAA..39....3A|title=A Revised Calibration of the MV-W(O I 7774) Relationship using Hipparcos Data: Its Application to Cepheids and Evolved Stars|journal=Revista Mexicana de Astronomía y Astrofísica |volume=39|pages=3|author1=Arellano Ferro|first1=A.|last2=Giridhar|first2=S.|last3=Rojo Arellano|first3=E.|year=2003|arxiv = astro-ph/0210695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One astrophysical method used to definitively identify yellow hypergiants is the so-called ''Keenan-Smolinski'' criterion. Here all absorption lines should be strongly broadened, beyond those expected with bright supergiant stars, and also show strong evidence of significant mass loss. Furthermore, at least one broadened [[H-alpha|Hα]] component should also be present. They may also display very complex Hα profiles, typically having strong emission lines combined with absorption lines.&lt;ref name=dejaeger/&gt;

The terminology of yellow hypergiants is further complicated by referring to them as either cool hypergiants or warm hypergiants, depending on the context.  Cool hypergiants refers to all sufficiently luminous and unstable stars cooler than blue hypergiants and [[Luminous blue variable|LBV]]s, including both yellow and red hypergiants.&lt;ref name=cool&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2013ASPC..470..167L|title=Long-term Spectroscopic Monitoring of Cool Hypergiants HR 8752, IRC+10420, and 6 Cas near the Yellow Evolutionary Void|journal=370 Years of Astronomy in Utrecht.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Rhocas lightcurve.png|thumb|left|Visual light curve for [[ρ Cassiopeiae]] from 1933 to 2015]]
Yellow hypergiants occupy a region of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] above the [[instability strip]], a region where relatively few stars are found and where those stars are generally unstable.  The spectral and temperature ranges are approximately A0-K2 and 4,000-8,000K respectively. The area is bounded on the high-temperature side by the ''Yellow Evolutionary Void'' where stars of this luminosity become extremely unstable and experience severe mass loss. The “Yellow Evolutionary Void” separates yellow hypergiants from [[luminous blue variable]]s although yellow hypergiants at their hottest and luminous blue variables at their coolest can have approximately the same temperature near 8,000&amp;nbsp;K.   At the lower temperature bound, yellow hypergiants and red supergiants are not clearly separated; [[RW Cephei]] (4,500&amp;nbsp;K, {{solar luminosity|555,000}}) is an example of a star that shares characteristics of both yellow hypergiants and red supergiants.&lt;ref name=stothers/&gt;&lt;ref name=void/&gt;

Yellow hypergiants have a fairly narrow range of luminosities above {{solar luminosity|300,000}} (e.g. [[V382 Carinae]] at {{solar luminosity|316,000}}) and below the Humphrey-Davidson limit at around {{solar luminosity|600,000}}.  With their output peaking in the middle of the visual range, these are the most visually bright stars known with absolute magnitudes around -9 or -9.5&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref name=zsoldos/&gt;

They are large and somewhat unstable, with very low surface gravities. Where yellow supergiants have surface gravities (log&amp;nbsp;g) below about&amp;nbsp;2, the yellow hypergiants have log&amp;nbsp;g around zero.  In addition they pulsate irregularly, producing small variations in temperature and brightness.  This produces very high mass loss rates, and nebulosity is common around the stars.&lt;ref name=rhocas&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lobel |first1= A. |last2= Israelian |first2= G. |last3= de Jager |first3= C. |last4= Musaev |first4= F. |last5= Parker |first5= J.

Yellow hypergiants form from massive stars after they have evolved away from the main sequence.  Most observed yellow hypergiants have been through a red supergiant phase and are evolving back towards higher temperatures, but a few are seen in the brief first transition from main sequence to red supergiant. Supergiants with an initial mass less than {{solar mass|20}} will explode as a supernova while still red supergiants, while stars more massive than about {{solar mass|60}} will never cool beyond blue supergiant temperatures. The exact mass ranges depend on [[metallicity]] and rotation.&lt;ref name=groh2013&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...558A.131G|arxiv=1308.4681|title=Fundamental properties of core-collapse supernova and GRB progenitors: Predicting the look of massive stars before death|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=558|pages=A131|author1=Groh|first1=Jose H.|last2=Meynet|first2=Georges|last3=Georgy|first3=Cyril|last4=Ekström|first4=Sylvia|year=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yellow supergiants cooling for the first time may be massive stars of up to {{solar mass|60}} or more,&lt;ref name=void/&gt; but post-red supergiant stars will have lost around half their initial mass.&lt;ref name=gesicki&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1992A&amp;A...254..280G|title=A Modelling of Circumstellar BAII Lines for the Hypergiant Rho-Cassiopeiae|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=254|pages=280|author1=Gesicki|first1=K.|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemically, most yellow hypergiants show strong surface enhancement of [[nitrogen]] and also of [[sodium]] and some other [[heavy elements]]. [[Carbon]] and [[oxygen]] are depleted, while helium is enhanced, as expected for a post-main-sequence star.

==Evolution==
Yellow hypergiants have clearly evolved off the main sequence and so have depleted the hydrogen in their cores.  The majority of yellow hypergiants are postulated to be post-[[red supergiant]]s evolving blueward,&lt;ref name=stothers&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stothers | first1 = R.

These stars are doubly rare because they are very massive, initially hot class O-type main-sequence stars more than 15 times as massive as the Sun, but also because they spend only a few thousand years in the unstable yellow void phase of their lives. In fact, it is difficult to explain even the small number of observed yellow hypergiants, relative to red supergiants of comparable luminosity, from simple models of stellar evolution.  The most luminous red supergiants may execute multiple "blue loops", shedding much of their atmosphere, but without actually ever reaching the blue supergiant stage, each one taking only a few decades at most.  Conversely, some apparent yellow hypergiants may be hotter stars, such as the "missing" LBVs, masked within a cool pseudo-photosphere.&lt;ref name=stothers/&gt;

Recent discoveries of blue supergiant supernova progenitors have also raised the question of whether stars could explode directly from the yellow hypergiant stage.&lt;ref name=supernova&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Langer | first1 = N. | last2 = Norman | first2 = C.

Modern models suggest that stars with a certain range of masses and rotation rates may explode as [[supernovae]] without ever becoming blue supergiants again, but many will eventually pass right through the yellow void and become low-mass low-luminosity [[luminous blue variable]]s and possibly [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s after that.&lt;ref name=lbv&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = N. | last2 = Vink | first2 = J.

According to the current physical models of stars, a yellow hypergiant should possess a [[convection|convective]] core surrounded by a [[radiation|radiative]] zone, as opposed to a sun-sized star, which consists of a radiative core surrounded by a [[convective zone]].&lt;ref name=convection&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fadeyev | first1 = Y.

The yellow hypergiant is an expected phase of evolution as the most luminous red supergiants evolve bluewards, but they may also represent a different sort of star.  LBVs during eruption have such dense winds that they form a pseudo-photosphere which appears as a larger cooler star despite the underlying blue supergiant being largely unchanged.  These are observed to have a very narrow range of temperatures around 8,000K. At the bistability jump which occurs around 21,000K blue supergiant winds become several times denser and could be result in an even cooler pseudo-photosphere.  No LBVs are observed just below the luminosity where the bistability jump crosses the [[S Doradus variable|S Doradus instability strip]] (not to be confused with the [[instability strip|Cepheid instability strip]]), but it is theorised that they do exist and appear as yellow hypergiants because of their pseudo-photospheres.&lt;ref name=pseudo&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benaglia | first1 = P. | last2 = Vink | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1039">'''Zeeman energy''', or the external field energy, is the potential energy of a magnetised body in an external magnetic field. It is named after the Dutch physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], primarily known by the [[Zeeman effect]]. In SI units, it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm Zeeman} =-\mu_{0} \int_V\,\textbf M\cdot \textbf H_{\rm Ext} \, \mathrm dV&lt;/math&gt;

where H&lt;sub&gt;Ext&lt;/sub&gt; is the external field, M the local magnetisation, and the integral is done over the volume of the body. This is the statistical average (over a 
unit volume macroscopic sample) of a corresponding microscopic Hamiltonial (energy) for each individual [[magnetic moment]] '''m''', which is however experiencing a ''local'' induction '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;H =-\textbf m \cdot \textbf B &lt;/math&gt;
