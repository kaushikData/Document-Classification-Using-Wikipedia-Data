'''Aghor Yoga''' (also referred to as Aghor) is a spiritual tradition that originated in Northern India around the 11th Century C.E. The word Aghor literally means "that which is not difficult or terrible." Aghor is a simple and natural state of consciousness, in which there is no experience of fear, hatred, disgust or discrimination.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonomaashram.org/teachings_aghor_yoga.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926211652/http://www.sonomaashram.org/teachings_aghor_yoga.php |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df= }}, Sonomaashram.org (accessed: Thursday 16 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aghor Yoga, any time that humans experience a state of discrimination, we limit our wholeness and fall prey to disruptive emotions such as anger, fear, jealousy, greed, and lust.&lt;ref&gt;^, Sonomaashram.org&lt;/ref&gt; The practices of Aghor Yoga today reflect reforms made in the 1960s, shifting the focus of Aghor to seeking a balanced life of selfless service and personal practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/encounter/stories/2006/1782966.htm Encounter: Aghoris], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Baba [[Bhagwan Ramji]] encouraged the practitioners of Aghor to follow the "left hand path" by embracing socially stigmatized and neglected people, such as street children and people with leprosy and other "untouchable" diseases. Today, the followers of Aghoreshwar Bhagwan Ramji have established a large network of schools, orphanages, medical clinics, or other social service projects.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness''. Aghor Publications. {{ISBN|0-9670701-0-4}}. p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and practices==
The modern teachings and practices of Aghor are known as Aghor Yoga. Aghor Yoga can be practiced by anyone without regard to religious or ethnic background and irrespective of whether s/he adopts traditional Aghori dietary practices. The essence of Aghor Yoga is that fundamentally humans are each an individual whole, at one with divine consciousness. Aghor Yoga believes that by learning to identify with one’s wholeness, one becomes free from a limited way of being. As a result, the energy that was previously invested in limitation becomes accessible for being directed towards the greater good.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Encounter: Aghoris&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings and practices of Aghor defy easy categorization. Some adherents classify Aghor as a non-dualistic (advaita) Hindu philosophy. Classic [[nondualism]] explains that only the one eternal Self – alternately referred to as God, Brahman, or Atman – is real. Accordingly, Aghor believes that all of humanity is a part of this higher Self. Beyond this, everything else in the universe is mere illusion (maya).&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings of Aghor are meant to be universal, transcending all particularities of Hinduism or Indian culture. The contemporary Aghor lineage of Baba Kinaram includes people from many religious faiths and countries of origin, including the United States and Europe. The lineage also recognizes great spiritual beings of all religions (such as [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], and [[Mohammed]]) as abiding in the realized state of Aghor – that is existing in wholeness and at one with the Divine.

Aghor focuses on the idea of [[jivanmukta]], or reaching liberation from material issues in this lifetime. Thus, one does not have to die before reaching a state of Aghor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
 
Any disciplined effort that one makes to connect with one’s wholeness is called [[sadhana]] (spiritual practice). A consistent effort that is in tune with human nature, simple to comprehend, and easy to practice bears fruit. Such a spiritual practice is thought to connect one with fullness, and when one is full, that fullness overflows into the outward action of [[Selfless service|seva]]. Seva is the selfless service one contributes to the community and world. Sadhana and seva form the two foundational aspects of the Aghor Yoga Path.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===Guru===
A disciple of Aghor Yoga often relies on a  [[Guru]] – a capable spiritual teacher – to provide guidance when forming their practice of sadhana and seva. The Aghor definition of the word Guru is "remover of doubt." The Guru is meant to function both as a bridge between outward action and spiritual wisdom, as well as an example of realization of the Aghor path. One distinguishing feature of the Aghor Yoga path is that the Guru is very accessible to the students.  A bridge does not just provide a means of passage between two realms of thought; it is also a lookout point from which one can see the blessings floating on a sustenance-giving river.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guru is also believed to reside within all beings in the form of a higher [[Self]]. In order to form a conscious connection to one’s own Self, a Guru is chosen for guidance. Eventually, it is hoped that an understanding of Gurupeeth (literally, the seat of the Guru) in oneself is formed.

There is no restriction of any kind in accepting a Guru. A Guru is a person in whose company one feels inspired and reminded of one’s divinity and wholeness. In Aghor Yoga, a Guru is commonly a person who has walked the path and is willing and available to guide the practitioner in their own practice. 
 
A Guru suggests a formal practice to the seeker. It is the responsibility of the seeker to cultivate their practice by aligning with the teachings. Though one is not required to follow the Guru’s exact prescriptions, it is commonly accepted that one will pay careful attention to their Guru’s teachings regarding spiritual practice and not try to modify or dilute them.
 
In Aghor Yoga the Guru instructs the seeker in the basics of sadhana (cultivation of a daily personal practice) and seva (their selfless service in the world). By incorporating the practices of sadhana and seva into everyday life, the student seeks to achieve a sense of peace and fulfillment through becoming better equipped to meet the challenges of modern life with calmness, grace and skill.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The Guru starts the practitioner on the path of Aghor Yoga through formal initiation by giving a personal [[mantra]] (a sound, syllable, or group of words that, with repetition, become spiritually transformative). In Aghor Yoga, one’s mantra is regarded as a personal friend with its own personality, presence and characteristic. A mantra is also a thread that connects the practitioner with the spiritual powerhouse of all the enlightened beings from the Aghor lineage, thus the practitioner gains a sense of belonging to the family of enlightened beings. It is said, "You are never alone after receiving a mantra." Developing a friendship with one’s mantra becomes the preoccupation of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts and terminology==
Students of the Aghor Yoga tradition seek to attain Aghor, a state of consciousness in which one does not experience fear, hatred, disgust, discrimination, or hunger.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; One who achieves Aghor does not view the world in dualistic terms such as "dead" and "alive" or "edible" and "inedible", and so does not cast judgment upon themselves or others. A person who conscientiously practices these virtues is called an Aughar.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

With constant practice, when one is established unwaveringly in the state of Aghor consciousness, a person becomes an Avadhut – a spiritually realized human being. Anyone from any religious, spiritual or ethnic background who has come to abide in the state of Aghor consciousness, regardless of the path that led to this state, is an Avadhut.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Aghor==
The term "Aghor" has ancient origins which likely precede written history. One of the five faces of [[Shiva]] was known as Aghor. In the Shiva Purana, one of India’s oldest legends, there is a hymn to the glory of Shiva by Pushpadanta, head of the Gandharva clan, called the Shiva Mahimnah Stotram. One of its Sanskrit verses reads:

::::::::::''Aghoranna paro mantro''
::::::::::''Nasti tatvam Guro param.''

The translation is: The very name of Aghor (Shiva, or the one who has attained the state of Aghor) is a mantra that is above all other mantras. There is nothing higher to be known than the real nature of the Guru (spiritual teacher).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Thus, the hagiographic roots of the Aghor tradition are traced to Lord [[Dattatreya]], an avatar of Shiva.

Aghor tradition believes that Jagadguru Dattatreya propounded the tradition of Aghor later followed in the sixteenth century by the great saint [[Baba Kinaram]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwan Ram (2007). ''The Book of Aghor Wisdom''. Indica Books. {{ISBN|81-86569-66-9}}. p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The life story of Baba Kinaram tells of his wandering for years until he attained complete knowledge upon encountering Bhagwan Dattatreya, who appeared to him in the [[Girnar]] Mountains, a holy place in [[Gujarat]] state in northwest [[India]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bhagwan Ram (2007). ''The Book of Aghor Wisdom''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Baba Kinaram settled in the holy city of [[Varanasi]] and wrote a book called ''Viveksar'', recognized now as the most authentic treatise on the principles of Aghor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He claimed that the contents of ''Viveksar'' were revealed to him by Lord Dattatreya. Through this revelation, he saw that the whole world, the whole universe, is situated in each human body, a vast world perfect in all respects. Baba Kinaram later established an ashram in Varanasi, called Krim Kund.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.15&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated many social reforms during the tumultuous times of the Moghul invasion when the Indian people were being persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt; The early devotees of Aghor comprised a diffuse network of wandering ascetics who passed down their beliefs and practices through oral teaching in many different lineages.

In the 1960s, the then-guru of the Baba Kina Ram lineage, Baba [[Bhagwan Ramji]] (1937-1992), instituted reforms of the Aghor tradition, banning taboo substances such as alcohol, marijuana, and ashes. Baba Bhagwan Ramji "challenged his devotees to embrace polluted people instead of polluted substances."&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008). ''Aghor Medicine: Pollution, Death, and Healing in Northern India''. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-25218-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25218-9}}. p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Aghor instead became focused on social reform, maintaining a left-hand path of spirituality by helping people who have been shunned from mainstream society, such as lepers and orphans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

When Baba Bhagwan Ramji attained Aghor in this lineage, he was compared to Baba Kinaram because he had a strong sense of social responsibility, identifying himself with suffering humanity. Numerous accounts describe how he helped struggling people to battle social injustices.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aghor Lineage===
The direct lineage of the twelve Aghoreshwars that began with Bhagwan Dattatreya extends from the sixteenth century until the present day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonomaashram.org/teachings_lineage.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710062957/http://www.sonomaashram.org/teachings_lineage.php |archivedate=10 July 2010 }}, Sonomaashram.org (accessed: Thursday 16 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aghor today==
The Aghor tradition, which originated as confined and reclusive, has transformed since Baba Bhagwan Ramji’s reforms to Aghor Yoga practices. By changing practices that have traditionally been shunned by conventional norms, Aghor Yoga now has entered mainstream society. Today, Aghor Yoga focuses upon forming a balanced personal practice, placing importance on both sadhana (one’s own spiritual practice) as well as seva (selfless service).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Baba Bhagwan Ramji===
{{Main|Bhagwan Ramji}}
Recognizing the need for change within his society, Baba Bhagwan Ramji renewed the socially conscious spirit of Baba Kinaram when he established a new ashram named Awadhut Bhagwan Ram Kusht Sewa Ashram (The Awadhut Bhagwan Ram Leprosy Service Ashram) at Parao, Varanasi.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwan Ram (2007). ''The Book of Aghor Wisdom''. p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Baba Bhagwan Ramji dedicated Parao Ashram to helping the poor and the afflicted, and included a [[leprosy]] hospital within the ashram grounds. By shifting Aghor Yoga’s focus to helping those who are suffering within society, Baba Bhagwan Ramji modernized the ancient Aghor tradition.

In order to maintain the continuum of the Aghor tradition, Baba Bhagwan Ramji initiated one of his disciples, [[Baba Siddharth Gautam Ram]], to be the head of Krim Kund and of the Aghor lineage. The Krim Kund and Parao ashrams are situated on the opposite sides of the [[Ganges River]] in Varanasi, India.

Baba Bhagwan Ramji also established [http://aghoreshwar.org/ Sri Sarveshwari Samooh Ashram], a secular social service organization that has worked throughout northern India.&lt;ref&gt;Harihar Ram (1997). ''Oasis of Stillness'' p.64&lt;/ref&gt; The Aghor lineage now includes many Ashrams in various locations in India and a number of centers and Ashrams in other countries.

During his life, Aghoreshwar Bhagwan Ramji also guided the reform of ancient Kina Ram [[Aghori]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008). ''Aghor Medicine: Pollution, Death, and Healing in Northern India''. p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashrams===
All of the ashrams started by Baba Bhagwan Ramji and his disciples around the world are continually dedicated to service. Contemporary Aghor practices focus especially on providing help and services to those who are downtrodden.

'''Alberto de Angelis''' (born 1885) was an Italian writer mostly remembered for writing a biography of [[Domenico Mustafà]], entitled ''Domenico Mustafa – La Cappella Sistina e la Società Musicale Romana''.

The book was published in 1926, and is considered of significant importance for its valuable account of Mustafa's life, the musical society in Rome and the other [[castrato singer|castrati singers]] at the [[Capella Sistina]].

==History==
Astro Computing Services (ACS) in San Diego, founded by Neil Michelsen in 1973, published a computer-generated astrological [[ephemeris]] in 1976, ''The American Ephemeris''.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

When personal computers generally became available, astrologers and astrology hobbyists were able to purchase them and use astrological or astronomical calculation [[software]] or make such programs themselves. Astrologer and computer programmer [[Michael Erlewine]] was involved early in making astrological software for microcomputers available to the general public in the late 1970s. In 1978, Erlewine founded Matrix Software, and in 1980 he published a book with all the algorithms and data required for owners of microcomputers to make their own complete astrological programs.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R. |title=The astrology book: the encyclopedia of heavenly influences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmv4930JbY0C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=Astrology+Computer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Et0tTO7IIoKC8ga61J2dAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Astrology%20Computer&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-144-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At first, astrology software was opposed by American astrologers who did not approve of computers in their field. However, acceptance grew as it became clear how more efficient and profitable such software could be.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

A few hundred fixed-purpose astrology computers were made, one of which was used by [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy Reagan's]] astrologer beginning in about 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/does-your-beloved-tech-artifact-belong-in-a-museum Daniel Dern, "Does Your Beloved Tech Artifact Belong in a Museum? What museums do and don’t want" ''IEEE Spectrum'' July, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology software has been made available in the [[open-source model]], starting with the release of [[Astrolog]] in 1991. Another open astrology project is ''OpenAstro.org''&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/OpenAstro.org/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Features ==

Computer astrology programs today typically make accurate planet position calculations, display and print these positions using astrological [[glyph]] symbols in graphic [[horoscope|charts]], save and retrieve individuals' data to and from [[database]] files, compare the planet positions of different charts to find the astrological aspects between them (e.g. for compatibility), calculate the dates of important events in the future for a chart, and research the saved chart database. Some generate colorful geographical maps with lines showing where the planets rise and culminate at a significant time, usually the time of birth or the time of inception of an organization (called [[astrocartography]]). Astrology programs usually come bundled with an electronic atlas, allowing the review of the [[longitudes]], [[latitudes]], and [[time zone]] observance histories for cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foreman | first = Patricia L. |author2= Peter Ashe | title = ''Computers and Astrology: A Universal User's Guide and Reference'' | publisher = Good Earth Publications | date = 1992 | pages = 304 | isbn = 978-0-9624648-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Friedman | first = Hank | title = ''Astrology on Your Personal Computer'' | publisher = Sybex Inc. | date = 1984 | pages = 225 | isbn = 978-0-89588-226-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many assemble interpretive text about the various element combinations in a chart into comprehensive printed reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astrology-software-review.toptenreviews.com/ Nine of the ten software programs reviewed] by [[TopTenReviews.com]] in 2011 provide interpretive reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2809">An '''Atash Behram''' (Fire of Victory) is the highest grade of a fire that can be placed in a ([[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]) [[fire temple]]. The establishment and consecration of this fire is the most elaborate of all [[Fire temple#Classification|the grades of fire]]. It involves the gathering of 16 different types of fire, including lightning, fire from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. 32 priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete.

The '''Bahá'í Faith''' has a long history in Australia. The first known mention of events related to the history of the religion was several reports in Australian newspapers in 1846. After sporadic mentions a turning point was a mention of Australia by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, in 1916&lt;ref name="tab1"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 40/42 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which United Kingdom/American emigrants John and Clara Dunn came to Australia in 1920.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web

==Earliest history==
The first known mention of events related to the history of the religion was several reports in Australian newspapers in 1846:
* [[The Morning Chronicle (N.S.W.)|Morning Chronicle]](later renamed) out of Sydney; 4 April&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Mahometan Schism | newspaper =Morning Chronicle | pages =4, 5th column, top, as highlighted | date =4 April 1846 | url =http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31747707 | accessdate = May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were reprints of an 1845 article in the London ''Times'' which relied on Muslim reactions to the new religion.&lt;ref name="States1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States|title=World Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUYlAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=1977|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next known news story covering events in Bahá'í history was in [[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]], 4 November 1850 in Melbourne which briefly mentions it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =English News | newspaper =The Argus | pages = 2, 3rd column (scroll up and over from the opening of the page) | date = November 4, 1850 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4765857 | accessdate = Sep 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 there was an event with caused great suffering among the Babís (whom Bahá'ís regard as spiritual precursors of their religion.) The Babís were blamed for an attempted assassination of the Shah of Persia. Recent scholarship has identified a fringe element distinct from all the major aspects of the religion, its community and leadership at the time, as actually being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_attempted_assassination_shah The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and Violence], by Moojan Momen, 2004-03-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religio 12-1"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Momen | first = Moojan | title =Millennialism and Violence: The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah of Iran by the Babis in 1852 | journal =Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions | volume =12 | issue =1 | pages =57–82 | date =August 2008 | url = | jstor =10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57 | doi =10.1525/nr.2008.12.1.57 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = April 16, 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, coverage in newspapers at the time often echoed the Persian government's view blaming the Babís and Babís in large numbers were in fact executed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4789126 "English News; Punishments for assassination attempt"], ''The Argus'', p. 4 (last column on the far right, just down from the top), Jan 21 1853

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablet (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled in ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''.  The seventh and eighth of the tablets was the first to mention taking the Bahá'í Faith to Australia and was written on 11 and 19 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Tablet 7) "The moment this divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion..., if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of Australia, New Zealand, [[Tasmania]], also to Japan, Asiatic Russia, Korea, [[French Indochina]], [[Siam]], [[Straits Settlements]], India, [[Ceylon]] and [[Afghanistan]], most great results will be forthcoming."&lt;ref name="tab1"/&gt;

(Tablet 8) "The teachers traveling in different directions must know the language of the country in which they will enter.… In short, after this [[World War I|universal war]], the people have obtained extraordinary capacity to hearken to the divine teachings, for the wisdom of this war is this: That it may become proven to all that the fire of war is world-consuming, whereas the rays of peace are world-enlightening.… Consequently, a number of souls may arise and … and hasten to all parts of the world, especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-8.html.iso8859-1?#pg56 |page=56 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon Bahá'í groups sprang up around the country. By 1934 there were enough Bahá'ís to elect a national governing body, the first [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of Australia and New Zealand. The delegates were: Robert Brown, Silver Jackman, Hilda Brooks;  A.O. Whittaker, Hyde Dunn, Olive Routh; and from New Zealand Mrs. E. Axford, Ethel Blundell, and Margaret Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = First Annual Convention of Australia and New Zealand | newspaper = Bahá'í News |date=April 1935 | page = 15| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&amp;page=759 | issue = 91 | accessdate = Sep 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s there was opposition published to the religion.&lt;ref name=Smith2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Hassall | first = Graham | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Peter | title = Bahá'ís in the West | chapter = Outpost of a World Religion | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2004 | location = |page=219 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 978-1-890688-11-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first secretary of the national assembly, Hilda Brooks, wrote many responses to various public attacks. For 6 weeks in 1943 the editor of the ''Mittagong Star'' entertained an exchange of letters to the editor between her and a Catholic priest and scholar who had chosen to describe the religion as an outgrowth of Islam.

By 1963 the Yerrinbool Bahá'í School was wholly owned and managed by the National Spiritual Assembly. The second national youth conference was held at Yerrinbool in 1970 and succeeding youth conferences were held in [[Canberra]] (1972), Adelaide (1973), [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (1974), Canberra (1975), [[Brisbane]] (1976), Sydney (1977), Hobart (1978), and Melbourne (1979).

Bahá'ís in Brisbane were established as early as 1928 but it wasn't until 1949 that a local spiritual assembly was elected.&lt;ref name="queen"/&gt; A Baha’i Society was established on the campus of the [[University of Queensland]] in 1961. By 1978 there were Local Assemblies in [[Albert Shire]], Brisbane, [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Mornington Island]] and [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]], [[Pioneer Shire]], [[Redland Shire]], [[Toowoomba]] and [[Townsville]], as well as groups in [[Gympie]], [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave Shire]], [[Murweh Shire]], [[Noosa Shire]], [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] [[Wondai Shire]] and [[Caboolture, Queensland|Caboolture]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Welcome | work = Caboolture Bahá'í Community | publisher = Caboolture Bahá'í Community | year = 2003 | url = http://www.caboolture.qld.bahai.org.au/home.htm | accessdate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, local assemblies in Queensland numbered 25.

Refocussing attention on the Melbourne community active projects were initiated and the assembly was reformed in 1948. The members of that local spiritual assembly were Emily and Cyril Easey, Ron Cover and his mother Irene Cover, Freda Adams, Mrs E. Bennett, Madam Holden-Graham, Eleanor Wheeler, and Vi Hoehnke&lt;ref name="vict"/&gt; and by 1953 communities near Melbourne included [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] however reorganizing along civic boundaries in 1957 spit the Melbourne community into Melbourne, [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]], [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]], [[Caufield]], [[Oakleigh, Victoria|Oakleigh]], [[Mordialloc]] and [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]].&lt;ref name="vict"/&gt;

In an atmosphere of growing tension over war, in October 1940 Gretta Lamprill in Tasmania was visited by government officers seeking information about the group's activities&lt;ref name="tasm"/&gt; and from then on the Bahá'ís consciously sought out collaboration with like-minded social movements and involved academics and outstanding public figures of the day in their public meetings. In 1945 the only group of Bahá'ís in Tasmania were in Hobart - consisting of six people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News from Other Lands; Australia |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1945 | page = 12| url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1949 the Hobart community was able to elect its local spiritual assembly with founding members of Frank &amp; Myra Brown, Mabel Bailey, Kit Crowder, Eileen Costello, Katherine Harcus, Gretta Lamprill, Katie Pharaoh, and Ben Raynor. Shirin Fozdar visited Tasmania in September 1952 for several talks before going on to introduce the religion to [[Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam|Vietnam]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="tasm"/&gt; In 1958 the Hobart community hosted a Tasmanian Bahá'í conference with representatives from [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], [[City of Clarence|Clarence]], and [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] in June 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News - Teaching Conferences held in Tasmanian and Queensland |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1957 | page = 5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Canberra Bahá'í community was one of five communities asked by the Universal House of Justice to host a conference in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the death of [[Bahiyyih Khánum]].&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 619, 632, 802–4 and Table of Contents | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.org/books/bw18/800-825.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian immigrants===
In 1948, Iranian Bahá'ís seeking to emigrate to Australia were classified as "Asiatic" by Australia's [[White Australia]] policy, and were denied entry and the policy largely remained in place until the 1960s and was lifted in 1973.&lt;ref name="pers"/&gt; The size and diversity of the community was boosted in the 1980s when Australia opened its doors to those fleeing the resurgence of [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran]], characterized as a [[diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By 1986, 538 Persian Bahá'ís had entered Australia under the program, and by 1988, some 2,500 had arrived in Australia through either the Assistance or Refugee Programs. Together with Persians already living in Australia, Persian constituted 38% of the Australian Bahá'í community where majorities of Iranians formed in 59 of 169 Bahá'í communities that had local assemblies, and in 19 Bahá'í communities, more than 75% of the members were Persian.&lt;ref name="pers"/&gt;  See also [[Iranian Australian]]s.

==Multiplying interests==
The Bahá'ís of Australia have taken up efforts in a number of interests - internal and with respect to the civic discourse in Australia. In 1975 the Australian Bahá'í Publishing Trust was established and in 1984 the Australian branch of the Association of Bahá'í Studies was formed.&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt; Representing the religion to the broader public the Bahá'ís developed a voluntary program in Australian public/state schools for 30 minutes a week on religious classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Bahá'ís developed a ''Peace Pack'' that was approved by the State's Department of Education and Training starting in the 1980s. Some 6,000 primary school children, about 10% of Bahá'í families, among more than 300 state-run schools attended in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

For the [[International Year of Indigenous Peoples]] and the Australian Association for Baha'i Studies set their annual conference in 1993 (at [[Queensland University]]) on an Indigenous related theme on building a positive understanding of [[Native title]]. In 1993 the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] tribe co-sponsors an intercultural celebration, ''Heart of Australia Calling''.&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt; In 1997 the Association for Baha'i Studies produced a book ''Indigenous Peoples: In the Wake of Mabo'' as a followup (see [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]].) In closing the [[UN International Decade of Indigenous Peoples]] (1993–2004) it held another conference (at [[Macquarie University]]) but this time ensuring as great a level of participation by Indigenous participants and keynote speakers and as many female participants and keynote speakers as possible and other similar priorities in order that the views and needs of Indigenous Peoples could be seriously heard and discussed and of practical benefit.&lt;ref name="indig"/&gt;

In 2003 the Australian Bahá’í Community testified in support of [[Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill of 2003]] suggesting that reviews of its provisions should be considered in light of the [[Paris Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==National exposure==
From the 1980s onward various personalities associated with the Bahá'í Faith have been national figures in Australia. Combined with the swelling membership the religion has emerged from obscurity in Australia on national level. The first mark of this emergence is probably graduate of the [[University of Sydney]], [[Tom Price (musician)|Tom Price]]. He was musical director of the Sydney Bahá'í Temple Choir in Australia for 14 years and became well known in Australia when he produced and co-wrote the double-platinum ''[[Bad Habits (Billy Field album)|Bad Habits]]'' album by singer [[Billy Field (singer)|Billy Field]], which was the largest selling album in Australia in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiophile.com.au/music_aus-01.html Welcome to Audiophile] Billy Field - "Best Of: You Weren't In Love With Me" comments&lt;/ref&gt; Price went on eventually to be director of the 420-voice choir and 90-piece symphony orchestra for the second [[Bahá'í World Congress]] in New York in 1992 and many other notable events.In 1986 Jack Malardy and his wife, tribal leaders of the [[Karadjari]], joined the religion.&lt;ref name="basic"/&gt; In the mid and late 1990s [[Cathy Freeman]] added some awareness of the religion in Australia as an [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] [[Olympic medalist]] who grew up as a Bahá'í.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s1584631.htm ''Cos I'm Free (AKA Cathy Freeman)'' Transcript of Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001 the 2nd edition of [[A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services]] added the Bahá'í Faith in its coverage of religions in Australia.&lt;ref name="2nd edition"/&gt; A TV medical-drama called ''MDA - [[MDA (TV series)|Medical Defense Australia]]'', which went on the air on 23 July 2002 through 2005 with an ongoing Bahá'í character, Layla Young, played by a non-Bahá'í&lt;ref name="ausiepoet"&gt;{{cite web | title = First Bahá'í Character | author = Australian Bahá'í Community | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Australia | url = http://www.bahai.org.au/docs/abr%206-2.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-08-12 | date = 5 June 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060819102030/http://www.bahai.org.au/docs/abr%206-2.pdf| archivedate= 19 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; actress [[Petra Yared]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Layla Young - Receptionist/Student Liaison Officer, MDA | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/mda/episodes/archive.htm | year = 2005 | author = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | publisher=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medical Defense Australia: Episode Guide | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/mda/staff/layla.htm | year = 2005 | author = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | publisher=abc.net.au| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060921182010/http://www.abc.net.au/mda/staff/layla.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Luke McPharlin]] has been visible as a distinguished Australian footballer who mentioned his spiritual beliefs in his reasons for his sportsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/316 Top sportsmen find support in faith], 11 August 2004 (BWNS)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 news articles appeared covering an various people - a singer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Demographics==
The 1996 Australian Census lists Bahá'í membership at just under 9 thousand Bahá'ís and in 2001 edition noted the community had grown to over 11 thousand.&lt;ref name="2nd edition"/&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'') estimated some 17,700 Bahá'ís in 2005,&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt; and over 19,300 in 2010.&lt;ref name="WCE-2010"/&gt; However, census data from 2016 reported a much lower population of only 13,988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Baojuan''' (宝卷 ''bǎojuǎn''), literally '''precious scrolls''', are a genre of prosimetric texts (texts written in an alternation of prose and verse) of a [[religion|religious]] or [[mysticism|mystical]] nature, produced within the context of [[Chinese folk religion]] and individual [[Chinese folk religious sects]]. They are often written in vernacular Chinese and recount the [[mythology]] surrounding a deity or a hero, or constitute the [[theology|theological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] scriptures of organised folk sects.

==Background==
The modern study of “precious scrolls” (''baojuan'' 寶卷) can be said to begin with the publication by [[Zheng Zhenduo]] 鄭振鐸 of his “Foqu xulu” 佛曲敘錄, which is a catalogue of Buddhist songs. In 1927 in Zhongguo wenxue yanjiu 中國文學研究 [Studies on Chinese Literature].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilt L. Idema]], “English –Language Studies of Precious Scrolls: A Bibliographical Survey,” CHINOPERL Papers 31(2012): 163-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3773">The '''Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians''' (EATWOT) is a network of theologians coming primarily from Africa, Asia, and Latin America and interested in creating theology that is relevant for their contexts. The group tended to critique traditional [[Christian theology]] as being too European and underscored the need for theology that addressed the challenges of poverty and oppression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/6306796|title=Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EATWOT) records, 1975-2001|last=|first=|date=|website=clio.columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[O. K. Bimwenyi]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was one of the key figures of the formation of EATWOT. While Bimwenyi was studying in [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]], he visited the general meeting of the [[Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in India in December 1974 and discussed the need for a network of theologians to address the pressing concerns of poverty and oppression in the third world.&lt;ref name="Joseph2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzneCgAAQBAJ|title=Theologies of the Non-Person: The Formative Years of EATWOT|last=Joseph|first=M. P.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-55054-5|location=New York|pages=1–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the first official meeting of EATWOT would be held in [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] with [[Joshua Russell Chandran]] as its first president until 1981. From this early start, the organization would produce a bi-annually published theological [[Academic journal|journal]] entitled ''Voices from the Third World''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatwot.net/VOICES/|title=EATWOT's Theological Journal VOICES|last=|first=|date=|website=eatwot.net|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, the organization would not allow women to be members. It would only be at the New Delhi meeting in 1981 that women were beginning to be allowed to have a voice in EATWOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theologies of the Non-Person|last=Joseph|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=212|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female figures such as [[Virginia Fabella]] and [[Mercy Oduyoye|Mercy Amba Oduyoye]], the latter who eventually became EATWOT's first female president (1997–2001), would continually challenge the absence of female leadership in the global church and in EATWOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talbot.edu/ce20/educators/protestant/mercy_oduyoye/|title=Mercy Amba Oduyoye|last=Smith|first=Yolanda|date=|website=www.talbot.edu|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts would result in the formation of the Women's Commission of EATWOT.&lt;ref name="FabellaOduyoye2006"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IZLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9|title=With Passion and Compassion: Third World Women Doing Theology: Reflections from the Women's Commission of the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians|last2=Oduyoye|first2=Mercy|date=4 January 2006|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-59752-500-8|location=Eugene, OR|pages=ix–x|last1=Fabella|first1=Virginia|authorlink1=Virginia Fabella|authorlink2=Mercy Oduyoye}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fish''' are [[gill]]-bearing [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[craniate]] animals that lack [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] with [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]]. They form a sister group to the [[tunicate]]s, together forming the [[Chordate|olfactores]]. Included in this definition are the living [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, and [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]] as well as various extinct related groups. [[Tetrapod]]s emerged within [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fishes]], so [[Cladistics|cladistically]] they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered [[paraphyletic]] by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in [[systematics|systematic biology]], unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.weber.edu/choagstrom/Zoology1120CH10.pdf|title=Zoology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Harry W.|date=1998-01-01|title=We are primates and we are fish: Teaching monophyletic organismal biology|journal=Integrative Biology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=1|issue=3|pages=108–111|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6602(1998)1:3&lt;108::aid-inbi5&gt;3.0.co;2-t|issn=1520-6602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional term '''pisces''' (also '''ichthyes''') is considered a [[wikt:typology|typological]], but not a [[phylogenetic]] classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied [[chordate]]s that first appeared during the [[Cambrian]] period. Although they lacked a [[vertebrate|true spine]], they possessed [[notochord]]s which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the [[Paleozoic]] era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed [[placodermi|external armor]] that protected them from predators. The first fish with [[jaw]]s appeared in the [[Silurian]] period, after which many (such as [[shark]]s) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of [[arthropod]]s.

Most fish are [[ectotherm]]ic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [[white shark]] and [[tuna]] can hold a higher [[core temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=K.J. |title=Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1997 |volume=167 |series=B Biochemical Systemic and Environmental Physiology |issue=6 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1007/s003600050092 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406114844/http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |archivedate=6 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carey |first=F.G. |author2=Lawson, K.D. |title=Temperature regulation in free-swimming bluefin tuna |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |date=February 1973 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=375–392 |doi=10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinmann|first1=S.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] and even [[hadal zone|hadal]] depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[FishBase]] |url=http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |title=FishBase |date=August 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823230232/http://www.fishbase.org/search.php |archivedate=23 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3970477 | pmid=24591588 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1322003111 | volume=111 | issue=12 | title=Marine fish may be biochemically constrained from inhabiting the deepest ocean depths | year=2014 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=4461–5 | last1 = Yancey | first1 = PH | last2 = Gerringer | first2 = ME | last3 = Drazen | first3 = JC | last4 = Rowden | first4 = AA | last5 = Jamieson | first5 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially [[fish (food)|as food]]. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in [[wild fisheries]] (see fishing) or [[Fish farm|farm]] them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see [[aquaculture]]). They are also caught by [[Recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], kept as pets, raised by [[Fishkeeping|fishkeepers]], and exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as [[deity|deities]], religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of fish}}
[[File:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' was a gigantic, {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} long [[prehistoric fish]] of class Placodermi.|alt=Drawing of animal with large mouth, long tail, very small dorsal fins, and pectoral fins that attach towards the bottom of the body, resembling lizard legs in scale and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |title=Monster fish crushed opposition with strongest bite ever |publisher=[[Smh.com.au]] |date=30 November 2006 |accessdate=26 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402143409/http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fish do not represent a [[monophyletic]] group, and therefore the "evolution of fish" is not studied as a single event.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lecointre &amp; H. Le Guyader, 2007, ''The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification'', Harvard University Press Reference Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a [[Fish jaw|jawed mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.

Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.

===Taxonomy===
Fish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the "Class Pisces" seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.
[[File:Leedsi&amp;Liopl DB.jpg|thumb|[[Leedsichthys]] (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish, with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at {{convert|16|m}}.]]

Traditional classification divides fish into three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[class (biology)|classes]], and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:&lt;ref name="Romer, A 1977"&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M. J. (1998) The quality of the fossil record of vertebrates. Pp. 269–303, in Donovan, S. K. and Paul, C. R. C. (eds), The adequacy of the fossil record, Fig. 2. Wiley, New York, 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish)
** Subclass [[Cyclostomata]] ([[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s)
** Subclass [[Ostracodermi]] (armoured jawless fish) †
* Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]])
** Subclass [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s and extinct relatives)
* Class [[Placodermi]] (armoured fish) †
* Class [[Acanthodii]] ("spiny sharks", sometimes classified under bony fishes)†
* Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
** Subclass [[Actinopterygii]] (ray finned fishes)
** Subclass [[Sarcopterygii]] (fleshy finned fishes, ancestors of tetrapods)

The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have given rise to successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes. With the arrival of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme, with the following major groups:
* Class Myxini ([[hagfish]])
* Class [[Pteraspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
* Class [[Thelodonti]] †
* Class [[Anaspida]] †
* Class [[Hyperoartia|Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia]]
** Petromyzontidae ([[lamprey]]s)
* Class [[Conodont]]a (conodonts) †
* Class [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
** (unranked) [[Galeaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Pituriaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Osteostraci]] †
* Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]] (jawed vertebrates)
** Class [[Placodermi]] † (armoured fish)
** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Class [[Acanthodii]] † (spiny sharks)
** Superclass [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
*** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Chondrostei]]

***** Order [[Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s).
**** Subclass [[Neopterygii]]
***** Infraclass [[Holostei]] ([[gar]]s and [[bowfin]]s)
***** Infraclass [[Teleostei]] (many orders of common fish)

† – indicates extinct taxon&lt;br /&gt;Some palaeontologists contend that because [[Conodonta]] are [[chordate]]s, they are primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the [[vertebrate]] article.

The position of [[hagfish]] in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the [[Cyclostomata]], that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.&lt;ref&gt;Shigehiro Kuraku, Daisuke Hoshiyama, Kazutaka Katoh, Hiroshi Suga, Takashi Miyata (1999) ''Monophyly of Lampreys and Hagfishes Supported by Nuclear DNA–Coded Genes'' J Mol Evol (1999) 49:729–735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mallatt, J. Sullivan (1998) ''28S and 18S rDNA sequences support the monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes'' Molecular Biology and Evolution V 15, Issue 12, pp 1706–1718&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. There are almost 28,000 known [[extant taxon|extant]] species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 [[Chondrichthyes|sharks, rays, and chimeras]] and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are [[Cyprinidae]], [[Gobiidae]], [[Cichlidae]], [[Characidae]], [[Loricariidae]], [[Balitoridae]], [[Serranidae]], [[Labridae]], and [[Scorpaenidae]]. About 64 families are [[monotypic]], containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fish" most precisely describes any non-[[tetrapod]] [[craniate]] (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has [[gill]]s throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike groupings such as birds or [[mammal]]s, fish are not a single [[clade]] but a [[paraphyletic]] collection of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[hagfish]]es, [[lamprey]]s, [[Chondrichthyes|sharks and rays]], [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[coelacanth]]s, and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name="publishing3"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treeoflife&gt;Tree of life web project – [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172716/http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 |date=24 February 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of [[tetrapod]]s (such as [[mammal]]s, birds, [[Lissamphibia|amphibians]], etc.) than of other fish such as [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] or sharks, so the [[last common ancestor]] of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern [[systematics|systematic biology]], the use of the term "fish" as a biological group must be avoided.

Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in the sense given above; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seals]], whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman, Jr. |author2=Larry S. Roberts |author3=Allan L. Larson |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Co |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-07-290961-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the definition above, all mammals, including [[cetacean]]s like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in [[aquaculture]], the true fish are referred to as '''finfish''' (or '''fin fish''') to distinguish them from these other animals.

[[File:leafydragon.jpg|thumb|A relative of the seahorses, the [[leafy seadragon]]'s appendages allow it to camouflage (in the form of [[crypsis]]) with the surrounding [[seaweed]].|alt=Photo of fish with many narrow, straight appendages. Some are end in points, and others are longer, ending in two or three approximately flat, triangular flaps, each with a dark spot.]]

A typical fish is [[ectothermic]], has a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlined]] body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]], and lays eggs.

Each criterion has exceptions. [[Tuna]], [[swordfish]], and some species of [[shark]]s show [[Warm-blooded#Temperature control in cold-blooded animals|some warm-blooded adaptations]]—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature.&lt;ref name="publishing3"/&gt; Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]], and [[Carangidae|jacks]] that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as [[eel]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. [[Lungfish]] have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, [[gourami]]s have a structure called the [[labyrinth organ]] that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as [[seahorse]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[anglerfish]], and [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulpers]]. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in [[moray eel]]s), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as [[Placoid scale|placoid]] (typical of sharks and rays), [[Scale (zoology)#Cosmoid scales|cosmoid]] (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), [[ganoid]] (various fossil fish but also living [[gar]]s and [[bichir]]s), [[Fish scale#Leptoid scales|cycloid]], and [[ctenoid]] (these last two are found on most [[bony fish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin, K.L.M. |title=Beach-Spawning Fishes: Reproduction in an Endangered Ecosystem |year=2014 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1482207972}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mudskipper]]s feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Periophthalmus|species=barbarus|year=2006|month=November|id=12803}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single, [[undescribed species]] of ''[[Phreatobius]]'', has been called a true "land fish" as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/species.php?species_id=646 |title=Cat-eLog: Heptapteridae: ''Phreatobius'': ''Phreatobius'' sp.

Fish range in size from the huge {{convert|16|m|adj=on}} [[whale shark]] to the tiny {{convert|8|mm|1|adj=on}} [[stout infantfish]].

Fish [[species]] diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and [[freshwater]] ecosystems. [[Coral reef]]s in the [[Indo-Pacific]] constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large [[river basin]]s of [[tropical rainforest]]s, especially the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Congo Basin|Congo]], and [[Mekong]] basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit [[Neotropic]]al freshwaters alone, such that [[Neotropical fish]]es represent about 10% of all [[vertebrate]] species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as [[Cantão State Park]], can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 Estudo das Espécies Ícticas do Parque Estadual do Cantão] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706160450/http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 |date=6 July 2011 }}, fish species survey of Cantão (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiration===
{{See also|Aquatic respiration}}

====Gills====
Most fish exchange gases using [[gill]]s on either side of the [[pharynx]]. Gills consist of threadlike structures called [[Protein filament|filaments]]. Each filament contains a [[capillary]] network that provides a large [[surface area]] for exchanging [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, [[bony fish]] have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]].

Juvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval [[amphibian]]s.

====Air breathing====
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|[[Tuna]] gills inside the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the view looking towards the mouth.|alt=Photo of fish head split in half longitudinally with gill filaments crossing from top to bottom]]
Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods. [[Amphibious fish]] such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days,{{doubtful|date=December 2014}} or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of [[anguillidae|anguillid eels]] may absorb oxygen directly. The [[buccal cavity]] of the [[electric eel]] may breathe air. Catfish of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] absorb air through their digestive tracts.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes |journal=[[Copeia]] |year=1998 |issue=3 |pages=663–675 |doi=10.2307/1447796 |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2009 |volume=1998 |last1=Armbruster |first1=Jonathan W. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326130527/http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy-all |jstor=1447796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lungfish]], with the exception of the [[Australian lungfish]], and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.

Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.

Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.&lt;ref name="Armbruster1998"/&gt;

===Circulation===
[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart]]
Fish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.&lt;ref name="Setaro"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Setaro |first=John F. |year=1999 |title=Circulatory System |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.

===Digestion===
Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.

===Excretion===
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.

Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.

===Scales===
{{Main|Fish scale}}
The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.

===Sensory and nervous system===
[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]

====Central nervous system====
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; Together these structures form the forebrain.

Connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The [[midbrain]] (or mesencephalon) contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The hindbrain (or [[metencephalon]]) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain" /&gt; Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

The brain stem (or [[myelencephalon]]) is the brain's posterior.&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt; As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref name="Helfman_brain"/&gt;

====Sense organs====
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.&lt;ref name="Encarta 99"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orr |first=James |year=1999 |title=Fish |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99 |isbn=978-0-8114-2346-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431–472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish, like the South American electric fishes [[Gymnotiformes]], can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.

Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sciences |first=Journal of Undergraduate Life |url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |title=Appropriate maze methodology to study learning in fish |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hn2YJET6?url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vision=====
{{main|Vision in fishes}}
[[Visual system|Vision]] is an important [[sensory system]] for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s like [[bird vision|birds]] and mammals, but have a more [[spherical]] [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. Their [[retina]]s generally have both [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] (for [[scotopic vision|scotopic]] and [[photopic vision]]), and most species have [[colour vision]]. Some fish can see [[ultraviolet]] and some can see [[polarized light]]. Amongst [[jawless fish]], the [[lamprey]] has well-developed eyes, while the [[hagfish]] has only primitive [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil A. Campbell |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |authorlink2=Jane Reece |year=2005 |title=''Biology'' |edition=Seventh |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish vision shows [[adaptation]] to their visual environment, for example [[deep sea fish]]es have eyes suited to the dark environment.

=====Hearing=====
{{see also|Sensory systems in fish#Hearing}}
[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their [[lateral line]]s and their [[otolith|ears]].

====Capacity for pain====
{{Further|Pain in fish}}
Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have [[pain]] and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, [[Batrachoididae|toadfish]] grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Dunayer, Joan, "Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp," The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Scottish scientists at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with [[pain]] in other animals. [[Bee]] [[venom]] and [[acetic acid]] injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |title=Fish do feel pain, scientists say |work=BBC News |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=4 January 2010 |first=Alex |last=Kirby |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121355/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grandin183"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Professor James D. Rose of the [[University of Wyoming]]  claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess "conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/RoseC.pdf |title=Rose, J.D. 2003.

Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=James D. |url=http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |title=Do Fish Feel Pain? |year=2002 |accessdate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120104558/http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/ |archivedate=20 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal behaviorist [[Temple Grandin]] argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because "different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions."&lt;ref name="grandin183"/&gt;

Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible [[suffering]] of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British [[RSPCA]] now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1037515,00.html |title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscular system===
{{Main|Fish locomotion}}
[[File:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|Swim bladder of a rudd (''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]'')|alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connected by a much thinner element]]

Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.

====Endothermy====
Although most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions. The only known bony fishes (infraclass [[Teleostei]]) that exhibit [[Warm-blooded|endothermy]] are in the suborder [[Scombroidei]] – which includes the [[billfish]]es, tunas, and the [[butterfly kingfish]], a [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] species of mackerel&lt;ref name="Block1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Block |first1=BA |last2=Finnerty |first2=JR |year=1993 |title=Endothermy in fishes: a phylogenetic analysis of constraints, predispositions, and selection pressures |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226138605 |format=PDF |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=283–302 |doi=10.1007/BF00002518}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and also the [[Lampris guttatus|opah]]. The opah, a [[lampriform]], was demonstrated in 2015 to utilize "whole-body endothermy", generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while countercurrent exchange (as in respiration) minimizes heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wegner |first=Nicholas C. |last2=Snodgrass |first2=Owyn E. |last3=Dewar |first3=Heidi |last4=Hyde |first4=John R. |date=2015-05-15 |title=Whole-body endothermy in a mesopelagic fish, the opah, Lampris guttatus |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6236/786 |journal=Science |volume=348 |issue=6236 |pages=786–789 |doi=10.1126/science.aaa8902 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=25977549}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to actively hunt prey such as squid and swim for long distances due to the ability to warm its entire body, including its heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |title=Warm Blood Makes Opah an Agile Predator |date=2015-05-12 |website=Southwest Fisheries Science Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120000911/https://swfsc.noaa.gov/news.aspx?ParentMenuId=39&amp;id=20466 |archive-date=2018-01-20 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a trait typically found in only mammals and birds (in the form of [[homeothermy]]).&lt;!-- Mentioned in Wegner 2015 --&gt; In the cartilaginous fishes (class [[Chondrichthyes]]), sharks of the families [[Lamnidae]] (porbeagle, mackerel, salmon, and great white sharks) and [[Alopiidae]] (thresher sharks) exhibit endothermy. The degree of endothermy varies from the billfishes, which warm only their eyes and brain, to the [[bluefin tuna]] and the [[porbeagle shark]], which maintain body temperatures in excess of {{convert|20|C}} above ambient water temperatures.&lt;ref name="Block1993" /&gt;

Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central [[nervous system]] processing, and higher rates of [[digestion]].

{{Anchor|Reproductive method}}

===Reproductive system===
{{Further|Fish reproduction|Spawn (biology)}}

[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|[[Organ (anatomy)|Organs]]: 1. [[Liver]], 2. [[Gas bladder]], 3. [[Roe]], 4. Pyloric caeca, 5. [[Stomach]], 6. [[Intestine]]]]
Fish reproductive organs include [[testicle]]s and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in [[wiktionary:atherinomorph|atherinomorph]] fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J. |author2=Santos, José E. dos |author3=Santos, Gilmar B. |title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes) |journal=Rev.

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil |last=Brito |first=M.F.G. |author2=Bazzoli, N. |journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=2003 |doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018 |issn=0102-0935 |pages=624–633 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135717/http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]]. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"/&gt; Secondary gymnovaries are found in [[salmonid]]s and a few other teleosts.

[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Some fish, like the [[California sheephead]], are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]],&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]], and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[clasper]]s.

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fishegg A.Slotwinski TAFI.jpg|thumb|An example of [[zooplankton]]|alt=Photo of semi-transparent creature with a darker, yolk-like central structure and other approximately round internal elements]] --&gt;
The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[Ichthyoplankton|larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

Some species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner"&gt;Meisner, A &amp; Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)" ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295–317, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner" /&gt;

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearer]]s.

== Acoustic communication in fish ==
Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bioacoustics"/&gt;
The sounds emitted can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. Fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

===Stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum.jpg|thumb|French grunts - Haemulon flavolineatum]]
There are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together. These noises produced by bone-on-bone interactions are known as 'stridulatory sounds'.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

An example of this is seen in ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum]]'', a species commonly referred to as the 'French grunt fish', as it produces a grunting noise by grinding its teeth together.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;
This behaviour is most pronounced when the ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' is in distress situations.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The grunts produced by this species of fishes generate a frequency of approximately 700&amp;nbsp;Hz, and last approximately 47 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt; The ''[[Haemulon flavolineatum|H. flavolineatum]]'' does not emit sounds with frequencies greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and does not detect sounds that have frequencies greater than 1050&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

In a study conducted by Oliveira et al. (2014), the longsnout seahorse, ''[[Hippocampus reidi]]'', was recorded producing two different categories of sounds; ‘clicks’ and ‘growls’. The sounds emitted by the ''[[Hippocampus reidi|H. reidi]]'' are accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colson|first1=D.

‘Clicking’ sounds were found to be primarily produced during courtship and feeding, and the frequencies of clicks were within the range of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz-800&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Zoology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliveira|first1=T.

===Non-stridulatory sound producing mechanisms===
[[File:C(flipped).jpg|thumb|{{center|Oyster toadfish}}]]
Some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract and cause swimbladder vibrations.

[[Oyster toadfish]] produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles&lt;ref name="Experimental"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=L.

==Diseases==
{{Main|Fish diseases and parasites}}
Like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

Some species use [[cleaner fish]] to remove external parasites. The best known of these are the [[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''Labroides'' found on [[coral reef]]s in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. These small fish maintain so-called "cleaning stations" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, ''[[Orange chromide|Etroplus maculatus]]'', the cleaner, and the much larger ''Etroplus suratensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyman |first1=Richard L. |last2=Ward |first2=Jack A. |year=1972 |title=A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis.

===Immune system===
Immune organs vary by type of fish.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. ''Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish.'' In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfish), true [[lymph]]oid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.
[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.
[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.

Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chilmonczyk |first=S. |title=''The thymus in fish: development and possible function in the immune response'' |journal=[[Annual Review of Fish Diseases]] |volume=2 |year=1992 |pages=181–200 |doi=10.1016/0959-8030(92)90063-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=J.D. |last2=Zapata |first2=A.G. |year=1998 |title=''Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians'' |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=166 |pages=199–220 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065x.1998.tb01264.x|pmid=9914914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the [[zebrafish]]. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) [[T cell]]s accumulate while waiting to encounter an [[antigen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kucher |title=''Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VegFc signalling'' |publisher=[[Current Biology]] |volume=16 |year=2006 |pages=1244–1248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B and T lymphocytes bearing [[immunoglobulin]]s and [[T cell receptor]]s, respectively, are found in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the [[adaptive immune system]] as a whole [[adaptive immune system#Evolution|evolved]] in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flajnik | first1 = M.

==Conservation==

However, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. For example, the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]] occupies only a single {{convert|3|by|6|m|0}} pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overfishing===
[[File:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|thumb|[[Whale shark]]s, the largest species of fish, are classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].|alt=Photo of shark in profile surrounded by other, much smaller fish in bright sunlight]]
{{Main|Overfishing}}

Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |title=Call to halt cod 'over-fishing' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=5 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117142906/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm |archivedate=17 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |title=Tuna groups tackle overfishing |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=26 January 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121111204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm |archivedate=21 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing eventually causes [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population]] (known as [[Fish stock|stock]]) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such '''commercial extinction''' does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.

One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the [[Pacific sardine]] ''Sadinops sagax caerulues'' fishery off the California coast. From a 1937 peak of {{convert|790000|LT}} the catch steadily declined to only {{convert|24000|LT}} in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tension between [[fisheries science]] and the [[fishing industry]] is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the [[commercial fishing|fishing industry]] is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |title=UK 'must shield fishing industry' |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130055349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm |archivedate=30 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |title=EU fish quota deal hammered out |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News |date=21 December 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061226234953/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm |archivedate=26 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |title=Ocean study predicts the collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050 |accessdate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315014325/http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html |archivedate=15 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |title=Atlantic bluefin tuna could soon be commercially extinct |accessdate=18 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430205610/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm |archivedate=30 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitat destruction===
{{See also|Environmental impact of fishing}}

A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including [[water pollution]], the building of dams, removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the [[pallid sturgeon]], a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126220804/http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |archivedate=26 November 2005 |url=http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html |title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon ''Scaphirhynchus'' Fact Sheet |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic species===
Introduction of [[invasive species|non-native]] species has occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of [[Nile perch]] into [[Lake Victoria]] in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 [[Endemism|endemic]] [[cichlid]] species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,,1541613,00.html |title=The little fish fight back |accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Laura |last=Spinney |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carp]], [[Channidae|snakeheads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |title=Stop That Fish! |accessdate=26 August 2007 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=3 July 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103055232/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tilapia]], [[perch|European perch]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[sea lamprey]]s are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.

==Importance to humans==

===Economic importance===
{{Main|Fishing industry|Aquaculture|Fish farming}}
[[File:Community fish-farming ponds in the rural town of Masi Manimba, DRC (7609946524).jpg|alt=A row of square artificial ponds, with trees on either side|thumb|These fish-farming ponds were created as a [[cooperative]] project in a rural village.]]

Throughout history, humans have utilized [[Fish as food|fish as a food source]]. Historically and today, most fish [[protein]] has come by means of catching wild fish. However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spalding |first1=Mark |title=Sustainable Ancient Aquaculture |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |date=11 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518210243/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.&lt;ref name="Helfman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helfman |first1=Gene S. |title=Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources |date=2007 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1597267601 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proportion is considerably elevated in some [[developing nation]]s and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.

Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as [[fishing]], while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a [[fishery]]. Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people.&lt;ref name="Helfman" /&gt; The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |website=fao.org |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828131307/http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with popular species including [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], and [[salmon]]. However, the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just fish, such as [[Mollusca|mollusks]] and [[crustacean]]s, which are often called "fish" when used as food.

===Recreation===
{{Main|Fishkeeping|Recreational fishing|Angling}}
Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in [[cave art]], being raised as [[ornamental fish]] in ponds, and displayed in [[aquarium]]s in homes, offices, or public settings.

''Recreational fishing'' is fishing for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is fishing for profit. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[fish hook|hook]]s and any one of a wide range of [[bait (luring substance)|baits]]. Angling is a method of fishing, specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an "angle" (hook). Anglers must select the right hook, [[cast net|cast]] accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the day, and other factors.

=== Culture ===

Fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and books such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of [[Horror film|horror movies]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], most notably the novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'', which spawned a series of films of the [[Jaws (film)|same name]] that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Snakehead Terror]]''. Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''; however, contrary to popular belief, the [[red-bellied piranha]] is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zollinger |first1=Sue Anne |title=Piranha–Ferocious Fighter or Scavenging Softie? |url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |website=A Moment of Science |publisher=Indiana Public Media |accessdate=1 November 2015 |date=3 July 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017010303/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/ |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends of half-human, half-fish [[mermaid]]s have featured in folklore, including the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

==Terminology==
===Fish or fishes===
Though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different meanings. ''Fish'' is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. ''Fishes'' is used to describe different species or species groups.&lt;ref name="Pauly2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pauly |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Pauly |title=Fish(es) |encyclopedia=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |date=13 May 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-45181-9 |page=77 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208060837/https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=8 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph S. Nelson|Nelson, Joseph S]] and Paetz, Martin Joseph (1992) [http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf ''The Fishes of Alberta''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085249/http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf |date=7 April 2014 }} page 400, University of Alberta. {{ISBN|9780888642363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="publishing5"&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.

===True fish and finfish=== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[True fish]], [[Fin-fish]] and [[Finfish]] redirect here --&gt;
* In biology, the term ''fish'' is most strictly used to describe any animal with a [[Vertebral column|backbone]] that has [[gill]]s throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of [[fin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fishes of the World |last=Nelson |first=Joseph S. |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-25031-9 |pages=2|title-link=Fishes of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s with common names ending in "fish" are not fish in this [[Fish#Definition|sense]]; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction—sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seal]]s, whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name="integrated" /&gt;
* In fisheries, the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.&lt;ref name="fao glossary"&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp ''Fisheries glossary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129213844/http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp |date=29 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a ''true fish''. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.

===Shoal or school===
{{Main|Shoaling and schooling}}
[[File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpg|thumb|These [[goldband fusilier]]s are [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] because their swimming is synchronised.|alt=Photo of thousands of fish separated from each other by distances of {{convert|2|in}} or less]]

A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an ''aggregation''. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helfman |first=G. |last2=Collette |first2=B. |last3=Facey |first3=D. |year=1997 |title=The Diversity of Fishes |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=375 |isbn=978-0-86542-256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an ''aggregation''.
* Many minnows and characins form ''shoals''.
* Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of ''schooling'' fish.

While the words "school" and "shoal" have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as [[synonym]]s. Thus speakers of [[British English]] commonly use "shoal" to describe any grouping of fish, and speakers of [[American English]] commonly use "school" just as loosely.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher T. J. and Parish J. K. (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363 "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001403/https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363 |date=5 April 2017 }} In: Pitcher T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11976">'''Georges Vasilievich Florovsky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Гео́ргий Васи́льевич Флоро́вский; September 9 [O.S. August 28], 1893 – August 11, 1979) was an [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] [[priest]], [[theologian]], historian and [[ecumenist]]. Born in [[Odessa]], in the [[Russian Empire]], he spent his working life in Paris (1920–1949) and New York (1949–1979). With [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[Justin Popović]] and [[Dumitru Stăniloae]] he was one of the more influential Orthodox Christian theologians of the mid-20th century. He was particularly concerned that modern Christian theology might receive inspiration from the lively intellectual debates of the patristic traditions of the undivided Church rather than from later Scholastic or Reformation categories of thought.

== Life ==
Georgiy Vasilievich Florovsky was born in Russian Empire on 9 September 1893 at [[Odessa]] (then in the [[Kherson Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]), as the fourth child of an Orthodox Christian [[priest]]. Raised in an erudite environment, he learned [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] while a schoolboy, and at eighteen he started to study [[philosophy]] and [[history]]. He graduated from the University of Odessa in 1916.

After his first graduation he taught for three years at high schools in [[Odessa]], and then made his full graduation including the [[licentia docendi]] at all universities in the Russian empire.

In 1919 Florovsky began to teach at the [[University of Odessa]]; but in 1920 his family was forced to leave Russia. Florovsky realized at that time that there would be no return for him, because [[Marxism]] did not accept the history and philosophy he taught. He was part of the [[emigration]] of Russian [[intelligentsia]], which also included [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Nicholas Lossky]] and his son [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[Alexander Schmemann]], and [[John Meyendorff]] (the last two of whom would follow him in the USA as Dean of [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]], New York).

In the 1920s Florovsky had a personal and vocational friendship with the existentialist philosopher [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], but the two became  distanced later, through Berdyaev's not understanding Florovsky's ordination to the presbyterate (1932), and because of the critical attitude to Berdyaev's [[philosophy of religion]] expressed in Florovsky's ''Ways of Russian Theology'' (1937).

In 1924 Florovsky received his M.A. in Prague. In 1925 he became professor of [[patristics]] at the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute|St. Serge Institute of Orthodox Theology]] in [[Paris]]. In this subject he found his vocation. The lively debates of the thinkers of the early Church became for him a benchmark for Christian  [[theology]] and [[exegesis]], as well as a base for his critique of the ecumenical movement, and despite his not having earned an academic degree in theology (he was later awarded several honorary degrees) he would spend the rest of his life teaching at theological institutions. In 1932 Florovsky was [[ordination|ordained]] [[priest]] of the [[Orthodox Church]]. During the 1930s he undertook extensive research in European libraries and published in Russian valuable patristic studies, such as his book on 'Eastern fathers of the fourth century' (1931) and 'The Byzantine fathers fifth to eighth centuries' (1933). These were followed by his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Ways of Russian Theology'' (1937). In this work he questioned the Western-European Christian influences of [[scholasticism]], [[pietism]], and [[idealism]] on Orthodox, and especially Russian, Christian theology, and called for its reformulation in the light of patristic writings. The work was received with enthusiasm or condemnation—there was no neutral attitude to it among Russian émigrés. One of his most prominent critics was [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. Florovsky remained professor of patristics at the Institute until 1939, and from 1939 to 1948 taught there as professor of dogmatics.

In 1949 Florovsky moved to the United States of America, to take a position as Dean of [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]]. There his development of the curriculum led to the Board of Regents of the [[University of the State of New York]] granting the Seminary an Absolute [[Charter]] in 1953.

In 1955 Florovsky was asked by his synod overseers to "lay down the deanship."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blane, ed., ''George Florovsky—Russian Intellectual and Orthodox Churchman'' (1993. St Vladimir’s Seminary Press, Crestwood NY), pp.&amp;nbsp;109ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a professor of divinity at Harvard University, and ended his academic years as a professor at Princeton University.

'''HaMashkif''' ({{Lang-he|המשקיף}}, lit. ''The Observer'') was a [[Hebrew language]] daily newspaper in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Published between 1938 and 1948, it was owned by [[Hatzohar]], the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist]] party.

The newspaper was established in 1938 in Tel Aviv, succeeding the Revisionist journals ''[[Hazit HaAm]]'' and ''[[HaYarden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/press.html The Israeli Press] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 until the paper's closure in 1948, it was edited by Izik Ramba. It closed in 1948 following [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli independence]] and the dissolution of Hatzohar, and was replaced by ''[[Herut (newspaper)|Herut]]'', the journal of the new Revisionist [[Herut]] party.

Contributors included [[Avraham Shekhterman]], who edited its political section and later served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Gahal]] and [[Likud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=651 Abraham Shechterman] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism''' is practised in various provinces of [[South Africa]], but primarily in [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. Approximately 1.1 of the [[South Africa]]n population professed to be [[Hinduism|Hindu]], according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/south-africa#/?affiliations_religion_id=11&amp;affiliations_year=2010&amp;region_name=All%20Countries&amp;restrictions_year=2015&lt;/ref&gt; This is the largest concentration of Hindus in absolute terms in Africa after [[Mauritius]].

The majority of Hindus in South Africa are [[Indian South Africans|descendants of indentured laborers]] brought in by the British colonial government, from 1860 to 1919, to work in plantations and the mining operations owned by European settlers.&lt;ref name=bna/&gt; Many came from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and some from other states of India. Because of their Indian descent, Hindu settlers in South Africa suffered discrimination, abuse and persecution&lt;ref name=rhutt/&gt;&lt;ref name=mvm/&gt;&lt;ref name=mckt/&gt; during the colonial and [[Apartheid]] eras.

The first Hindu temples were in operation in the 1870s. Some South African local governments banned temple building and property ownership by Hindus in 1910s.&lt;ref name=bhanabrain/&gt; Modern South Africa has many Hindu temples, and its Hindu community observes major festivals of Hinduism such as [[Diwali|Deepavali]].&lt;ref name=ppk/&gt;

==History==
There is an ongoing controversy about the first arrival of Hindus in modern South Africa. One school of scholars state that Indians first arrived in modern South Africa during colonial era as indentured servants for the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Facts on File, {{ISBN|978-0816073368}}, pp 11&lt;/ref&gt; The second school states Indians arrived between 500-900 AD about the same time as Islamic traders arrived.&lt;ref name=ac2011&gt;Alexis Catsambis et al. (2011), The Oxford Handbook of Maritime Archaeology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195375176}}, Chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt; The third school states that Hindus very likely arrived by 1st millennium BC, or possible before.&lt;ref name=ac2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril A. Hromnik, Dravidian Gold Mining and Trade in Ancient Komatiland, Journal of Asian and African Studies, Volume 26, Issue 3-4, pp. 283–290&lt;/ref&gt; The third school's uses indirect linguistic, literary and gold mining process technology evidence to support its theory,&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Hromnik, Indo-Africa: Towards a New Understanding of the History of Sub-Saharan Africa, Juta, Cape Town (1981), {{ISBN|978-0702111631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril A. Hromnik, African History and Africanist Orthodoxy: A Response to Hall and Borland's Review Article on 'Indo-Africa', The South African Archaeological Bulletin, Vol. 38, No. 137 (Jun., 1983), pp. 36-39&lt;/ref&gt; while there is ample additional archaeological and historical evidence for the first two schools.

A number of ancient Indian texts describe shipping and trade. Kautiliya's [[Arthashastra]] dedicates a chapter to it, and mentions a government official called ''navadhyaksha'', or minister of shipping whose job was to capture and prosecute pirates, manage sea ports and collect custom duties.&lt;ref name=ac2011/&gt; Wilfred Schoff's work provides evidence of a chain of active trading ports along east and west Indian coasts by 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Schoff (1912), The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century, {{ISBN|978-8121506991}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is extensive evidence for the presence of Hindu traders and merchants in Mozambique and Swahili coast (Tanzania, Kenya), archaeological evidence has not been found for any shipping or trading in ancient times, including those by Hindus from India, along the coast of modern South Africa. Bruno Werz states that this is likely because the coastal region of Mozambique and Swahili coasts are calmer and offer many natural ports that fall is natural trade winds between India and Africa, in contrast to the more turbulent coast and seas around South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Werz, in Editors: Alexis Catsambis et al. (2011), The Oxford Handbook of Maritime Archaeology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195375176}}, Chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hromnik states that the likely path was arrival in Mozambique, followed by a land route inland into gold mining areas belonging to [[Shona people]] in Zimbabwe to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Shona, सोना, means gold in many Indian languages&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the era when Hindus first arrived in South Africa, their numbers were small and they were limited to the coastal or urban regions before the colonial era.

===Colonial era, indentured labourers===
{{main|Indian South Africans}}
[[File:Natal Colony map.png|thumb|Natal region (orange) of South Africa, where over 100,000 indentured Hindu laborers were first brought in by British colonial empire in the 19th century.]]
Large numbers of Hindus (as well as people of other religions) began arriving into South Africa in the 19th century colonial era, mostly as [[indentured labor]] and some on their own as "free" immigrants. After [[slavery]] was abolished throughout the [[British Empire]] by 1833,&lt;ref name=dcush&gt;Denise Cush et al. (2007), Hindus in Africa, in Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0700712670}}, Routledge, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt; British mining companies and European plantation owners throughout the empire were short of cheap or free skilled labour for labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and mining work. The available local labour became difficult to retain for low salary, harsh work, and thus unreliable.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt;&lt;ref name=bna&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Labour| year=2010| publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom| url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/blackhistory/india/forced.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Empire invented and enforced an [[indentured]] labor system which essentially retained all elements of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New System of Slavery|first= Hugh | last=Tinker| year=1993| isbn=978-1-870518-18-5| publisher= Hansib Publishing, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new system, also called the 'coolie system',&lt;ref name=mvm/&gt; was extensively used to bring Hindus to South Africa and other parts of British empire. The system enticed extremely poor people in India to sign a contract wherein they would be promised paid travel and a livelihood in exchange for a binding promise to work for a fixed period of time (four to seven years was common). Any indentured laborer who left before the contract ended was considered a criminal and subject to a prison term.&lt;ref name=bna/&gt;

When the indentured labor law was designed, it provided the indentured laborer some rights at the end of the contract; the laborer became free, with the legal right to some land and the right to stay in the new land, or demand the company or plantation owner for pre-paid travel back. However, in late 1880s South Africa, new laws were passed that required that the newly freed indentured laborer pay a hefty tax, or sign a new indentured labor contract and escape the tax. About 25% of Hindus returned to India, once their first contract was over. But for most indentured Hindu laborers, they had lost all contact with their country of origin, chose to stay and signed a new indentured contract. It is this system that brought large number of Hindus (and Southeast Asians) into South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Vertovik (Robin Cohen, ed.)|title=The Cambridge survey of world migration| year=1995|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ships carrying indentured Hindu labourers for plantations in British Empire left India in 1836. While some Hindus were recruited legally, many others were kidnapped or "[[Blackbirding|blackbirded]]" into long-term indentured service in various parts of British Empire, ranging from South Africa to Fiji, Australia and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=bna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2013/08/17/south-sea-islanders-mark-sugar-slave-days|title=South Sea Islanders mark sugar 'slave' days|publisher=SBS Australia|date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, indentured labourers were brought in to work on [[sugarcane]] plantations in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]],&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt; in part because sugarcane farming and sugar had its origins in India, the labor did not need to be trained, and Indian Hindus were suffering from waves of famines and extreme poverty while British colonial empire was busy force converting India's fertile farms from the production of food to the production of cash crops such as cotton for British mills, tobacco for Europeans, poppy and opium for China.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison, A. (1970), The historical origins of Indian poverty, PSL Quarterly Review, 23(92), pp. 31-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hunt (1997), To End Poverty - The Starvation of the Periphery by the Core, Oxford, UK, {{ISBN|978-0952887201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Kwa-Zulu Natal province of South Africa has the largest Hindu population in Africa (about 12% of Kwa-Zulu Natal province's total population).

In the early decades of the migrations, indentured Indians were treated as inhumanely as the enslaved Africans had been.&lt;ref name=bna/&gt;&lt;ref name=mvm&gt;Michelangelo van Meerten, in History of Humanity: Scientific and Cultural Development, Editors: Peter Mathias and Nikolaj Tolorov, Volume 6, Originally published by [[UNESCO]], Re-published by Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-09310-4}}, pp. 72-75&lt;/ref&gt; They were confined to their estates and paid a pitiful salary. Any breach of contract brought automatic criminal penalties and imprisonment. Many of these were brought away from their homelands deceptively, from inland regions far from seaports where they were promised jobs but were not told the work they were being hired for, nor that the new job required them to leave their homeland and communities.&lt;ref name=bna/&gt; They were hustled aboard waiting ships, unprepared for the long and arduous four-month sea journey. Abuse, disease and death on these ship, and in plantations of South Africa were common place.&lt;ref name=rhutt&gt;R Huttenback (1976), Racism and Empire: White Settlers and Colored Immigrants in the British Self-Governing Colonies 1830-1910, Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|978-0801409745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H Tinker (1976), Separate and Unequal, University of British Columbia Press, {{ISBN|978-0903983310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse led to a temporary ban on indenture labor hiring in South Africa in early 1870s.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt;

===Establishment of Hinduism in South Africa===
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|thumb|Mahatma Gandhi's resolve to apply Hindu principles of non-violence for peaceful transformation of society took shape in South Africa.]]
After the ban was lifted with British Colonial Law 19 and 20 of 1874, British officials advertised plantation job opportunities to Hindu families in northern Ganges basin and southern Tamil Nadu, invited men to bring their families, promised salary with homes, and that they and their families can continue to practice Hinduism while they work at the plantations. However, once they arrived, there were many irregularities and the reality after arrival was very different than promises before their departure.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sujata Patel and Tina Uys (2012), Contemporary India and South Africa, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-52299-1}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1874 and 1911, European plantation and factory owners in Natal region of South Africa alone brought in 146,000 people from India in 364 ships.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;over 80% of Indians who were brought in these ships were Hindus; South Indian Christians and North Indian Muslims made up most of the rest&lt;/ref&gt; Other Hindu [[coolie]]s (indentured laborers)&lt;ref&gt;In the plantations as well as the courts of South Africa, Hindus were often called coolie; see Lord Selborne court papers from 1905 in Johannesburg&lt;/ref&gt; were deployed by the colonial government in [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and [[Free State (province)|Free State]].&lt;ref name=mckt&gt;Marina Carter and Khal Torabully (2002), Coolitude, Anthem Press, {{ISBN|1-84331-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the colonial government recognized three classes of Hindus - the "free" merchant class Hindus who had arrived in South Africa at their own expense, the previously indentured but later free Hindus who typically manned shops and logistics, and the "non-free" indentured class of Hindus whose residence and movement was controlled because he or she was contracted property.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt; The first two classes of Indian Hindus prospered and became wealthy, and were increasingly seen as economic threats by European merchants by late 1880s.&lt;ref name=pyounger/&gt;

Discriminatory laws based on ethnic origin began to be passed in 1890s, and the roots of South African apartheid era started taking shape. It was in this environment of 1890s when [[Mahatma Gandhi#Civil rights movement in South Africa (1893–1914)|Mahatma Gandhi]] arrived in South Africa as a lawyer offering services to Indian diaspora in South Africa. It was his experiences of colonial abuse, religious stereotyping and racial discrimination against poor Hindus in South Africa that shaped his political and non-violent movement.&lt;ref name=dcush/&gt; He, along with other Hindus in Pretoria, began a series of publications and Hindu organizations to bring Hindu community together, and then non-violently highlight and seek human rights. Not only did they demand civil rights to transform interracial relations, they also sought social reforms among Hindus living in South Africa.&lt;ref name=pyounger&gt;Paul Younger (2009), New Homelands: Hindu Communities in Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa, Fiji and East Africa, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195391640}}, pp. 125-166&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
The first South African Hindu temple was built in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/indian-community Community History of Durban] South African History Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulwazi.org/index.php5?title=The_History_of_the_Sithambaram_Alayam_Temple_in_Bayview,_Chatsworth,_Durban The History of the Sithambaram Alayam Temple in Bayview, Chatsworth, Durban] Ulwazi&lt;/ref&gt; As the "free" Hindu community prospered, more temples were built in Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Pretoria. However, given the Hindus in South Africa came from different regions of India and spoke different languages, the temples and social life among Hindus remained diverse and fragmented. As apartheid-type discriminatory laws against colored and black people began to catch the imagination of some European settlers in South Africa, a few regional governments banned Hindus from purchasing land or building new temples in 1902.&lt;ref name=bhanabrain&gt;Bhana and Brain (1990), Setting down roots: Indian Migrants in South Africa, 1860-1911, Johannesburg, Witwatersrand University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Additional and more severe restrictions were placed against Hindus in South Africa during the Apartheid era, through 1994.&lt;ref name=ppk&gt;P.P. Kumar (2012), Hinduism in South Africa, in Elias Kifon Bongmba (Editor) - The Wiley Blackwell Companion to African Religions, {{ISBN|978-1405196901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamil Hindus had a well frequented First River (Umbilo Shri Ambalavanaar) temple on [[Umbilo River|Umbilo]] river in Durban by 1875. This temple was damaged by floods in 1905, but its deities and relocatable parts were saved before the floods and relocated nearby to Second River temple, one that has remained in use for over 100 years. The early temples in South Africa were simple, but followed the traditional Hindu temple design and architectures. Temples built later were larger and more elaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mikula et al. (1982), Traditional Hindu temples in South Africa, University of Virginia, {{ISBN|978-0620058551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
In South Africa, there is some blurring between language, and religion among Hindus. It is not uncommon for [[Tamil South Africans|Tamils]] to call their religion "Tamil",  or for [[Hindi language|Hindi]] speakers to refer to their religion likewise.&lt;ref name="Bongmba2012"/&gt; In general, worship of [[Mother goddess#Hinduism|Mother Goddess]] [[Parvati]] and Lord Sri [[Shiva]] are more common among Hindus of South Indian origin, with Hindus of North Indian origin worshiping [[Rama]], or in the case of Gujaratis, worshippers of [[Vishnu]]. However, there are many practices that are fluidly shared amongst all Hindus in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Bongmba2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias Kifon Bongmba|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to African Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFRRl1vv0kwC&amp;pg=PA393|date=21 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9690-1|pages=393–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diwali|Deepavali]] is the most important festival for South African Hindus. It is a major attraction in Durban, where public festivities are held every year along its beachfront.&lt;ref&gt;P.P. Kumar (2012), Hinduism in South Africa, in Elias Kifon Bongmba (Editor) - The Wiley Blackwell Companion to African Religions, {{ISBN|978-1405196901}}, pp. 395&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil Hindus of South Africa also observe [[Kavadi]], while Krishna devotees observe the Festival of Chariots.

Hare Krishna bhakti school of Hindus is active in many parts of South Africa, such as in Durban area where South Africa's largest Hindu community lives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

According to a research,More than 88% of Hindus affirmed a monotheistic understanding of God in Hinduism as opposed to only about 11% admitting to polytheistic notions.According to the Hofmeyr and Oosthuizen survey, the majority of Hindus in the Durban township of Chatsworth believes that “Jesus was the only son of God.”&lt;ref&gt;https://scroll.in/article/811204/why-religious-conversion-didnt-always-help-south-africas-indian-community&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of Sikhism''' started with [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], the first Guru in the fifteenth century in the [[Punjab region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The religious practices were formalised by [[Guru Gobind Singh Ji]] on 13 April 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =BBC History of Sikhism – The Khalsa  | work =Sikh world history  | publisher =BBC Religion &amp; Ethics  | date =29 August 2003  | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/history/history_1.shtml  | accessdate = 2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter baptised five persons from different social backgrounds to form [[Khalsa]] (ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ). The first five, [[Panj Pyare|Pure Ones]], then baptised Gobind Singh into the Khalsa fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Patwant  | title = The Sikhs  | publisher = Knopf  | pages = 14  | isbn = 0-375-40728-6  | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the order of Khalsa, a history of around 300 years.

The history of Sikhism is closely associated with the [[history of Punjab]] and the socio-political situation in 16th-century Northwestern Indian subcontinent (modern Pakistan and India). During the Mughal rule of India (1556–1707), Sikhism was in conflict with the Mughal empire laws, because they were affecting political successions of [[Mughals]] while cherishing saints from Hinduism and Islam. Prominent [[Sikh Gurus]] were killed by Islamic rulers for refusing to convert to Islam,&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution8&gt;Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Dhan Dhan Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-62&lt;/ref&gt; and for opposing the persecution of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]].&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution9&gt;{{cite journal  | last =McLeod   | first =Hew  | title =Sikhs and Muslims in the Punjab  | journal =South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies  | volume =22  | issue =s1  | pages =155–165  | year =1987  | doi =10.1080/00856408708723379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Sikh gurus|total 10 Sikh gurus]], last 6 gurus were persecuted,&lt;ref name=IslamistPersecution1&gt;V.

The emergence of the [[Sikh Confederacy]] under the [[misl]]s and [[Sikh Empire]] under reign of the Maharajah [[Ranjit Singh]] was characterised by religious tolerance and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] with Christians, Muslims and Hindus in positions of power. The establishment of the [[Sikh Confederacy|Sikh Empire]] is commonly considered the zenith of Sikhism at political level,&lt;ref name="Lafont"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Lafont  | first =Jean-Marie  | title =Maharaja Ranjit Singh: Lord of the Five Rivers (French Sources of Indian History Sources)   | publisher =Oxford University Press  | date =16 May 2002  | location =USA  | pages =23–29  | isbn = 0-19-566111-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this time the [[Sikh Confederacy|Sikh Empire]] came to include [[Kashmir]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Peshawar]]. [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], the Commander-in-chief of the Sikh army along the North West Frontier, took the boundary of the [[Sikh Empire]] to the very mouth of the [[Khyber Pass]]. The [[Sikh Confederacy|Empire's]] secular administration integrated innovative military, economic and governmental reforms.

The months leading up to the [[partition of India]] in 1947, saw heavy conflict in the [[Punjab Region|Punjab]] between Sikh and Muslims, which saw the effective religious migration of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus from [[Punjab (Pakistan)|West Punjab]] which mirrored a similar religious migration of Punjabi Muslims in [[Punjab (India)|East Punjab]].

== Early Modern (1469 CE – 1750 CE) ==

===Guru Nanak Dev ji ===
{{Main|Guru Nanak}}
Guru Nanak (1469&amp;ndash;1539), founder of Sikhism, was born to Mehta Kalu and Mata Tripta, in a [[Hindu]] family in the village of [[Nankana Sahib|Talwandi]], now called Nankana Sahib, near [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name=Singh_2006_1&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | isbn = 0-19-567747-1 | pages=12–13}} Also, as according to the Purātan Janamsākhī (the birth stories of Nanak).&lt;/ref&gt; His father, named Mehta Kalu, was a Patwari, an [[accountant]] of land revenue in the government. Nanak's mother was Mata Tripta, and he had one older sister, [[Bibi Nanki]].

From an early age, Guru Nanak Dev Ji seemed to have acquired a questioning and enquiring mind and refused as a child to wear the ritualistic "sacred" thread called a [[Janeu]] and instead said that he would wear the true name of God in his heart as protection, as the thread which could be broken, be soiled, burnt or lost could not offer any security at all. From early childhood, Bibi Nanki saw in her brother the Light of God but she did not reveal this secret to anyone. She is known as the first disciple of Guru Nanak.

Even as a boy, his desire to explore the mysteries of life eventually led him to leave home. It was during this period that Nanak was said to have met [[Kabir]] and Ravidass (1440–1518), saints revered by many. Nanak married Sulakhni, daughter of Moolchand Chona, a trader from [[Batala]], and they had two sons, [[Sri Chand]] and [[Lakshmi Das]].

His brother-in-law, Jai Ram, the husband of his sister Nanki, obtained a job for him in [[Sultanpur Lodhi|Sultanpur]] as the manager of the government granary. One morning, when he was twenty-eight, Guru Nanak Dev went as usual down to the river to bathe and [[meditate]]. It was said that he was gone for three days. When he reappeared, it is said he was "filled with the spirit of God". His first words after his re-emergence were: "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim". With this [[secular]] principle he began his [[missionary]] work.&lt;ref name=Shackle_2005&gt;{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher |author2=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xiii-xiv | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four distinct major journeys, in the four different directions, which are called [[Udasis]], spanning many thousands of kilometres, preaching the message of God.&lt;ref name=Singh_2006_1/&gt;

Guru Nanak spent the final years of his life in [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]] where [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] free blessed food was available. The food would be partaken of by Hindus, rich, poor, both high and so-called low castes. Guru Nanak worked in the fields and earned his livelihood. After appointing Bhai Lehna as the new Sikh Guru, on 22 September 1539, aged 70, Guru Nanak passed away.

===Guru Angad===
{{Main|Guru nanak}}
In 1538, Guru Nanak chose [[Lehna]], his disciple, as a successor to the Guruship rather than one of his sons.&lt;ref name=Shackle_2005/&gt; Bhai Lehna was named Guru Angad and became the successor of Guru Nanak. Bhai Lehna was born in the village of Harike in [[Ferozepur]] district in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], on 31 March 1504. He was the son of a small trader named Pheru. His mother's name was Mata Ramo (also known as Mata Sabhirai, Mansa Devi, Daya Kaur). Baba Narayan Das Trehan was his grand father, whose ancestral house was at Matte-di-Sarai near Mukatsar.

Under the influence of his mother, Bhai Lehna began to worship [[Durga]] (A Hindu Goddess). He used to lead a group of [[Hindu]] worshippers to Jawalamukhi Temple every year. He married [[Mata Khivi]] in January 1520 and had two sons, (Dasu and Datu), and two daughters (Amro and Anokhi). The whole Pheru family had to leave their ancestral village because of the ransacking by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and Baloch military who had come with Emperor [[Babur]]. After this the family settled at the village of [[Khadur Sahib]] by the [[River Beas]], near [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]] Sahib, a small town about 25&amp;nbsp;km. from [[Amritsar]] city.

One day, Bhai Lehna heard the recitation of a hymn of [[Guru Nanak]] from Bhai Jodha (a Sikh of Guru Nanak Sahib) who was in Khadur Sahib. He was thrilled and decided to proceed to [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]] to have an audience ([[Darśana|darshan]]) with Guru Nanak. So while on the annual pilgrimage to Jwalamukhi Temple, Bhai Lehna left his journey to visit Kartarpur and see Baba Nanak. His very first meeting with Guru Nanak completely transformed him. He renounced the worship of the Hindu Goddess, dedicated himself to the service of Guru Nanak and so became his disciple, (his Sikh), and began to live in Kartarpur.

His devotion and service ([[Selfless service|Sewa]]) to Guru Nanak and his holy mission was so great that he was instated as the Second Nanak on 7 September 1539 by Guru Nanak. Earlier Guru Nanak tested him in various ways and found an embodiment of obedience and service in him. He spent six or seven years in the service of Guru Nanak at Kartarpur.

After the death of Guru Nanak on 22 September 1539, Guru Angad left Kartarpur for the village of Khadur Sahib (near Goindwal Sahib). He carried forward the principles of Guru Nanak both in letter and spirit. Yogis and Saints of different sects visited him and held detailed discussions about Sikhism with him.

Guru Angad introduced a new alphabet known as [[Gurmukhi]] Script, modifying the old Punjabi script's characters. Soon, this script became very popular and started to be used by the people in general. He took great interest in the education of children by opening many schools for their instruction and thus increased the number of literate people. For the youth he started the tradition of Mall Akhara, where physical as well as spiritual exercises were held. He collected the facts about Guru Nanak's life from [[Bhai Bala]] and wrote the first biography of Guru Nanak.  He also wrote 63 [[Salok]]s (stanzas), which are included in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. He popularised and expanded the institution of ''Guru ka Langar'' that had been started by Guru Nanak.

Guru Angad travelled widely and visited all important religious places and centres established by Guru Nanak for the preaching of Sikhism. He also established hundreds of new Centres of Sikhism (Sikh religious Institutions) and thus strengthened the base of Sikhism. The period of his Guruship was the most crucial one. The Sikh community had moved from having a founder to a succession of Gurus and the infrastructure of Sikh society was strengthened and crystallised – from being an infant, Sikhism had moved to being a young child and ready to face the dangers that were around. During this phase, Sikhism established its own separate spiritual path.

Guru Angad, following the example set by Guru Nanak, nominated Sri Amar Das as his successor (the Third Nanak) before his death. He presented all the holy scripts, including those he received from Guru Nanak, to Guru Amar Das. He died on 29 March 1552 at the age of forty-eight. It is said that he started to build a new town, at Goindwal near Khadur Sahib and Guru Amar Das Sahib was appointed to supervise its construction. It is also said that [[Humayun]], when defeated by [[Sher Shah Suri]], came to obtain the blessings of Guru Angad in regaining the throne of [[Delhi]].

Guru Amar Das became the third Sikh guru in 1552 at the age of 73. [[Goindwal]] became an important centre for Sikhism during the Guruship of Guru Amar Das. He continued to preach the principle of equality for women, the prohibition of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] and the practise of [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]].&lt;ref name=Duggal_1988&gt;{{cite book | last=Duggal | first=Kartar Singh | year=1988 | title=Philosophy and Faith of Sikhism | publisher=Himalayan Institute Press | isbn = 0-89389-109-6 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1567, [[Emperor Akbar]] sat with the ordinary and poor people of Punjab to have Langar. Guru Amar Das also trained 140 apostles, of which 52 were women, to manage the rapid expansion of the religion.&lt;ref name=Brar_1998&gt;{{cite web | last=Brar | first=Sandeep Singh | year=1998 | title=The Sikhism Homepage:  Guru Amar Das | url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru3.htm | accessdate=2006-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died in 1574 aged 95, he appointed his son-in-law Jetha as the fourth Sikh Guru.

It is recorded that before becoming a Sikh, Bhai Amar Das, as he was known at the time, was a very religious Vaishanavite Hindu who spent most of his life performing all of the ritual pilgrimages and fasts of a devout Hindu. One day, Bhai Amar Das heard some hymns of Guru Nanak being sung by [[Bibi Amro]] Ji, the daughter of [[Guru Angad]], the second [[Sikh Guru]]. Bibi Amro was married to Bhai Sahib's brother, Bhai Manak Chand's son who was called Bhai Jasso. Bhai Sahib was so impressed and moved by these [[Shabda|Shabad]]s that he immediately decided to go to see [[Guru Angad]] at [[Khadur Sahib]]. It is recorded that this event took place when Bhai Sahib was 61 years old.

In 1535, upon meeting Guru Angad, Bhai Sahib was so touched by the Guru's message that he became a devout Sikh. Soon he became involved in [[Selfless service|Sewa]] (Service) to the Guru and the Community. Under the impact of Guru Angad and the teachings of the Gurus, Bhai Amar Das became a devout Sikh. He adopted Guru as his spiritual guide (Guru). Bhai Sahib began to live at Khadur Sahib, where he used to rise early in the morning and bring water from the Beas River for the Guru's bath; he would wash the Guru's clothes and fetch wood from the jungle for 'Guru ka Langar'.  He was so dedicated to Sewa and the Guru and had completely extinguished pride and was totally lost in this commitment that he was considered an old man who had no interest in life; he was dubbed Amru, and generally forsaken.

However, as a result of Bhai Sahib's commitment to Sikhi principles, dedicated service and devotion to the Sikh cause, Guru Angad Sahib appointed Guru Amar Das Sahib as third Nanak in March 1552 at the age of 73. He established his headquarters at the newly built town of Goindwal, which Guru Angad had established.

Soon large numbers of Sikhs started flocking to Goindwal to see the new Guru. Here, Guru Amar Das propagated the Sikh faith in a vigorous, systematic and planned manner. He divided the Sikh Sangat area into 22 preaching centres or Manjis, each under the charge of a devout Sikh. He himself visited and sent Sikh missionaries to different parts of India to spread Sikhism.

Guru Amar Das was impressed with [[Bhai Gurdas]]' thorough knowledge of [[Hindi]] and [[Sanskrit]] and the Hindu scriptures. Following the tradition of sending out [[Masand]]s across the country, Guru Amar Das deputed Bhai Gurdas to [[Agra]] to spread the gospel of Sikhism. Before leaving, Guru Amar Das prescribed the following routine for Sikhs:

{{cquote|He who calls himself a Sikh of the True Guru, He must get up in the morning and say his prayers. He must rise in the early hours and bathe in the holy tank. He must meditate on God as advised by the Guru. And rid him of the afflictions of sins and evil. As the day dawns, he should recite scriptures, and repeat God's name in every activity. He to whom the Guru takes kindly is shown the path. Nanak! I seek the dust of the feet of the Guru's Sikh who himself remembers God and makes others remember Him. (Gauri)}}

Guru Ji strengthened the tradition of '[[Guru ka Langar]]' and made it compulsory for the visitor to the Guru to eat first, saying that 'Pehle Pangat Phir Sangat' (first visit the Langar then go to the Guru). Once the emperor Akbar came to see Guru Sahib and he had to eat the coarse rice in the Langar before he could have an interview with Guru Sahib. He was so much impressed with this system that he expressed his desire to grant some royal property for 'Guru ka Langar', but Guru Sahib declined it with respect.

He introduced new birth, marriage and death ceremonies. Thus he raised the status of women and protected the rights of female infants who were killed without question as they were deemed to have no status. These teachings met with stiff resistance from the Orthodox Hindus. He fixed three Gurpurbs for Sikh celebrations: [[Diwali]], [[Vaisakhi]] and [[Maghi]].

Guru Amar Das not only preached the equality of people irrespective of their caste but he also fostered the idea of women's equality. He preached strongly against the practice of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] (a Hindu wife burning on her husband's funeral pyre). Guru Amar Das also disapproved of a young widow remaining unmarried for the rest of her life.

Guru Amar Das constructed "Baoli" at Goindwal Sahib having eighty-four steps and made it a Sikh pilgrimage centre for the first time in the history of Sikhism. He reproduced more copies of the hymns of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad. He also composed 869 (according to some chronicles these were 709) verses (stanzas) including [[Anand Sahib]], and then later on [[Guru Arjan]] (fifth Guru) made all the Shabads part of [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

When the time came for the Guru's younger daughter [[Bibi Bhani]] to marry, he selected a pious and diligent young follower of his called Jetha from [[Lahore]]. Jetha had come to visit the Guru with a party of pilgrims from Lahore and had become so enchanted by the Guru's teachings that he had decided to settle in [[Goindwal]]. Here he earned a living selling wheat and would regularly attend the services of Guru Amar Das in his spare time.

Guru Amar Das did not consider anyone of his sons fit for Guruship and chose instead his son-in law (Guru) Ram Das to succeed him. Guru Amar Das Sahib at the age of 95 died on 1 September 1574 at Goindwal in District [[Amritsar]], after giving responsibility of Guruship to the Fourth Nanak, [[Guru Ram Das]].

===Guru Ram Das===
{{Main|Guru Ram Das}}
Guru Ram Das (Punjabi: ਗੁਰੂ ਰਾਮ ਦਾਸ) (Born in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan on 24 September 1534 – 1 September 1581, Amritsar, Punjab, India) was the fourth of the Ten Gurus of Sikhism, and he became Guru on 30 August 1574, following in the footsteps of Guru Amar Das. He was born in Lahore to a Sodhi family of the Khatri clan. His father was Hari Das and mother Anup Devi, and his name was Jetha, meaning 'first born'. His wife was Bibi Bhani, the younger daughter of Guru Amar Das, the third guru of the Sikhs. They had three sons: Prithi Chand, Mahadev and Arjan Dev.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As a Guru one of his main contributions to Sikhism was organising the structure of Sikh society. Additionally, he was the author of Laava, the hymns of the Marriage Rites, the designer of the Harmandir Sahib, and the planner and creator of the township of Ramdaspur (later [[Amritsar]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A hymn by Guru Ram Das from Ang 305 of the Guru Granth Sahib:
"One who calls himself a Sikh of the True Guru shall get up early morning and meditate on the Lord's Name. Make effort regularly to cleanse, bathe and dip in the ambrosial pool. Upon Guru's instructions, chant Har, Har singing which, all misdeeds, sins and pains shall go away."
Guru Ram Das nominated Guru Arjan, his youngest son, as the next Guru of the Sikhs.

===Guru Arjan Dev===

{{Main|Guru Arjan}}
In 1581, Guru Arjan &amp;mdash; the youngest son of the fourth guru &amp;mdash; became the Fifth Guru of the Sikhs. In addition to being responsible for building the [[Harimandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], he prepared the Sikh [[Sacred text]] and his personal addition of some 2,000 plus hymns in the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sāhib]].

In 1604 he installed the [[Adi Granth|Ādi Granth]] for the first time as the [[Holy Book]] of the Sikhs. In 1606, for refusing to make changes to the Gurū Granth Sāhib, he gave martyrdom and was executed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers of the time.&lt;ref name=Shackle_2005/&gt;

===Guru Har Gobind===
{{Main|Guru Hargobind}}
[[File:Nishan sahib golden temple.jpg|thumb|right|The two Nishan Sahib's at Akal Bunga]]
Guru Har Gobind became the sixth guru of the Sikhs. He carried two swords &amp;mdash; one for Spiritual reasons and one for temporal (worldly) reasons.&lt;ref name=Mahmood_2002&gt;{{cite book | last=Mahmood | first=Cynthia | year=2002 | title=A Sea of Orange | publisher=Xlibris | location=United States | isbn = 1-4010-2856-X | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} From this point onward, the Sikhs became a military force and always had a trained fighting force to defend their independence.

Guru Hargobind fixed two [[Nishan Sahib]]'s at Akal Bunga in front of the [[Akal Takht]]. One flag is towards the [[Harmandir Sahib]] and the other shorter flag is towards Akal Takht. The first represents the reins of the spiritual authority while the later represents temporal power stating temporal power should be under the reins of the spiritual authority.

===Guru Har Rai===

{{Main|Guru Har Rai}}
Guru Har Rai (Punjabi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿ ਰਾਇ) (26 February 1630 – 6 October 1661) was the seventh of the ten Gurus of Sikhism, becoming Guru on 8 March 1644, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Guru Har Gobind, who was the sixth guru. Before he died, he nominated Guru Har Krishan, his youngest son, as the next Guru of the Sikhs.

As a very young child he was disturbed by the suffering of a flower damaged by his robe in passing. Though such feelings are common with children, Guru Har Rai would throughout his life be noted for his compassion for life and living things. His grandfather, who was famed as an avid hunter, is said to have saved the Moghul Emperor Jahangir's life during a tiger's attack. Guru Har Rai continued the hunting tath at age 31, Guru tradition of his grandfather, but he would allow no animals to be killed on his grand Shikars. The Guru instead captured the animal and added it to his zoo.
He made several tours to the Malwa and Doaba regions of the Punjab.

His son, Ram Rai, seeking to assuage concerns of Aurangzeb over one line in Guru Nanak's verse (Mitti Mussalmam ki pede pai kumhar) suggested that the word Mussalmam was a mistake on the copyist's part, therefore distorting Bani. The Guru refused to meet with him again. The Guru is believed to have said, "Ram Rai, you have disobeyed my order and sinned. I will never see you again on account of your infidelity." It was also reported to the Guru that Ram Rai had also worked miracles in the Mughal's court against his father's direct instructions. Sikhs are constrained by their Gurus to not believe in magic and myth or miracles. Just before his death at age 31, Guru Har Rai passed the Gaddi of Nanak on to his younger son, the five-year-old – Guru Har Krishan.

Guru Har Rai was the son of Baba Gurdita and Mata Nihal Kaur (also known as Mata Ananti Ji). Baba Gurdita was the son of the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind. Guru Har Rai married Mata Kishan Kaur (sometimes also referred to as Sulakhni), daughter of Sri Daya Ram of Anoopshahr (Bulandshahr) in Uttar Pradesh on Har Sudi 3, Samvat 1697. Guru Har Rai had two sons: Baba Ram Rai and Sri Har Krishan.

Although, Guru Har Rai was a man of peace, he never disbanded the armed Sikh Warriors (Saint Soldiers), who earlier were maintained by his grandfather, Guru Hargobind. He always boosted the military spirit of the Sikhs, but he never himself indulged in any direct political and armed controversy with the contemporary Mughal Empire. Once, Dara Shikoh (the eldest son of emperor Shah Jahan), came to Guru Har Rai asking for help in the war of succession with his brother, the murderous Aurangzeb. The Guru had promised his grandfather to use the Sikh Cavalry only in defense. Nevertheless, he helped him to escape safely from the bloody hands of Aurangzeb's armed forces by having his Sikh warriors hide all the ferry boats at the river crossing used by Dara Shikoh in his escape.

===Guru Har Krishan===
{{Main|Guru Har Krishan}}
Guru Har Krishan born in Kirat Pur, Ropar (Punjabi: ਗੁਰੂ ਹਰਿ ਕ੍ਰਿਸ਼ਨ) (7 July 1656 – 30 March 1664) was the eighth of the Ten Gurus of Sikhism, becoming the Guru on 7 October 1661, following in the footsteps of his father, Guru Har Rai. Before Har Krishan died of complications of [[Smallpox]], he nominated his granduncle, Guru Teg Bahadur, as the next Guru of the Sikhs. The following is a summary of the main highlights of his short life:

{{cquote|Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji was the epitome of sensibility, generosity and courage. There is a famous incident from his early age. Once on the way to Delhi from Punjab he met an arrogant [[Brahmin]] [[Pandit|Pundit]] called Lal Chand in Panjokhara town. The Pundit asked him to recite Salokas from the Geeta since his name was similar to that of Lord Krishna. Guru Ji invited a mute person called Chhajju Mehra and placed his stick on his head. He immediately started interpreting salokas from the Geeta. Everybody around was dumbstruck. Lal Chand's arrogance too was shattered and he asked for Guru Ji's forgiveness.}}

When Har Krishan stayed in Delhi there was a smallpox epidemic and many people were dying. According to Sikh history at Har Krishan's blessing, the lake at Bangla Sahib provided cure for thousands. Gurdwara Bangla Sahib was constructed in the Guru's memory. This is where he stayed during his visit to Delhi. Gurdwara Bala Sahib was built in south Delhi besides the bank of the river Yamuna, where Har Krishan was cremated at the age of about 7 years and 8 months. Guru Har Krishan was the youngest Guru at only 7 years of age. He did not make any contributions to Gurbani.

===Guru Tegh Bahadur ji===
{{Main|Guru Tegh Bahadur}}
Guru Tegh Bahadur was the ninth of the Sikh Gurus. The eight Sikh Guru, Guru Har Krishan, nominated him, his grand uncle as the next Guru, before he died. Guru Tegh Bahadur was actually the son of the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind. 
He sacrificed himself to protect Hindus. Aurungzeb was forcibly converting Hindus to Muslims. Hindus from Kashmir came to Guru Teg Bahadur for protection and requested for assistance. Guru asked them to tell Aurungzeb that if he converted Guru Teg Bahadur to Islam then they all become Muslim. He was asked by Aurungzeb, the Mughal emperor, under coercion by Naqshbandi Islamists, to convert to Islam or to sacrifice himself. The exact place where he died is in front of the [[Red Fort]] in Delhi (Lal Qila) and the gurdwara is called Sisganj.&lt;ref name=Rama_1986&gt;{{cite book | last=Rama | first=Swuami | year=1986 | title=Celestiyal Song/Gobind Geet: The Dramatic DialogueyBetween Guru Gobind Singh and Banda Singh Bahadyur | publisher=Hyimalayan Iystitute Press | isbn = 0-89389-103-7 | pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a turning point for Sikhism. His successor, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] further militarised his followers.

=== Guru Gobind Singh Ji ===

Guru Gobind Singh was the tenth guru of Sikhs. He was born in 1666 at [[Patna]] (Capital of [[Bihar, India]]). In 1675 Pundits from Kashmir in India came to Anandpur Sahib pleading to Guru Teg Bhadur (Father of Guru Gobind Singh ) about [[Aurangzeb]] forcing them to convert to Islam. Guru Teg Bahadur told them that martyrdom of a great man was needed. His son, Guru Gobind Singh said "Who could be greater than you", to his father. Guru Teg Bahadur told pundits to tell Aurangzeb's men that if Guru Teg Bahadur will become Muslim, they all will. Guru Teg Bahadur was then killed in Delhi, but before that he assigned Guru Gobind Singh as 10th Guru at age of 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005170705/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter14.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming Guru he commanded Sikhs to be armed. He fought many battles with Aurangzeb and some other Kings of that time, but always won.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==== Creation of the Khalsa ====
{{Main|Khalsa}}

In 1699 he created the Khalsa ''[[panth]]'', by giving ''[[Amrit Sanskar|amrit]]'' to sikhs. In 1704 he fought the great battle with collective forces of Aurangzeb, Wazir Khan (Chief of Sarhind), and other kings. He left Anandpur and went to Chamkaur with only 40 sikhs. There he fought the [[Battle of Chamkaur]] with 40 sikhs, vastly outnumbered by the Mughal soldiers. His two elder sons (at ages 17, 15) were killed there. Wazir Khan killed other two (ages 9, 6). Guru Ji sent Aurangzeb the [[Zafarnama (letter)|Zafarnamah]] (''Notification of Victory''). Then he went to Nanded ([[Maharashtra, India]]). From there he made Baba Gurbakhash Singh, also aliased as Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, as his general and sent him to Punjab.

On the evening of the day when Baba Gurbakhash Singh left for Punjab, Guru Gobind Singh was visited by two Muslim soldiers. One of them was commissioned by [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]], Subedar of Sirhind, to assassinate Guru Gobind Singh. One of the assailants, Bashal Beg, kept a vigil outside the Guru's tent while Jamshed Khan, a hired assassin, stabbed the Guru twice. Khan was killed in one stroke by the Guru, while those outside, alerted by the tumult, killed Beg. Although the wound was sewn up the following day, the Guru died in [[Nanded]], [[Maharashtra]], India in 1708.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/history/his1004.htm Today in Sikh History - 4 October :Gateway to Sikhism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309032444/http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/history/his1004.htm |date=9 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before passing away Guru Gobind Singh ordered that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (the Sikh Holy Scripture), would be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs and temporal authority would be vested in the [[Khalsa Panth]] &amp;ndash; the Sikh Nation. The first Sikh Holy Scripture was compiled and edited by the Fifth Guru, Guru Arjan in AD 1604, although some of the earlier gurus are also known to have documented their revelations. This is one of the few scriptures in the world that has been compiled by the founders of a faith during their own lifetime. The Guru Granth Sahib is particularly unique among sacred texts in that it is written in [[Gurmukhi]] script but contains many languages including [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. Sikhs consider the Guru Granth Sahib the last, perpetual living guru.

The Sikhs captured [[Sirhind]] in 1710 and killed the Governor of Sirhind, [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]] who was responsible for the death of the two youngest sons of Guru Gobind Singh at Sirhind. Becoming the ruler of Sirhind Banda Singh gave order to give ownership of the land to the farmers and let them live in dignity and self-respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty officials were also satisfied of with the change.

Banda Singh developed the village of Mukhlisgarh, and made it his capital He then renamed the city it to [[Lohgarh]] (fortress of steel) where he issued his own [[Mint (coin)|mint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=J.

He briefly established a state in Punjab for half a year. Banda Singh sent Sikhs to the [[Uttar Pradesh]] and Sikhs took over [[Saharanpur]], [[Jalalabad]], [[Saharanpur]], and other areas near by bringing relief to the repressed population.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the regions of [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]] and [[Amritsar district|Amritsar]], the Sikhs started fighting for the rights of the people.

Banda Singh ordered Baj Singh to open fire on them. The people were astonished at the strange reply to their representation, and asked him what he meant. He told them that they deserved no better treatment when being thousands in number they still allowed themselves to be cowed down by a handful of Zamindars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Sikhs over the entire [[East Punjab|Punjab]] east of Lahore obstructed the communication between [[Delhi]] and [[Lahore]], the capital of Punjab, and this worried Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah I|Bahadur Shah]] He gave up his plan to subdue rebels in [[Rajasthan]] and marched towards Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 6|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170102588|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire [[Imperialism|Imperial]] force was organised to defeat and kill Banda Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Harbans|title=The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism: A-D|year=1995|publisher=Punjabi University|isbn=9788173801006|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the generals were directed to join the Emperor’s army.

=== Sikhs retreat to jungles ===
[[File:Nihang Singh and Nihang Singhani.jpg|thumb|[[Nihang]] Singh and Nihang Singhani]]
In 1716 [[Farrukh Siyar]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor, issued all Sikhs to be converted to Islam or die, an attempt to destroy the power of the Sikhs and to exterminate the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=Jaspal|title=The Sikhs of the Punjab (Revised)|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521637640|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reward was offered for the head of every Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohli|first=Surinder|title=The Sikh and Sikhism|year=1993|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|location=New Delhi|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time it appeared as if the boast of Farrukh Siyar to wipe out the name of Sikhs from the land was going to be fulfilled. Hundreds of Sikhs were brought in from their villages and executed, and thousands who had joined merely for the sake of booty cut off their hair and went back to the Hindu fold again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Surjit|title=Sikhs in the Eighteenth Century: Their Struggle for Survival and Supremacy|year=1999|publisher=Singh Bros.|location=the University of Michigan|isbn=9788172052171|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these there were some Sikhs who had not yet received the baptism of Guru Gobind Singh, nor did they feel encouraged to do so, as the adoption of the outward symbols meant courting death.

After a few years Adbus Samad Khan, the Governor of [[Lahore]], Punjab and other Mughal officers began to pursue Sikhs less and thus the Sikhs came back to the villages and started going to the Gurdwaras again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were managed by [[Udasi]]s when the Sikhs were in hiding. The Sikhs celebrated [[Bandhi Chorh Diwas]] and [[Vaisakhi]] at [[Harmandir Sahib]].
The Khalsa had been split into two major factions Bandia Khalsa and Tat Khalsa and tensions were spewing between the two.

Under the authority of [[Mata Sundari]] [[Bhai Mani Singh]] become the [[Jathedar]] of the Harminder Sahib&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jawandha|first=Nahar|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|isbn=9789380213255|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a leader of the Sikhs and the Bandia Khalsa and Tat Khalsa joined by Bhai Mani Singh into the Tat Khalsa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhanoa|first=Surain|title=Raj Karega Khalsa|year=2005|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the event from that day the Bandeis assumed a quieter role and practically disappeared from the pages of history. A police post was established at Amritsar to keep a check on the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Bhagat|title=Sikh Polity in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|year=1978|publisher=Oriental Publishers &amp; Distributors|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdus Samad Khan, was transferred to Multan in 1726, and his more energetic Son, Zakaria Khan, also known as Khan Bahadur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to take his place as the governor of Lahore. In 1726, [[Bhai Tara Singh Wan|Tarra Singh of Wan]], a renowned Sikh leader, and his 26 men was killed after Governor Zakaria Khan, sent 2200 [[horse]]s, 40 [[zamburak]]s, 5 [[elephant]]s and 4 [[cannon]]s, under the command of his deputy, Momim Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder of Tarra Singh spread across the Sikhs in Punjab and the Sikhs. Finding no Sikhs around, the government falsely announced in each village with the beat of a drum, that all Sikhs had been eliminated but the common people knew the truth that this was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs did not face the army directly, because of their small numbers, but adopted ''dhai phut'' [[guerrilla warfare]] (hit and run) tactics.

Under the leadership of Nawab Kapoor Singh and Jathedar Darbara Singh, in attempt to weaken their enemy looted many of the Mughals caravans and supplies and for some years no money from revenue could reach the government treasury.&lt;ref name="Singh 1999 116"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the forces of government tried to punish the outlaws, they were unable to contact them, as the Sikhs did not live in houses or forts, but ran away to their rendezvous in forests or other places difficult to access.

=== Nawab Kapur Singh ===
{{Main|Nawab Kapur Singh}}

Nawab Kapur Singh was born in 1697 in a village near [[Sheikhupura]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]].He was a volunteer at Darbar Sahib Amritsar. His was cleaning shoes of sangat that come to pay their repect to Darbar Sahib,work in the kitchen to feed the Sangat .He was given a [[jagir]] in 1733 when the Governor of Punjab offered the Sikhs the [[Nawab]]ship (ownership of an estate) and a valuable royal robe, the Khalsa accepted it all in the name of Kapur Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|title=The A to Z of Sikhism|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810863446|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, he became known as Nawab Kapur Singh. In 1748 he would organise the early [[Sikh Misls]] into the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]] (Budda Dal and Tarna Dal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 7|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170102458|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawab Kapur Singh’s father was Chaudhri Daleep Singh as a boy he memorised [[Gurbani]] [[Nitnem]] and was taught the arts of war.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapur Singh was attracted to the [[Khalsa Panth]] after the execution of [[Bhai Tara Singh Wan|Bhai Tara Singh]], of the village of Van, in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 6|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170102588|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Extensive looting of the Mughal government ====

The [[Sarbat Khalsa|Khalsa]] held a meeting to make plans to respond to the state repression against the people of the region and they decided to take procession of government money and weapons in order to weaken the administration, and to equip themselves to face the everyday attacks.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 14"/&gt; Kapur Singh was assigned to plan and execute these projects.

Information was obtained that money was being transported from [[Multan]] to the [[Lahore]] treasure; the Khalsa looted the money and took over the arms and horses of the guards.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 14"/&gt; They then took over one lakh rupees from the Kasoor estate treasury going from Kasur to Lahore.&lt;ref name="Johar 2002 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johar|first=Surinder|title=The Sikh Sword to Power|year=2002|publisher=Arsee Publishers|location=the University of Michigan|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next they captured a caravan from [[Afghanistan]] region which resulted in capturing numerous arms and horses.

The Khalsa seized a number of vilayati (Superior Central Asian) horses from Murtaza Khan was going to [[Delhi]] in the jungle of [[Kahna Nau|Kahna Kachha]].&lt;ref name="Singh 1999 116"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhamija|first=Sumant|title=The Lion Hearted Jassa Singh Ahluwalia of Punjab|journal=Indian Defence Review|year=2004|volume=25|series=2|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6fqIFGD-E0C&amp;dq=jassa+singh+Mata+Sundari&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional war supplies were being taken from Afghanistan to Delhi and Kapur Singh organised an attack to capture them. In another attack the Khalsa recovered gold and silver which was intended to being carried from Peshawar to Delhi by Jaffar Khan, a royal official.&lt;ref name="Johar 2002 48"/&gt;

==== Government sides with the Khalsa ====

The Mughal rulers and the commanders alongside the Delhi government lost all hope of defeating the Sikhs through repression and decided to develop another strategy, Zakaria Khan, the Governor of Lahore, went to Delhi where it was decided to befriend the Sikhs and rule in cooperation with them and in 1733 the Dehli rulers withdrew all orders against the Khalsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|title=My library My History Books on Google Play The A to Z of Sikhism|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810863446|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs were now permitted to own land and to move freely without any state violence against them.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To co-operate with the [[Khalsa Panth]], and win the goodwill of the people, the government sent an offer of an estate and [[Nawab]]ship through a famous Lahore Sikh, Subeg Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jawandha|first=Nahar|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|isbn=9789380213255|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Khalsa did not wanted to rule freely and not to be under the rule of a subordinate position. However this offer was eventually accepted and this title was bestowed on [[Nawab Kapur Singh|Kapur Singh]] after it was sanctified by the touch of [[Panj Pyare|Five Khalsas]] feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Kapur Singh became Nawab Kapur Singh. Kapur Singh guided the Sikhs in strengthening themselves and preaching [[Gurmat]] to the people. He knew that peace would be short lived. He encouraged people to freely visit their [[Gurdwara]]s and meet their relatives in the villages.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 16"/&gt;

==== Dal Khalsa ====
{{Main|Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)}}
[[File:Dilruba detail.jpg|thumb|[[Ragi (Sikhism)|Ragi]]s recite [[Sikh scriptures]] alongside playing portable instruments such as the [[Dilruba]]]]
The Khalsa reorganised themselves into two divisions, the younger generation would be part of the Taruna Dal, which provided the main fighting force, while the Sikhs above the age of forty years would be a part of the Budha Dal, which provided the responsibility of the management of Gurdwaras and [[Gurmat]] preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budha Dal would be responsible to keep track of the movements of government forces, plan their defense strategies, and they provide a reserve fighting force for the Taruna Dal.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 16"/&gt;

The following measures were established by Nawab Kapur Singh:&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All money obtained from anywhere by any [[Jatha]] should be deposited in the Common Khalsa Fund.
* The Khalsa should have their common [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langer]] for both the Dals.
* Every Sikh should respect the orders of his [[Jathedar]]. Anyone going anywhere would get permission from him and report to him on his return.

==== 5 Sikh Misls of the Dal Khalsa ====
The Taruna Dal quickly increased to more than 12,000 recruits and it soon became difficult to manage the house and feeding of such a large number of people at one place.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 17"/&gt;
It was then decided to have five divisions of the Dal, each to draw rations from the central stocks and cook its own [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chhabra|first=G. S.|title=Advanced History of the Punjab, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=New Academic Publishing Company|location=he University of Virginia|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five divisions were stationed around the five sarovars (sacred pools) around [[Amritsar]] they were Ramsar, Bibeksar, Lachmansar, Kaulsar and Santokhsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nijjar|first=Bakhshish|title=Panjab Under the Later Mughals, 1707-1759|year=1972|publisher=New Academic Publishing Company|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The divisions later became known as [[Misl]]s and their number increased to eleven. Each took over and ruled a different region of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Collectively they called themselves the [[Sarbat Khalsa]].

==== Preparing Jassa Singh Ahluwalia for leadership ====

Being the leader of the Khalsa [[Nawab Kapur Singh]] was given an additional responsibility by [[Mata Sundari]], the wife of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] sent Kapur Singh the young [[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]] and told him that Ahluwalia was like a son to her and that the Nawab should raise him like an ideal Sikh. Ahluwalia under the guidance of Kapur Singh, was given a good education in [[Gurbani]] and a thorough training in managing the Sikh affairs.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later Jassa Singh Ahluwalia would become an important role in leading the Sikhs to self-rule.

==== State oppression ====

In 1735, the rulers of Lahore attacked and repossessed the [[jagir]] (estate) given to the Sikhs only two years before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 6|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170102588|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Nawab Kapur Singh]] in reaction decided the whole [[Punjab region|Punjab]] should be taken over by the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Sangat|title=The Sikhs in History|year=1995|publisher=S. Singh|location=New York|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was taken against heavy odds but was endorsed by the [[Khalsa]] and all the Sikhs assured him of their full cooperation in his endeavor for self-rule. [[Zakariya Khan Bahadur]] sent roaming squads to hunt and kill the Sikhs. Orders were issued to all administrators down to the village level officials to seek Sikhs, murder them, get them arrested, or report their whereabouts to the governments. One years wages were offered to anyone who would murder a Sikh and deliver his head to the police station.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 18"/&gt;
Rewards were also promised to those who helped arrest Sikhs. Persons providing food or shelter to Sikhs or helping them in any way were severely punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=A Short History of the Sikhs: 1469-1765|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|location=Patiala|isbn=9788173800078|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the period when the Sikhs were sawed into pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sethi |first=Amarjit |title=Universal Sikhism |year=1972 |publisher=Hemkunt Press |location=The University of California |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; burnt alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sikh Review |year=2005 |volume=53 |issue=7-12; 619-624 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObIlAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; their heads crushed with hammers&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 19"&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Gurbaksh |title=The Khalsa Generals |year=1927 |publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society |isbn=0969409249 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and young children were pierced with spears before their mother’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Randhawa |first=Ajit |title=Evolution of Faith and Religion: An Exploration |year=2009 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=9781449000806 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep their morale high, the Sikhs developed their own high-sounding terminologies and slogans:&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 19"/&gt; For example. Tree leaves boiled for food were called ‘green dish’; the parched [[chickpea]]s were called ‘almonds’; the [[Acacia nilotica|Babul tree]] was a ‘rose’; a blind man was a ‘brave man’, getting on the back of a [[Bovinae|buffalo]] was ‘riding an elephant’.

The army pursued the Sikhs hiding near the hills and forced them to cross the rivers and seek safety in the [[Malwa]] tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Harbans|title=The Heritage of the Sikh|year=1983|publisher=Manohar Publications|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kapur Singh reached [[Patiala district|Patiala]] he met [[Maharaja]] [[Maharaja of Patiala|Baba Ala Singh]] who then took [[Amrit Sanskar|Amrit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kapur Singh helped him increase the boundaries of his state. In 1736 the Khalsa attacked [[Sirhind]], where the two younger sons of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were killed. The Khalsa took over the city, the took over the treasury and they established the [[Gurdwara]]s at the historical places and withdrew.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 19"/&gt;
While near [[Amritsar]] the government of Lahore sent troops to attack the Sikhs. Kapur Singh entrusted the treasury to [[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]], while having sufficient amount of Sikhs with him to keep the army engaged. When Jassa Singh was reached a consider distance the Khalsa safely retreated to [[Tarn Taran Sahib]]. Kapur Singh sent messages to the Tauna Dal asking them to help them in the fight. After a days of fighting Kapur Singh from the trenches dug by the Khalsa surprisingly attacked the commanding posts killing three generals alongside many Mughal officers. The Mughal army thus retreated to Lahore.

Zakaria Khan called his advisers to plan another strategy to deal with the Sikhs. It was suggested that the Sikhs should not be allowed to visit the Amrit Sarovar,&lt;ref name="Singha 2005 31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H.S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 6|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170102588|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was believed to be the fountain of their lives and source of their strength. Strong contingents were posted around the city and all entries to [[Harmandir Sahib]] were checked. The Sikhs, however, risking their lives, continued to pay their respects to the holy place and take a dip in the Sarovar (sacred pool) in the dark of the night. When Kapur Singh went to Amritsar he had a fight with [[Qadi]] Abdul Rehman. He had declared that Sikhs the so-called [[lions]], would not dare to come to Amritsar and face him. In the ensuing fight Abdul Rehman was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Surjit|first=Gandhi|title=Struggle of the Sikhs for sovereignty|year=1980|publisher=Gur Das Kapur|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his son tried to save him, he too lost his life. In 1738 [[Bhai Mani Singh]] was executed.

==== Sikhs attack Nader Shah ====
In 1739 [[Nader Shah]] of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Afsharid dynasty]] invaded and looted the treasury of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Nader Shah killed more than 100,000 people in Delhi and carried off all of the gold and valuables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Augustus|title=An accompaniment to Mitchell's map of the world|year=1840|publisher=R.L. Barnes|location=Harvard University|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added to his caravan hundreds of elephants and horses, along with thousands of young women and Indian [[artisans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sikh Review|year=2005|volume=53|issue=1-6; 613-618|page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nXXAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Kapur Singh]] came to know of this, he decided to warn Nader Shah that if not the local rulers, then the Sikhs would protect the innocent women of Muslims and Hindus from being sold as slaves. While crossing The river [[Chenab]],  the Sikhs attacked the rear end of the caravan, freed many of the women, freed the artisans, and recovered part of the treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chhabra|first=G. S.|title=Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-1: 1707-1803)|year=2005|publisher=Lotus Press|location=India|isbn=9788189093068|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sikhs continued to harass him and lighten him of his loot until he withdrew from the Punjab.

==== Sikhs kill Massa Rangar ====

[[Massa Ranghar]], the Mughal official, had taken over the control of [[Amritsar]]. While smoking and drinking in the [[Harmandir Sahib]], he watched the dances of [[nautch]] girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Parm|title=Golden Temple|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|isbn=9788173805691|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs who had moved to [[Bikaner district|Bikaner]], a desert region, for safety, were outraged to hear of this desecration. In 1740 [[Sukha Singh]] and [[Mehtab Singh Bhangu|Mehtab Singh]], went to Amritsar disguised as revenue collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tied their horses outside, walked straight into the [[Harmandir Sahib]], cut off his head,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohli|first=Surinder|title=The Sikh and Sikhism|year=1993|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took it with them. It was a lesson for the ruler that no tyrant would go unpunished.

==== Sikhs loot Abdus Samad Khan ====

Abdus Samad Khan, a senior Mughal royal commander, was sent from [[Delhi]] to subdue the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Harbans|title=The Heritage of the Sikhs|year=1964|publisher=Asia Publishing House|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapur Singh learned of this scheme and planned his own strategy accordingly. As soon as the army was sent out to hunt for the Sikhs, a [[Jatha]] of commandos disguised as messengers of Khan went to the [[Armory (military)|armory]]. The commander there was told that Abdus Samad Khan was holding the Sikhs under siege and wanted him with all his force to go and arrest them. The few guards left behind were then overpowered by the Sikhs, and all the arms and ammunition were looted and brought to the Sikh camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mughals increase persecution ====

Abdus Samad Khan sent many roaming squads to search for and kill Sikhs. He was responsible for the torture and murder of [[Bhai Mani Singh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jawandha|first=Nahar|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=9789380213255|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; the head [[Granthi]] of Harimander Sahib. Samad Khan was afraid that Sikhs would kill him so he remained far behind the fighting lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chhabra|first=G. S.|title=Advanced History of the Punjab, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=New Academic Publishing Company|location=The University of Virginia|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kapur Singh had a plan to get him. During the battle Kapur Singh ordered his men to retreat drawing the fighting army with them. He then wheeled around and fell upon the rear of the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Panjab Past and Present, Volume 11|year=1977|publisher=Department of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University|location=The University of California|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samad Khan and his guards were lying dead on the field within hours. The Punjab governor also took extra precautions for safety against the Sikhs. He started to live in the fort. He would not even dare to visit the mosque outside the fort for prayers.

On the request of the Budha Dal members, Kapur Singh visited [[Patiala]]. The sons of Sardar Ala Singh, the founder and [[Maharajah]] of the [[Patiala district|Patiala state]], gave him a royal welcome. Kapur Singh subdued all local administrators around Delhi who were not behaving well towards their people.

Zakaria Khan died in 1745. His successor tightened the security around [[Amritsar]]. Kapur Singh planned to break the siege of Amritsar. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was made the commander of the attacking Sikh forces. In 1748, the Sikhs attacked. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, with his commandos behind him, dashed to the army commander and cut him into two with his sword. The commander's nephew was also killed.

==== The Khalsa strengthen military developments ====

The Sikhs built their first fort Ram Rauni at Amritsar in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaur|first=Madanjit|title=The Golden Temple: Past and Present|year=1983|publisher=Department of Guru Nanak Studies, Guru Nanak Dev University Press|location=The University of Michigan|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1748, Governor Mir Mannu had to take his forces outside of [[Lahore]] to stop the advance of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]]. The Sikhs quickly overpowered the police defending the station in Lahore and confiscated all of their weapons and released all the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Tarlochan|title=History of the Sikhs|year=1996|publisher=Canada Centre Publications|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nawab Kapur Singh told the sheriff to inform the Governor that, the sheriff of God, the True Emperor, came and did what he was commanded to do. Before the policemen could report the matter to the authorities, or the army could be called in, the Khalsa were already riding their horses back to the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nawab Kapur Singh died in 1753.

[[File:PicKingRaja.jpg|thumb|[[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]]]]

Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was born in 1718.

Later Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was adopted by Nawab Kapoor Singh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Ganda|title=Sardar Jassa Singh Ahluwalia|year=1990|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the leader of the Sikh nation. Ahluwalia followed all Sikh qualities required for a leader Ahluwalia would sing [[Asa di Var]] in the morning and it was appreciated by all the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]] and Ahluwalia kept busy doing [[Selfless service|seva]] (selfless service). He became very popular with the Sikhs. He used to tie his [[turban]] in the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] fashion as he grew up in Delhi. Ahluwalia learned [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]] and [[swordsmanship]] from expert teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1748 Jassa Singh Ahluwalia became the supreme commander of all the Misls.&lt;ref name="H. S. Singha 2000 111"&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S.

==== Chhota Ghalughara (The Lesser Massacre) ====
{{Main|Sikh holocaust of 1746}}

In 1746 about seven thousand Sikhs were killed and three thousand to fifteen thousand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sikh Review |year=2003|volume=51|issue=1-6; 589-594|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3XXAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs were taken prisoners during by the order of the [[Mughal Empire]] when Zakaria Khan, The Governor of Lahore, and Lakhpat Rai, the [[Divan]] (Revenue Minister) of Zakaria Khan, sent military squads to kill the Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Kohli 1993 62"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohli |first=Surinder |title=The Sikh and Sikhism |year=1993 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehta 2005 675"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mehta |first=Jaswant |title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India: 1707 - 1813 |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

Jaspat Rai, a [[jagir]]dar (landlord) of the [[Eminabad]] area and also the brother of Lakhpat Rai, faced the Sikhs in a battle one of the Sikhs held the tail of his elephant and got on his back from behind and with a quick move, he chopped off his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dilagir|first=Harajindar|title=The Sikh Reference Book|year=1997|publisher=Sikh Educational Trust for Sikh University Centre|location=Denmark|isbn=9780969596424|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeing their master killed, the troops fled. Lakhpat Rai, after this incident, committed himself to destroying the Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Mehta 2005 675"/&gt;

Through March–May 1746, a new wave of violence was started against the Sikhs with all of the resources available to the Mughal government, village officials were ordered to co-operate in the expedition. Zakaria Khan issued the order that no one was to give any help or shelter to Sikhs and warned that severe consequences would be taken against anyone disobeying these orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=Sukhbir|title=The Ideal Man: The Concept of Guru Gobind Singh, the Tenth Prophet of the Sikhs|year=1988|publisher=Khalsa College London Press|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local people were forcibly employed to search for the Sikhs to be killed by the army. Lakhpat Rai ordered Sikh places of worship to be destroyed and their holy books burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johar|first=Surinder|title=The Sikh Sword to Power|year=2002|publisher=Arsee Publishers|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about including Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and a large body of Sikhs were camping in riverbeds in the [[Gurdaspur district]] ([[Kahnuwan]] tract). Zakaria Khan managed to have 3,000 Sikhs of these Sikhs captured and later got them beheaded in batches at Nakhas (site of the horse market outside the Delhi gate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Ram|title=The Sikh struggle: origin, evolution, and present phase|year=1991|publisher=Chanakya Publications|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs raised a memorial shrine known as the Shahidganj (the treasure house of martyrs) at that place latter.

In 1747, Shah Nawaz took over as Governor of Lahore. To please the Sikhs, Lakhpat Rai was put in prison by the new Governor.&lt;ref name="Kohli 1993 62"/&gt; Lakhpat Rai received severe punishment and was eventually killed by the Sikhs.

==== Reclaiming Amritsar ====
In 1747 Salabat Khan, a newly appointed Mughal commander, placed police around Amritsar and built observation posts to spot and kill Sikhs coming to the Amrit Sarovar for a holy dip.&lt;ref name="Singha 2005 31"/&gt;  Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Nawab Kapoor Singh led the Sikhs to Amritsar, and Salabat Khan was killed by Ahluwalia, and his nephew was killed by the arrow of Kapur Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sikhs restored Harmandir Sahib and celebrated their [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Diwali]] gathering there.

==== Reorganisation of the Misls ====
In 1748 all the Misls joined themselves under one command and on the advice of the aging [[Jathedar]] Nawab Kapoor Singh Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was made the supreme leader.&lt;ref name="Singha 2000 111"/&gt; They also decided to declare that the Punjab belonged to them and they would be the sovereign rulers of their state. The Sikhs also built their first fort, called Ram Rauni, at [[Amritsar]].

==== Khalsa side with the Government ====
[[Adina Beg]], the [[Faujdar]] (garrison commander) of [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]], sent a message to the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]] chief to cooperate with him in the civil administration, and he wanted a meeting to discuss the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markovit|first=Claude|title=A History of Modern India: 1480 - 1950|year=2002|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843310044|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as a trick to disarm the Sikhs and keep them under government control. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia replied that their meeting place would be the battle ground and the discussion would be carried out by their swords. Beg attacked the Ram Rauni fort at Amritsar and besieged the Sikhs there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewan Kaura Mal advised the Governor to lift the siege and prepare the army to protect the state from the Durrani invader, Ahmed Shah Abdali. Kaura Mal had a part of the revenue of Patti area given to the Sikhs for the improvement and management of Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|title=A History of the Sikhs: 1469-1839|year=1963|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaura Mal had to go to [[Multan]] to quell a rebellion there. He asked the Sikhs for help and they agreed to join him. After the victory at Multan, Kaura came to pay his respects to the [[Harmandir Sahib|Darbar Sahib]], and offered 11,000 rupees and built Gurdwara Bal-Leela; He also spent 3,000,000 rupees to build a Sarover (holy water) at [[Nankana Sahib]], the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tasneem|first=Niranjan|title=The Lost Meaning|year=2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=9788126017966|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1752, Kaura Mall was killed in a battle with Ahmed Shah Abdali and state policy towards the Sikhs quickly changed. Mir Mannu, the Governor, started hunting Sikhs again. He arrested many men and women, put them in prison and tortured them. In November 1753,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} when he went to kill the Sikhs hiding in the fields, they showered him with a hail of bullets and Mannu fell from the horse and the animal dragged him to death. The Sikhs immediately proceeded to Lahore, attacked the prison, and got all the prisoners released and led them to safety in the forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Harmandir Sahib demolished in 1757 ====
In May 1757, the [[Afghan]] [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] general of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], Jahan Khan attacked Amritsar with a huge army and the Sikhs because of their small numbers decided to withdraw to the forests. Their fort, Ram Rauni, was demolished,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Harmandir Sahib]] was also demolished, and the army desecrated the Sarovar (Holy water) by filling it with debris and dead animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=Jaswant|title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India: 1707 - 1813|year=2005|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

==== The Khalsa gain territory ====
[[File:River Beas.jpg|thumb|Beas Rivers]]
[[Adina Beg]] did not pay revenues to the government so the Governor dismissed him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Diwan|title=The Revolution of Guru Nanak|year=1993|publisher=Peoples Publishing House|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a new [[Faujdar]] (garrison commander) in his place. The army was sent to arrest him and this prompted Adina Beg to request Sikh help. The Sikhs took advantage of the situation and to weaken the government, they fought against the army. One of the commanders was killed by the Sikhs and the other deserted. Later, the Sikhs attacked [[Jalandhar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhavan|first=Purnima|title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199756551|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus became the rulers of all the tracts between [[Sutlej]] and [[Beas River|Beas]] rivers, called [[Doaba]].&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead of roaming in the forests now they were ruling the cities.

The Sikhs started bringing more areas under their control and realising revenue from them. In 1758, joined by the [[Maratha Empire|Mahrattas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A. H.|first=Bingley|title=Sikhs|year=1970|publisher=Department of Languages, Punjab|location=The University of Michigan|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; they conquered Lahore and arrested many Afghan soldiers who were responsible for filling the Amrit Sarovar with debris a few months earlier. They were brought to Amritsar and made to clean the Sarovar (holy water).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Sikh Courier International |year=1985 |volume=25; 27 |issue=60; 64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWJRAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobati|first=Haracaran|title=The Sikh Psyche: A Study of the Fictional Writings of Bhai Vir Singh|year=1990|publisher=Eastern Book Linkers|isbn=9788185133423|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cleaning of the Sarovar, the soldiers were allowed to go home with a warning that they should not do that again.

[[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] came again in October 1759 to loot Delhi. The Sikhs gave him a good fight and killed more than 2,000 of his soldiers. Instead of getting involved with the Sikhs, he made a rapid advance to Delhi. The Khalsa decided to collect revenues from Lahore to prove to the people that the Sikhs were the rulers of the state. The Governor of Lahore closed the gates of the city and did not come out to fight against them. The Sikhs laid siege to the city. After a week, the Governor agreed to pay 30,000 [[rupee]]s to the Sikhs.

Ahmed Shah Abdali returned from Delhi in March 1761 with lots of gold and more than 2,000 young girls as prisoners who were to be sold to the Afghans in Kabul. When Abdali was crossing the river Beas, the Sikhs swiftly fell upon them. They freed the women prisoners and escorted them back to their homes. The Sikhs took over Lahore in September of 1761, after Abdali returned to [[Kabul]].

The Khalsa minted their coins in the name of [[Guru Nanak Dev]]. Sikhs, as rulers of the city, received full cooperation from the people. After becoming the Governor of Lahore, Punjab Jassa Singh Ahluwalia was given the title of [[Sultan]]-ul-[[Qaum|Kaum]] (King of the Nation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Patwant|title=The Sikhs|year=2007|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=9780307429339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wadda Ghalughara (The Great Massacre) ====
{{Main|Sikh holocaust of 1762}}
In the winter of 1762, after losing his loot from Delhi to the Sikhs, The [[Durrani]] emperor, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] brought a big, well equipped army to finish the Sikhs forever. Sikhs were near [[Ludhiana]] on their way to the forests and dry areas of the south and Abdali moved from Lahore very quickly and caught the Sikhs totally unprepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Haroon|title=History of the Pathans, Volume 1|year=2002|publisher=Haroon Rashid|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had their women, children and old people with them. As many as 30,000 Sikhs are said to have been murdered by the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Anna|title=Sharing the Sacred: Practicing Pluralism in Muslim North India|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195368239|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayel 2006 58"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayel|first=Jaspal|title=Universality of the Sikh Religion|year=2006|publisher=Jaspal Mayell|isbn=9780977790708|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jassa Singh Ahluwalia himself received about two dozen wounds.

==== Harmandir Sahib blown up in 1762 ====

[[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], fearing Sikh retaliation, sent messages that he was willing to assign some areas to the Sikhs to be ruled by them. [[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]] rejected his offers and told him that Sikhs own the Punjab and they do not recognise his authority at all. Abdali went to Amritsar and destroyed the [[Harmandir Sahib]] again by filling it up with gunpowder hoping to eliminate the source of "life" of the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nevile|first=Pran|journal=India Perspectives|year=2004|volume=17|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhavan|first=Purnima|title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199756551|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Abdali was demolishing the Harminder Sahib a he was hit on the nose with a brick;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johar|first=Surinder|title=The Heritage of Amritsar|year=1978|publisher=Sundeep Prakashan|location=University of Michigan|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; later in 1772 Abdali died of cancer from the 'gangrenous ulcer' that consumed his nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalrymple|first=William|title=Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan, 1839-42|year=2013|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc|isbn=9780307958297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few months the Sikhs attacked [[Sirhind]] and moved to Amritsar.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Sikhs retake Lahore ====
In 1764 the Sikhs shot dead [[Zain Khan Sirhindi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Parm|title=Golden Temple|year=1999|publisher=Publication Bureau, Punjabi University|isbn=9788173805691|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani Governor of Sirhind, and the regions around Sirhind were divided among the Sikh [[Misl]]dars and money recovered from the treasury were used to rebuild the [[Harmandir Sahib]]. [[Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib]] was built in Sirhind, at the location the two younger sons of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were killed. The Sikhs started striking Govind Shahi coins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=S. N.|title=History Modern India|year=2006|publisher=New Age International|isbn=9788122417746|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1765 they took over [[Lahore]] again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grewal|first=Jaspal|title=The Sikhs of the Punjab|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521637640|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1767 when [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] came again he sent messages to the Sikhs for their cooperation. He offered them the governorship of Punjab but was rejected.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 33"/&gt; The Sikhs using repeated guerrilla attacks took away his caravan of 1,000 camels loaded with fruits from Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seetal|first=Sohan|title=Rise of the Sikh Power and Maharaja Ranjeet Singh|year=1971|publisher=Dhanpat Rai|location=The University of Michigan|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs were again in control of the areas between [[Sutlej]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]]. After Abdali’s departure to Kabul, Sikhs crossed the Sutlej and brought Sirhind and other areas right up to Delhi, the entire Punjab under their control.&lt;ref name="Mayel 2006 58"/&gt;

[[Shah Alam II]], the Mughal Emperor of Delhi was staying away in [[Allahabad]], ordered his commander Zabita Khan to fight the Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 33"/&gt; Zabita made a truce with them instead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umar|first=Muhammad|title=Muslim society in northern India during the eighteenth century|year=1998|page=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then was dismissed from Alam’s service.

Qadi Nur Mohammed, who came to Punjab with Ahmad Shah Abdali and was present during many Sikh battles writes about the Sikhs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peace in Amritsar ====
[[File:Red Fort.jpg|thumb|In 1783 the [[Sikh]]s capture the [[Red Fort]], Delhi]]
[[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], fearing the Sikhs, did not follow his normal route through Punjab while he returned to Kabul. Jassa Singh Ahluwalia did not add more areas to his [[Misl]]. Instead, whenever any wealth or villages came into the hands of the Sikhs he distributed them among the [[Jathedar]]s of all the Misls. Ahluwalia passed his last years in [[Amritsar]]. With the resources available to him, he repaired all the buildings, improved the management of the Gurdwaras, and provided better civic facilities to the residents of Amritsar. He wanted every Sikh to take [[Amrit Sanskar|Amrit]] before joining the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahluwalia died in 1783 and was cremated near Amritsar. There is a city block, Katra Ahluwalia, in Amritsar named after him. This block was assigned to his Misl in honor of his having stayed there and protected the city of Amritsar.

=== Jassa Singh Ramgarhia ===
{{Main|Jassa Singh Ramgarhia}}
[[File:BungaTowers.jpg|thumb|[[Ramgarhia Bunga]] built by Jassa Singh Ramgarhia in the late 18th century (year 1755)]]
Jassa Singh Ramgarhia played an active role in Jassa Singh Alhuwalia’s army. He founded the Ramgarhia Misl&lt;ref name="Duggal 2001 46"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duggal|first=Kartar|title=Maharaja Ranjit Singh: The Last to Lay Arms|year=2001|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170174103|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a major role in the battles of the [[Khalsa Panth]]. He suffered about two dozen wounds during the [[Wadda Ghalughara]]. Jassa Singh Ramgarhia was the son of Giani Bhagwan Singh&lt;ref name="Duggal 2001 46"/&gt; and was born in 1723. They lived in the village of Ichogil, near Lahore. His grandfather took [[Amrita|Amrit]] during the lifetime of Guru Gobind Singh,&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined him in many battles; he joined the forces of Banda Singh Bahadur. Ramgarhia was the oldest of five brothers. When Ramgarhia was young he had memorised [[Nitnem]] hymns and took Amrit.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 36"/&gt;

==== Award of an Estate ====
In 1733, Zakaria Khan, the Governor of Punjab, needed help to protect himself from the Iranian invader, [[Nader Shah]]. He offered the Sikhs an estate and a royal robe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markovitz|first=Claude|title=A History of Modern India: 1480 - 1950|year=2002|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781843310044|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs in the name of [[Nawab Kapur Singh|Kapur Singh]] accepted it. After the battle Zakaria Khan gave five villages to the Sikhs in reward for the bravery of Giani Bhagwan Singh, father of Ramgarhia, who died in the battle. Village Vallah was awarded to Ramgarhia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dilagir|first=Harajindar|title=The Sikh Reference Book|year=1997|publisher=Sikh Educational Trust for Sikh University Centre|location=Denmark|isbn=9780969596424|page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Ramgarhia gained the administrative experience required to become a [[Jathedar]] (leader) of the Sikhs.  During this period of peace with the government, the Sikhs built their fort, Ram Rauni, in Amritsar.  Zakaria died in 1745 and [[Mir Mannu]] became the Governor of Lahore.

==== Jassa Singh honored as Jassa Singh Ramgarhia ====

[[Mir Mannu]] (Mu'in ul-Mulk), the Governor of Lahore, was worried about the increasing power of the Sikhs so he broke the peace. Mir Mannu also ordered [[Adina Beg]], the [[Faujdar]] (garrison commander) of the [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]] region, to begin killing the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adina Beg was a very smart politician and wanted the Sikhs to remain involved helping them. In order to develop good relations with the Sikhs, he sent secret messages to them who were living in different places. [[Jassa Singh Ramgarhia]] responded and agreed to cooperate with the Faujdar and was made a Commander.&lt;ref name="H. S. Singha 2000 111"/&gt; This position helped him develop good relations with [[Divan]] Kaura Mal at Lahore and assign important posts to the Sikhs in the [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]] division.

The Governor of Lahore ordered an attack on Ram Rauni to kill the Sikhs staying in that fort. Adina Beg was required to send his army as well and Jassa Singh, being the commander of the Jalandhar forces, had to join the army to kill the Sikhs in the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Surjit|first=Gandhi|title=Struggle of the Sikhs for sovereignty|year=1980|publisher=Gur Das Kapur|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; After about four months of siege, Sikhs ran short of food and supplies in the fort.  He contacted the Sikhs inside the fort and joined them.  Jassa Singh used the offices of Divan Kaura Mal and had the siege lifted.&lt;ref name=Singh_2006_2&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | isbn = 0-19-567747-1 | pages=60}} Also, as according to the Purātan Janamsākhī (the birth stories of Nanak).&lt;/ref&gt; The fort was strengthened and named Ramgarh; Jassa Singh Ramgarhia, having been designated the [[Jathedar]] of the fort, became popular as Ramgarhia.

==== Fighting the tyrannical Government ====
[[Mir Mannu]] intensified his violence and oppression against the Sikhs. There were only 900 Sikhs when he surrounded the Ramgarh fort again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs fought their way out bravely through thousands of army soldiers. The army demolished the fort. The hunt for and torture of the Sikhs continued until Mannu died in 1753. Mannu's death left [[Punjab region|Punjab]] without any effective Governor. It was again an opportune period for the Sikhs to organise themselves and gain strength. [[Jassa Singh Ramgarhia]] rebuilt the fort and took possession of some areas around [[Amritsar]]. The Sikhs took upon themselves the task of protecting the people in the villages from the invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money they obtained from the people was called Rakhi (protection charges). The new Governor, [[Timur Shah Durrani|Taimur]], son of [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]], despised the Sikhs. In 1757, he again forced the Sikhs to vacate the fort and move to their hiding places. The fort was demolished, [[Harmandir Sahib]] was blown up, and [[Amrita|Amrit]] Sarovar was filled with debris.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The Governor decided to replace [[Adina Beg]]. Beg asked the Sikhs for help and they both got a chance to weaken their common enemy. Adina Beg won the battle and became the Governor of Punjab. Sikhs rebuilt their fort Ramgarh and repaired the Harmandir Sahib. Beg was well acquainted with the strength of the Sikhs and he feared they would oust him if he allowed them to grow stronger, so he led a strong army to demolish the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=Jaswant|title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India: 1707 - 1813|year=2005|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9781932705546|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; After fighting valiantly, the Sikhs decided to leave the fort. Adina Beg died in 1758.

==== Ramgarhia Misl Estate ====
[[File:Jodhsinghr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jodh Singh Ramgarhia]] the son of [[Jassa Singh Ramgarhia]]]]

[[Jassa Singh Ramgarhia]] occupied the area to the north of Amritsar between the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and the [[Beas River|Beas]] rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Punjab District Gazetteers: Supplement|year=1980|publisher=Controller of Print. and Stationery|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBRuAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also added the [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]] region and [[Kangra district|Kangra]] hill areas to his estate. He had his capital in [[Sri Hargobindpur]], a town founded by the sixth Guru. The large size of Ramgarhia's territory aroused the jealousy of the other Sikh [[Misl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflicts between Misls ====
A conflict between [[Kanhaiya Misl|Jai Singh Kanhaiya]] and Jassa Singh Ramgarhia developed and the [[Bhangi Misl]] sardars also developed differences with Jai Singh Kanhaiya. A big battle was fought between Jai Singh, [[Charat Singh]], and Jassa Singh Ahluwalia on one side and Bhangis, Ramgarhias and their associates on the other side. The Bhangi side lost the battle.

Later, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, one day while hunting, happened to enter Ramgarhia territory where Jassa Singh Ramgarhia's brother arrested him. Ramgarhia apologised for the misbehaviour of his brother, and returned Ahluwalia with gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhavan|first=Purnima|title=When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199756551|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mutual Misl wars ====

Due to mutual jealousies, fights continued among the Sikh [[Sardar]]s. In 1776, the [[Bhangi Misl|Bhangis]] changed sides and joined Jai Singh Kanhaiya to defeat Jassa Singh Ramgarhia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=R. N.|title=Historical Development of Sikhism: Religion to Politics|year=2003|publisher=Commonwealth Publishers|isbn=9788171697038|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; His capital at [[Sri Hargobindpur]] was taken over and he was followed from village to village,&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally forced to vacate all his territory. He had to cross the river [[Sutlej]] and go to [[Maharaja of Patiala|Amar Singh]], the ruler of [[Patiala]]. Maharaja Amar Singh welcomed Ramgarhia and who then occupied the areas of Hansi and Hissar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Punjab District Gazetteers: Supplement|year=1980|publisher=Controller of Print. and Stationery|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBRuAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually Ramgarhia handed over to his son, [[Jodh Singh Ramgarhia]].

Maharaja Amar Singh and Ramgarhia took control of the villages on the west and north of Delhi, now forming parts of [[Haryana]] and Western [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The Sikhs disciplined and brought to justice all the Nawabs who were harassing their non-Muslim population. Jassa Singh Ramgarhia entered Delhi in 1783. [[Shah Alam II]], the Mughal emperor, extended the Sikhs a warm welcome.&lt;ref name="Singh 1927 41"/&gt; Ramgarhia left Delhi after receiving gifts from him. Because of the differences arising out of the issue of dividing the [[Jammu district|Jammu state]] revenues, long time friends and neighbors [[Maha Singh]], [[Jathedar]] of [[Sukerchakia Misl]] and [[Jai Singh Kanheya|Jai Singh]], Jathedar of the [[Kanheya Misl]], became enemies. This resulted in a war which changed the course of Sikh history. Maha Singh requested Ramgarhia to help him. In the battle, Jai Singh lost his son, Gurbalchsh Singh, while fighting with [[Ramgarhia]]s.

==Sikhs captured Delhi==
{{see also|Sikh Occupation of Delhi and Red Fort}}
After continuous raids, Sikhs under  [[Baghel Singh]] defeated the mughals on 11 March 1783, captured Delhi and hoisted Sikh flag ([[Nishan Sahib]]) in Red Fort.

=== The creation of the United Misl ===

[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|right|150px|thumb|[[Maharaja]] [[Ranjit Singh]]]]

[[Jai Singh Kanheya]]’s widowed daughter-in-law, [[Sada Kaur]], though very young, was a great statesperson.  Sada Kaur saw the end of the Khalsa power through such mutual battles but she was able to convince [[Maha Singh]] to adopt the path of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dogra|first=R. C.|title=Encyclopaedia of Sikh Religion and Culture|year=1995|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=9780706983685|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this she offered the hand of her daughter, then only a child, to his son, [[Ranjit Singh]] (later the Maharaja of the Punjab), who was then just a boy. The balance of power shifted in favour of this united [[Misl]]. This made Ranjit Singh the leader of the most powerful union of the Misls.

When the Afghan invader, [[Zaman Shah Durrani]], came in 1788 the Sikhs, however, were still divided. [[Ramgarhia]] and [[Bhangi Misl]]s were not willing to help Ranjit Singh to fight the invader, so the Afghans took over Lahore and looted it. Ranjit Singh occupied Lahore in 1799&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilana|first=Rajwant|title=International Bibliography of Sikh Studies|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402030437|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still the Ramgarhias and Bhangis did not accept him as the leader of all the Sikhs. They got the support of their friends and marched to Lahore to challenge Ranjit Singh. When the Bhangi leader died Jassa Singh Ramgarhia returned to his territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurbaksh|title=The Khalsa Generals|year=1927|publisher=Canadian Sikh Study &amp; Teaching Society|isbn=0969409249|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ramgarhia was eighty years old when he died in 1803. His son, [[Jodh Singh Ramgarhia]], developed good relations with Ranjit Singh and they never fought again.

==Sikh Empire==
{{Main|Sikh Empire}}

[[Ranjit Singh]] was crowned on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with [[Baisakhi]]). Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of [[Guru Nanak Dev]], conducted the coronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhcybermuseum.org.uk/People/ranjitmaharaja.htm |title="Ranjit Singh, Maharaja", Sikh Cyber Museum |publisher=Sikhcybermuseum.org.uk |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070815130616/http://www.sikhcybermuseum.org.uk/People/ranjitmaharaja.htm |archivedate=15 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gujranwala]] served as his capital from 1799. In 1802 he shifted his capital to Lahore and Amritsar.  Ranjit Singh rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single Sikh misl to finally becoming the Maharaja (Emperor) of Punjab.

===Formation===

The Sikh Empire (from 1801–1849) was formed on the foundations of the Punjabi Army by [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. The Empire extended from [[Khyber Pass]] in the west, to [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir|Kashmir]] in the north, to [[Sindh]] in the south, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] in the east.  The main geographical footprint of the empire was the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The religious [[demography]] of the Sikh Empire was [[Islam|Muslim]] (80%),  [[Sikhism|Sikh]] (10%), [[Hinduism|Hindu]] (10%),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/IDE822/ |title=Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign |author=K.S. Duggal |isbn=8170172446 |publisher=Exoticindiaart.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of the Sikh Empire, during the Punjab Army, could be defined as early as 1707, starting from the death of [[Aurangzeb]] and the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]]. After fighting off local Mughal remnants and allied Rajput leaders, Afghans, and occasionally hostile Punjabi Muslims who sided with other Muslim forces the fall of the Mughal Empire provided opportunities for the army, known as the [[Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)|Dal Khalsa]], to lead expeditions against the [[Mughals]] and [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghans]]. This led to a growth of the army, which was split into different Punjabi Armies and then semi-independent misls. Each of these component armies were known as a [[misl]], each controlling different areas and cities. However, in the period from 1762-1799 [[Sikh]] rulers of their misls appeared to be coming into their own. The formal start of the Sikh Empire began with the disbandment of the [[Punjab Army]] by the time of Coronation of [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1801, creating the one unified political Empire. All the misldars who were affiliated with the Army were nobility with usually long and prestigious family histories in Punjab's history.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition 1911 Page 892"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, (Edition: Volume V22, Date: 1910-1911), Page 892.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PYR_RAY/RANJIT_SINGH_MAHARAJA_178o_1839.html |title=MAHARAJAH RANJIT SINGH ... – Online Information article about MAHARAJA RANJIT SINGH |publisher=Encyclopedia.jrank.org |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punjab flourishes in education and arts ===

The Sikh rulers were very tolerant of other religions; and arts, painting and writings flourished in Punjab. In [[Lahore]] alone there were 18 formal schools for girls besides specialist schools for technical training, languages, mathematics and logic, let alone specialised schools for the three major religions, they being [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name="Sheikh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheikh|first=Majid|title=Destruction of schools as Leitner saw them|url=http://dawn.com/2010/10/31/destruction-of-schools-as-leitner-saw-them/|work=Dawn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were craft schools specialising in [[Persian miniature|miniature painting]], [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[architecture]], and [[calligraphy]]. There wasn't a [[mosque]], a [[temple]], a [[Dharamshala (type of building)|dharmsala]] that had not a school attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allender|first=Tim|title=Ruling Through Education: The Politics of Schooling in the Colonial Punjab|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

In Lahore, Schools opened from 7am and closed at midday. In no case was a class allowed to exceed 50 pupils.&lt;ref name="Leitner 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitner|first=Gottlieb|title=History of Indigenous Education in the Panjab: Since Annexation and in 1882|year=2002|publisher=Sang-e-Meel|isbn=9789693513127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khalsa Army ===

{{Main|Sikh Khalsa Army}}
[[File:Sikh Armour and weapons.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh]] Armour and weapons]]

The Sikh Fauj-i-Ain (regular army) consisted of roughly 71,000 men and consisted of [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stronge|first=Susan|title=The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms|year=1999|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|isbn=1851772618|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh employed [[List of generals of Ranjit Singh|generals]] and soldiers from many countries including Russia, Italy, France, and America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

There was strong collaboration in defense against foreign incursions such as those initiated by [[Shah Zaman]] and [[Timur Shah Durrani]]. The city of [[Amritsar]] was attacked numerous times. Yet the time is remembered by Sikh historians as the "Heroic Century". This is mainly to describe the rise of Sikhs to political power against large odds. The circumstances were hostile religious environment against Sikhs, a tiny Sikh population compared to other religious and political powers, which were much larger in the region than the Sikhs.

=== Conquests ===

In 1834 the [[Khalsa]] under [[Nau Nihal Singh]], [[Hari Singh Nalwa]],  [[Jean-Baptiste Ventura]], and [[Claude August Court]] conquered [[Peshawar]] and extended the Sikh Raj up to [[Jamrud]],  [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chhabra|first=G.

===End of empire===

[[File:India1765and1805b.jpg|thumb|Map showing expansion of Sikh empire from 1765 to 1805]]
After [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s death in 1839, the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement.  This opportunity was used by the [[British Empire]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]]. The [[Battle of Ferozeshah]] in 1845 marked many turning points, the British encountered the Punjabi Army, opening with a gun-duel in which the Sikhs "had the better of the British artillery".  But as the British made advancements, Europeans in their army were especially targeted, as the Sikhs believed if the army "became demoralised, the backbone of the enemy's position would be broken".&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Singh: administration and British policy, (Prakash, p.31-33)&lt;/ref&gt;  The fighting continued throughout the night earning the nickname "night of terrors".  The British position "grew graver as the night wore on", and "suffered terrible casualties with every single member of the Governor General's staff either killed or wounded".&lt;ref name="Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137"&gt;Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the last to lay arms, (Duggal, p.136-137)&lt;/ref&gt;

British General Sire [[James Hope Grant]] recorded: "Truly the night was one of gloom and forbidding and perhaps never in the annals of warfare has a British Army on such a large scale been nearer to a defeat which would have involved annihilation"&lt;ref name="Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137"/&gt; The Punjabi ended up recovering their camp, and the British were exhausted.  Lord Hardinge sent his son to Mudki with a sword from his Napoleonic campaigns.  A note in [[Robert Needham Cust]]'s diary revealed that the "British generals decided to lay down arms: News came from the Governor General that our attack of yesterday had failed, that affairs were disparate, all state papers were to be destroyed, and that if the morning attack failed all would be over, this was kept secret by Mr. Currie and we were considering measures to make an unconditional surrender to save the wounded...".&lt;ref name="Maharaja Ranjit Singh p.136-137"/&gt;

However, a series of events of the Sikhs being betrayed by some prominent leaders in the army led to its downfall. [[Maharaja]] [[Gulab Singh]] and Dhian Singh, were Hindu [[Dogra]]s from [[Jammu]], and top Generals of the army. [[Tej Singh]] and [[Lal Singh]] were secretly allied to the British.  They supplied important war plans of the Army, and provided the British with updated vital intelligence on the Army dealings, which ended up changing the scope of the war and benefiting the British positions.&lt;ref name="Grewal"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sikhs of the Punjab|last=Grewal |first=J. S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the last to lay arms, (Duggal, p.136-138)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of ferozeshah(H Martens).jpg|thumb|The [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], 1845-46]]
The Punjab Empire was finally dissolved after a series of wars with the British at the end of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849 into separate [[princely states]], and the British province of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] that where granted a statehood, and eventually a lieutenant governorship stationed in Lahore as a direct representative of the Royal Crown in London.

=== Punjab under British Raj ===
[[File:Punjab 1903.gif|thumbnail|[[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]] in 1903]]

==== Impact on Punjabi education ====
Every village in the [[Punjab, British India|Punjab]], through the [[Tehsildar]] (taxman), had an ample supply of the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] ''qaida'' (beginners book), which was compulsory for females and thus, almost every Punjabi woman was literate in the sense that she could read and write the ''lundee'' form of [[Gurmukhi]].&lt;ref name="Leitner 2002"/&gt;

In the carnage of revenge that followed 1857, the [[British Raj]] made it a special effort to search every house of a village and to burn every book.&lt;ref name="Sheikh"/&gt; Even in the secular schools of Lahore which used Persian or ''lundee'' Gurmukhi which was given by guru angad dev ji, as the medium of instruction, books formed the major bonfire than the British troops 'cleansed' the region.

==== Sikhs in the British military ====
Under the [[East India Company]] and then British colonial rule from 1858 Sikhs were feared and respected for their martial ability. After they played a key role in the suppression of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian 'Mutiny' of 1857-8]]. Sikhs were increasingly incorporated into the Indian army because they were not only seen as 'loyal', but because the British believed that they were a 'martial race' whose religious traditions and popular customs made them skilled fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cArhKfrY_IoC |last=Ballantyne |first=Tony |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780822388111 |pages=229 |title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sikhs again were honoured in the [[Battle of Saragarhi]] where twenty-one Sikhs of the 4th Battalion (then 36th Sikhs) of the [[Sikh Regiment]] of British India, died defending an army post from 10,000 Afghan and Orakzai tribesmen in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Gautam|title=Valour and Sacrifice: Famous Regiments of the Indian Army|year=1990|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788170231400|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Singh Sabha ====

In 1873 and 1879 the First and Second Singh Sabha was founded, the Sikh leaders of the [[Singh Sabha Movement|Singh Sabha]] worked to offer a clear definition of Sikh identity and tried to purify Sikh belief and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NKC9g2ayJEC&amp;dq |last=Oberoi |first=Harjot |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1994 |isbn=9780226615929 |pages=494 |title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cultural infrastructure and Gurdwara management ====
[[File:KhalsaCollegeAmritsar-2.jpg|130px|thumbnail|[[Khalsa College, Amritsar|Khalsa College]], Amritsar]]
In 1882 The first Punjab university, [[University of the Punjab]], was founded at [[Lahore]]. In 1892 the [[Khalsa College, Amritsar|Khalsa College]] was founded in [[Amritsar]]. In 1907 The [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] is established in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. In 1911 The first [[Gurdwara]] is established in London. In 1912 the First Gurdwara in United States was established in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansra|first=Harkirat|title=Liberty at Stake: Sikhs: The Most Visible, Yet Misunderstood, Minority of America|year=2007|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595432226|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==== Settlement outside Punjab ====
In the late 1800s and early 1900s Punjabi and Sikhs began to immigrate to [[East Africa]], the [[Far East]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Contemporary period (1914 – present)==
[[File:Anti-aircraft BrenGun.jpg|thumb|left|A Sikh in [[World War II]]]]

=== Sikhs in the World Wars ===

In two world wars 83,005 Sikh soldiers were killed and 109,045 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spencer|first=Bob|title=Sanity and Solitude: Cogent Ramblings of a Lone Aesthetic|year=2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477234679|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh soldiers died or were wounded for the freedom of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the world and during shell fire, with no other protection but their [[turban]] (a symbol of the Sikh faith).&lt;ref name="Sikh Soldiers In World Wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhspectrum.com/122002/soldiers_ww.htm |title=Sikh Soldiers In World Wars |last=Singh |first=Vicky |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021204082813/http://www.sikhspectrum.com/122002/soldiers_ww.htm |archivedate=4 December 2002 |accessdate=2013-09-18 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At offset of [[World War I]], Sikh military personnel numbered around 35,000 men of the 161,000 troops, which is around 22% of the [[British Armed Forces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sidhu|first=Dawinder|title=Civil Rights in Wartime: The Post-9/11 Sikh Experience|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409496915|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the Sikhs only made up less than 2% of the total population in India. Sikhs, before and after this were, and are, well known for their martial skills, freedom in speaking their minds, and their daredevil courage.&lt;ref name="Sikh Soldiers In World Wars"/&gt;

==== Sikh Soldiers in World War I ====
During World War I thousands of Sikhs from India fought alongside with Britain and many sacrificed their lives for the greater cause. The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst honored Sikhs by featured a re-enacting by 36 Sikh volunteers. Kameldeep Singh Samra, from Birmingham talked and emphasized the importance of Sikhs in British Army who fought defending the British Empire against its enemies

=== Early modern Sikh developments ===

In 1920 The [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali Party]] is established to free gurdwaras from corrupt masands (treasurers), and the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SPGC) is founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Mohinder|title=The Akali Movement|year=2007|publisher=National Institute of Panjab Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 [[Tara Singh (activist)#Gurdwara Act of 1925|The Punjab Sikh Gurdwaras Act]] is passed, which transfers control of the Punjab's historic gurdwaras to the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannum|first=Hurst|title=Autonomy, Sovereignty, and Self-Determination: The Accommodation of Conflicting Rights|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812202182|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikh Struggles in British India ===

==== Jallianwala Bagh massacre ====

==== Saka Panja Sahib ====

A non-violent agitation to assert the right to felling trees for Guru ka [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] from the land attached to [[Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh]] was underway. The first Sikh volunteers were arrested and tried for trespass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Harbans|title=The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism: S-Z|year=1998|publisher=Publications Bureau|isbn=9788173805301|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from 25 August police resorted to beating day after day the batches of Sikhs that came. eventually the beating stopped and the procedure of arrests resumed with jail time of about two and a half years and a fine of one hundred rupees each.

One such train left [[Amritsar]] on 29 October 1922 for the [[Attock Fort]] which would touch [[Hasan Abdal]] the following morning. The Sikhs of Panja Sahib decided to serve a meal to the detenues but when they reached the railway station with the food they were informed by the station master that the train was not scheduled to halt there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohli|first=M. S.|title=Miracles of Ardaas: Incredible Adventures and Survivals|year=2003|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173871528|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Sikhs, Bhai Pratap Singh and Bhai Karam Singh who were leading the [[Sangat (term)|sangat]] went forward as the rumbling sound of the approaching train was heard and sat crosslegged in the middle of the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakshi|first=Ram|title=Parkash Singh Badal: Chief Minister of Punjab|year=1998|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788170249870|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several others, men and women, followed suit.

The Sikhs served the Singhs in the train and then turned to the injured. The worst mauled were Bhai Pratap Singh and Bhai Karam Singh, who succumbed to their injuries the following day.

[[Sohan Singh Bhakna]], [[Kartar Singh Sarabha]], alongside many other Punjabi's founded the [[Ghadar party]] to overthrow British colonial authority in India by means of an armed revolution. The Ghadar party is closely associated with the [[Babbar Akali Movement]], a 1921 splinter group of "militant" Sikhs who broke away from the mainstream non-violent [[Akali movement]].

In 1914 [[Baba Gurdit Singh]] led the [[Komagata Maru]] ship to the port of Vancouver with 346 Sikhs on board; forced to leave port on 23 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pannu|first=Mohinder|title=Partners of British Rule|year=2006|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788177648683|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bela Singh Jain an informer and agent of Inspector [[W.

He murdered Bhai Bhag Singh, President of the Society and Battan Singh and Bela Singh was charged with murder, but Hopkinson decided to appear as a witness in his case and made up much of his testimony at his trail and subsequently Bela Singh was acquitted. On 21 October 1914, Bhai Mewa Singh, [[Granthi]] of Khalsa Diwan Society shot William Hopkinson in the Assize court corridor with two revolvers because he believed him to be unscrupulous and corrupt, using informers to spy on Indian immigrants.

As a reaction against these actions came the emergence of the Sikh leader [[Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] who vocalised Sikh sentiment for justice.

The statistics for '''Islam in Honduras''' estimate a total [[Muslim]] population of 5,000- 6,000 representing 0.1 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center,
''Mapping the Global Muslim Population. A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Muslim Population'', October 2009, p. 33 [http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no official statistics, it is estimated that between 150,000-200,000 of the country's eight million inhabitants are of Arab descent, and of these, the great majority are [[Palestinian Arab]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luxner|first1=Larry|title=The Arabs of Honduras|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200104/the.arabs.of.honduras.htm|work=Saudi Aramco World|date=July–August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of these Arabs are of Orthodox and Catholic Christian descent. No other country in the Western Hemisphere has a higher proportion of Arab immigrants and, in absolute numbers, Honduras ranks seventh after the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Canada and [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Arabs of Honduras'', Luxner, L., JA 01: 34-37&lt;/ref&gt; There are two known Islamic organizations in [[Honduras]], including the Centro Islámico de Honduras in [[San Pedro Sula]] led by Yusuf Amdani, and the Comunidad Islámica de Honduras in [[Cortés, Honduras|Cortés]].

==Background==
Honduras received its first Arab immigrant in 1896, and by 1918, according to a local survey, Arab immigrants were largely Palestinian Christians in [[San Pedro Sula]], the country's second-largest city. They immigrated due to the Ottoman control of Palestine, where Arabs fled with Ottoman passports gaining their commonly known nickname, Turkish (''Turcos''). Immigration picked up again after [[World War II]] and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. In 1984, an Islamic charitable organization was founded, with the main object of taking care of the interests of the Arabs and Muslims in the country, and they have since built a mosque, where they meet and discuss their social and religious affairs, including the education of their children, the most important of which is teaching them the [[Qur’an]] and the Arabic language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicpopulation.com/honduras_muslim.html Muslim Population&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513234729/http://www.islamicpopulation.com/honduras_muslim.html |date=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics and geography==
Popular opinion seems to hold that a vast majority of the country's [[Muslim]]s are found in the Thailand's four southernmost provinces of [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Pattani Province|Pattani]] and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]], where they make up majority of the population.&lt;ref name="Royal Thai Embassy, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim in Thailand|url=http://www.thaiembassy.org/riyadh/en/organize|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Thai [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]' research indicates that only 18 percent of Thai Muslims live in those three provinces. The rest are scattered throughout Thailand, with the largest concentrations being in [[Bangkok]] and throughout the southern region.

According to the National Statistics Office, in 2005, Muslims in [[southern Thailand]] made up 30.4 percent of the general population above the age 15, while less than three percent in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="service.nso.go.th"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service.nso.go.th/nso/nsopublish/service/survey/cult48.pdf |title=สรุปผลการสํารวจการเข??ารวมก ?? จกรรมทางว ิ ัฒนธรรม พ.ศ. 2548 |publisher=Service.nso.go.th |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[early modern history|early modern]] Thailand, Muslims from the [[Coromandel Coast]] served as eunuchs in the Thai palace and court.&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 73  {{Google books|BFXpi5ZKKF8C|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peletz (2009), p. 73  {{Google books|-YnQJXxspJUC|Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and identity==
[[File:Baan Haw Mosque 4-6-09.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Ban Ho Mosque]] of the [[Chin Haw]].]]

Thailand's Muslim population is diverse, with ethnic groups having migrated from as far as [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]], as well as including [[Thai people|ethnic Thais]], while about two-thirds of Muslims in Thailand are [[Thai Malays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0052) |title=Thailand |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Thai===
Many Thai Muslims are ethnically and linguistically Thai, who are either hereditary Muslims, Muslims by intermarriage, or recent converts to the faith. Ethnic Thai Muslims live mainly in the central and southern provinces - varying from entire Muslim communities to mixed settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gilquin| first = Michel| title = The Muslims of Thailand| publisher = IRASEC (Silkworm Books)| year = 2002| isbn = 974-9575-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former Commander-in-Chief of the [[Royal Thai Army]] General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]] is an example of an indigenous Thai Muslim. Sonthi is of remote Persian ancestry. His ancestor, Sheikh Ahmad of [[Qom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tnews.teenee.com/politic/15433.html |title=ŕ¸Šŕ¸ľŕ¸§ŕ¸´ŕ¸•ŕš ŕ¸Ľŕ¸°ŕ¸œŕ¸Ľŕ¸‡ŕ¸˛ŕ¸™ŕ¸šŕ¸´ŕšŠŕ¸ ŕ¸šŕ¸ąŕ¸‡ : ŕ¸‚ŕšˆŕ¸˛ŕ¸§ŕ¸ ŕ¸˛ŕ¸Łŕš€ŕ¸Ąŕ¸ˇŕ¸ŕ¸‡ |publisher=Tnews.teenee.com |date= |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siammedia.org/news/thailand/20070913_01.php |title=Siam Media News - ÊÂÒÁÁÕà´ÕÂ ¹ÔÇÊì |publisher=Siammedia.org |date= |accessdate=2 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011621/http://siammedia.org/news/thailand/20070913_01.php |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Iran]]ian expatriate trader who lived in the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] for 26 years.

[[Sri Sulalai]] was a princess of the royal family of the [[Sultanate of Singora]]. [[Rama II of Siam]] took her as a concubine.

In 1946 Prince [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and [[Ananda Mahidol]], Rama VIII, toured the [[Tonson Mosque]].&lt;ref name="Hamburger"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Hamburger|title=Klongs-Thai Waterways &amp; Reflections of Her People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qjZIvLtlFEC&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Booksmango|isbn=978-616-245-033-4|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay Muslims===
{{further|Thai Malays}}
In the three southernmost border provinces, the vast majority of the local Muslim population is predominantly Malay, amounting to about 80 percent of the region's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand's southern insurgency: No end in sight|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21684829-southern-village-tries-remain-united-divisions-elsewhere-grow-no-end-sight|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai Malays speak [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]], which is in a different language family entirely than the [[Thai language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091005204302/http://www.bangkokpost.com/220708_News/22Jul2008_news006.php|title=Bangkok Post - General news - Yawi-Thai dictionary brings ray of hope|author=|date=|website=arquivo.pt|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adds to the culturally unique identity of Thai Malay Muslims.

The high number of Malay origin inhabitants in the southern region is due the historical nature of the area, which was once known as the [[Pattani Kingdom]], an Islamic Malay kingdom established in the 19th century, but later annexed to Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=1292]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429015231/http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=1292 |date=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is an ethnic Thai minority in northern Malaysia.

===Chinese Muslims===

[[File:Khao soi nuea Fueng Fah.jpg|thumb|''[[Khao soi]]'' at a [[Chin Haw]] restaurant in [[Chiang Mai]]]]

In the far north, as well as in select central and southern urban areas, there are pockets of Thai Muslims of [[Hui people|Hui]] (ethnic Chinese Muslim) origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khondoi.com/thai/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=87 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220130034/http://khondoi.com/thai/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=87 |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EmberEmber2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melvin Ember|author2=Carol R.

Some historians believe that the name Chin Haw can be explained to be a combination of "Chin" (China) and "Ho" (Hui). The Chin Haw thus can be seen as traders and émigrés who carried with them Hui traditions from China. One of the best known Chinese mosques is [[Ban Ho Mosque]] in [[Chiang Mai Province]].

===Muslim groups===
Ethnic groups such as the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] are refugees who are scattered throughout Thailand's refugee camps, rural fishing villages, as well as in many small towns and cities close to the [[Myanmar]] border. 

Northern Thailand, as well as being home to many Chinese Muslims, also is home to many Burmese, and mixed Chinese-Burmese or [[Burmese people in Pakistan|Pakistani-Burmese]] peoples.

===Other Asian Muslim groups===
:''See also: [[Pakistanis in Thailand]]''

Other represented groups include Muslim [[Chams]], originally from [[Cambodia]], who can be found between the mutual border and [[Bangkok]] as well as the deep south. In the 1700s and 1800s Cambodia-based Chams settled in Bangkok.&lt;ref name="Brown2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Rajeswary Ampalavanar|title=Islam in Modern Thailand: Faith, Philanthropy and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQkiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-58389-8|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups include South Asians (especially [[Indians in Thailand|Indians]], [[Pakistanis in Thailand|Pakistanis]] and Bangladeshis) and  [[Indonesia]]n Muslims, especially [[Bugis]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]].

According to a 1685 account of a Persian diplomat as well as notes of the French traveller [[Guy Tachard]], there was a substantial Persian [[Shia Islam|Shi'i]] community in Thailand at the time, with ritual ''[[ta'zieh]]'' performances subsidised by the king.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/sup/Safine_ye_Solaymani.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514084119/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/sup/Safine_ye_Solaymani.html |date=14 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctiveness of Thai Islam==
Generally there is a small circle of theologically trained believers of the Islamic faith in Thailand and large general Muslim masses which follow certain customs and traditions associated with traditional [[Islam]] influenced by [[Sufism]].

For Thai Muslims, like their co-coreligionists in Southeast Asia's other Buddhist-majority countries, [[Mawlid]] is a symbolic reminder of the historical presence of Islam in the country. It is also represents an annual opportunity to reaffirm Muslims' status as Thai citizens and their allegiance to the monarchy.&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Celebrating-the-Prophet-Muhammads-birthday-in-Thai-30255466.html|title=Celebrating the Prophet Muhammad's birthday in Thailand  - The Nation|author=|date=|website=nationmultimedia.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic faith in Thailand, is integrated with [[Sufi]] beliefs and practices, as in other Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia. The Ministry of Culture's Islamic Department gives awards to Muslims who have contributed to the promotion and development of Thai life in their roles as citizens, as educators and as social workers. In Bangkok, the Ngarn Mawlid Klang main festival is a vibrant showcase for the Thai Muslim community and their lifestyles.&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://malaysiandigest.com/opinion/484043-celebrating-mawlid-maulidur-rasul.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of worship==
According to the National Statistics Office of Thailand in 2007, the country had 3494 mosques, with the largest number, 636, in [[Pattani Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iqraforum.com/forum2/index.php?topic=30.0 |accessdate=10 March 2009|title=Mosques }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Religious Affairs Department (RAD), 99 percent of the mosques are associated with Sunni Islam with the remaining one percent Shi'i Islam.

==Governance and education==

{{anchor|Chularatchamontri}}&lt;!-- [[Chularatchamontri]] redirects here--&gt;'''Chularatchamontri''' (จุฬาราชมนตรี) is the title of [[Shaykh al-Islām]] in Thailand. The title was first used in the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] when King [[Songtham]] (1611–1628) appointed [[Bunnag#Sheikh Ahmad|Sheikh Ahmad]] to the office. Pursuant to the current Islamic Organ Administration Act, BE 2540 (1997), Chularatchamontri is appointed by the king upon advice of the prime minister. He has the authority to administer all Islamic affairs in the nation and to provide advice on Islamic affairs to governmental agencies. Chularatchamontri vacates his office upon death, resignation and removal by the king upon the advice of the prime minister.

There is also a '''Central Islamic Council of Thailand''' (คณะกรรมการกลางอิสลามแห่งประเทศไทย) (CICOT) (กอท.), consisting of at least five councillors appointed by the king. The CICOT advises the Minister of Education and the Minister of Interior on Islamic matters. Its presiding officer is Chularatchamontri. Provincial Islamic Councils (คณะกรรมการอิสลามประจำจังหวัด) exist in the provinces that had substantial Muslim minorities. There are other links between the government and the Muslim community, including government financial assistance to Islamic education institutions, assistance with construction of some of the larger mosques, and the funding of pilgrimages by Thai Muslims to [[Mecca]], both [[Bangkok]] and [[Hat Yai]] being primary gateway cities.

Thailand also maintains several hundred Islamic schools at the primary and secondary levels, as well as Islamic banks, including the [[Islamic Bank of Thailand]], shops and other institutions. Much of Thailand's packaged food is tested and labelled [[halal]] if applicable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15312">'''Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages''' were texts written to protect and dissuade Jewish communities from [[Proselytization and counter-proselytization of Jews#Christian_missions|conversion to Christianity]], or more [[Proselytization_and_counter-proselytization_of_Jews#Muslim_missions|rarely to Islam]]. The terms [[polemic]]s (from "battles") and [[apologetic]]s (from "defence") may be distinguished&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chazan ''Fashioning Jewish identity in medieval western Christendom'' Page 7 2004 "I have used the term “polemics” broadly, not distinguishing between defensive thrusts, sometimes identified as apologetic, and attacks on the opposing faith. With regard to the distinction between those works intended for insiders and those for outsiders, I also use the inclusive term polemics, although I sometimes tend to call the latter missionizing or proselytizing works."&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be considered somewhat subjective.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'' Page 60 ed. Adele Berlin, Maxine Grossman - 2011 "Jewish apologetics is less “apologetic” than the term indicates. Occasionally, too, Jews have gone on the attack."&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller number of proselytizing text also exists intended to convert Christians, or more rarely Muslims, to Judaism.

==Under the pre-Christian and Christianizing Roman Empire==
Defences of Judaism to Greek, Egyptian and Roman religionists are found in [[Philo]]'s ''Apology on behalf of the Jews'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Judaism'' ed. Geoffrey Wigoder - 1989 p68 "APOLOGETICS AND POLEMICS ... when Jewish writers sought to defend Judaism against the criticisms of Hellenism and paganism. Two noted works were Philo's Apology on behalf of the Jews and Against Apion by the historian Josephus, who vindicated the Jewish "&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephus]]' ''[[Against Apion]]'' as well as other [[Hellenistic Jewish]] authors.&lt;ref&gt;''Josephus' Contra Apionem: studies in its character and context'' Page 143 Louis H. Feldman, John R. Levison - 1996 [[Aryeh Kasher]] ''POLEMIC AND APOLOGETIC METHODS OF WRITING IN CONTRA APIONEM'' Tel-Aviv University. "Introductory words on the nature of polemics and apologetics - Josephus, admittedly, was not the first of the Jewish apologeticists"&lt;/ref&gt; In the early centuries following the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|emergence of Christianity from Judaism]], but before [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianity's establishment as state religion by Constantine]], mutual Jewish-Christian debate, polemics and apologetics occurred as for example in the words of [[Rabbi Tarfon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Essential papers on Judaism and Christianity in conflict: from Late Antiquity to the Reformation'' ed. Jeremy Cohen Page 448  1991 "Further, R. Tarfon regards these Jewish Christians as worse than idolaters; for while a pagan might embrace the new faith, it was a great source of frustration that Jews, raised in the traditions of Judaism, would have done so as .."&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the other side, [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]],'' and the lost [[Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus]] (2nd century), and the later [[Dialogue of Athanasius and Zacchaeus]] (4th century), [[Dialogue of Simon and Theophilus]] (5th century), and [[Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila]] (6th century).

==Middle Ages==
The [[Middle Ages]] is generally counted as covering Europe from the 5th to 15th centuries.

===Under Islam===
During the Middle Ages many polemical texts originated outside Catholic Europe in lands where Jews and Christians were on an even footing as subjects of [[Islam]]. Among the oldest anti-Christian texts with polemic intent is the ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]'' "Life of Jesus" (7th century), although this does not follow the reasoned format of argument found in a true polemic or apologetic work. The earliest true polemic is the ''[[Nestor the priest|Sefer Nestor Ha-Komer]]'' "The Book of Nestor the Priest" (c. 600 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Joel E. Rembaum, The Influence of "Sefer Nestor Hakomer" on Medieval Jewish Polemics, in: Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 45, (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The book represents itself as the arguments for Judaism of a former Christian (possibly [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]) priest.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Lasker, "Jewish-Christian Polemics at the Turning Point: Jewish Evidence from the Twelfth Century", in: ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol. 89, No. 2 (Apr., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The need for apologetics emerged as national boundaries were in flux.&lt;ref&gt;''Cursing the Christians?: A History of the [[Birkat Haminim]]'' Page 66 Ruth Langer - 2011 "These commonalities extend as well to the rabbinic discussions about the prayer and to many elements of the Christian polemics and Jewish apologetics that emerge in the late medieval world, particularly as national boundaries become ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saadia]]'s ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Kitab al-Amanat wal-I'tikadat]]'' "Book of Belief and Opinions" (933) includes refutations of the [[Holy Trinity|Christian Trinity]], and more restrainedly against [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]]'s arguments against the Jewish scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Frank ''The Jews of medieval Islam: community, society, and identity'' 1995 [[Institute of Jewish Studies]] (London, England) page 176 "... obvious reluctance to polemicize against other Islamic tenets while exercising no such restraint vis-a-vis Christianity, it would seem that the discussion of naskh should be seen in the context of Saadya's anti-Christian polemic."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cairo Genizah]] fragments include polemics against [[Samaritan]]s, Christianity, and Islam, as well as Jewish sects, from the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' Volume 3 [[Cecil Roth]] 1972 "Fragments from the Cairo Genizah attest to the polemics directed in this period against the Samaritans, Christianity, and Islam, as well as Jewish schismatic sects, apparently from the beginning of the tenth century" cites J. Mann, Genizah Fragments of the Palestinian Order of Service (HUCA, 1925).&lt;/ref&gt; Both Jews and Christians under Islam were careful in criticism of, or proselytizing to, their host's religion, in response to Muslim proselytzing of Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;''Religious apologetics - philosophical argumentation'' Yossef Schwartz, Volkhard Krech 2004 Page 240 "At the same time, however, the Qur'an defined for the Muslim polemist the areas of polemical activity, which differed for Judaism and for Christianity. In general, the disagreement with Judaism was limited to the charge of altering the.. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Stroumsa ''Freethinkers of medieval Islam: [[Ibn al-Rawandi]], [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]] and their Impact on Islamic Thought.'' Leiden, the Netherlands: Brill, 1999. Page 204 "Joseph van Ess has suggested [[Hiwi al-Balhi]]'s ''Questions concerning the Bible'' as a source of inspiration for a Jewish polemicist.51 These Questions prove indeed that criticism of the scriptures was not foreign to the Medieval Jewish.."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judah Halevi]]'s Arabic ''[[Kuzari|Kitab al Khazari]]'' "Book of the [[Khazar]]s" (c 1120), subtitled "The book of refutation and proof on behalf of the despised religion," included apologetics to Islam alongside Christianity and [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'' Page 60 Adele Berlin, Maxine Grossman - 2011 "Later Jewish apologetics reasserted Judaism against Greek philosophy, Christianity, Islam (*Yehuda ha-Levi's Kuzari dealt with all three), "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia'' Volume 1 - Page 342 Phyllis G. Jestice - 2004 "The book's subtitle, Kitab al-Hujja wa-al-Dalil fi Nasr al-Din al-Dhalil (The book of refutation and proof on behalf of the despised religion), identifies it as a work of religious apologetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Catholic Europe===
Jews in Europe began to write polemical works in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Berger David ''Jewish-Christian Debate in the High Middle Ages''  Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1979 in ''Jewish history and Jewish memory: essays in honor of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi'' 1998 Page 26 "By the twelfth century, when European Jews began to write polemical works, they had far more information, which made their task easier in some respects and more complex in others.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'' "Wars of the Name" of Jacob ben Reuben (12th century) is an apologetic text against conversion by Christians, notable in that it contains questions and answers based on selected Hebrew translations of the Latin [[Gospel of Matthew]]&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury Hebrew study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda 1999 128&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have served as a precedent for the full Hebrew translation and interspersed commentary on Matthew found in [[Ibn Shaprut]]'s ''[[rabbinical translations of Matthew|Touchstone]]'' (c. 1385).&lt;ref&gt;J. Rosenthal (ed.), Jacob b. Reuben, Milhamoth ha-Shem (Jerusalem, 1963), pp. 141-52&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Joseph Kimhi]]'s ''Sefer ha-Berit'' "Book of the covenant" (c. 1150) follows Jacob ben Reuben's format of an apologetic response to Christian argument,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Janet Ridyard '' The medieval crusade'' 2004 Page 37 "Both Jacob ben Reuben's Milhamot ha-Shem and Joseph Kimhi's Sefer ha-Berit begin with the Christian spokesman adducing a series of arguments to show that reason dictates the truth of Christianity. Once again, the Jewish participants in these dialogues assume a largely defensive position, although the Jewish defense is portrayed as spirited and convincing.1."&lt;/ref&gt; but does not only refute Christian challenges, Kimhi also identifies weaknesses of Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;Chazan 2004 "While the obligation of the Jewish polemicist begins with rebutting Christian challenges, it does not end with such defensive maneuvers. The responsibility of medieval Jewish polemicists, as perceived by Joseph Kimhi, extends to identifying weaknesses in the opposing camp and bringing them forcefully to the attention of Jewish readers. This aggressive thrust of medieval Jewish polemics is well documented in Sefer ha-Berit, and we shall cite this first of  "&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same period are the ''[[Sefer Nizzahon Yashan]]'' "The (old) Book of Victory" (in Latin ''Nizzahon vetus'', to distinguish from Prague rabbi [[Yom-Tov Lipmann-Muhlhausen]]'s 1405 polemical work) a "typical Ashkenazic polemic,"&lt;ref&gt;Ora Limor, Guy G. Stroumsa ''Contra Iudaeos: ancient and medieval polemics between Christians and Jews'' TSMJ 10; Tubingen: Mohr 1996  p196 "When one thinks of a typical Ashkenazic polemic, one generally looks to a book such as Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, ... 8 A critical edition of Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, with English translation and notes, can be found in David Berger, The Jewish-Christian Debate in the High Middle Ages  2008 "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Trautner-Kromann ''Shield and sword: Jewish polemics against Christianity and the Christians in France and Spain from 1000-1500'' Texts and Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Judaism 8. Tubingen: Mohr (Siebeck) ({{ISBN|3 16 145995 4}})  1993 p103 "The Sefer Nizzahon Vetus begins with a quite brief introduction where God's help is invoked. After this, the text follows the order of the ... Presumably the Nizzahon Vetus was much used because of its manageable and systematic form."&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Sefer Joseph Hamekane]]'' "Book of Joseph the Official" of rabbi Joseph ben Nathan (13th century) which presents among other arguments a conversation between a Christian, the 'Chancellor,' and two rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Sapir Abulafia ''Religious violence between Christians and Jews: medieval roots'' p94 2002 "This is illustrated clearly in an episode in Sefer Joseph Hamekane (Book of Joseph the Zealot, France, thirteenth century), recounting a conversation in Paris between the 'Chancellor' and two rabbis.29 The Christian claimed that from .."&lt;/ref&gt;
Other apologetic works include [[Joseph Albo]]'s ''Sefer Ha-Ikkarim'' "Book of Principles" (1420), [[Chasdai Crescas]]' ''Or Adonai'' "Light of the Lord" (1410), [[Isaac of Troki]]'s ''Hizzuk emunah'' "Faith strengthened" (1590).&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish encyclopedia'' Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler "As to the two Hebrew standard works of New Testament criticism in the Middle Ages, written for apologetic purposes, the " Sefer Nizzahon " and the "Hizzuk Emunah,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defences of the Talmud===
A subcategory of apologetics in the late medieval period is found in necessary Jewish responses to highly dangerous Christian charges concerning material related to [[Jesus in the Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;''Turim: Studies in Jewish History and Literature'' ed. Michael A. Shmidman - 2007 "Furthermore, his theory of "two Yeshus" (which was advanced numerous times previously, both in the context of disputations23 and apparently sincerely by the Tosafot ha-Rosh) shows that he did not believe the derogatory passages in the about "Yeshu" referred to Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;/ref&gt; found in the responses of [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Moses of Coucy]], and [[Judah of Melun]] at the [[Disputation of Paris]] (1240),&lt;ref&gt;Saadia R. Eisenberg, “Reading Medieval Religious Disputation: The 1240 'Debate' Between Rabbi Yehiel of Paris and Friar Nicholas Donin” (Ph.D. diss., University of Michigan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nachmanides]] at the  [[Disputation of Barcelona]] (1263), and [[Profiat Duran]] "Shame of the Gentiles" (1375), Joseph Albo (mentioned above) and [[Astruc HaLevi]] at the [[Disputation of Tortosa]] (1413).

==Renaissance and Counter-Reformation==
Following the [[Renaissance]] the religious landscape of Europe changed with the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]]. Notable among apologeticists of the 17th century was [[Elijah Montalto]], personal physician to [[Maria de Medici]] in Paris until his death in 1611, among others such as [[Menasseh ben Israel]], author of ''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' whose works were printed by the [[Jewish community of Amsterdam]]. Montalto's student [[Saul Levi Morteira]] continued in Montalto's tradition of conducting a rational polemical [[criticism of Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Melnick ''From polemics to apologetics: Jewish-Christian rapprochement in 17th Century Amsterdam'' 1981 - 95 {{ISBN|9789023217923}} "Like Montalto, Saul Levi Morteira, the disciple who accompanied his master to Paris and who took his body to Amsterdam for burial, continued in this same polemical tradition of conducting a rational critique of Christianity."&lt;/ref&gt; Many polemical works, like [[Leon of Modena]]'s ''Magen va-Herev'' "Shield and Sword", were designed to win back [[converso]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Talya Fishman, "Changing Early Modern Jewish Discourse About Christianity: The Efforts of Rabbi Leon Modena", in David Joshua Malkiel ''Lion shall roar: Leon Modena and his world''   2003 "Magen va-Herev 's methodology and use of sources offer other clues regarding its target audience. Like other works designed to win hesitant converses over to Judaism, all the arguments in Magen va-Herev appeal to either Scripture or''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph ''' was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 790 until his death in 792.

==Biography==
Prior to his consecration as patriarch, Joseph was a monk at the Monastery of Gubba Baraya, near [[Manbij|Mabbogh]]. According to [[Dionysius I Telmaharoyo]], Joseph was elected as patriarch in 790 in fear of the Monastery of Gubba Baraya, which was powerful enough to cause serious disruption to the church. He is not considered to have been particularly intelligent as a result of his lack of education.&lt;ref name="Palmer179"&gt;Palmer (1990), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his consecration, Zachariah, former Bishop of Edessa, who had been removed due to complaints from local clergy, convinced Joseph to travel with him to the city to persuade locals to accept him as their bishop. The Syriac Orthodox population of Edessa, however, rejected Zachariah. Joseph served as patriarch until his death in 792 whilst visiting a monastery near Tell Beshmay.&lt;ref name="Palmer179"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">'''Judah Leib (Leibele) (Löbele) Prossnitz''' (c. 1670 – c. 1730/1750) was a [[kabbalist]] born about the end of the seventeenth century at [[Uherský Brod]], [[Moravia]]. He left his native city and went to [[Prostějov]] (German: &lt;i&gt;Prossnitz&lt;/i&gt;), [[Moravia]], where he married, earning a livelihood by peddling in the neighboring villages. On account of his poverty he occupied a deserted hovel, which was reputed to be haunted.

One night he promised to summon the [[Shekhina]] to appear at midnight in a large gathering. Prossnitz stretched across his room a perforated curtain, behind which he had secretly lighted a mixture of alcohol and turpentine. He himself, robed in white, stood behind the curtain, and the light brought out in full relief the gilt letters of the [[Tetragrammaton]], which he had placed on his breast. The spectators were disposed to believe in a miracle, when someone present, ([[Jacob Emden]] believes it to be the rabbi), pulled down the curtain and exposed the fraud. Prossnitz was excommunicated by the rabbis of [[Moravia]], among them the "Landrabbiner" [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]].

In spite of all, Prossnitz found many followers among the [[Sabbateans]]. He proclaimed himself the [[Messiah ben Joseph]], and signed his name "Joseph ben Jacob." He had relations{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} with the Sabbatean [[Mordecai Eisenstadt]] and with [[Jonathan Eybeschütz]], and seems to have been especially influenced by the Sabbatean [[Nehemiah Hayyun]]. Prossnitz wandered from city to city in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], where many persons supplied him with funds. In 1725 the excommunication was renewed, whereupon he moved to [[Hungary]]. Emden relates that he died there among non-Jews.

Prossnitz taught that, since the appearance of [[Shabbatai Zevi]], God had entrusted the guidance of the world to him, after whose ascent to heaven the mission passed to [[Jonathan Eybeschütz]] and, finally, to Prossnitz himself.

{{other uses|Catholicos of the East (disambiguation)}}
{{Eastern Christianity}}
The '''Patriarch of the Church of the East''' ('''Patriarch of Babylon''' or '''Patriarch of the East'''){{sfn|Walker|1985|p=172: "this church had as its head a "catholicos" who came to be styled "Patriarch of the East" and had his seat originally at Seleucia-Ctesiphon (after 775 it was shifted to Baghdad)"}} is the [[patriarch]], or leader and head [[bishop]] (sometimes referred to as [[Catholicos]] or universal leader) of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The position dates to the early centuries of [[Christianity]] within the [[Sassanid Empire]], and the church has been known by a variety of names, including the [[Church of the East]], [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Church, the Persian Church, the Sassanid Church, or ''East Syrian''.{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=4}} In the 16th and 17th century the Church, by now restricted to its original [[Assyrian homeland]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], experienced a series of splits, resulting in a series of competing patriarchs and lineages. Today, the three principal churches that emerged from these splits, the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], each have their own patriarch, the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, the Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East and the [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans]], respectively.

==History==
The geographic location of the patriarchate was first in the Persian capital of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] in central Mesopotamia. In the 9th century the patriarchate moved to [[Baghdad]] and then through various cities in what was then [[Assyria]] ([[Assuristan]]/[[Athura]]) and is now northern [[Iraq]], south east [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]], including, [[Tabriz]], [[Mosul]], and [[Maragheh]] on [[Lake Urmia]]. Following the Chaldean Catholic Church split from the Assyrian Church, the respective patriarchs of these churches continued to move around northern Iraq. In the 19th century, the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East was in the village of [[Qudshanis]] in southeastern [[Turkey]].{{sfn|Wigram|1910|p=90}} In the 20th century, the Assyrian patriarch went into exile, relocating to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States. Another patriarchate, which split off in the 1960s as the [[Ancient Church of the East]], is in Baghdad.

The patriarchate of the Church of the East evolved from the position of the leader of the Christian community in [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], the Persian capital. While Christianity had been introduced into [[Assyria]] then largely under the rule of the [[Parthian Empire]] in the first centuries AD, during the earliest period, leadership was unorganized and there was no established succession. In 280, [[Papa bar Aggai]] was consecrated as Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon by two visiting bishops, Akha d'abuh' of [[Erbil|Arbela]] and Hai-Beël of [[Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Susa]], thereby establishing the generally recognized succession.{{sfn|Wigram|1910|p=42-44}} Seleucia-Ctesiphon thus became its own [[episcopal see]], and exerted some ''de facto'' control over the wider Persian Christian community. Papa's successors began to use the title of ''[[Catholicos]]'', a Roman designation probably adopted due to its use by the [[Catholicos of Armenia]], though at first it carried no formal recognition.{{sfn|Wigram|1910|p=90-91}} In 409 the Church of the East received state recognition from the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Emperor]] [[Yazdegerd I]], and the [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] was called, at which the church's hierarchy was formalized. Bishop [[Mar Isaac (bishop)|Mar Isaac]] was the first to be officially styled Catholicos over all of the Christians in Persia. Over the next decades, the Catholicoi adopted the additional title of [[Patriarch]], which eventually became the better known designation.{{sfn|Wigram|1910|p=91}}

In the 16th century, another schism separated the church, with those following "Nestorianism" separating from a group which entered into communion with the Roman Catholic Church. This latter group, known initially as ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'', and latterly the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholics]], continues also to maintain its own [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|list of Chaldean Catholic patriarchs]].{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=4}}

Because of the complex history of [[Eastern Christianity]], it is difficult to define one single lineage of patriarchs,{{sfn|Wilmshurst|2000|p=4}} though some modern churches, such as the Assyrian Church of the East, claim all patriarchs through the centuries as the Assyrian Patriarch, even though the modern version of the church did not come into being until much more recently.

==Language==
Today, the ethnically [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] celebrate the liturgy of Mar Addai and Mar Mari in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a dialect which (along with [[Eastern Aramaic]]) emerged in [[Assyria]] during the 5th century BC, as do [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] members of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] (largely centred in north east Syria and south east Turkey)), and Assyrian [[Protestant]] churches such as the [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]] and [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]].

At its peak, the Church of the East expanded from its Assyrian heartland, and it celebrated the liturgy in East Syriac in modern-day [[Syria]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Yemen]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]], [[UAE]], [[Cyprus]], [[Armenia]]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. The church also uses [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Suryoyo]] which are the vernacular dialects of the [[Assyrian people]] as well as English, Arabic, Persian, Turkish and the languages of the countries of the [[Assyrian Diaspora]].

{{seealso|Province of the Patriarch}}
According to Church legend, the Apostleship of Edessa (Chaldea) is alleged to have been founded by Shimun Keepa ([[Saint Peter]]) (33–64),&lt;ref&gt;I Peter, 1:1 and 5:13&lt;/ref&gt; Thoma Shlikha, ([[Thomas (Apostle)|Saint Thomas]]), Tulmay ([[St. Bartholomew]] the Apostle) and of course [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Mar Addai]], (St. Thaddeus) of the [[Seventy disciples]]. Saint Thaddeus was martyred c.66 AD.

=== Edessa era ===

*1 [[Aggai (bishop)|Mar Aggai]] (c.66-81). First successor to the Apostleship of his [[spiritual director]] the Apostle [[Saint Thaddeus]], one of the [[Seventy disciples]]. He in turn was the [[spiritual director]] of [[Mar Mari]].
*2 Palut of Edessa (c.81-87) renamed [[Saint Mari|Mar Mari]] (c.87 – c.121) Second successor to the Apostleship of Mar Addai of the [[Seventy disciples]]. During his days a bishopric was formally established at Seleucia-Ctesiphon.
*3 [[Abris]] ([[Mar Abris|Abres]] or Ahrasius) (121–148 AD) [[Judah Kyriakos]] relocates Jerusalem Church to Edessa in 136 AD
*4 [[Abraham (bishop)|Abraham]] ([[Mar Abraham I|Abraham I of Kashker]]) (148–171 AD)
*5 [[Yaqob I|Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob I]] ([[Mar Yacob I]]) (''c.'' 172–190 AD)
*6 [[Ebid M’shikha]] (191–203)
*7 [[Ahadabui]] ([[Ahadabui|Ahha d'Aboui]]) (204–220 AD) First bishop of the East to get statikon as Catholicos. Ordained in 231 AD in [[Jerusalem]] Council.
*8 [[Shahlufa|Shahaloopa of Kashker]] ([[Shahlufa]]) (220–266 AD) 
**''Bar Aggai'' (267–''c.'' 280)

===Metropolitan of Seleucia-Ctesiphon elevated as titular Catholicos ===
{{See also|Al-Mada'in}}
Around 280, visiting bishops consecrated [[Papa bar Aggai]] as Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, thereby establishing the succession.{{sfn|Stewart|1928|p=15}} With him, heads of the church took the title [[Catholicos]].

*9 [[Papa (bishop)|Papa bar Aggai]] ([[Mar Papa bar Gaggai]]) (''c.'' 280–316 AD died 336)
*10 [[Simeon Barsabae|Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on bar Sabba{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}e]] ([[Simeon Barsabae]]) (coadjutor 317–336, Catholicos from 337–341 AD)
*11 [[Shahdost]] (Shalidoste)  (341–343 AD)
*12 [[Barba'shmin|Barba{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}shmin]] ([[Barbashmin]]) (343–346 AD). The apostolic see of Edessa is completely abandoned in 345 AD due to persecutions against the Church of the East.
*13 [[Tomarsa]] (Toumarsa) (346–370 AD)
*14 [[Qayyoma]] (Qaioma) (371–399 AD)
*15 [[Isaac (patriarch)|Isaac]] (399–410 AD)

=== Catholicos of the East with jurisdiction over Eastern provinces ===
[[Isaac (patriarch)|Isaac]] was recognised as 'Grand Metropolitan' and Primate of the Church of the East at the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410. The acts of this Synod were later edited by the Patriarch [[Joseph (Nestorian Patriarch)|Joseph]] (552–567) to grant him the title of Catholicos as well. This title for Patriarch Isaac in fact only came into use towards the end of the fifth century.

*16 [[Ahha]] (Ahhi) (410–414 AD)
*17 [[Yahballaha I]] (Yab-Alaha I) (415–420 AD)
*18 [[Mana (patriarch)|Ma{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}na]] (Maana) (420 AD)
*19 [[Farbokht]] (Frabokht) (421 AD) 
*20 [[Dadisho|Dadisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}]] ([[Dadishu I]]) 421–456 AD)

With Dadisho, the significant disagreement on the dates of the Catholicoi in the sources start to converge. In 424, under Mar Dadisho I, the Church of the East declared itself independent of all other churches; thereafter, its Catholicoi began to use the additional title of Patriarch.{{sfn|Stewart|1928|p=15}} During his reign, Nestorianism was subsequently denounced at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431.

*21 [[Babowai]] (Babwahi) (457–484 AD)

*26 [[Paul (Nestorian Patriarch)|Paul]] (539)
*27 [[Aba I]] (540–552)

In 544 the Synod of Mar Aba I adopted the ordinances of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|p=287-289}}

***[[Babai the Great]] (coadjutor) 609–628; together with [[Mar Aba Qozma|Abba]] (coadjutor) 609–628

From 628, the [[Maphrian]] also began to use the title Catholicos. See the [[List of Maphrians]] for details.

{{main|Schism of 1552}}
By the Schism of 1552 the Church of the East was divided into many splinters but two main factions, of which one (the Church of Assyria and Mosul) entered into [[full communion]] with the [[Catholic Church]] and the other remained independent. A split in the former line in 1681 resulted in a third faction.

The Eliya line (1) in [[Alqosh]] ended in 1804, and branch of [[Yohannan VIII Hormizd]], that was in communion with Rome, merged with the Catholic Josephite line in [[Amid]] (3), with Yohannan VIII Hormizd recognised by the Holy See as [[Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans]] in 1830. This merged line, which relocated the [[Episcopal see|see]] to [[Mosul]], formed the contemporary unbroken patriarchal line of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. For subsequent Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs, see [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon]].

The Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on line (2) remained the only line not in full communion with the Catholic Church, which from the 19th-century continued to be known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. For subsequent patriarchs in this line, see [[List of Patriarchs of the Assyrian Church of the East]].

This is a '''list of the saints of Ireland''', which attempts to give an overview of saints from [[Ireland]] or venerated in Ireland.

The vast majority of these saints lived during the 4th—10th centuries, the period of [[early Christian Ireland]], when [[Celtic Christianity]] produced many [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|missionaries]] to Great Britain and the European continent. For this reason, Ireland in a 19th-century  adage is described as "the land of saints and scholars".&lt;ref&gt;
''The Monthly Packet of Evening Readings for Members of the English Church'', Volume 3, John and Charles Mozley (1852), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=jN1OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 215].&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of Christianity into Ireland was during the end of the 4th century. Its exact introduction is obscure, though the strict [[ascetic]] nature of monasticism in Ireland, derives from the Desert Fathers. Although there were some Christians in Ireland before him, [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], a native of [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]], played a significant role in its full Christianisation.

Some of the most well known saints are the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]] and [[Brigit of Kildare]].
Saints canonized in the modern era include [[Oliver Plunkett]] (d. 1681, canonized 1975 by [[Pope Paul VI]])  and [[Charles of Mount Argus]] (d. 1893, canonized 2007 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]]).

It is commonly considered a counterasana to [[Sarvangasana]], or shoulder stand, specifically within the context of the [[Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga]] Primary Series.&lt;ref name="Maehle2007"&gt;{{cite book

LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The asana is a [[backbend]], where the practitioner lies on his or her back and lifts the heart ([[anahata]]) [[chakra]] by rising up on the elbows and drawing the shoulders back. The neck is lengthened, and the crown of the head [[Sahasrara]] [[chakra]] is "pointed" toward the 'wall' behind the practitioner. As the arch of the back deepens with practice, and the heart and throat open further, the top of the head may brush the ground, but no weight should rest upon it.

==Variations==
*The legs can kept straight on the ground with toes pointed. 
*The legs again straight can be lifted about 6 inches off the ground with toes pointed. 
*The hands may also be placed before the heart in [[Añjali Mudrā]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/786 | title = Yoga Journal - Fish Pose | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael P. Jensen''' is an [[Australian]] clergyman, author, and lecturer. He has served as the rector in the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] parish of [[St Mark's Church, Darling Point|St Mark's Church]], [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]] since 2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydneyanglicans.net/author/5244 |title=Author Bio |publisher=Sydney Anglicans |accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly a professor of theology at [[Moore College]], Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/michael-jensen/27292 | title=Author Bio | publisher=ABC | accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a son of the former [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|archbishop of Sydney]], [[The Most Reverend]] [[Peter Jensen (bish&lt;ref&gt;op)|Peter Jensen]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Jensen is a prolific commentator in both religious and secular forums on a range of topics. For example, in April 2016 Jensen responded to columnist [[Peter FitzSimons|Peter FitzSimons']] criticism of [[Mormon]] rugby player [[Will Hopoate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-05/jensen-is-hopoate's-mormon-faith-fair-game-for-ridicule/7299158 |title=Is Hopoate's Mormon faith fair game for ridicule? |work=ABC Drum |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=28 April 2016 |author=Jensen, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2015 Jensen's book ''You: An Introduction'' (2008) was [[List of books banned by governments|banned]] from state schools by the [[New South Wales]] [[Department of Education and Communities (New South Wales)|Department of Education and Communities]] on the basis of a "potential risk to students in the delivery of this material, if not taught sensitively and in an age appropriate manner."&lt;ref name=Piccoli&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piccoli|first1=Adrian|authorlink1=Adrian Piccoli|title=Letter to His Grace the Most Reverend Dr G Davies|url=http://sydneyanglicans.net/images/uploads/Letter_SRE_180515.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was lifted 18 May 2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In September 2018, Jensen launched a podcast, With All Due Respect,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eternitynews.com.au/topics/with-all-due-respect/. Retrieved 6 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; which he co-hosts with Megan Powell du Toit, a Baptist minister. The podcast is the first one for Eternity News, an Australian Christian news site.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eternitynews.com.au/culture/the-podcast-trying-to-teach-you-how-to-have-better-conversations/. Retrieved 6 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2018, Jensen published a widely panned opinion piece comparing John Allen Chau favourably to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/like-jesus-us-missionary-accepted-death-as-the-price-of-reaching-out-20181127-p50ik3.html?&lt;/ref&gt; Chau was a US missionary killed by the protected North Sentinelese tribe after travelling illegally and trespassing onto their island. In doing so, Chau risked wiping out the tribe by possibly introducing deadly pathogens the tribe had no immunity to. Jensen argued that Chau was "not attempting to ... "civilise" them" by hoping to introduce Christianity to the tribe, but only "came to save".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/like-jesus-us-missionary-accepted-death-as-the-price-of-reaching-out-20181127-p50ik3.html?&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6447">[[File:Odin am Brunnen der Weisheit.jpg|thumb|Odin drinks from Mímisbrunnr as Mímir looks on (1903) in a work by [[Robert Engels]]]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Mímisbrunnr''' ([[Old Norse]] "[[Mímir]]'s well"&lt;ref name=SIMEK216&gt;Simek (2007:216).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Water well|well]] associated with the being Mímir, located beneath the world tree [[Yggdrasil]]. Mímisbrunnr is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. The well is located beneath one of [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] roots of the world tree [[Yggdrasil]], a root that passes into the [[Jötunheimr|land of the frost jötnar]] where the primordial plane of [[Ginnungagap]] once existed. In addition, the ''Prose Edda'' relates that the water of the well contains much wisdom, and that [[Odin]] sacrificed one of his eyes to the well in exchange for a drink.

==Attestations==

===''Poetic Edda''===
[[File:Odin at the Brook Mimir.jpg|thumb|"Odin at the Brook Mimir" (1893) by [[John Angell James Brindley]]]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', a [[völva]] recounts to Odin that she knows that Odin once placed one of his eyes in Mímisbrunnr as a pledge, and that Mímir drinks from the well every morning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:"Of what wouldst thou ask me?
:Why temptest thou me?
:Odin! I know all,
:where thou thine eye didst sink
:in the pure well of Mim."
:Mim drinks from [[mead]] each morn
:from [[List of names of Odin|Valfather's]] pledge.&lt;ref name=THORPE6&gt;Thorpe (1866:6).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:I know where Othin's eye is hidden,
:Deep in the wide-famed well of Mimir;
:Mead from the pledge of Othin each morn
:Does Mimir drink: would you know yet more?&lt;ref name=BELLOWS13&gt;Bellows (1936:13).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above stanza is absent from the ''[[Hauksbók]]'' manuscript version of the poem.&lt;ref name=BELLOWS13/&gt; Elsewhere in the poem, the völva mentions a scenario involving the hearing or [[Gjallar|horn]] (depending on translation of the Old Norse noun ''hljóð''—bolded for the purpose of illustration) of the god Heimdallr:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:&lt;small&gt;Benjamin Thorpe translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:She knows that '''Heimdall's horn''' is hidden
:under the [[Yggdrasil|heaven-bright holy tree]].
:A river she sees flow, with foamy fall,
:from [[List of names of Odin|Valfather]]'s pledge.
:Understand ye yet, or what?&lt;ref name=THORPE7&gt;Thorpe (1866:7).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;Henry Adams Bellows translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:I know of the '''horn of Heimdall''', hidden
:Under the high-reaching holy tree;
:On it there pours from Valfather's pledge
:A mighty stream: would you know yet more?&lt;ref name=BELLOWS12&gt;Bellows (1932:12).&lt;/ref&gt;
|
:&lt;small&gt;Carolyne Larrington translation:&lt;/small&gt;
:She knows that '''Heimdall's hearing''' is hidden
:under the radiant, sacred tree;
:she sees, pouring down, the muddy torrent
:from the wager of Father of the Slain; do you
:understand yet, or what more?&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON7&gt;Larrington (1999:7).&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Scholar Paul Schach comments that the stanzas in this section of Voluspa are "all very mysterious and obscure, as it was perhaps meant to be". Schach details that "''Heimdallar hljóð'' has aroused much speculation. Snorri seems to have confused this word with ''gjallarhorn'', but there is otherwise no attestation of the use of ''hljóð'' in the sense of 'horn' in Icelandic.  Various scholars have read this as "hearing" rather than "horn".&lt;ref name="SCHACH93"&gt;Schach (1985:93).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Carolyne Larrington]] comments that if "hearing" rather than "horn" is understood to appear in this stanza, the stanza indicates that Heimdall, like Odin, has left a body part in the well; his ear. Larrington says that "Odin exchanged one of his eyes for wisdom from Mimir, guardian of the well, while Heimdall seems to have forfeited his ear."&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON265"&gt;Larrington (1999:265).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Prose Edda''===
In chapter 15 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the enthroned figure [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (described as king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) about Yggdrasil. High details that Yggdrasil has three roots. One of these roots reaches to where the primordial space of [[Ginnungagap]] once existed and where now the frost jötnar live. High explains that, beneath this root is Mímisbrunnr and that the well contains "wisdom and intelligence" and "the master of the well is called Mimir. He is full of learning because he drinks of the well from the horn [[Gjallarhorn|Giallarhorn]]. [[List of names of Odin|All-father]] went there and asked for a single drink from the well, but he did not get one until he placed his eye as a pledge." After his explanation, High quotes the stanza involving Odin and the well from ''Völuspá''.&lt;ref name=FAULKES17&gt;Faulkes (1995:17).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Naometria''''' ("temple measurement") is a book of prophecies attributed to [[Simon Studion]] and published in 1604.  Its two thousand pages cover predictions based on [[numerology]] that include destruction of the [[Papacy]].  It was dedicated to [[Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg]].

Its appearance in [[Tübingen]] drew enough interest that a "Society Naometrica" was formed, which included [[Bible]] and [[Kabbalah|cabala]] scholar [[Tobias Hess]] and Lutheran theologian [[Johann Valentin Andreä]].

It is addressed in the 1983 volume of ''[[Hermetic Journal]]''.

The '''Nattukottai [[Nagarathar]]s''' (also known as '''Nattukottai Chettiar''') is a community within the [[Chettiar]] [[Caste system in India|caste]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

==Origins==
The traditional base of the Nattukottai Nagarathars is the [[Chettinad]] region of the present-day state of Tamil Nadu. It comprises a triangular area around north-east [[Sivagangai]], north-west [[Ramnad]] and south [[Pudukkottai]]. There are various claims regarding how they arrived in that area.&lt;ref name="Price13"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kingship and Political Practice in Colonial India |first=Pamela G. |last=Price |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521552479 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqKSTs4ajsAC&amp;pg=PA13 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the community had been involved in trade since the 8th century CE and certainly by the early 17th century they were established salt merchants. Later, in the 19th century, their trading activities had expanded into southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Price13" /&gt;

==Religious influence==
It is found that [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], the prime personalities of the epic ''[[Silappatikaram]]''  were born in Nagarathar community. The religious figures [[Karaikkal Ammaiyar]] and [[Pattinathar]] were also from the community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Nagarathar-children-trace-their-roots/article14571805.ece|title=Nagarathar children trace their roots|last=|first=|date=2016-08-16|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-08-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
The nine temples connected with the Nagarathar community include: [[Ilaiyattangudi| Ilayathakudi]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} Iluppaikkudi,{{cn|date=January 2018}} Iraniyur,{{cn|date=January 2018}} Mathur,{{cn|date=January 2018}} Nemam,{{cn|date=January 2018}} [[Karpaka Vinayakar Temple|Pillayarpatti]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} Soorakudi,{{cn|date=January 2018}} [[Vairavapatti|Vairavan]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} and Velangudi.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The temple at the foot of the [[Palani]] hill is called Thiru Avinankudi (Kulandai Velayudhaswami Thirukkoil). It was renovated between 1898 and 1910, with a rajagopuram that can be seen from the hill temple being added in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Palani: The Hill Temple of Muruga|author=Cōmale|publisher=Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple, 1975|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pattani''' (Patani) or the '''Sultanate of Patani''' was a [[Malay sultanate]] in the [[historical region|historical]] [[Pattani (region)|Patani Region]]. It covered approximately the area of the modern [[Thailand|Thai]] provinces of [[Pattani Province|Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] and much of the northern part of modern [[Malaysia]]. The 6–7th century Hindu state of [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|Pan Pan]] may or may not have been related.

==Early history==
{{see|Pan Pan (kingdom)}}
[[File:YosriApr2005HikayatPatani.jpg|thumb|The [[Hikayat Patani]].]]

[[Langkasuka]] was a [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] kingdom, founded in the region as early as the 2nd century CE, which appeared in many accounts by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] travellers, the most famous of whom was the Buddhist pilgrim I-Ching. The kingdom drew trade from Chinese, [[India]]n, and local traders as a stopping place for ships bound for, or just arrived from, the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Langkasuka reached its greatest economic success in the 6th and 7th centuries and afterward declined as a major trade center. Political circumstances suggest that by the 11th century [[Chola]] invasion, Langkasuka was no longer a major port visited by merchants.  However, much of the decline may be due to the silting up of its harbour, shown most poignantly today because the most substantial Langkasukan ruins lie approximately 15 kilometres from the sea.

Patani became part of the [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] Empire of [[Srivijaya]], a maritime confederation based in [[Palembang]]. Srivijaya dominated trade in the [[South China Sea]] and exacted [[tariff|tolls]] on all traffic through the Straits of [[Malacca]]. Malay culture had substantial influence on the Khmer Empire, and the ancient city of [[Nakhon Pathom]].

The founding of the Islamic kingdom of Patani is thought to have been around the mid-13th century CE, with folklore suggesting it was named after an exclamation made by Sultan Ismail Shah, "Pantai ini!" (pronounced as "pata ni!", 'this beach' in the local [[Malay language]]).&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani'', Ibrahim Syukri, {{ISBN|0-89680-123-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some think it was the same country known to the Chinese as [[Pan Pan (kingdom)|Pan Pan]]. 

An alternative theory is that the Patani kingdom was founded in the 14th century. Local stories tell of a fisherman named Pak Tani (Father of Tani), who was sent by a king from the interior to survey the coast, to find a place for an appropriate settlement. After he established a successful fishing outpost, other people moved to join him. The town soon grew into a prosperous trading center that continued to bear his name.  The authors of the 17th–18th century [[Hikayat Patani]] chronicle claim this story is untrue, and support the claim that the kingdom was founded by the Sultan.

The Patani kingdom's [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] was during the reign of its four successive queens from 1584, known as [[Ratu Hijau]] (The Green Queen), [[Ratu Biru]] (The Blue Queen), [[Ratu Ungu]] (The Purple Queen) and [[Ratu Kuning]] (The Yellow Queen), during which the kingdom's economic and military strength was greatly increased to the point that it was able to fight off four major Siamese invasions, with the help of the eastern Malay kingdom of [[Pahang]] and the southern Malay [[Sultanate of Johor]].

==Patani and the Siamese Kingdom==
===Sukhothai===
In the 14th century CE, King [[Ram Khamhaeng the Great]] (c.1239 – 1317) of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] (also known as Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng,  {{lang-th|พ่อขุนรามคำแหงมหาราช}}), occupied [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]] and its vassal states – including Patani.

===Ayutthaya===
[[Image:Patani1837.jpg|thumb|Patani 1837]]
The Thai [[Ayutthaya kingdom]] conquered the isthmus during the 14th century CE, bringing it into a single unified state, with [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] as a capital, and many smaller vassal states under its control. This consisted of a self-governing system in which the vassal states and tributary provinces owed allegiance to the king of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], but otherwise ran their own affairs.

A sheikh named Sa'id or Shafi'uddin from Kampong Pasai (presumably a small community of traders from [[Pasai]] who lived on the outskirts of Patani reportedly healed the king of a rare skin disease and after much negotiation (and recurrence of the disease), the king agreed to convert to Islam, adopting the name [[Sultan Ismail Shah]]. All of the sultan's officials also agreed to convert. However, there is fragmentary evidence that some local people had begun to convert to Islam prior to this. The existence of a diasporic Pasai community near Patani shows the locals had regular contact with [[Muslims]]. There are also travel reports, such as that of [[Ibn Battuta]], and early [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] accounts that claimed Patani had an established Muslim community even before [[Melaka]] (which officially converted in 1413), which would suggest that merchants who had contact with other emerging Muslims centres were the first to convert to the region.

During much of the 15th century [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]'s energies were directed toward the [[Malay Peninsula]], especially the trading port of [[Malacca]], which fell under the rule of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]'s sovereignty extended over Malacca and the Malay states south of [[Tambralinga]] (Nakorn Sri Thammarat). Ayutthaya helped develop and stabilise the region, opening the way for lucrative trade on the isthmus. This attracted Chinese merchants seeking [[speciality goods]] for the Chinese market.

====First Siamese-Burmese wars====
The 16th century witnessed the rise of [[Burma]], which under an aggressive dynasty had overrun [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Laos]] and made war on Ayutthaya. [[Burmese–Siamese War (1563–1564)|A second siege (1563–64)]] led by King [[Bayinnaung]] forced King [[Maha Chakkraphat]] to surrender in 1564. The royal family was taken to [[Bago, Burma]], with the king's second son [[Mahinthrathirat]] installed as the vassal king.&lt;ref name="app-111"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Burma | author=Lt. Gen. Sir Arthur P. Phayre | year=1883 | page=111 | edition=1967 | publisher=Susil Gupta | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geh-167"&gt;{{cite book | author=GE Harvey | title=History of Burma | pages=167–170 | publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co. Ltd. | year=1925 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the brief decline of Ayutthaya's hegemony in this period, Patani may have become independent temporarily.

King [[Mahathammarachathirat (king of Ayutthaya)|Dhammaraja]] (reigned 1569–90) was a Siamese noble of the Sukhothai dynasty, and was formerly the King of Phitsanulok - an important city of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]. Dhammaraja became the King of Ayutthaya by aiding [[Bayinnaung|the Burmese King]] in the siege of Ayutthaya in 1568. After, taking over Ayutthaya, Bayinnaung installed Dhammara as a vassal king. After Bayinnaung's death in 1581, uparaja [[Naresuan]] proclaimed Ayutthaya's independence in 1584. The Thai fought off repeated Burmese invasions (1584–1593). Thai independence was later restored by Dhammaraja son, King [[Naresuan]] the Great (reigned 1590–1605), who rebelled against the Burmese and by 1593 had driven them from the kingdom. The [[Burmese–Siamese War (1594–1605)]] was a Thai attack on Burma, resulting in the capture of the [[Tanintharyi Region]] as far as [[Mottama]] in 1595 and Lan Na in 1602. Naresuan even invaded mainland Burma as far as Taungoo in 1600, but was driven back.

Under King Naresuan, Ayutthaya returned to the summit of its power - its territory span over [[Lan Xang]] and the Khmer Kingdom. All the polities that broke away from its hegemony during Dhammaraja's reign returned to be under the Siamese control. King Naresuan set about unifying the country's administration directly under the royal court at Ayutthaya. He ended the practice of nominating royal princes to govern Ayutthaya's provinces, instead assigning court officials who were expected to adhere the policies handed by the king. The royal princes were confined to the capital city. Their power struggles continued, but they were at court under the king's watchful eye. Even with King Naresuan's reforms, however, the power of the royal government during the next 150 years should not be overestimated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Growth as a  trade entrepot====
[[Image:Patani1782a.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Patani 1782]]
Chinese merchants, beginning with [[Zheng He]] in the period 1406–1433 CE, played a major role in the rise of Patani as a regional trade center. They were joined by others including the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1516, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] in 1592, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] in 1602, [[England|English]] in 1612, and Malay and Siamese merchants who traded throughout the area. Many Chinese also moved to Patani, perhaps due to the activity of [[Lin Daoqian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIgGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Ethnic Chinese Business In Asia: History, Culture And Business Enterprise |author= Yen Ching-hwang|page=57 |publisher= World Scientific Publishing Company|isbn=9789814578448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dutch report of 1603 by [[Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck|Jacob van Neck]] estimated that there may be as many Chinese in Patani as there were native Malays, and they were responsible for most of the commercial activity of Patani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIDGBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ghosts of the Past in Southern Thailand: Essays on the History  and Historiography of Patani |author=Anthony Reid |editor=Patrick Jory|publisher=NUS Press |date=30 August 2013|isbn= 978-9971696351 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) established warehouses in Patani in 1603, followed by the [[English East India Company]] in 1612, both carrying out intense trading. In 1619, [[John Jourdain]], the East India Company's chief factor at [[Banten (town)|Bantam]] was killed off the coast of Patani by the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Keay|author-link=John Keay|title=The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPQNAQAAMAAJ|year=2010|edition=EPUB|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=978-0-007-39554-5|page=location 1218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patani was seen by European traders as a way to access the Chinese market. After 1620, the Dutch and English both closed their warehouses, but a prosperous trade was continued by the Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese for most of the 17th century.

====Reassertion of Thai power====
Following a 1688 invasion by [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], political disorder continued for five decades, during which the local rulers were helpless to end the lawlessness in the region. Most foreign merchants abandoned trade with Patani.

====Death of the Yellow Queen====
In the mid-17th century ''Ratu Kuning'' (the Yellow Queen) died. She is believed to be the last of four successive female rulers of Patani, which then went through decades of political chaos and conflict, experiencing a gradual decline.

One hundred years later, Ayutthaya under King [[Ekatat]] (Boromaraja V) faced another [[Burma|Burmese]] invasion. This culminated in the capture and destruction of the city of Ayutthaya in 1767, as well as the death of the king. Siam was shattered, and as rivals fought for the vacant throne, Patani declared its complete independence.

King [[Taksin]] finally defeated the Burmese and reunified the country, opening the way for the establishment of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]] dynasty by his successor, King [[Rama I]]. In 1785, a resurgent Siam sent an army led by Prince Surasi (Viceroy [[Boworn Maha Surasinghanat]]), younger brother of King Rama I, to seek the submission of Patani.

===Patani in the Bangkok Period===
[[Image:National Museum KL 2008 (36).JPG|thumb|200px|right|''[[Bunga mas]]'', the tribute sent every three years to the Siamese ruler in Bangkok as symbol of friendship by the ruler of Patani. The sending of the ''Bunga mas'' began in the 14th century.]]
Patani was easily defeated by Siam in 1785 and resumed its tributary status. However, a series of attempted rebellions prompted [[Bangkok]] to divide Patani into seven smaller [[Puppet state|puppet kingdoms]] in the early 1800s during the reign of King [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai|Rama II]]. Britain recognised the Thai ownership of Patani by the [[Burney Treaty]].

== Chronology of rulers ==
'''Inland Dynasty (Sri Wangsa)'''
* [[Sultan Ismail Shah]] (d. 1530?), founder of the kingdom according to one account, and the first ruler to convert to [[Islam]].  In fact, other rulers must have preceded him. It is also likely that during his reign the Portuguese first visited the port to trade, arriving in 1516.  He was called King Phaya Tu Nakpa before his conversion.
* [[Sultan Mudhaffar Shah]] (c. 1530–1564), son of Sultan Ismail Shah, who died during an attack on [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayudhya]] ([[Siam]]).
* Sultan Manzur Shah (1564–1572), brother of Sultan Mudhaffar Shah.
* [[Sultan Patik Siam]] (1572–1573), son of Sultan Mudhaffar Shah, who was murdered by his half-brother, Raja Bambang.
* [[Sultan Bahdur]] (1573–1584), son of Sultan Manzur Shah, who was considered a tyrant in most accounts.
* [[Ratu Hijau]] (the Green Queen) (1584–1616), sister of Sultan Bahdur, during whose reign Patani attained its greatest economic success as a middle-sized port, frequented by [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[English people|English]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Thai people|Siamese]], and other merchants.
* [[Ratu Biru]] (the Blue Queen) (1616–1624), sister of Ratu Hijau.
* [[Ratu Ungu]] (the Purple Queen) (1624–1635), sister of Ratu Biru, who was particularly opposed to Siamese interference in local affairs.
* [[Ratu Kuning]] (the Yellow Queen) (1635-1649/88), daughter of Ratu Ungu and last queen of the Inland Dynasty.  Controversy surrounds the exact date of the end of her reign.

'''First Kelantanese Dynasty'''

'''Shiva Dhanush''' ({{lang-sa|शिव धनुष}}) or '''Pinaka''' ({{lang-sa|पिनाक}}, pínāka) is the bow of Lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/p.html |title= Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary |last= Williams |first= Monier |date= |quote= pínāka m. n. a staff or bow, (esp.) the staff or bow of Rudra-Śiva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinaka is the original bow of Shiva used for total destruction or "[[Pralaya]]". As per original Valmiki Ramayana,  two bows were created by God Devendra of equal capacity which were given to [[Rudra]] and [[Vishnu]] and requested them to fight with each other to know who is the powerful one. However just before the start of the war an [[Aakashvani]] said that the war will lead to total destruction and hence the war was stopped. On hearing Aakashvani, Rudra threw his Dhanush which fell on earth to be later known as "Shiva dhanush". It was later found by King [[Devaratha]], the ancestor of  King [[Janaka]]. It is mentioned in the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', when its hero [[Rama]] (another [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) breaks it to win Janaka's daughter as his wife.

[[Vishwakarma]] crafted two divine bows. He gave [[Sharanga]] to Lord Vishnu and Pinaka to Lord Shiva. King Janaka of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]] had a daughter named [[Sita]]. In earlier part of her life, Sita while playing with her sisters had unknowingly lifted the table over which the bow had been placed; which was something no one in the kingdom could do. This incident was however observed by Janaka and he decided to make this incident as the backdrop for [[Sita]]'s [[swayamvara]].

Later, Janaka had announced that whosoever wanted to marry Sita had to lift the divine bow and string it. The bow was broken by [[Ayodhya]]'s prince [[Rama]] when he attempted to string the bow, during the swayamvara of Sita, thereby winning the princess's hand in marriage. After the marriage when his father [[Dasharatha]] was returning to [[Ayodhya]] with Rama, [[Parashurama]] obstructed their path and challenged Rama for breaking his guru Shiva's bow. Rama extolled the sage. After that [[Dasharatha]] prayed to the sage to forgive him but Parashurama remained enraged and brought out Vishnu's bow. He then asked Rama to string the bow and fight a duel with him. Rama snatches the bow of Vishnu, strings it, places an arrow and points it straight at the challenger's heart. Rama then asks Parashurama what he will give as a target to the arrow. At this point, Parashurama feels himself devoid of his mystical energy. He realizes that Rama is the avatar of Vishnu.

Another tale of Pinaka revolves around the tale of Lord Vishnu fighting Lord Shiva, mentioned in Seventy fifthe sarga of [[Bala kanda]] of Ramayana. Parashuram narrates this to Lord Rama before challenging him to string [[Sharanga]]. The story goes like this-The Devas wanted to test ''the superiority of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva and asked Lord Brahma to create a difference of opinion between them. In the battle that ensued, Lord Vishnu utters a battle cry "hum" which paralyzes the Devas and Lord Shiva. His bow is rendered useless, and Lord Vishnu's bow Sharanga prevails.&lt;ref&gt;http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/2219/why-did-lord-shiva-fight-with-lord-vishnu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ramayanam-atwistedversion.blogspot.in/2012/12/32-legends-of-shiva-and-vishnu-bows.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://redzambala.com/ramayana-valmiki/ramayana-bala-kanda-chapter-75.html&lt;/ref&gt; This Pinaka was broken later by Lord Rama, who also snatches Sharanga from Parashurama and gives it to Varuna, lord of the oceans, for safekeeping.

Although reference is still to be inserted from [[Puranas]] (ancient Hindu texts) there is some connection of Pinaka with the life of Maharshi [[Dadhichi]] a sage who helped devas to defeat the asura [[Vritra]] and later on request gave up life and provided his bones for making a [[Vajra]] which [[Indra]] used to kill the Demon [[Vritrasura]].

{{redirect|Praepositus|official in the Late Roman Empire|Praepositus sacri cubiculi}}
{{Unreferenced|date=October 2015}}

A '''provost''' is a senior official in a number of Christian churches.

==Historical development==

The word ''praepositus'' ([[Latin]]: "set over", from ''praeponere'', "to place in front") was originally applied to any ecclesiastical ruler or dignitary. It was soon more specifically applied to the immediate subordinate to the abbot of a monastery, or to the superior of a single [[Monk|cell]], and it was defined as such in the [[Rule of St Benedict]]. The [[dean (Christianity)|dean]] (''decanus'') was a similarly ranked official. [[Chrodegang of Metz]] adopted this usage from the [[Benedictine]]s when he introduced the monastic organization of [[College (canon law)|canon-law colleges]], especially [[cathedral chapter|cathedral capitular colleges]]. The provostship (''praepositura'') was normally held by the [[archdeacon]], while the office of dean was held by the [[archpriest]]. In many colleges, the temporal duties of the archdeacons made it impossible for them to fulfil those of the provostship, and the headship of the chapter thus fell to the dean.

The title became ''prevost'' in Old French, before being adopted as "provost" in English. ''Prévôt'' is the equivalent in modern French.

==Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden==
In the Nordic countries, a provost (Danish and older Norwegian ''provst'', modern Norwegian ''prost'', Swedish ''prost'' (under the current system ''kontraktsprost''), Icelandic ''prófastur'' (from the Old English ''prōfast'')) is the leader of a ''provsti'' (or ''prosti'', Ice. ''prófastsdæmi'', Swe. ''kontrakt''), an administrative territorial unit within the Lutheran national churches which comprises several parishes (''sogn'', Ice. ''sókn'', Swe. ''församling'' (previously ''socken'')). The provost is the immediate superior of the ‘parish priest’ (''sognepræst'' or ''sogneprest'', Ice. ''sóknarprestur'', Swe. ''församlingspräst'') but is normally also a parish priest in one of the local parishes. Several ''provstier'' form a [[Diocese]] (''stift'' (all languages) or ''bispedømme'', Ice. ''biskupsdæmi'', Swe. ''biskopsdöme'').

==Germany==
While the modern spelling is "''Propst''," in an historical context the spelling "''Probst''" may also occur. Historically, the title is also found among [[Military chaplain]]s, both Roman Catholic and Protestant (''e.g., Feldpropst'' in Prussia).

{{anchor|Anglican Church}}

==Anglican churches==
In England, the title of provost in cathedrals was almost completely replaced by that of dean, although sometimes when a bishop nominated himself as dean of his own cathedral, a provost was appointed as his deputy.

In cathedrals which were also [[parish church]]es, however, especially the newly created cathedrals of the 19th and 20th centuries, the senior priest (who was also the parish priest) continued to be known as the provost. This title was used by the head priests of [[St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham|Birmingham Cathedral]], [[Blackburn Cathedral]], [[Bradford Cathedral]], [[Chelmsford Cathedral]], [[Coventry Cathedral]], [[Derby Cathedral]], [[Leicester Cathedral]], [[Newcastle Cathedral]], [[Portsmouth Cathedral]], [[St. Edmundsbury Cathedral]], [[Sheffield Cathedral]], [[Southwark Cathedral]], [[Southwell Minster]], and [[Wakefield Cathedral]], but all were redesignated deans in 2000.

In the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] this tradition continues. The leading priests of the cathedrals, with the exception of the [[Cathedral of the Isles]] on [[Cumbrae]], are called provost.

The usage is preserved in the title of the heads of some colleges in England formerly administered by the Church.

==Roman Catholic Church==

In Germany, the heads of certain chapters under the Catholic church are still known as ''Probst'' or ''Propst''.

"Propstei" or "Propstei(pfarr)gemeinde" is the honorary designation for some important, old Roman Catholic churches in Germany; most honorary titles date back to the 20th century. The provosts (see "Propst" in German), being ordinary parish priests, have the privilege of wearing a prelate's dress (black-purple) and using a pectoral cross hung by a ribbon.

In Polish, ''[[wikt:proboszcz|proboszcz]]'' simply means ''parish priest'' (''pastor'' in the US usage), which is the chief priest in a parish, the Catholic counterpart of Anglican [[w:Vicar_(Anglicanism)|vicar]] or [[w:Rector_(ecclesiastical)#Anglican_churches|rector]].

The office of provost in the Roman Catholic Church, particularly when applied to the monastic role, falls under the category of [[prelate]], with a rank equivalent to that of a bishop. In a [[society of apostolic life]] such as an [[Oratory of St Philip Neri]], the provost is the major religious superior of his particular oratory. It is customary among Oratorians to call the provost "THE father" as he is ''primus inter pares'', and a father in the place of the founder, [[St Philip Neri]].

==Protestant Churches (General)==

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], usually following pre-Reformation traditional usage, and in connexion with certain churches, some Protestant pastors bore the title of provost. In these cases it was merely an honorific rank, without any special place in the church hierarchy. Such usage occurred, for example, in the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] and its successor [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg|Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]].

In certain [[Landeskirche]]n within the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], the title is still used for a pastor officiating as chairperson in a provostry (e.g. in the Lutheran [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Brunswick|Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Brunswick]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg|Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Mecklenburg]] and in the united Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau, and the [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]]). In the above-mentioned Lutheran churches, a provostry is equal to a [[deanery]], and, in the two united churches, it is a unit comprising several deaneries.

Moreover, in the united [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia]], the provost is the theological leader of the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]].

==Monasteries and Religious Houses==

The heads of Augustinian and Dominican friaries are termed "provost or prior" (''praepositus vel prior''), and those of [[Cistercian]] monasteries "provost or warden" (''praepositus vel custos''). The superiors of the Oratory are also known as provosts, as noted above.

==Religious Orders==

In some religious orders, especially those under the patronage of royalty or nobility, the ecclesial management of the Order is placed under the jurisdiction of a provost.

==Demographics of religion in Pakistan==
Based on information collected from the [[Library of Congress]], [[Pew Research Center]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[The World Factbook|World Factbook]], [[Oxford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] and others, the following is a list of estimations about the percentage of people professing different faiths in the country.

As of 2012, around 5,900,000 Pakistanis of non-Muslim faiths were holding the [[Computerised National Identity Card]] (CNIC cards) from [[National Database and Registration Authority]] (NADRA), which can only be obtained by citizens over 18 years of age. It is estimated that some 96% adult Pakistanis currently hold CNIC cards, and therefore the total adult population of non-Muslim religions seems to be over 3 million. Of the minority CNIC holders, 1,414,527 were [[Hindu]]s (769,647 males and 644,880 females), 1,270,051 were [[Christian]]s (731,713 males and 538,338 females), 125,681 were [[Ahmadi]] Muslims (63,479 males and 62,202 females), 33,734 were [[Bahai]]s, 6,146 were [[Sikh]]s, 4,020 were [[Parsi]]s, 1,492 were [[Buddhist]] and 66,898 were others (such as [[Kalash people|Kalasha]] Animists).&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; NADRA has made it near impossible to declare and change the religion to anything from Islam therefore the statistics must be looked at with a pinch of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/363182/losing-your-religion-nadra-should-not-be-deciding-peoples-faith/|title=Losing your religion?: ‘NADRA should not be deciding people’s faith’|date=2012-04-12|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufi===
Islam to some extent syncretized with pre-Islamic influences, resulting in a religion with some traditions distinct from those of the [[Arab]] world. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are [[Ali Hajweri]] in [[Lahore]] (ca. 11th century) and [[Shahbaz Qalander]] in [[Sehwan]], [[Sindh]] (ca. 12th century).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[Sufism]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] in [[pakpatan]] a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large popular following in Pakistan. Popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance. Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticize its popular character, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, 5 in 2010 that killed 64 people.&lt;ref name=NYTSufivideo&gt;{{cite news|title=Sufism Under Attack in Pakistan|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Produced by Charlotte Buchen|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTAtWarSufi&gt;{{cite news|title=The Islam That Hard-Liners Hate|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/the-islam-that-hard-liners-hate/|accessdate=2018-03-20|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2011-01-06|author=Huma Imtiaz|author2=Charlotte Buchen|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the last [[Census in Pakistan]], Ahmadi made up 0.22% of the population; however, the Ahmadiyya community boycotted the census. Independent groups generally estimate the population to be somewhere between two and five million Ahmadis. In media reports, four million is the most commonly cited figure.&lt;ref name=ahmadi&gt;The 1998 Pakistani census states that there are 291,000 (0.22%) Ahmadis in Pakistan. However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted figure and is approximately 2.2% of the country. See:

In 1974, the [[government of Pakistan]] amended the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] to define a [[Muslim]] according to Qu'ran 33:40,&lt;ref&gt;[https://quran.com/33/40]&lt;/ref&gt; as a person who believes in finality of [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]. Ahmadis believe in [[Muhammad]] as the best and the last law bearing prophet and [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as the [[Messiah]] of Muslims.  Consequently,  Ahmadis were declared [[Kafir|non-Muslims]] by a [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliamentary]] tribunal.

==Bahá'í==
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Pakistan begins previous to its independence when it was still under British colonial rule. The roots of the religion in the region go back to the first days of the [[Bábí]] religion in 1844,&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bahá'í Faith -Brief History|work=Official Website of the National Spiritual Assembly of India|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India|year=2003|url=http://www.bahaindia.org/intro/history.html|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi who was from [[Multan]].&lt;ref name="pk-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bahá’í Faith in Pakistan|work=Official Webpage of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Pakistan|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Pakistan|year=2008|url=http://www.bahai.pk/eng/history/historyPak.html|accessdate=2018-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170041/http://www.bahai.pk/eng/history/historyPak.html|archivedate=2013-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to the area that is current-day [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Momen|first=Moojan|last2=Smith|first2=Peter|title=Bahá'í History|work=Draft A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith|publisher= Bahá'í Library Online|url=http://bahai-library.com/encyclopedia_history|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{Main|Sikhism in Pakistan}}
[[File:Nankana Sahib.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Nankana Sahib]] Gurdwara in Punjab, Pakistan]]
In the 15th century the reformist Sikh movement originated in Pakistan's Punjab region where [[Sikhism]]'s founder as well as most of the faiths disciples originated from. There are a number of Sikhs living throughout Pakistan today; estimates vary, but the number is thought to be on the order of 20,000. In recent years, their numbers have increased with many Sikhs migrating from neighboring Afghanistan who have joined their co-religionists in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="State"/&gt; The shrine of [[Guru Nanak Dev]] is located in [[Nankana Sahib]] near the city of Lahore where many Sikhs from all over the world make pilgrimage to this and other shrines.

==Zoroastrianism==
[[File:Bvs 608.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Bai Virbaiji Soparivala Parsi  School, [[Karachi]]]]
{{Further information|Parsi people}}
There are at least 4,000 Pakistani citizen practicing the Zoroastrian religion.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; With the flight of Zoroastrians from Greater Iran into the Subcontinent, the Parsi communities were established. More recently, from the 15th century onwards, Zorastrians came to settle the coast of Sindh and have established thriving communities and commercial enterprises. These newer migrants were to be called Parsi. At the time of independence of Pakistan in 1947, Karachi and Lahore were home to a thriving [[Parsi people|Parsi]] business community. [[Karachi]] had the most prominent population of Parsis in Pakistan. After independence, many migrated abroad but a number remained. Parsis have entered Pakistani public life as social workers, business folk, journalists and diplomats. The most prominent Parsis of Pakistan today include [[Ardeshir Cowasjee]], [[Byram Dinshawji Avari]], [[Jamsheed Marker]], as well as [[Minocher Bhandara]]. The founding father of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], married [[Maryam Jinnah|Ratti Bai]] who belonged to a Parsi family before her conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/life_quaid05.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024215548/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/life_quaid05.htm|archivedate=2008-10-24|title=Quaid i Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah: Early days|publisher=Government of Pakistan|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalash==
[[File:Kalasha village guardians.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Guardians of a Kalasha village in the valley of Mumuret (Bumburet)]]
{{Main|Kalash people}}
This is [[pagan]] religion of the [[Kalash people]] living in a remote part of [[Chitral]]. Adherents of the Kalash religion number around 3,000 and inhabit three remote valleys in Chitral; Bumboret, Rumbur and Birir. Their religion is unique but shares some common ground with Greek, Macedonian Pagan, Vedic and Pre-Zoroastrian religions.

==Jainism==
[[File:Jain Temple 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Jain Temple of Bhodesar]]
{{Main|Jainism in Pakistan}}
Jainism existed in [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], before the partition in 1947, and even for several years after the partition. There is no evidence of any Jains living in Pakistan today, although it is claimed that a few still live in Sindh and Punjab provinces. They are number of disused Jain Temples found in different parts of Pakistan. [[Gulu Lalvani]], a famous Jain, was originally from Pakistan but he, like other Jains, emigrated from Pakistan. Baba Dharam Das Tomb is also found in Pakistan. The Jain temple at [[Godiji|Gori]] in Tharparkar was a major Jain pilgrimage center. The Jain Mandir Chowk at Lahore was the site of a [[Digambar]] Jain Temple. The memorial of Jain seer [[Vijayanandsuri]] at [[Gujranwala]] is now a police station.

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Buddhism in Pakistan}}
[[Buddhism]] has an ancient history in Pakistan; currently there is a small community of at least 1500 Pakistani Buddhist in the country.&lt;ref name="2012_religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghauri |first=Irfan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/430059/over-35000-buddhists-bahais-call-pakistan-home/ |title=Over 35,000 Buddhists, Baha’is call Pakistan home, By Irfan Ghauri Published: September 2, 2012, Dawn |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is dotted with numerous ancient and disused Buddhist stupas along the entire breath of the Indus River that courses through the heart of the country. Many Buddhist empires and city states existed, notably in Gandhara but also elsewhere in [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], Punjab and Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8wM-dNOa7fMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=A History of Sanskrit Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jews and Judaism in Pakistan}}
Various estimates suggest that there were about 1,500 Jews living in Pakistan at the time of its independence on 14 August 1947, with the majority living in Karachi and a few living in [[Peshawar]]. However, almost all emigrated to Israel after 1948. There are a few disused synagogues in both cities; while one Karachi synagogue was torn down for the construction of a shopping mall. The one in Peshawar still exists, although the building is not being used for any religious purpose. There is a small Jewish community of Pakistani origin settled in [[Ramla]], Israel.

One Pakistani, Faisal Khalid (AKA Fishel Benkhald) of Karachi claims to be Pakistan's only Jew. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/227964|title=Brothers of Pakistani man claiming to be Jewish call him insane|website=Israel National News|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vosizneias.com/267071|title=Karachi, Pakistan - Brothers Of Pakistani Man Claiming Jewish Roots Call Him 'Insane'|website=VosIzNeias|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He falsely claimed that his mother is Jewish (making him Jewish by [[Matrilineality in Judaism|Jewish custom]]) but, because his father is a Muslim, Pakistani authorities refuse to recognize him as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/150205/pakistans-last-jew-battle-win-empathy|title=Pakistan's last Jew in battle to win 'empathy'|author=Simon Caldwell|date=2015-11-26|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/848760/last-jew-in-pakistan-beaten-by-mob-arrested/|title='Last Jew in Pakistan' beaten by mob, arrested|work=Express Tribune|date=2015-03-06|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/04/09/news-opinion/world/brothers-of-pakistani-man-claiming-jewish-roots-call-him-insane|title=Brothers of Pakistani man claiming Jewish roots call him ‘insane’|date=2017-04-09|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irreligion==
{{Main|Irreligion in Pakistan}}
There are people who do not profess any faith (such as [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]) in Pakistan, but their numbers are not known.&lt;ref name=Farooqi&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/09/being-pakistani-and-atheist-a-dangerous-combo-but-some-ready-to-brave-it/|title=Being Pakistani and atheist a dangerous combo, but some ready to brave it|work=Pakistan Today|date=2011-09-17|accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are particularly in the affluent areas of the larger cities. Some were born in [[Secularism|secular]] families while others in religious ones. According to the 1998 census, people who did not state their religion accounted for 0.5% of the population, but social pressure against claiming no religion was strong.&lt;ref name="State"/&gt; A 2012 study by Gallup Pakistan found that people not adhering to any religion account for 1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallup.com.pk/Polls/240712.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secularism in Israel''' shows how matters of religion and how matters of state are related within Israel. [[Secularism]] is defined as an indifference to, rejection or exclusion of religion and religious consideration.&lt;ref name=Secularism&gt;{{cite web|title=Secularism Definition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secularism|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]] this applies to the entirely secular community that identifies with no religion and the secular community within the [[Jewish]] community which identifies with no particular division of the religion.  When Israel was established as a new state in 1948, a new and different [[Jewish identity]] formed for the newly created Israeli population. This population was defined by the Israeli culture and [[Hebrew]] language, their experience with the [[Holocaust]], and the need to band together against conflict with hostile neighbors in the Middle East. This is not an identity with which Jews outside of Israel can easily identify.&lt;ref name=Religion&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Secularism in Israel|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,469996,00.html|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 1922 many official documents originating in the land of Israel gave rise to religious freedom and secularism. In 1922 the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument) |Palestinian Mandate]] prohibited discrimination based on religious affiliation. In 1948, at the establishment of the state of Israel, the Declaration of Independence again protects freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Religion in Israel|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/freedom.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Declaration of Establishment of the State of Israel]] was approved by members of the Jewish community of Palestine and the [[Zionist movement]]. The documents first section sheds light on the relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name=Declaration&gt;{{cite web|title=The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/decind.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|work=18 October 2011|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reads “the Land of Israel,[ Palestine] was the birthplace of the Jewish people. Here their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped.” The history of the Jews establishing the State of Israel is long. The right of the Jewish people to settle in the land was recognized in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. The United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution that called for a Jewish state to be established in Eretz-Israel on November 29, 1947.&lt;ref name=Establishment&gt;{{cite web|title=The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation of religion and state==
When the idea of political Zionism was introduced by [[Theodor Herzl]], his idea was that Israel would be a secular state which would not be influenced at all by religion. When [[David Ben-Gurion]] founded the state of Israel he put religious leaders at the head of the government next to secular Jews in the government. Many westernized Israelis feel constrained by the strict religious sanctions imposed on them. Many businesses close on [[Shabbat]], including [[EL AL]], Israel’s leading airline, many forms of public transportation, and restaurants.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt;

===Policies controlled by religious leaders===
In order to be formally married in Israel, a Jewish couple has to be married by a [[rabbi]]. This also applies when and if a couple would like to divorce, they must seek out rabbinical council. Since many secular Israelis find this absurd they often go abroad to be married, often in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt; Marriages officiated abroad are recognized as official marriages in Israel.&lt;ref name=NonJewish&gt;{{cite web|title='Non-Jewish' Jews endure challenges living in Israel|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/nonjewish_jews_endure_challenges_living_in_israel_20080104/|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, all food at army bases and in cafeterias of government buildings has to be [[Kosher]] even though the majority of Israelis do not follow these dietary laws.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt;

===Religious influences in politics===
Many religious symbols have found their way into Israeli national symbols. For example, the flag of the country is similar to a [[tallit]], or prayer shawl, with its blue stripes. The national coat of arms displays the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]].&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt; The Israeli national anthem includes a few references of religion. “As long as the Jewish spirit is yearning” and “the two-thousand-year-old hope” are both lines in the anthem, "[[HaTikvah]]" (“The Hope”).&lt;ref name=HaTikvah&gt;{{cite web|title=HaTikvah|url=http://stateofisrael.com/anthem/|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
In Israel certain cities and regions are known for their more secular or religious qualities. [[Tel Aviv]], the port city, for example, is a direct example of a secular city. It is very cosmopolitan with modern hotels, boutiques, coffee shops, and loud music on Friday night. Non-Jews and secular Jews alike feel very comfortable in this city because of the lack of religious bearing. Tel Aviv is a modern city similar to a coastal city in the United States like [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=TelAviv&gt;{{cite web|title=Tel Aviv: Secular City|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/95dec/telaviv/telaviv.htm|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tel Aviv is even considered one of the top party cities in the world. It is typical to find bars and night clubs open until dawn, even on Shabbat.&lt;ref name=Party&gt;{{cite news|title=World's Top 10 Party Towns|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/activity/food-and-wine/the-worlds-top-10-party-towns-20091118-im4q.html|accessdate=2 November 2011 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in the Jewish population==
The Jewish population of Israel, can be divided, albeit imperfectly, into three groups: Orthodox, Traditional, and Secular. The largest group is the Secular Jews making up 41.4% of the Jewish population, followed by the Traditional Jews accounting for 38.5% of the population, with the remaining 20% populated by the orthodox and ultra-orthodox.  In Israel, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movements are estimated to make up 7.6% of the Jewish population,&lt;ref&gt;https://7minim.wordpress.com/2013/06/20/poll/&lt;/ref&gt; a significantly lower rate compared to the Jewish diaspora.

===Secular===
Secular Jews in Israel identify as being Jewish because they serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (army), they celebrate [[Jewish holidays]] (usually not in strict conformity with [[Jewish Law]]), and speak Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/weinerinis.html|title=An American in Israel|author=Rebecca Weiner|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the population makes up 41.4% of the Jewish population.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|title=Central Bureau of Statistics, Statistical Abstract of Israel 2011|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton62/st07_04x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Jews are largely supporters of the [[Israeli Labor Party]] and a Secular Zionist state.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"/&gt; Many secular Israelis identify as Jewish, but the religion is only one aspect of their identity. Even many secular Jews practice certain aspects of the religion, such as having a [[Passover Seder]] or fasting during [[Yom Kippur]]. It would not be uncommon to see a secular family to light Shabbat candles, say the blessings over food and wine, have a Shabbat dinner together and then for the parents to get into their car and drive their children to the movies.&lt;ref name=Religion /&gt;

===Traditional===
Masorti/Traditional Jews make up 30.5% of the Jewish population in Israel.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"/&gt;  This is the second largest group.  Many of these "traditional Jews" differ from the Orthodox only because they will drive their cars on the Sabbath, use electricity, watch television, or go to a soccer game or the beach, frequently after attending religious services in the morning and the evening before. Many of the men wrap [[tefillin]] every morning, others cover the spectrum of observance.  What is critical is that all are committed to a major religious component in the definition of their Jewishness and the Jewishness of the Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/howrelisr.htm|title=How Religious are Israeli Jews?|author=Daniel J. Elazar|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Jews make up most of the [[Likud]] political party.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/29/world/the-israeli-jews-4-distict-camps.html | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas L. | last=Friedman | title=The Israeli Jews: 4 {{sic|nolink=y|Distict|expected=Distinct}} Camps| date=29 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox===
27.9% of the Jewish population identifies as Orthodox ("dati") or ultra-Orthodox.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"/&gt;  Most of the Orthodox and some ultra-Orthodox, believe that secular Zionist nationalism and Judaism can successfully work and live together in Israel. Politically they align with [[National Religious Party]], the Morasha Party and by the two state-appointed Chief Rabbis. Orthodox Jews are often seen wearing knitted [[yarmulkes]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The ultra-Orthodox (Charedi) are the smallest part of the population, representing only 12% of Jews living in Israel.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"/&gt; The Charedim tend to live in their own communities and live according to Jewish law by following moral and dress codes passed down from ancestors. This part of the population is often seen wearing black hats or yarmulkes and some [[Hasidic]] sects are related to Hasidic sects in the United States.

==Discrimination issues==
[[File:Parkannabe001.jpg|thumb|right|Anaba Park in Modi'in]]

===Housing===
As of November 2012, secular and Orthodox Jews are competing in a bidding war for apartments in [[Harish, Israel|Harish]] after a court ruled that the [[Israel Land Administration]] could not discriminate between them.&lt;ref&gt;

==Membership in the United Nations==
In 1949 Israel became part of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Members&gt;{{cite web|title=Member States|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a state becomes part of the United Nations, the state adopts the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In the Declaration there are many instances that reflect a country’s need for religious freedom.  The Preamble of the Declaration states that it is  “a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.” In the Declaration both articles 2 and 18 reference freedom of religion. In article 2 it states that everyone is entitled to all the rights without any distinction such as religion. Article 18 states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and has the right to show their religion in teaching, practice, worship and observance.&lt;ref name=Universal&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|work=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Jews in Israel==
In Israel, to be considered legally Jewish by the rabbinate you have to have a Jewish mother. This excludes a large portion of the immigrant population that moved to Israel from the former [[Soviet Union]] and many parts of Europe and had previously identified as Jewish even though they did not have a Jewish mother.  This part of the population accounts for around 320,000 people who serve in the Israeli Defense Forces and celebrate Jewish holidays.&lt;ref name=NonJewish /&gt;

Israel legally recognizes thirteen non-Jewish religious communities, each of which practice their own religious family law. The largest religious minority population is the [[Muslim]] community of Israel and it amounts to 17.3% of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;"Population, by Religion". Statistical Abstract of Israel. Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. 11 September 2012. Retrieved 5 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim communities live mostly in the northern part of the country. The Orthodox Jewish and the Muslim population have the highest population growth of all communities in Israel.&lt;ref name=Growth&gt;{{cite web|title=1.16 Million Muslims in Israel, Growth Rate Slowing|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128757#.Tp8d19TczsM|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;They are free under the law to vote, practice religion, be members of the [[Israeli parliament]] and can use the same Israeli education system as the rest of the country, although the education system is de facto mostly bifurcated into Jewish and non-Jewish schools (see [[Education in Israel]]). Many Arabs are a part of the Israeli government and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/article/364746/arabs-are-prominent-israels-government-deroy-murdock Arabs Are Prominent in Israel's Government], ''National Review'' November 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Almost one 10th of the parliament are Arab and there is a [[mosque]] in the parliament building ([[Knesset]]) for those who are Muslim. A supreme court justice and a minister of the Israeli cabinet are also Arab Muslims. Muslims, as well as other religious minorities, are not required to serve in the army, however.

The next largest minority population is the [[Christian]] population (2%), many of whom live with Jewish communities.&lt;ref name=NonJewish /&gt; Rather than have their own education and medical institutions they have integrated into state institutions. The Christian population in Israel is the only Christian population in the Middle East that has grown in the last half century.  Christians choose to live in Israel because they have freedom of speech and the freedom to practice religion.&lt;ref name=Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth and Fact: Christians in Israel |url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=104341 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716102501/http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=104341 |archivedate=July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4790">'''Sepermeru''' (or Spermeru) was a town in [[Ancient Egypt]], located roughly between [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolis]] to the north and [[Oxyrhynchus]] to the south in what was considered the XIX Upper Egyptian [[nome (Egypt)|nome]].

During the [[Ramesside Period]] of Pharaohs, Sepermeru enjoyed some prominence as both a largely populated religious, military, and administrative center for the XIX Nome. The latter district was situated near the [[Bahr Yusuf]] canal, which connected the [[Nile]] with the [[Fayyum]] region (cf. S. Katary, Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period, p.&amp;nbsp;215; O'Connor, Man, Settlement and Urbanism, pp.&amp;nbsp;690–91). The meaning of the town's name ("near to the desert") signifies its status as a frontier community (cf. H. te Velde, Seth: God of Confusion, p.&amp;nbsp;118, n.2) and was thus a suitable cult center for the god [[Set (mythology)|Seth]].

According to [[Wilbour Papyrus]] (cf. Gardiner, Commentary, 28, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–128), by [[Dynasty XIX]] there existed two land-owning [[Egyptian temple|temple]] institutions within the main Seth-enclosure at Sepermeru. The larger of these two institutions was the "House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru," and the smaller a temple dedicated to his consort, [[Nephthys]], and called the "House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun." It is not known how long the temple of Seth had been established in Sepermeru before Dynasty XIX, but it is evident that the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation (or refurbishment) of [[Ramesses II]], which dates this particular institution to that Pharaoh's reign (1279-1213 BCE). 

Both temples (and their respective land-holdings) were apparently under separate administration; the Prophet Huy administered the House of Seth in Dynasty XIX and XX.  Yet, as Katary notes, "What cannot be established from the evidence of P. Wilbour is the authority of any particular prophet of the House of Seth over the House of Nephthys," and: "Although Huy may have been the chief administrator of the House of Nephthys as well as his own temple, he was most certainly not in charge of the administration of the...fields of the House of Nephthys, such fields being the responsibility of two prophets of Nephthys, Merybarse...and Penpmer." (Katary, Land Tenure in the Ramesside Period, pp.&amp;nbsp;219–220).

There were at least two more subsidiary shrines in Sepermeru in Dynasties XIX and XX: a sanctuary called the "House of Seth, Powerful-is-His-Mighty-Arm," and a cult-place called "The Sunshade of Re-Horakhte" (P. Wilbour, A45,11 and S29 and 169). Like the Nephthys temple, these smaller shrines were considered affiliations or dependencies "within the House" (or primary temple enclosure) of Seth, who was supreme "Lord" of the town.

Sepermeru is perhaps of most interest to modern Egyptologists because of its status as one of the chief ancient Egyptian cult centers of Seth, along with the cities of [[Ombos]], [[Nagada]], and [[Avaris]]. It is thought that the cult of Seth waned considerably after Dynasty XX, due to the increasing "demonization" of this deity and his association with territories and priorities increasingly considered foreign to the general interests of Egypt. Religious and administrative prominence in Nome XIX was duly shifted south to Oxyrhynchus after this time (cf. te Velde, Seth: God of Confusion, p.&amp;nbsp;139). We know, however, that Seth continued to be the object of veneration in cult centers on the outskirts of Egypt well into Roman times, especially at [[Deir el-Hagar]] ([[Dakhla Oasis]]), [[Kellis]], [[Mut]], and [[Kharga]] (cf. te velde, van Dijk, Essays, p.&amp;nbsp;236). It may be that Seth's cult survived in some form at Sepermeru, long after Sepermeru's decline as a religious center. Indeed, a late inscription in the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] temple of Horus at Edfu makes reference to "Seth of Sepermeru," albeit with an insulting caveat that the god's canals in this district had become "dried-up and useless" (cf. P. Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexikon, p.&amp;nbsp;827). 

The foundations of both the Seth and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru were excavated and identified in the 1980s (cf. R. Lachaud, Les Deesses, p.&amp;nbsp;51). Therefore, the site is also of some interest for boasting remnants of the only surviving temple of Nephthys, along with her temple at [[Komir]], near the ancient site of [[Esna]].

'''Serra Springs''' are a pair of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] located on the campus of [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceres.ca.gov/geo_area/counties/Los_Angeles/landmarks.html California State Historical Landmarks in Los Angeles County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403032550/http://www.ceres.ca.gov/geo_area/counties/Los_Angeles/landmarks.html |date=2007-04-03 }} at [[California Environmental Resources Evaluation System|CERES]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are designated by [[California Historical Landmark]] #522.&lt;ref name=CHL&gt;{{cite ohp|522|Serra Springs|2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The springs, called '''Kuruvungna''' by the native [[Tongva people|Gabrieleno Tongva]] people, were used as a source of natural fresh water by the Tongva people since at least the 5th century BC and continue to produce 22,000-25,000 gallons of water a day.&lt;ref name="spring age"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120911225537/http://clkrep.lacity.org/councilfiles/05-1009_mot_5-17-05.pdf Motion (Department of Transportation) for installion of ceremonial street signs]&lt;/ref&gt; The springs are also sometimes referred to as the '''Gabrieleno Tongva Springs''', the '''Tongva Holy Springs''', and the '''Sacred Springs'''. The springs are found at two separate locations on the high school campus. The larger is now closed off from the rest of the campus and is under the care of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation. The other spring is located on the northeastern edge of the so-called Girls' Field. A third spring was located farther north, near Texas Avenue, but it ceased to flow during the 1940s when a local water company began drawing from the aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;The Chieftain (Yearbook), 1974 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The springs have a UCLA Archaeological designation of CA-LAN-382.&lt;ref name="before columbus day"/&gt;

The Tongva were described in unpublished diary of [[Juan Crespí]], who traveled with the [[Portolà expedition|Portolá Expedition of 1769]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;as we arrived and set up camp, six very friendly, compliant tractable heathens came over, who had their little houses roofed with grass, the first we have been seeing of this sort. Three of them came wearing a great deal of paint; all of them, however unarmed. They brought four or six bowls of usual seeds and good sage which they presented to our captain; on me they bestowed a good sized string of the sort of beads that they all have, made of white sea shells and red ones (though not very bright colored) that look to be coral, though of a very inferior sort.&lt;ref name="Before Columbus"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name Serra comes from [[Junípero Serra]] the founder of the [[Alta California]] [[Spanish missions in California|mission]] chain, who is reported to have said [[mass (Roman Rite)|mass]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Crespi renamed the springs "San Gregorio" while visiting the Tongva village at the springs with the Portola Expedition in 1769, but the expedition soldiers called them "El Berrendo" after wounding a deer there. Later, around the turn of the 19th century, the two springs began to be called "The Tears of Santa Monica" because they brought to mind the weeping eyes of the saint as she cried for her erring son. "Santa Monica", as an official place name, was first recorded in 1827 on a grazing permit, next in 1828 when the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica was granted to Marques and Reyes.

Later, in 1839, the name was used again for Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica when it was [[Spanish land grants in California|granted]] to Sepulveda and Machado. Kuruvungna Springs was included in this rancho, the first time it had been "owned" by anyone other than the indigenous inhabitants. Jose Delores Sepulveda, one of the sons of the rancho's owner, lived in the Sepulveda adobe which once stood on the high ground near Bundy Ave and Wilshire Blvd overlooking the Kuruvungna village site and the springs.

The canyon, the ranchos, the city, the bay, the mountains, the boulevard, the airport and the freeway are all called after a former turn-of-the-19th-century name for Kuruvungna Springs.&lt;ref&gt;
Hancock, Ralph, "Fabulous Boulevard", 1949, Funk &amp; Wagnalls&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, the spring served as the water supply for the city of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].&lt;ref name="spring age"/&gt;

[[File:One of the Serra springs.jpg|thumb|The smallest of the Springs bubbling from underground]]

==University High School==
Shortly after the [[Sawtelle, Los Angeles, California#History of the city of Sawtelle|annexation of Sawtelle]], construction began at the springs to build Warren G. Harding High School, later renamed [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]]. Construction at the school in 1925 unearthed evidence of an Indian village.&lt;ref name="community plan"/&gt; The springs were landscaped to make them a feature of the campus. The waters of the upper spring were made to cascade down a small waterfall (still extant) and also fill a wishing well (demolished).

The source of the lower springs was left open, as it still is, so one could see the water bubbling up through the sand. The overflow fills a large pond with a small island before being directed into a storm drain. The pond was surrounded with manicured lawns and served as a gathering place for students and the setting for group graduation photos. However, the springs corner of the campus fell into disrepair in the 1980s and began to be used as a dump. After the Gabrielino Tongva Springs Foundation removed tons of trash from the site in the 1990s, the area around the springs was planted with tule reeds and other native plants.

In 1975, a grave containing a small skeleton and soapstone bowls was discovered by students and a science teacher from what archaeologists now believe to be a burial site.&lt;ref name="community plan"/&gt; This grave was dated to approximately [[4000 BCE]] and the character of the bowls suggested kinship with the culture of [[Santa Catalina Island (California)|Santa Catalina Island]] in the same era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In 1980 [[Indian Springs Continuation High School]], which is housed on the part of the campus where the springs are, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;[[California Department of Education]]'s [http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/sd/details.asp?cds=19647331930999&amp;Public=Y California School Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, developers proposed an underground parking lot one block north of the springs which would have cut off the spring's water. In response, tribal descendants, community members and teachers and students from the school founded a non-profit foundation, the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation, and after a two-year fight, the proposed parking structure was voted down.&lt;ref name="Before Columbus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA School Uses Sacred Tongva Site"/&gt;

The foundation currently leases the site from the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] in order to use the location for their monthly ceremony and guided tours, and received a $7,000 grant from Los Angeles' Environmental Affairs Department to enhance the area with different types of trees, vines and herbs.&lt;ref name="Before Columbus"/&gt;

In 1992, the newly established Gabrieleno Springs Foundation held the first annual Life Before Columbus Day event.&lt;ref name="before columbus day"&gt;[http://www.onionskin.com/gabrielino/before-columbus.htm Annual "Life Before Coumbus Day Event"]&lt;/ref&gt; The event takes place just before Columbus day every year and celebrates the history of the land and of the Tongva people. Previous events have drawn more than 600 people,&lt;ref name="Before Columbus"/&gt; including Native Americans from various tribes, local politicians, community members and students and faculty from the school.&lt;ref name="heritage celebrated"&gt;{{cite news

Gabrielino/Tongva Springs", and called for the creation of a task force created by University
High School's administration, "in consultation with the Gabrielino/Tongva
Springs Foundation and the Los Angeles Unified School District". The bill appropriated $50,000 to the department to be spent on a local assistance grant to the task force, "to plan for the preservation of
the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs, and property adjacent thereto...in order to enhance environmental, cultural, and
educational opportunities."&lt;ref name="SB 1956"&gt;[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_1951-2000/sb_1956_bill_19980625_amended_asm.html SB 1956 Amended] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212091016/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_1951-2000/sb_1956_bill_19980625_amended_asm.html |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shacharit''' {{IPA-he|ʃaχaˈʁit|}} ({{lang-he-n|שַחֲרִית}} ''šaḥăriṯ''),&lt;ref&gt;Shachrith (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|שַׁחרִית}}) – with a {{Hebrew|שוא נח}} – in the [[Yemenite Hebrew|Yemenite tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Shacharis''' in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], is the morning [[Tefillah]] (prayer) of the [[Jews|Jewish people]], one of the three daily prayers.

Different traditions identify different primary components of Shacharit. Essentially all agree that [[Pesukei dezimra]], the [[Shema]] and its blessings, and the [[Amidah]] are major sections. Some identify the preliminary blessings and readings, as a first, distinct section. Others say that [[Tachanun]] is a separate section, as well as the concluding blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/287,134/What-is-Shacharit.html |title=What is Shacharit?  |publisher=Askmoses.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On certain days, there are additional prayers and services added to Shacharit, including [[Mussaf]] and a [[Torah reading]].

==Origin==
Shacharit according to tradition was identified as a time of prayer by Abraham, as {{bibleref|Genesis|19:27|HE}} states, "Abraham arose early in the morning," which traditionally is the first Shacharit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/services.html |title=Daily Services |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abraham's prayer did not become a standardized prayer. The sages of the [[Great Assembly]] may have formulated blessings and prayers that later became part of Shacharit.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 1:4&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[siddur]], or prayerbook as we know it, was not fully formed until around the 7th century [[common era|CE]] The prayers said still vary among congregations and [[Jewish ethnic divisions|Jewish communities]].

Shacharit was also instituted in part as a replacement of the daily morning [[Temple in Jerusalem#Temple services|Temple service]] after the destruction of the Temple.

===Etymology===
Shacharit comes from the Hebrew root {{Hebrew|שחר}} (''shakhar''), meaning dawn.

In [[Eastern Yiddish]], praying is also identified by the verb ''daven'', which comes from the same [[Latin]] root as the English word ''divine.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davening.net/ |title=davening.net |publisher=davening.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Davening Shacharit'' is the [[Yinglish]] term for doing the service.

==Service==
During or before Shacharit, Jews put on their [[tefillin]] and/or [[tallit]], according to their tradition. Both actions are accompanied by [[Berakhah|blessings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/tallit.htm |title=Judaism 101: Donning Tallit and Tefillin |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some do not eat until they have prayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naalehupdate.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/eating-before-davening/ |title=Eating Before Davening  |publisher=Naalehupdate.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, a series of introductory prayers are said as the start of Shacharit. The main pieces of these prayers are [[Pesukei dezimra]], consisting of numerous psalms, hymns, and prayers. Pesukei dezimra is said so that an individual will have praised God before making requests, which might be considered rude.

The [[Shema]] and its related blessings are said. One should "concentrate on fulfilling the positive commandment of reciting the ''Shema''" before reciting it. One should be sure to say it clearly and not to slur words together.&lt;ref&gt;The Artscroll Siddur, Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amidah|Shemoneh Esrei]] (The Amidah), a series of 19 blessings is recited. On Shabbat and Yom Tov, only 7 blessings are said. The blessings cover a variety of issues and ethics such as [[Jerusalem]], crops, and prayer.

[[Tachanun]], a supplication consisting of a collection of passages from the [[Tanakh|Hebrew bible]] (Tanakh) is said. On Mondays and Thursdays, a longer version is recited. On other days, the extra parts are omitted. The main part of Tachanun is traditionally said with one's head resting on his or her arm. 

On certain days, there is a [[Torah reading]] at this point in the service. On most days, three aliyot are given as honors. Seven are given on Shabbat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templesanjose.org/JudaismInfo/Torah/howtoaliyah.htm How to have an Aliyah to the Torah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020814053036/http://www.templesanjose.org/JudaismInfo/Torah/howtoaliyah.htm |date=2002-08-14 }}. templesanjose.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The service concludes, typically with [[Adon Olam]], [[Psalm of the Day]], and Prayer for Peace.

==Timing==
{{also|Zmanim}}
According to [[Jewish law]], the earliest time to recite the morning service is when there is enough natural light "one can see a familiar acquaintance six feet away." It is a subjective standard. After sunrise and before mid-day is the usual time for this prayer service. The latest time one may recite the morning service is astronomical noon referred to as ''chatzot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/bechukotai63/print.htm|title=Torah Tidbits&amp;nbsp;– Shabbat Parshat B'chuotai|publisher=Orthodox Union Israel Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907201054/http://www.ou.org/torah/tt/5763/bechukotai63/print.htm|archivedate=2012-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the afternoon service can be recited; it is called [[mincha]].

The '''Shangqing School''' (Chinese:上清) or '''Supreme Clarity''' is a [[Daoist]] movement that began during the aristocracy of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin]] dynasty. Shangqing can be translated as either 'Supreme Clarity' or 'Highest Clarity.' The first leader of the school was a woman, [[Wei Huacun]] (251-334). According to her Shangqing hagiographers, her devotion to Daoist cultivation so impressed a number of immortals that she received revelations from them 31 volumes of Daoist scriptures which would become the foundation of Shangqing Daoism. Later, [[Tao Hongjing]] (Chinese: 陶弘景) (456－536) structured the theory and practice and compiled the [[Taoist canon|canon]]. He greatly contributed to the development of the school that took place near the end of the 5th century. The mountain near [[Nanjing]] where Tao Hongjing had his retreat, Maoshan (茅山), today remains the principal seat of the school.

Shangqing practice values [[meditation]] techniques of visualization and breathing, as well as physical exercises, as opposed to the use of [[internal alchemy|alchemy]] and [[Amulet|talismans]]. The recitation of the sacred canon plays an equally important role. The practice was essentially individualistic, contrary to the collective practices in the [[Way of the Celestial Master|Celestial Master]] school or in the [[Lingbao School]]. Recruiting from high social classes, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], Shangqing was the dominant school of Daoism, and its influence is found in literature of the time period. The importance of the school only began to diminish beginning from the second half of the [[Song dynasty]]. Under the [[Yuan dynasty]], the movement was known by the name Maoshan and the focus changed from meditation to rituals and talismans. In the 21st century, Maoshan Daoism is still practiced but its current techniques are very different from the original techniques developed at the beginning of the school.

==History==

Lady Wei Huacun, an aristocrat from the Jin dynasty and a Celestial Master practitioner, was the first leader of the Shangqing School. Three decades after her death, from 364 to 370, [[Yang Xi]] (330-c. 386) supposedly had revelations "aided almost certainly by [[cannabis]]" ([[Joseph Needham]] 1980:213) and transcribed texts from a group of immortals and spirits that appeared to him. These texts eventually formed the basis of the school’s beliefs. The revelation began to spread in aristocratic circles of South China, and eventually Tao Hongjing, advisor to the princes of Qi, joined the group. He commented upon, and compiled the Shangqing texts, and developed a well-structured system consisting of a pantheon and new ways to reach immortality that depended upon meditation. More interested in Daoism and [[Buddhism]] than in public administration, in 492 he received authorization to leave the court. He moved to Maoshan, which had by now become the center of the school. There, with the help of the [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor Wudi]] of the [[Liang dynasty]], he built the temple of Huayang, the first Shangqing temple.

After his death, the school continued to prosper, and recruited many people from the aristocracy. From its beginning near Nanjing, the school expanded to the north after laws passed in 504 and 517 forced several masters of the school to go into exile. Ironically this expulsion helped spread the movement to the north, and did little to weaken the schools organization in the south. The Daoist encyclopedia published under the patronage of the [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Northern Zhou]] (561-578) placed a great deal of importance on the Shangqing texts.

The Shangqing School dominated the Daoist movements under the Tang. During this period, all of its leaders received a title from the emperor. Emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] personally visited three of the temples on Maoshan, and in 731 the [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] emperor put Shangqing deities in charge of China’s sacred mountains. The Daoist section of the imperial encyclopedia was composed primarily of Shangqing texts.
[[Image:TaoHongJing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tao Hongjing, responsible for the compilation of Shangqing texts.]]
At the same time, the Shangqing school underwent a transformation and integrated texts from the Lingbao School as well as from the Way of the Celestial Master school. The clergy also became more important and more emphasis was put on public rituals.

During the second of half of the [[Northern Song dynasty]], the influence of Shangqing Daoism declined at the court, but still remained, changing its focus to rituals and talismans. New buildings appeared on Maoshan that survived until the [[Cultural Revolution]] of [[Mao Zedong]]. Under the Song, some of the Shangqing leaders still benefited from imperial favour such as the 23rd leader, Zhu Ziying who received the title of ‘national master’ from the court. The 35th and 44th masters, Ren Yuanpu and Wang Daomeng, were equally distinguished for having ended a grasshopper invasion and a flood. Under the Yuan dynasty, the Shangqing school integrated itself under the Zhengyi alliance. At the end of the 20th century, the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] army and the Cultural Revolution have resulted in the complete destruction of the temples on Maoshan. Two of the temples, Jiuxiaogong and Yuanfugong have been rebuilt more for tourists than for religious purposes.

==Practices==

Shangqing Daoism has borrowed many concepts and beliefs from both the Celestial Masters as well as from [[Ge Hong]]’s alchemical tradition. However, the absorption of elixirs and other potions aimed to attain immortality was largely replaced in the Song period by [[internal alchemy]] that was more linked to meditation techniques (see the ''[[Zuowanglun]]'').

An emphasis was placed on personal meditation in the Shangqing school, unlike the ritualized system of the Celestial Masters. Shangqing meditation was largely a solitary affair, and focused on mental visualization of spirits and gods. There was also no requirement to meditate at a temple; one’s own home was fine. Deities lived inside the body and could provide good health if meditated upon. Each deity inhabited a different part of the body. Through studying the descriptions of deities in the canon, adepts would contemplate the inside of their body and maintain the deities in their proper place. This would ensure the body’s durability. While it began as a school centered on the individual, the school changed progressively until talismans and rituals became a more important aspect.

==Pantheon==

The main god of the Shangqing School is known as the Venerable Sovereign, the first of the [[Three Pure Ones]]. The pantheon included gods that could be turned to for help, ones that could be revered and others that could be commanded. As described by Tao Hongjing, the pantheon occupied twenty-eight pages in Shangqing texts, but the most important deities are scarcely mentioned. The canon mostly contains information about the gods that lived within the body.

==Canon==

The principal text of the Shangqing School is known as The True Text of the Great Dong (Dadong Zhenjing). Dong can be translated as cave or grotto, but also has other meanings such as ‘to communicate.’&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; When the texts were dictated to Yang Xi, the immortals told him that they were the condensed form of primordial [[qi]], and existed before the world was born. Eventually the texts congealed and were sent by heaven to be dictated to Yang.

Recitation and veneration of the texts was extremely important. The transmission of texts was strictly controlled, and only a master could give a text to a disciple. The texts could never be revealed to those outside the school.

'''Shlomo Elyashiv (Eliashov)''' (January 5, 1841 [12 [[Tevet]] 5602] - March 13, 1926 [27 [[Adar]], 5676]) ({{lang-he-n|שלמה בן חיים חייקל אלישיב}}),  also known as the ''Leshem'' or ''Ba'al HaLeshem'', was a famous [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]], who was born in [[Šiauliai]], [[Lithuania]], and later moved to then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] . 

==Biography==
His father was Rabbi [[Chayim Chaikl Eliashoff]]. 

Rabbi Elyashev, a brilliant [[talmudist]], studied in the yeshivot of [[Minsk]] and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In addition to his own works on Kabbalah (''Leshem''), he was instrumental in printing works of earlier kabbalists.&lt;ref name="orot"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Naor |first1=Bezalel |title=Rav Kook and Rav Shlomo Elyashev (“Leshem”) (1841-1926) |url=http://orot.com/rav-kook-and-rav-shlomo-elyashev-leshem-1841-1926/ |website=Orot |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aliyah== 
Eliashiv taught Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] Kabbalah when Rabbi Kook was the young rabbi of the town of [[Žeimelis|Zoimel]]. Rabbi Kook was granted a month-long leave of absence to study with the famous [[kabbalist]] in [[Shavel]].&lt;ref name="orot"/&gt;

In 1922, when Rabbi Kook was serving as [[chief rabbi]] of Jerusalem, Rabbi Elyashiv asked him for assistance in settling in [[Eretz Yisrael]]. Due to Rav Kook’s intervention, the great kabbalist, his son-in-law, daughter, and his eleven-year-old grandson (who would grow up to be the great scholar Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]]), were allowed to emigrate to the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name="JewishAction"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinreb |first1=Tzvi Hersh |title=Rav Kook &amp; Rav Elyashiv |url=https://jewishaction.com/jewish-world/people/rav-kook-rav-elyashiv/ |website=Jewish Action |publisher=Orthodox Union |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"One particularly poignant story tells of a visit the revered Leshem paid to the chief rabbi. It was a bitterly cold winter evening and Rav Kook noted that the Leshem had no coat. Rav Kook immediately took his own fur-lined coat from his closet and gave it to the elderly man as a gift. This coat remained in the Elyashiv family as an heirloom and was periodically worn by Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] on wintry days."&lt;ref name="JewishAction"/&gt;

Rabbi Elyashiv passed away in 1926, and is buried in [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery]] in [[Jerusalem]].

==Works==
The primary work for which Elyashiv is known is ''[[Leshem Shevo V’Achlama]]'', which was written in four parts and released in the following order:

* ''Drushei Olam HaTohu'' (''Sefer HaDei'ah'') - Elyashiv details what happened, based upon the Zohar, Arizal, and the Vilna Gaon, from the first moment of God’s emanation of light that we are allowed to study, until physical Creation itself.
* ''Hakdamot u’She’arim'' (''HaKadosh'') - An introduction to Elyashiv's system, based upon the idea of five major revelations that occur between the Divine and humanity; it also contains a discussion of the Sarugian Lurianic system, particularly of the idea of the "malbush"
* ''Sha’arei Leshem Shevo V’Achlama'', ''Sefer HaBeiurim''
* ''Sha’arei Leshem Shevo V’Achlama'', ''Sefer HaKlallim''

'''Sa Paru''', the festival, celebrated in [[Nepal]], mainly in [[Kathmandu valley]] by the [[Newar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalhomepage.com/society/festivals/gaijatra.html] Nepal Home Page&lt;/ref&gt;
The festival commemorates the death of people during the year. During the festival, cows are marched in the streets and generally celebrated in the month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra]] (August–September). It falls on the 1st day of the dark fortnight of [[Gunla]] according to the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar. People also distribute food to others. The festival of cows is one of the most popular festivals of Nepal. It is celebrated to remove the sadness of death of family members.

* The whole complex of Sa Paru festival has its roots in the ancient ages for, the dead Parent. 
* According to the traditions since time immemorial, every family who has lost one relative during the past year must participate in a procession through the streets of Kathmandu leading a cow. If a cow is unavailable then a young boy dressed as a cow is considered a fair substitute.
* In Hinduism, a cow is regarded the most venerated among all the domestic animals. It is believed that the cow, revered as a holy animal by [[Hindu]]s, will help the deceased relative's journey to heaven.
* According to the historical evidence, when King [[Pratap Malla]] lost his son, his wife, the queen, remained grief-stricken. The king was very sad to see the condition of his beloved queen. The king, in spite of several efforts, could not lessen the grief of his wife. He desperately wanted to see a little smile on the lips of his sweetheart, and so he announced that anyone who made the queen laugh would be rewarded adequately.
* During the Sa Paru, the cow procession was brought before the grief-stricken queen. Then the participants began ridiculing and be-fooling the important people of the society. Finally, when the social injustices and other evils were highlighted and attacked mercilessly, the queen could not help but smile. The queen cried and the king instituted a tradition of including funny jokes, satire, monkey, and lagoons into the Sa Paru celebrating the day.
* After the procession is over, in the afternoon, nearly everyone takes part in another age-old tradition in which the participants dress up and wear masks. The occasion is filled with songs and jokes. Mockery and humor of every kind become the order of the day until late evening. Hence, Sa Paru is a healthy festival which enables the people to accept the reality of death and to prepare themselves for life after death. According to Hinduism, "whatever a man does in his life is a preparation leading to a good life after death".

==Sa Paru in different cities==

===Kathmandu=== 

Kathmandu is considered to be the main source of this festival as the king who started this festival was of this city. After the show presented to the queen was a success, it became an annual program to present the queen with this festival. As time passed on and as the kings and the queens passed on the festival has been passed on from generation to generation. In main Kathmandu, people celebrate it with much happiness and many programs. If a father had died the previous year then the elder son dresses up like a cow and goes around the city, and if the mother had died then it is the duty of the younger son to go around the city dressed up like a cow. The procession is now not that of joke, satire or monkey but has become a serious but enjoyable event that will help their beloved ones to rest in peace. The procession goes around the city to different parts of the suburbs and the inner urban areas to present the devotion to their loved ones. The people involved in this profession get small packets with fruits, sweets, oats and other food items to help them on their tour around the city, by many people watching the festival and by their loved ones.

===Kirtipur===

The center of Sa Paru in Kirtipur falls in a part of the Kirtipur city known as ''Paanga''. The people in Kirtipur celebrating have many reasons to celebrate this festival and have a unique way of celebrating this festival. Among the people of Kirtipur it is said that the gates of heaven for the dead are opened in this day, and the procession of Gaijatra will help their beloved to reach the gates of heaven if they march around the city for them. They march around the city of Kirtipur with not dressing up like cows but rather dressed up in different forms of gods and goddesses. People celebrate this festival not only for their dead relatives but also for peace and harmony among the family members and the city itself.
[[File:Gaijatra02.jpg|thumb|People dressed as different deities dancing in procession of Sa Paru.]]
During this month the farmers of the city finish up their work in the fields and return home to celebrate the ending of the hard and tedious work in the fields. They gather the family members and have a feast of their success. This culture is replicated in this festival in Kirtipur. Men dress up like women and travel around the city. They go from house to house calling up the owners of the house and asking them to come down and join in the feast with them. This helps to create harmony among the neighbors and the city members.
Kirtipur performs many dances with different imitating artists that provide much of an awe and a happiness among the people. Kirtipur is enriched with many beliefs and many stories relating	Sa Paru than any other cities of the valley and has a more diverse celebration of this festival.

===Bhaktapur===

Bhaktapur(Bhadgaon) is said to have the most enjoyable and exciting Sa Paru, as it has its own peculiarities in the ways the festival is celebrated as compared to Lalitpur and Kathmandu. A chariot (known as Taha-Macha) made of bamboo wrapped in cloth, with a photo of the dead person hung at the center, is navigated through a predefined street by the family along with localities. So a long parade of chariots is seen.

The Taha-Macha symbolize dead people and is decorated with their possessions and photograph. The chariot has a framework of bamboo which is wrapped with cotton cloth usually Hakupatasi (a black traditional sari type female cloth) for women and simple sari type cloth for men. The Taha-Machas are brought out from different toles of Bhaktapur, but peculiarly, the Taha-Machas of Lakolachhen are guided by one large one that has the bamboo framework but is covered in straws. This is known as Bhailya Dya: and is succeeded by Ajima made at Khala (Ajima Dyo:Chhen)

Many local musicians, and a cultural dance called '''Ghinta Ghisi''' follow in the wake of a chariot. Men are also seen wearing women's dress: Hakupatasi. People dress up funnily. There is face painting and masks are common. Children even dress up as Gods and join the parade.

The Ghinta Ghisi dance is celebrated for almost a week, starting from the day of Gaijatra to [[Krishna Janmashtami]]. The dance is done in a long queen with two persons in a row hitting each other's sticks. Many cultural shows are performed, and the festival is even participated in by many nearby villages.
All peoples are faint to this day.

{{Hermeticism}}
{{God}}

'''The All''' (also called '''The One,''' '''[[The Absolute]]''', '''The Great One,''' '''The Creator,''' '''The Supreme Mind,''' '''The Supreme Good,''' '''The Father,''' and '''The All Mother''') is the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[pantheism|pantheistic]], [[pandeism|pandeistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] (and thus also [[panpsychism]]/[[monopsychism]]/[[unus mundus]]/[[anima mundi]]) view of [[God]], which is that everything that is, or at least that can be experienced, collectively makes up The All.  One Hermetic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] states, "While All is in The All, it is equally true that The All is in All."&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;  The All can also be seen to be [[androgynous]], possessing both masculine and feminine qualities in equal part.&lt;ref&gt;(The Way of Hermes p. 19 Book 1:9)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe understood in relation to the All ==
The following is commentary on possibilities about The All but not anything necessarily accepted by Hermeticists in general.

According to [[Kybalion|The Kybalion]], The All is a bit more complicated than simply being the sum total of the [[universe]].  Rather than The All being simply the physical universe, it is more correct to say that everything in the universe is within the mind of The All, since the ALL can be looked at as Mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 96-7)&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the universe is partially existent on the [[Mental plane]], and we may in fact all be parts of The All's psychological makeup, representing parts of The All in its [[dream]] or [[meditation]].

The Three Initiates (see [[Kybalion|The Kybalion]]) strongly caution that we restrain from simply declaring "I am God" for oversimplification purposes.  Though you are a part of The All, you are but one small piece of that puzzle.  You cannot be equated with God any more than your toenail can be equated with you.  You have the potential for perfection and to rejoin God, but you are not the totality of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 98-9)&lt;/ref&gt;  However stating "God is me/I (us)" is a more accurate statement.

The All's mind can be seen as infinitely more powerful and vast than any of us could hope to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates p. 99)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it may be capable of keeping track of each and every [[subatomic particle|particle]] across the expanse of the Universe, as well as maintain symbolism that applies to many lesser entities such as that seen in [[astrology]] and [[numerology]].

Because of this view, some Hermetics also practice [[theurgy]].  If the universe is completely a mental construct, then the mind must be able to mold it and shape it, in an experience that can become closer and closer to [[lucid dreaming]] as skills improve.

== Explaining why The All acts ==
Questions as to why God acts or doesn't act is an ancient question with many divergent answers.  The same has been asked by Hermetics of the All, and many reasons have been put forth.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 105-6)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The All has something to gain by acting ===
Some Hermetics believe that The All acts so that it may gain something from the action, for it must have a reason for acting, for having created the universe and our own existence.  Critics of this idea argue that there is nothing outside of The All for it to gain, it is All.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates p. 106)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, proponents argue that the critics fail to recognize [[Personal development|inner growth]] that allow the All to change by acting upon itself.

=== The All is compelled to act ===
Some Hermetics believe that The All acts because it is internally compelled to do so out of creative urge that is innate.  Critics claim that The All is absolute and if this urge were to compel The All then it (the proposed urge) instead would be absolute .&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 106-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The All acts because it acts ===
[[Kybalion|The Kybalion]] claims simply that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT ACTS." (''cf.'' [[Actus purus]]) There is no reason but The All itself, therefore its action, itself, and its reason for action are all the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 108-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary on the All referred to as "The Father" ==
Though sometimes referred to as The Father, The All is not simply male.  In this aspect, The All is called The Father for its active, masculine part in the creation of what is, not because of its physical sex.  Similarly, that what it was created out of, is represented as The Mother, for its passive, feminine aspect in that same process.  For example, we say Mother Earth and Mother Nature.

== Different aspects of ==
The story describing The All here is not meant to be taken literally, but rather has symbolic meaning.  Hermetics do not ever claim that the creation story used for this information is to be taken literally.  The All has three aspects which are known as The Father and the "Sons of God," put forth in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]]:

=== Nous ===
{{main article|Nous}}
''Nous'' bridges the gap between The All and its contents, and is described having taught [[Hermes Trismegistus]] his initial knowledge on God and the divine in Book 1 of the [[Corpus Hermeticum]].&lt;ref name="Way of Hermes p. 17"&gt;(Way of Hermes p. 17)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manly P. Hall]] translates ''Nous'' differently, instead calling it "Thought ([[Thoth]])", an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god generally seen as synonymous with Hermes.  The terms ''Great Dragon,'' and ''Eternal Teacher'' also pop up for Nous in his translation.

''Nous'' is claimed also to be the Father of the Word, and only comes to pious and religious men.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall p.40)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Nous'' claims to be '''God''' while the others are "sons of God" &lt;ref name="Way of Hermes p. 18"&gt;(Way of Hermes p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was ''Nous'' who is said to have created [[Human|Man]], both [[male]] and [[female]] (or hermaphroditic; some translations claiming "bisexual" used in a way to connote hermaphroditic), 7 of them, which were later broken up into separate men and women after falling in love with [[Nature]], its shadow, and actually merging with Nature, or, in other words, [[Incarnation|incarnating]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hall pp. 39-40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermes proclaims that ''Nous'' is the ''cause of existence'' and God should be worshipped by those two names, for they belong only to God.  ''Nous'', or God, is also seen as synonymous with the ''Supreme Good''.&lt;ref&gt;(Way of Hermes pp. 28-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Word ===
"Poimandres had spoken a Word. The Word was [[Reason]]" and ''Reason'' is given to ''The Workman'', ''The Master-Builder'', and ''The Maker of Things''.&lt;ref name="Hall p. 39"&gt;(Hall p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nous'' and ''Reason'' are truly one, according to the Hermeticum, and their Union is Life.&lt;ref name="Way of Hermes p. 18"/&gt;  The Word is also known as ''The Logos''.&lt;ref name="Scott p. 3"&gt;(Scott p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Word is used, by inhabiting the elements, to create [[destiny]], the "seven governors" ([[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]] of [[astrology]]) and was used to organize [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]].  The leaving of Reason from the elements is said to give rise to the lower creatures, who were created without ''Reason''.&lt;ref name="Hall p. 39"/&gt; See also [[Logos]].

=== Anthropos ===
''Anthropos'' (called the third son of God, while others see Nous—one of these sons of God—as the Father of the other two, and truly being God) is essentially the human [[soul]] which comes from God, and is destined to return to God.  It is the part of man that is not material, the spiritual part of Man as opposed to the man's body (physical) or nous/mind (mental).  It is further said that God is made up of innumerable souls, and if they conduct themselves properly, being true to themselves, they may become Powers of God,&lt;ref&gt;(Scott p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; which would lend credit to "The All has Something to Gain" theory for action.

=== Kybalion's ideas of God ===
The ''Kybalions'' interpretation of The ALL is that of a Substantial Reality,&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates pp. 53-5)&lt;/ref&gt; and transcends names and terms&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates p. 55)&lt;/ref&gt; and in essence is unknowable. It can be said that this corresponds to the ideas of or about the [[Tao]], with respect to the interpretation of an all encompassing force above all other. There is little room in this view for a "god", for it is stated that the ALL transcends names and terms. For reasons of logic, the Kybalion goes further in stating that there can be nothing existing outside of the ALL, else the ALL would not be The ALL.&lt;ref name="Three Initiates p. 59"&gt;(Three Initiates p. 59)&lt;/ref&gt; Anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned cannot be The All.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates p. 61)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible origin==
Those seeking a deeper understanding of life will ask the question, "Where did The All come from?" Some Hermeticists, strong adherents of ''The [[Kybalion]]'', go no further than to state "THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else to define, confine, bound, limit or restrict THE ALL.  It must be infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,-- it must have always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to have ever created it ... if it had ever 'not been,' even for a moment, it would not 'be' now."&lt;ref name="Three Initiates p. 59"/&gt;

In 1975, [[Summum]], an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] organization whose philosophy also includes the natural principles described in ''The Kybalion'',&lt;ref&gt;(Ra Chap. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; put forth an explanation behind The All's existence and claims the explanation came from "Summa Individuals",&lt;ref&gt;(Ra)&lt;/ref&gt; beings who appear to be what ''The Kybalion'' describes as "Unseen Divinities" that intervene and assist with human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;(Three Initiates Chap. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; Summum rewrote ''The Kybalion'' to include its explanation along with additional information.&lt;ref name="Summum"&gt;(Summum)&lt;/ref&gt; Summum refers to The All as "SUMMUM," a Latin term meaning "highest" or "greatest",&lt;ref&gt;(Mirza)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of the Summum philosophy means, "the sum total of creation".&lt;ref name="Summum"/&gt; The explanation Summum offers is based upon what it calls the "Grand Principle of Creation," and via this grand principle, The All (SUMMUM) exists.&lt;ref name="Ra Chap. 2"&gt;(Ra Chap. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, according to the Summum philosophy, The All is a union between Nothing and All Possibility, the ultimate opposites, and the nature of that union is without beginning or end for these two opposites automatically and simultaneously create each other. The result is a "cosmic copulation" whose effect is an infinite, living mind.&lt;ref name="Ra Chap. 2"/&gt;

'''''The Heathen's Guide to World Religions''''' is a book by Kingston, Ontario-based William Hopper (1966-2017). It is a humorous look at the history of the [[Jewish]], [[Christian]], [[Islamic]], [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] faiths.

The book was written in 1997, and self-published by Hopper that same year. After attracting the attention of publishers, it was re-released in 2001 by StoneFox Publishing. After StoneFox went defunct in 2003, the rights to the book reverted to the author. In 2005, Hopper founded [[Diogenes Press]], publishing a new, expanded edition of ''The Heathen's Guide to World Religions''. In 2008, Hopper worked with [[Eris Publications]] to produce the current "New World Order" edition. The most recent edition was published in 2011.

'''''The King’s Messengers''''' is an American [[Teen drama]] mini-series produced by [[Crystal Creek Media]] that premiered on Amazon Prime. It centers on Anwaar Osem (Christopher Veldhuizen) and David Sutherland ([[Daniel Knudsen]]), two refugees trying to survive in the fictional war-torn country of Zanora. The series was awarded a Dove seal of family approval from the [[Dove Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dove.org/review/12476-the-kings-messengers/ |title=The King’s Messengers Awarded the Dove Seal of Family Approval |date=June 22, 2017 |work=[[Dove Foundation]] |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

He flees to the northern forrest to escape a corrupt regime as well as the dangerous Resistance Army. While hiding out and surviving in the woods he meets David Sutherland, a fellow refugee who is also trying to escape the Resistance Army. Anwaar questions David on a computer that David has, however David will not reveal any information to Anwaar. After a close call with a Resistance soldier, David reveals that his brother Allen gave him the computer and it has something important on it.

'''Uatsdin''' ({{lang-os|Уацдин}}), otherwise spelled '''Watsdin''', also known as '''Assdin''' (Ассдин, "[[Æsir|Ese]]-Faith"), or by the extended name '''Ætsæg Din''' (Æцæг Дин, literally "True Faith"; the same meaning of "Uatsdin", which is a word compound),&lt;ref&gt;[http://osetins.com/print:page,1,1450-mestnaja-religioznaja-organizacija-tradicionnykh.html Местная религиозная организация традиционных верований осетин «Æцæг Дин»]&lt;/ref&gt; and among [[Russians]] as '''[[Assianism]]''' ({{lang-ru|Ассианство}}, ''Assianstvo''; alternative rendition of "Assdin"){{citation needed|date=October 2018}}, is the modern neo-Pagan movement and religious organization of the same name founded in North Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriston.com/nogbon/news.php?newsid=427&lt;/ref&gt; Its followers consist primarily by the [[Ossetians]] (an [[Eastern Iranic]], [[Alans|Alan]]-[[Sarmatians|Samatian]] ethnic group inhabiting a homeland in the [[Caucasus]] that is split nowadays between two states: the Republic of [[North Ossetia–Alania]] within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring state of [[South Ossetia]]). This religion has experienced an organised revival since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann202"&gt;V. A. Schnirelmann. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202101/http://legacy.wlu.ca/documents/6483/Christians_Go_home.pdf “Christians! Go home”: A Revival of Neo-Paganism between the Baltic Sea and Transcaucasia]". ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', Vol. 17, No. 2, 2002. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13537900220125181 See profile] at Taylor Francis Online; {{DOI|10.1080/13537900220125181}}. "Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a "religion of exploiters" (Filatov &amp; Shipkov, 1996)." (p. 202).

"Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches—one of a "bookish" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an "invention of tradition", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another." (p. 207)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ossetian case, certain traditions of [[folk religion]] had survived with unbroken continuity, and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revival religion to overcome the crisis of identity of the Ossetian people, based in  [[ethnic nationalism]] and opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], perceived as foreign, and opposed as well to the [[Islam]] professed by the neighboring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and among a small minority of Ossetians.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann202"/&gt; The major organisation among Ossetians is the ''Atsætæ'' organization (Ossetian: Ацæтæ; Russian: Асата, ''Asata'') led by Daurbek Makeyev, based in [[North Ossetia–Alania]].

The Uatsdin movement is active both in North and South Ossetia. Whilst there are no figures about religious demographics for [[South Ossetia]], in [[North Ossetia–Alania]] about 29% of the population was practicing this ethnic folk-religion in 2012, according to a survey carried out in that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sreda.org/arena Arena - Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia]. Sreda.org; 29% "adhere to a traditional religion of their ancestors, worship gods and the forces of nature". (исповедую
традиционную религию своих предковпоклоняюсь богам  и силам природы). This figure compares to 1.2% adherents of ethnic religions in all of the Russian Federation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Ætsæg'' literally means "right", "true" in the [[Ossetian language]], and is a cognate of Avestan ''haiθiia'', also meaning "true". ''Din'' is a cognate of the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''[[daena]]'' (whence ''din'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]), which represents "insight" and "revelation", and from this "observance" and "religion", but also "consciousness".

==Theology==
Uatsdin contemplates the worship of a supreme [[God]], [[Xucau|Xwytsau]] (Хуыцау), meaning "Heaven" or "Sky", who is the creator of the universe and of all beings. The supreme God may be called upon by a multiplicity of epithets, including simply "Yštyr Xwytsau" (Ыштыр Хуыцау), meaning "Great Heaven", but also "Duneskænæg" (Дунескæнæг), "Creator of the Universe", "Meskænæg Xwytsau" (Мескаенаег Хуыцау) and "Styr Xwytsau" (Стыр Хуыцау), meaning "God of the Gods". Uatsdin's theology affirms that God is within every creature, and in men he manifests as consciousness and worthy action.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz (2015), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of [[Ossetian mythology|other beings]], lesser gods, ancestors and heroes such as [[Uastyrdzhi]], are worshipped as intermediaries with Xwytsau.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz (2015), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State recognition==
There are attempts to turn local traditional gods into objects of national worship in [[North Ossetia–Alania]]. For example, in former times, a grove was devoted to the local communal god/saint Khetag. After the [[1991–92 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991–1992]], a glade near the wood was turned into a place for pan-Ossetian worship, including religious and political rituals, with activities supervised by the Great Council of Ossetian Priests (''Styr-nykhas''), a non-governmental committee established in 1993.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann205"&gt;Schnirelmann (2002) '''pp. 204-205''', citing Popov (1995, pp. 62-67) and Dzeranov (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khetag celebration was approved by the 1990s president of North Ossetia–Alania as a national holiday. A special foundation was established in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the site, and since 1994 a big annual sacrifice is arranged at the Khetag shrine.&lt;ref name="Schnirelmann205"/&gt;

In 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by philosopher [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Atsætæ'' Church. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Atsætæ'' Church was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because "what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Александр Дугин: Осетинский народ сделал возможным возвращение России на имперскую орбиту (Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit) | date = 7 October 2009 | website = iratta.com | url = http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html | archive-date = 26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wirikuta''' is a site, sacred to the [[Wixárika]] ([[Huichol people|Huichol]]) Indians high in the mountains of central [[Mexico]], between the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and the [[Zacatecas]] ranges, near [[Real de Catorce]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Sam B. |last2=Santos |first2=Diogo |title=Revolutionizing the interaction between state and citizens through digital communications |date=2015 |publisher=IGI Global |location=Hershey, PA |isbn=9781466662926 |pages=150-158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xiXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wixárika cosmology, the world was believed to have been created in Wirikuta.&lt;ref name="Ángel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ángel |first1=Arturo Gutiérrez del |title=La Peregrinación a Wirikuta: el gran rito de paso de los huicholes |date=2002 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Universidad de Guadalajara}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wirikuta is the focus of a yearly pilgrimage in which community members, led by maraka'ames (chamanes), travel approximately 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Jalisco to San Luis Potosí. The area in which the pilgrimage occurs is protected as a UNESCO [[Sacred natural site|Natural Sacred Area]],&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Huichol Route through the sacred sites to Huiricuta (Tatehuari Huajuye) |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1959/ |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is at risk for exploitation and environmental damage by the foreign mining company [[First Majestic Silver]].&lt;ref name="Hollander"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hollander |first1=Kurt |title=Battle in the Mexican desert: silver mining against peyote and indigenous spirituality |url=https://theecologist.org/2017/may/30/battle-mexican-desert-silver-mining-against-peyote-and-indigenous-spirituality |accessdate=19 October 2018 |work=Ecologist |date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Haramara (San Blas, Nayarit),  West
* Xapawleyeta (Isla de los Alacranes del Lago Chapala, Jalisco),  South.
* Wirikuta,  East.

Huichols carry out yearly [[Huichol Route to Huiricuta|pilgrimages to Wirikuta]] or Huiricuta. Between October and March, they follow the journey of their deities from Haramara's sea to the place where the Sun appeared (Reunax), the Cerro Quemado (''Leunaxü''). Those Gods were guided by  [[Tatewari]], the Grandfather Fire. There, a Deer (''maxa'') used his horns to rise the sun to the sky, illuminating the world.

== Pilgrimage ==
In order to follow the sacred journey, every year the [[maraka'ame]]s (chamanes) travel 250 miles (400 kilometers)  from wixarica's area in Jalisco to San Luis Potosí. At the beginning they walk towards Takata, a sacred area in [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] where the temple guard (''xuxuricare'') will ask for a safe journey. The next step is ''kalihuey'', a Main Temple where they join Wixarica's authorities.
They collect [[peyote]] - a [[cactus]] containing [[hallucinogens]] - along the way, they believe  the peyote  enables the Wixarica (Huichol) to commune directly with their ancestors and deities.&lt;ref name="Dubisch"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Dubisch |editor-first1=Jill |editor-last2=Winkelman |editor-first2=Michael |last=Schaefer |first=Stacy B.|chapter=Plants and Healing on the Wixarika (Hnichol) Peyote Pilgrimage |title=Pilgrimage and healing |date=2005 |publisher=University Of Arizona Press |isbn=0816531676 |pages=179- |edition=First paperbackition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJqzU75AvjoC&amp;pg=PA179 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end they collect ''hikuri'' and take it back to their homes, recreating life's cycle.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

Groups travel under the direction of a leading shaman, but may include other shamans who assist on the journey, apprentice shamans, and family groups which may include children. The lead shaman advises participants on their ingestion of peyote and other behavior.&lt;ref name="Dubisch"/&gt;  Abstinence and purification are important parts of the journey. Participants abstain from sex, and abstain from or  limit food, water, and sleep.&lt;ref name="Pratt"/&gt;  Early in the journey, participants undergo a rite of public confession and purification, to prepare themselves for further healing and growth as they travel. This includes a retelling of each person's transgressions in front of the group. The most significant transgressions are those of theft, murder and adultery. Confession therefore includes the public recitation of a full personal sexual history.&lt;ref name="Dubisch"/&gt; The intention is to create an experience of cleansing and renewal, free of jealousy, shame or blame.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pratt |first1=Christina |title=An encyclopedia of shamanism|volume=2|chapter=Peyote Hunt |date=2007 |publisher=Rosen Pub.

{{quote|The pilgrimage is a ritual undertaking that unifies families and communities, reinforces cultural beliefs, practices and values, and serves as a means by which pilgrims can work toward their own individual development. On this personal level, the pilgrimage helps the individual seekers find greater health, awareness, understanding and meaning; in essence it enables the seekers to "find their lives."&lt;ref name="Dubisch"/&gt;}}

== Proposed mining ==
The Wirikuta, a sacred place for the Huichol peoples, is being threatened by [[First Majestic Silver]], which has obtained permission from the Mexican government for its proposed [[La Luz Silver Project]] for the extraction of silver in the Sierra Decatorce, even though it is transgressing the law in covenants that protect the area Wirikuta and the Wixarika peoples at national and international levels.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

The mining site represents a threat to the environment balance and health of the population in the area. It is adding greater social impacts through the division of local peoples. Chemical substances used in the mining process from previous mines are destroying resources at various levels, which are creating impact on the environment and human health. For example, the mining sites will consume vast quantities of water in an already arid region.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;

'''Zailiism''' (在理教, the "Way of the Abiding Principle"{{efn|在理教 ''Zàilǐjiào''. "''Zai li''" means "abiding principle", "staying in principle", "staying in truth", "remaining faithful to the universal truth"; "''jiao''" means a "teaching" or "transmission".}}) or '''Liism''' (理教{{efn|理教 ''Lǐjiào'', "transmission of the principle".}}),&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Baiyidao''' (白衣道{{efn|白衣道 ''Báiyīdào''}} "White-Clad Way") or '''Bafangdao''' (八方道{{efn|八方道 ''Bāfāngdào''}} "Octagonal Way"), is a [[Chinese folk religious sect]] of north [[China]], founded in the 17th century by Yang Zai.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=107}} It claims a [[Taoism|Taoist]] identity&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 2011. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and is centered on the worship of [[Guanyin]] as the incarnation of the [[absolute (philosophy)|principle of the universe]], the "Only God of the Unlimited" (无极只神 ''Wújí Zhīshén'').{{sfnb|Tertitski|2007}}

==History==
===Yang Zai's life===
Zailiism was founded during the waning years of the [[Ming dynasty]] by Yang Zai (1621-1754; alias Yang Chengqing or Yang Rulai), a holder of the ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'' degree from [[Jimo]], [[Shandong]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=107}} Although anxious to take up an official position, Yang remained in Jimo to care for his aged mother.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=107}} After her death he became a religious leader, and there are different accounts about how this happened.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=107}} Some sources attribute this to a vision or encounter with [[Guanyin]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=107}}

He certainly migrated to the mountains of [[Ji County, Tianjin|Ji County]] in [[Tianjin]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=108}} Here he remained for ten years in meditation in the Lanshui Cave, he purified himself and formulated his philosophical teachings revolving around the Eight Proscriptions (''ba jie'').{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=108}} At the age of eighty he took ten disciples, who were sent in different directions to spread the teaching. Yang, thanks to his techniques of meditation and refinement, reputedly died at the age of 133.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=108}}

===18th century: Yin Ruo leadership===
The religion was formally established in Tianjin, and by the mid 18th century it had spread throughout north China.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Mass following was founded on the work of Yin Ruo (1729-1806; alias Yin Laifeng and Yin Zhongshan), the second great patriarch in the history of the sect.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=109}} In 1766, Yin founded the first common house (''gong suo'') in the suburbs of Tianjin; common houses became the basic and characteristic organisation units of Zailiism.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=110}} They are both temples and meeting houses, and early common houses were rooms in private homes and village temples.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=110}} By the [[Republic of China (1912-49)|early republican period]] some of them had evolved into elaborate complexes of buildings and courtyards.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=110}}

Common houses were run by two layers of leadership: ritual and administrative. The ritual ministers were the ''dangjia'', celibate men who engaged in a strict self-cultivation regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In Tianjin every common house had a single ''dangjia'', who more than parish priests were holy men and moral exemplars, who led few yearly rituals of the sect.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=110}} The administrative counterpart was the "manager" (''chengbanren''), a lay who cared for the daily activities of the common house.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=111}}

===19th and 20th century===
The spread of Zailiism did not go unnoticed, and in the 19th century [[Qing dynasty]] officials carried out various investigations to verify the orthodoxy of the sect, always concluding that it was orthodox and contributed to the economy and morality of the population. Some officials advised the throne not only to recognise the sect, but even to encourage it to counter the growing influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|pp=111-112}}

In 1891, Zaili lodges led an uprising in [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], in a climate of [[Han Chinese]] discontent with privileges of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] nobility and the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Although the uprising was crushed, the tensions festered and reemerged within the [[Boxer Rebellion]] at the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The sect grew rapidly in the last years of the Qing dynasty and in the early republic. Zaili adherents operated a large number of lodges and took over some disrepaired temples of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century it had already established a strong presence in [[Manchuria]], and by the early 20th century it started to exhibit a national character.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=112}} It even spread among [[ethnic Chinese in Russia]].{{sfnb|Tertitski|2007}} By the 1920s the sect had an established presence in all major cities of China, and when [[Jiangsu]] province outlawed it in 1929, influential leaders of [[Beijing]], Tianjin and [[Shanghai]] appealed to the national government to have the ban lifted.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=112}} In August 1929 the Ministry of the Interior gave explicit approval to Zailiism.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=112}}

===Contemporary developments===
Zailiism returned active in China's [[Hebei]] province since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It also has 186,000 members in [[Taiwan]], corresponding to 0.8% of the total population. There is a Chinese United Church of Liism (中华理教总会 ''Zhōnghuá Lǐjiào Zǒnghuì''{{efn|[[traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]]: 中華理教總會}}) and other smaller bodies.

==Philanthropy==
The most characteristic element of Zailiism is the emphasis on physical purity and abstinence from addictive substances.{{sfnb|Dubois|2005|p=108}} Zailiism spread as members founded charities and campaigned for abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and opium, and offering cures for the addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Zaili followers developed drug rehabilitation centres using herbal medicines and self-cultivation techniques (''zhengshen''), which were said to fully cure two hundred addicts per year.&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, 2000. p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Zaili members also founded the "China's General Association for the Prevention of Alcohol and Tobacco According to the Righteously Good Teachings" (中華全國理善勸戒煙酒總會 ''Zhōnghuá quánguó lǐ shàn quàn jièyān jiǔ zǒng huì''), that was recognized by the [[Yuan Shikai]] government in June 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 2008. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamodia, Édition Internationale en Français. 15 December 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/dirige/picard.htm Eliezer Shavit. Bernard Picard . 1925-1998.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Jewish religious school founded 1948, in [[Paris]] by [[Chief Rabbi]] and Jacob Kaplan with the help of [[rabbi]] [[Élie Munk]] and [[Chief Rabbi]] Henri Schilli which continues to run to this day.

== History ==

In 1948 the [[Chief Rabbi]] Jacob Kaplan, with the help of Suzanne Aron, created a Jewish lycée which he called "École Yabné."&lt;ref&gt;in memory of the [[Yeshiva]] founded in [[Yavne]] by [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] after the destruction of the second [[Temple of Jerusalem]] by the Romans in the [[70s]]&lt;/ref&gt; He received help from [[Rabbi]] [[Élie Munk]], [[Chief Rabbi]] Henri Schilli, and from the communities of Synagogue Adas Yereim|rue Cadet, Synagogue de la rue de Montevideo,rue Montévidéo, [[Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue|rue Pavée]] and Synagogue Rashi (Paris),rue Ambroise-Thomas. To run the school, Suzanne Aron called upon Albert Crémieux.

It was established in 1948, on the grounds of the [[Gustave de Rothschild]] Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;A former Rothschild school, occupied by the [[École Maïmonide (Boulogne-Billancourt)|École Maïmonide]] at its start (1935-1938), later requisitioned during the [[Second World War]], then used as a reception centre during the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]]&lt;/ref&gt; at 60 rue Claude-Bernard, in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Quartier Latin]]. There was not enough room in the small building for all the Classe de sixième française|sixth-form classes in the final year.
The solution was to educate half the students in the morning, and half in the afternoon. Some classes also took place in the Séminaire israélite de France,rabbinical seminary, located at 9 rue Vauquelin.

The situation continued until the construction, in the 1960s, of a multi-story building, far more spacious and in the same location, which can accommodate all classes. This building was opened on 2 May 1965. The building included a gym and a refectory for the first time.

In 1976, in agreement with the centre Rachi classes took place from first year to the final year. Yabné could then accommodate 750 students.

In 1993, the school left the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Quartier Latin]] for the [[Porte d'Italie]]. It is currently the largest Jewish college in France. It has more than 1000 students from the [[kindergarten]] to the final year.

The primary school has the name "École Yabné- Henri Schilli".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.henrischilli.yabne.org/historique.html École Yabné Henri Schilli.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lycée ranking ==

In 2015, the lycée ranked 47th out of 109 at départemental level in terms of teaching quality, and 452nd at national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language = |title = Classement département et national du lycée|url = http://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/0/lycee-yabne-paris-13_0753834K.html|website = L'Express|date = 1 April 2015|access-date= 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking is based on three criteria; the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their [[baccalauréat]] after two years at the establishment and the ''added value'' (calculated based on social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language = |title = Méthodologie du classement 2015 des lycées français|url = http://www.lexpress.fr/education/palmares-des-lycees-2015-notre-methodologie_1666795.html|website = L'Express|date = 1 April 2015|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
