==Synopsis==
This modernist and non-linear film, influenced by the [[French New Wave]], and, especially, by films such as ''[[Jules and Jim]]'' and ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'', tells the story of an advertiser (Yossi Spector), in his forties, who, meets Helit ({{ill|Helit Yeshurun|he|הלית ישורון}}), a model, in her twenties, and, together, the two spend a day in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], The model leads the advertiser into cafés and drug-fueled orgies, while, he leads her into the workshops of sculptors, so, that they could create sculptures, modeled on her body, out of [[gypsum]]. While she tries to liberate his mind, he attempts to stay where he is. The film ends with the advertiser strangling Helit to death, during a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levy Ben-Zakai|first=Talila|date=9 October 1969|script-title=he:הלית|trans-title=Helit|url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=MAR%2F1969%2F10%2F09&amp;id=Ar02101&amp;sk=0339248E|language=Hebrew|work=[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">[[File:Sound-transmission.png|300px|thumb|Example of airborne and structure-borne transmission of sound, where Lp is sound pressure level, A is attenuation, P is acoustical pressure, S is the area of the wall [m²], and τ is the transmission coefficient]]
'''Acoustic transmission''' is the transmission of sounds through and between materials, including air, wall, and musical instruments.

The degree to which sound is transferred between two materials depends on how well their [[acoustical impedance]]s match. 

==In musical instrument design==
[[Musical instrument]]s are generally designed to radiate sound effectively. A high-impedance part of the instrument, such as a string, transmits vibrations through a bridge (intermediate impedance) to a sound board (lower impedance). The soundboard then moves the still lower-impedance air. Without bridge and soundboard, the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air, and is too quiet to be performed with. An electric guitar has no soundboard; it uses a microphone pick-up and artificial amplification. Without amplification, electric guitars are very quiet.

==Stethoscope==
[[Stethoscope]]s roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body, so they transmit sounds from a patient's chest to the doctor's ear much more effectively than the air does. Putting an ear to someone's chest would have a similar effect.

==In building design==
Acoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another. Typically these are:
#Airborne transmission - a noise source in one room sends air pressure waves which induce vibration to one side of a wall or element of structure setting it moving such that the other face of the wall vibrates in an adjacent room. [[Structural isolation]] therefore becomes an important consideration in the [[Soundproofing|acoustic design]] of buildings. Highly sensitive areas of buildings, for example recording studios, may be almost entirely isolated from the rest of a structure by constructing the studios as effective boxes supported by springs. Air tightness also becomes an important control technique. A tightly sealed door might have reasonable sound reduction properties, but if it is left open only a few millimeters its effectiveness is reduced to practically nothing. The most important acoustic control method is adding mass into the structure, such as a heavy dividing wall, which will usually reduce airborne sound transmission better than a light one.
#Impact transmission - a noise source in one room results from an impact of an object onto a separating surface, such as a floor and transmits the sound to an adjacent room. A typical example would be the sound of footsteps in a room being heard in a room below. Acoustic control measures usually include attempts to isolate the source of the impact, or cushioning it. For example carpets will perform significantly better than hard floors.
#Flanking transmission - a more complex form of noise transmission, where the resultant vibrations from a noise source are transmitted to other rooms of the building usually by elements of structure within the building. For example, in a steel framed building, once the frame itself is set into motion the effective transmission can be pronounced.

The '''Apollo 11 missing tapes''' were those that were recorded from [[Apollo 11]]'s [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) telecast in its raw format on [[telemetry]] data tape at the time of the first [[moon landing]] in 1969 and subsequently lost. The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television broadcasts failed for any reason.

In order to broadcast the SSTV transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations performed real-time [[scan conversion]] to the [[NTSC]] television format. The moonwalk's converted video signal was broadcast live around the world on July 21, 1969 (2:56 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded on many [[videotape]]s and [[kinescope]] films. Many of these low-quality recordings remain intact. The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes as a backup in the event that real-time conversion and broadcast failed. As the real-time broadcast worked, was shown and widely recorded, preservation of the backup video was not deemed a priority in the years immediately following the mission.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely the tapes were erased and reused at this time.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

A team of retired NASA employees and contractors tried to find the tapes in the early 2000s but was unable to do so. The search was sparked when several still photographs appeared in the late 1990s that showed the superior-looking raw SSTV transmission on ground station monitors. The research team conducted a multi-year investigation in the hopes of finding the most pristine and detailed video images of the moonwalk. If copies of the original SSTV format tapes were to be found, more modern digital technology could make a higher-quality conversion, yielding better images than those originally seen. The researchers concluded that the tapes containing the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signal were [[Bulk eraser|erased]] and reused by NASA in the early 1980s, following standard procedure at the time.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}}{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} 

Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes as well as [[Super 8 mm film|super 8 movie film]] taken of a video monitor in Australia, showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved restoration project of the first moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced footage obtained during the search. [[Lowry Digital]] completed the full moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.

[[Apollo 11]] was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969, at 02:56 UTC; [[Buzz Aldrin]] joined him about 20 minutes later.

Only limited radio bandwidth was available to transmit the video signal from the lunar landings, which needed to be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with other communication and telemetry channels beamed from the [[Lunar Module]], back to Earth.{{sfnp|Coan|1973|pp=1–2}} Therefore, Apollo 11's moonwalk video was transmitted from the [[Apollo TV camera]] in a monochrome [[slow-scan television|SSTV]] format at 10 frames per second (fps) with 320 lines of resolution, [[progressive scan|progressively scanned]].{{sfnp|Lebar|Hoffman|1967|p=3}} These SSTV signals were received by [[radio telescopes]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[tracking station]], and [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] tracking station.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|p=2}} The camera's video format was incompatible with existing [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]] broadcast television standards. It needed to be converted before it could be shown on broadcast television networks. This live [[scan conversion|conversion]] was crude, essentially using a video camera pointing at a high-quality 10-inch TV monitor.

Since the camera's scan rate was much lower than the approximately 30 fps for NTSC video,{{refn|group="Note"|For the purposes of clarity and simplicity in this article, 60 fields and 30 frames per second are used. NTSC actually runs at 59.94 fields per second, and 29.97 frames per second. Two interlaced fields create one complete video frame.}} the television standard used in North America at the time, a real-time [[scan conversion]] was needed to be able to show its images on a regular TV set. NASA selected a scan converter manufactured by [[RCA]] to convert the black-and-white SSTV signals from the Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 11 missions.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

When the Apollo TV camera radioed its images, the ground stations received its raw unconverted SSTV signal and split it into two branches. One signal branch was sent unprocessed to a fourteen-track analog [[data]] [[tape recorder]] where it was recorded onto fourteen-inch diameter reels of one-inch-wide [[analog signal|analog]] [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic data tapes]] at {{nowrap|120 inches}} per second.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}} The other raw SSTV signal branch was sent to the RCA scan converter where it would be processed into an NTSC broadcast television signal.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}}

The RCA scan converter operated on an optical conversion principle.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} The conversion process started when the signal was sent to a high-quality 10-inch video monitor where a conventional RCA TK-22 television camera—using the NTSC broadcast standard of 525 scanned lines [[interlaced video|interlaced]] at 30 fps—merely re-photographed its screen. The monitor had persistent phosphors, that acted as a primitive [[framebuffer]].{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} An analog disk recorder, based on the [[Ampex#HS-100 .26 HS-200 .22slo-mo.22 disc recorder|Ampex HS-100 model]], was used to record the first field from the camera.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} It then fed that field, and an appropriately time-delayed copy of the first field, to the NTSC Field Interlace Switch (encoder). The combined original and copied fields created the first full 525-line interlaced frame and the signal was then sent to Houston.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The disk recorder repeated this sequence five more times, until the camera imaged the next SSTV frame.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The converter then repeated the whole process with each new frame downloaded from space in real-time.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} In this way, the RCA converter produced the extra 20 frames per second needed to produce flicker-free images to the world's television broadcasters.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

This live conversion was crude compared to early-21st-century electronic digital conversion techniques. Image degradation was unavoidable with this system as the monitor and camera's optical limitations significantly lowered the original SSTV signal's [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[brightness]] and [[Display resolution|resolution]]. If the scan converter's settings were incorrectly set, as they were at the Goldstone station during the first few minutes of Apollo 11's moonwalk, the negative impact on the image could be very obvious.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} When Armstrong first came down the Lunar Module's ladder, he was barely visible because the contrast and the vertical phase were not set correctly by the scan converter operator.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} The video seen on home television sets was further degraded by the very long and noisy analog transmission path.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} The converted signal was sent by satellite from the three receiving ground stations to Houston, Texas. Then the network [[Press pool|pool feed]] was sent by microwave relay to New York, where it was broadcast live to the United States and the world.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}} Because all of these links were analog, each one added additional noise and distortion to the signal.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}}

===NTSC broadcast tapes===
This low-quality optical conversion of the Apollo 11 moonwalk video images—made with a TV camera taking pictures of a video monitor—is what was widely recorded in real-time onto [[kinescope]] film and NTSC broadcast-quality [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch quadruplex videotape]]. Recordings of this conversion were not lost and have long been available to the public (along with much higher quality video from later [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions). If the one inch data tapes, with the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signals on them, were to be found, modern digital technology would allow for significantly better conversion and processing.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The quality would be similar to what a few technicians and others saw at SSTV receiving ground stations before it got converted to NTSC.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|}}

In 2005, an amateur [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] movie with about 15 minutes of Apollo 11 images was rediscovered. The footage had been taken by Ed von Renouard at Honeysuckle Creek tracking station during or immediately after the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The images show mainly the scan converted monitor and briefly the slow scan monitor.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2008|}} This is some of the best quality recording of brief segments of the Apollo 11 moonwalk available.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The images are available on DVD.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2006|}}

News that these analog data tapes were missing emerged on August 5, 2006 when the printed and online versions of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published a story with the title ''One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost moon pictures''.{{sfnp|Macey|2006a|}} The missing tapes were among over 700 boxes of magnetic data tapes recorded throughout the Apollo program which have not been found.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|pp=11–12}}  On August 16, 2006 NASA announced its official search saying, "The original tapes may be at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ... or at another location within the NASA archiving system", "NASA engineers are hopeful that when the tapes are found they can use today's digital technology to provide a version of the moonwalk that is much better quality than what we have today."{{sfnp|Macey|2006b|}} NASA also had ongoing research reasons for finding these higher resolution tapes, as the [[Constellation program]] then planned shared some similar tasks with the original Apollo program.{{sfnp|Wheeler|2006|}}

The Goddard Center's Data Evaluation Laboratory has the only known surviving piece of equipment which can read the missing tapes and was set to be closed in October 2006, causing some fear that, even if the tapes were later found, there would be no ready way to read and copy them.{{sfnp|Hansen|2006}} However, equipment that could read the tapes was maintained.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

On November 1, 2006 [[Cosmos (magazine)|''Cosmos'' magazine]] reported that some NASA telemetry tapes from the Apollo project era had been found in a small marine science laboratory within the main physics building at [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]]. One of these tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.{{sfnp| Amalfi |2006|}} It carried no video but did show that if any of the tapes are ever found, data could likely be read from them.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=6}}

== NASA news conference ==
NASA held a news conference at the [[Newseum]], in Washington, D.C. regarding the missing tapes on July 16, 2009 – the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's launch from Cape Kennedy.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} The multinational research team looking into the missing tapes – mostly retired engineers who had worked on the original broadcast in 1969 — was represented at the event by Richard Nafzger from the Goddard Space Flight Center, and Stanley Lebar, the former lead engineer at Westinghouse that developed the Apollo Lunar Camera and the Apollo Color Camera.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} They concluded that the data tapes – with the SSTV signal – were shipped from Australia to Goddard and then routinely erased and reused a few years later.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Australian backup tapes were also erased after Goddard received the reels,{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} following the procedures established by NASA.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes mostly as a backup in case the real-time conversion and broadcast around the world failed. Since the real-time broadcast conversion worked, and was widely recorded on both videotape and [[kinescope|film]], the backup video was not deemed important at the time.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s, NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely that during this period the tapes were erased and reused.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

There was also documentation that the Apollo 11 moonwalk SSTV was recorded at the Parkes, Australia facility on modified Ampex 2-inch helical scan VTRs.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=14}} The VTRs were modified by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Labs to record 320-line slow-scan video directly to the videotape without converting it.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}  It was confirmed that these tapes were shipped to Johns Hopkins University, but could not be found by the search team.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

Nafzger stated that they did find several post-conversion copies of the broadcast that were higher quality than what was previously seen by the public.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Their findings included: a videotape recorded in Sydney after the conversion but before the satellite transmission around the world; videotape from [[CBS News]] archives (direct from NASA, without commentary); and kinescopes at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} At the news conference, it was mentioned that Lowry Digital would complete enhancing and restoring the tapes.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Mike Inchalik, president of Lowry Digital, mentioned that they would only restore the video and not remove defects (such as reflections that looked like flag poles) that their software could remove.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} A few short clips were shown at the news conference, showing their improved quality.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} NASA released some partially restored samples on their website after the news conference.{{sfnp|Jacobs|Hess|2009|}} The full restoration of the footage, about three hours long, was completed in December 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Some other footage from Australian ground station feeds showing SSTV video of Armstrong's descent and first steps surfaced through John Sarkissian's efforts.{{sfnp|SPACE.com Staff|2010|}} Highlights of this fully enhanced video were shown to the public for the first time at the Australian Geographic Society Awards on October 6, 2010, where [[Buzz Aldrin]] was the guest of honor.{{sfnp|Barry|2010|}}{{sfnp|AG Staff|2010|}}

'''Arts-based training''' is a form of employee training.

== In the workplace ==

In recent years, there has been growth in the use of arts programs by corporations to meet a wide range of employee training and organizational development needs. In the United States alone, more than 400 of the [[Fortune 500]] corporations and countless smaller firms employ arts-based learning in participatory [[workshop]]s, skill-based training programs, hands-on consultancies with business units, individual and team coaching, case studies in-action, and lecture/demonstrations at leadership conferences.  Companies use these various programs to foster creative thinking, promote the development of new leadership models, and strengthen employee skills in critical areas such as collaboration, conflict resolution, change management, presentation/public performance, and intercultural communication. This represents a dramatic shift in the boundaries that traditionally defined experiences relevant to the business world – a shift triggered by profound technological and social changes that have transformed the culture of business over the past decade.

Arts-based training can be defined as employee or staff development [[training]] (such as team building, communication/listening skills) which is delivered using the [[arts]] (music, visual art, drama etc.).  It is used in many sectors in [[business]] from [[solicitors]] and [[law firms]], to local councils and community-based organisations.  In the [[United Kingdom]] it began to be used in the 1990s, primarily in [[London]], and has now spread through the country. In the United States, arts organizations like [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]] and [[Second City Theatre]], along with individual practitioners such as visual artist [[Todd Siler]] and jazz musician [[Michael Gold]] pioneered this field at about the same time.  "Orchestrating Collaboration at Work"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orchestrating Collaboration at Work|last = Van Gundy|first = Arthur|publisher = Pfeiffer|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1419651748|location = |pages = |last2 = Naiman|first2 = Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Arthur Van Gundy and Linda Naiman, published in 2003 was one of the first books published for practitioners in the field. In recent years, organisations all over the world have begun to adopt arts based learning.

== Worldwide ==

[[Lotte Darsø]], author of ''Artful Creation: Learning-Tales of Arts-in-Business'' was the first to map the interplay between arts and business in Europe and North America.  The key questions asked in her research were: "In what ways can business learn from artists," "What can be learned?," and "What kind of learning takes place?" Darsø proposes two approaches for Arts-in-Business: the Arts applied as an instrument for teambuilding, communication training, leadership development, problem-solving and innovation; and the Arts integrated as a strategic process of organisational transformation. Steven Taylor and Donna Ladkin offered a model of four different processes, skills transfer, projective techniques, illustration of essence, and making, used in arts-based learning in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Understanding Arts-Based Methods in Managerial Development|last = Taylor|first = Steven|date = 2009|journal = Academy of Management Learning and Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ladkin|first2 = Donna|issue = Vol 8(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schuima's 2012 book, "The Value of Arts for Business"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Value of Arts for Business|last = Schiuma|first = Giovanni|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a comprehensive review of the use of arts in business. 

== Organizations ==

[[Terry McGraw]], chairman and CEO of The [[McGraw Hill]] Companies, characterizes creativity as a "business imperative", and puts his companies’ successful experiences with arts-based learning in a broad strategic context of "surfacing creativity" through engagement with the arts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Creativity is essential because it is at the heart of innovation, and innovation is a growth driver and, therefore, a business imperative. That is why, for several years, The McGraw-Hill companies has been using arts-based learning as a training tool in several key leadership initiatives...the arts have served as a complementary vehicle to more traditional learning approaches. They have helped to change attitudes by letting employees confront their assumptions in a nontraditional and non-intimidating environment....The results of using arts-based learning and training have been very positive for The McGraw-Hill Companies…Arts-based training is part of an overall strategy and commitment of the corporation to help 'surface' creativity 
—&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Business Strategy (Harvey Seifter, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Keith Weed]], Chairman, [[Lever Fabergé]] sees employee involvement as a key part of developing and sustaining an innovative and creative business. Catalyst, their internal arts and creativity program "brings artists and arts organisations into the business to motivate, inspire, challenge and unlock the potential of our staff, on both a professional and personal level. Artists and arts organisations come into the workplace to tackle specific business issues, from creative thinking to leadership styles and writing skills."

In reviewing ''The Art of Business: Make All Your Work a Work of Art'' (Davis, 2005) Tom Peters commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

The authors persuasively argue that we are entering an economy which will value—insist upon!—a new way of looking at value creation. They call it moving from an emphasis on "economic flow" (input-output) to "artistic flow." The altered nature of enterprise, the "four elements" of new business thinking: "See yourself as an artist." "See your work as a work of art." "See your customers as an audience." "See your competition as teachers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor P Vijayakumar, Chairperson,Centre for Social and Organisational Leadership (C SOL) at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai,India uses art as a teaching tool extensively in the Organisation Development and Change course for masters students states  "Art facilitates reflection. Reflective practice needs to be an integral part of any management education".&lt;ref&gt;Lubna Kably, "Brushing up on HRD skills through art",Times of India, November 25,2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond the Witch Trials: Witchcraft and Magic in Enlightenment Europe''''' is an academic anthology edited by the historians [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] and [[Willem de Blécourt]]. It was first published by [[Manchester University Press]] in 2004. Containing ten separate papers by different academics active in the field, the book dealt with the continued practice of magic and the belief in witchcraft in Europe following the end of the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period]].

The same year, Manchester University Press would bring out a companion anthology, also edited by Davies and Blécourt. Entitled ''Witchcraft Continued: Popular Magic in Modern Europe'', it dealt with the period following the Enlightenment.

==Synopsis==

===Davies and De Blécourt's "Introduction"===

===Toivo's "Making (dis)order: witchcraft and the symbolics of hierarchy in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Finland===

===Ferraiuolo's "''Pro exoneratione sua propria conscientia'': magic, witchcraft and Church in early eighteenth-century Capua"===

===Tausiet's "From illusion to disenchantment: Feijoo versus the 'falsely possessed' in eighteenth-century Spain"===

===Lennersand and Oja's "Responses to witchcraft in late-seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Sweden"===

===Maxwell-Stuart's "Witchcraft and magic in eighteenth-century Scotland"===

===Olli's "The Devil's pact: a male strategy"===

===Barry's "Public infidelity and private belief? The discourse of spirits in Enlightenment Bristol"===

===De Blécourt's "Evil people: a late eighteenth-century Dutch witch doctor and his clients"===

===Hoggard's "The archaeology of counter-witchcraft and popular magic"===
Brian Hoggard, an independent researcher from [[Worcester]], England, authored a paper looking at the subject of Enlightenment-era popular magic from an [[archaeology|archaeological]] perspective. Noting that the only published book dealing with the archaeology of British folk magic was [[Ralph Merrifield]]'s ''[[The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic]]'' (1987), he argues that archaeology can provide scholars with evidence of popular magical traditions that were not recorded in the literate sources of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hog04|Hoggard 2004]]. pp. 167&amp;ndash;186.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doering-Manteuffel and Bachter's "The dissemination of magical knowledge in Enlightenment Germany"===

If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development.

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clothes horse''', sometimes called a '''clothes rack''', '''drying horse''', '''clothes maiden''', '''garment donkey''', '''drying rack''', '''drying stand''', '''Frostick'''{{cn|date=August 2018}}, '''airer''', or (Scots) '''winterdyke''',&lt;ref name=DLSdyke&gt;{{cite web|title=DYKE, DIKE, n. and v.|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=16546&amp;startset=10317947&amp;query=DYKE&amp;fhit=Dyke&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd#fhit|work=Dictionary of the Scots Language|publisher=Scottish Language Dictionaries Ltd|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a frame upon which clothes are hung after [[washing]], indoors or outdoors, to dry by [[evaporation]]. The frame is usually made of [[wood]], [[metal]] or [[plastic]].

==Types of drying racks==

There are many types of drying racks, including large, stationary outdoor racks, smaller, folding portable racks, and wall-mounted drying racks. A drying rack is similar in usage and function to a [[clothes line]], and used as an alternative to the powered [[clothes dryer]].

A [[pulley]] clothes airer can be loaded and unloaded at a convenient height, and hoisted out of the way to ceiling height while the clothes dry. The racks are also used in kitchens, to hang utensils out of the way.

A pulley clothes airer is sometimes also described as "Victorian", "Edwardian", or "Lancashire" and then comprises two iron frames positioned as far apart as desired to provide a suitable length, with wooden laths, typically four or six, passed through holes in them. The frames are suspended from the ceiling by a system of rope and pulleys. The result is a hoistable rack with several parallel bars on which clothes can be draped out of the way, or hung, extending further down, with [[clothes hanger]]s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castinstyle.co.uk/product.php/416/victorian-kitchen-maid-pulley-clothes-airer Typical parts available commercially to assemble a pulley airer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pulley+airer+images&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;rlz=1B3GGHP_en-GB___GB414&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4rjkU8q_POmI7AaG24CoBg&amp;ved=0CCsQsAQ&amp;biw=1215&amp;bih=714&amp;dpr=0.9 Images found by Google image search for "pulley airer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern development uses a wooden frame with seven to eleven continuous clothes lines which increase the capacity of the clothes horse. The frame uses a [[Cleat_(nautical) | clam cleat]] to tighten the clothes lines and hangs on four ropes. This increases the necessary installation effort, but also improves safety by increasing redundancy of the suspension. It uses a pulley system ([[block and tackle]]) which reduces the required force to lift the loaded frame. &lt;ref&gt;[https://hangbird.net/en A modern design of the clothes horse]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurative usage==

Used figuratively, the single-word term ''clotheshorse'' describes men and women who are passionate about clothing and always appear in public dressed in the latest styles.  From 1850 the term referred to a male [[fop]] or female [[quaintrelle]], a person whose main function is, or appears to be, to wear or show off clothes.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., documents use of "clothes horse" in 1807, and "human clothes horse" in 1850&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the term is similar to "[[fashion plate]]," which originally referred to a [[lithography|lithograph]] illustration of fashionable clothing in a book or magazine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">The '''Combined Services Entertainment''' ('''CSE''') is the live entertainment arm of the [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation]] (SSVC), a registered British charity. It is the official provider of live entertainment to the British Armed Forces. CSE routinely sends tours of entertainment to [[Afghanistan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Oman]], the [[Falkland Islands]] and to [[Royal Navy]] ships deployed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssvc.com/cse|title=Services Sound and Vision Corporation|publisher=Ssvc.com|accessdate=2012-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531051330/http://www.ssvc.com/cse/|archivedate=2012-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CSE is the successor to the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA). Originally, it was called the '''Central Pool of Artists'''. It emerged during and after the [[Second World War]] as the British Armed Forces' [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]].

==Artists==
Artists who began their careers in the Central Pool of Artists, and later the CSE, included [[Benny Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;"Benny Hill Obituary". Telegraph. Telegraph Media. 22 April 1992. Retrieved 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Stanley Baxter]], [[Ken Platt]] and [[Peter Nichols]]. 

Peter Nichols later adapted his experiences into a stage play (and later film) called ''[[Privates on Parade]]''. This in turn inspired the long-running [[BBC]] TV comedy series ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]''.

Over the past decade, [[James Fox (singer)|James Fox]] has undertaken many CSE tours to entertain British troops on active service in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[The Falkland Islands]] and [[Iraq]]. In recognition of this, he was twice invited to perform at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] before [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] as part of the [[Festival of Remembrance]].&lt;ref name=YouTube-RAH-FoR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIuKw0vwZVc |title=James Fox Don't Look Back In Anger at Royal Albert Hall |date= |publisher=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YouTube-RAH-FoR-2006&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za0_Ht9YfJI |title=James Fox - Anthem feat. Katherine Jenkins |date= |publisher=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he presented a film highlighting the work of CSE before his performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">'''Crop Over'''  (formerly called "Harvest Home") is a traditional [[harvest festival]] which began in [[Barbados]], having had its early beginnings on the sugar cane plantations during slavery. The crop over tradition began in 1687, and featured singing, dancing and accompaniment by bottles filled with water, ''[[shak-shak]]'', [[banjo]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[fiddle]], [[guitar]], and [[Bones (instrument)|bones]].  Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting and drinking competitions. Originally a celebration signaling the end of the yearly sugar cane harvest, it has since evolved into Barbados' biggest national festival similar to [[Caribbean Carnival|Carnival]] in [[Brazilian Carnival|Brazil]] and [[Trinidad Carnival|Trinidad]]. With the harsh effects of [[World War II]] on Barbados, the festival was disbanded.
It was later revived in 1974 by local stakeholders including [[Julian Marryshow]], [[Flora Spencer]], [[Emile Straker]], and [[Livvy Burrowes]] with the Barbados Tourist Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The father of Crop-Over |author= |first=Gercine |last=Carter |authorlink= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/the-father-of-crop-over/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=July 23, 2010 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=October 16, 2011 |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the gradual change, the general schematic of Crop Over began to closely mirror the [[Trinidad Carnival]]. Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, [[Kadooment Day|The Grand Kadooment]].

For the entire two months life for many islanders is one big party with a major feature of crop over being the calypso competition. [[Calypso music]], originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics and gives its exponents a medium in which to satirise local politics and comment on the issues of the day, while taking nothing away from the general bacchanal. [[Calypso tent]]s, also originating in Trinidad, feature their cadre of calypsonians who perform biting social commentaries on the happenings of the past year, political exposés or rousing exhortations to ''wuk up'' or "wine up", "jonesing", ''roll de bumper'', guh down (pronounced "dung")  and "six-thirty" dance. There are craft markets, food tents and stalls, street parties and cavalcades every week supplemented by daily events at Tim’s on the Highway, the new home of the Barbados Crop Over Festival.

Competition 'tents' ring with the fierce battle of calypsonians for the coveted [[Calypso music|Calypso]] Monarch Award. There are also the [[People's Monarch]] and [[Party Monarch]] competitions. The People's Monarch is a competition in which the public are given groups of songs; each group with two songs, and they vote until a winner is chosen. The Party Monarch competition, however, is chosen by a panel of judges and is based on presentation. Therefore, you may have the best song but not be able to make use of stage and props and not be crowned 'Party Monarch King/Queen'. The competition is held on the Ermy Bourne Highway, commonly known as East Coast. The air is redolent with the exotic smells of Barbadian cooking during the [[Bridgetown Market Street Fair]]. Rich with the [[spirit]] of local [[culture]], the [[Cohobblopot Festival]] blends dance and [[drama]] and [[music]] with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the 'Pic-o-de-Crop' Show is performed when finally the King of Calypso is crowned. The climax of the festival is [[Kadooment Day]] celebrated with a national holiday when costume bands fill the streets with [[Culture of Barbados|Barbadian]] music and [[fireworks]].

[[File:From Caroline Weston to Deborah Weston; Friday, March 3, 1837 p3.jpg|thumb|Cross-hatched letter of 1837, Massachusetts, USA.]]

A '''crossed letter''' is a [[manuscript]] [[letter (message)|letter]] which contains two separate sets of writing, one written over the other at right-angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~awoodley/crossedletter.html|title=A crossed letter|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0-8166-2795-9|location = |page = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done during the early days of the [[postal system]] in the 19th century to save on expensive postage charges, as well as to save paper.

A cross letter is distinct from a [[palimpsest]], as cross-hatched manuscripts were written this way at one sitting or for the same purpose (such as a diary), rather than being re-used later.

The '''culture of [[Chile]]''' reflects the relatively homogeneous population as well as the geographic isolation of the country in relation to the rest of South America. Since colonial times, the Chilean culture has been a mix of [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial elements with [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] (mostly [[Mapuche]]) culture.

The [[Huaso]]s of [[Zona Central, Chile|Central Chile]] and their folk music and dance are central to Chilean folk culture. Even though the folk traditions the [[Zona Central, Chile|Central Chile]] are central to Chilean cultural and national identity, Chile is both geographically and culturally diverse with both the North and the South having their own folk music and dance due to different indigenous peoples and immigrant groups settling there. Additionally, while some regions of Chile have very strong indigenous heritage, such as [[Araucanía Region]], [[Easter Island]], and [[Arica and Parinacota Region|Arica y Parinacota Region]], some regions lacks considerable indigenous communities and a few other regions have noteworthy non-Spanish [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] immigrant heritage.

== National identity ==
The term ''Chilenidad'' describes the Chilean National identity.

Hernán Godoy describes the psychological characteristics of the Chilean, and hence part of the Chilean national identity, with following words: '''[[roto]]''', '''madness''', '''sober''', '''serious''', '''prudent''', '''sense of humor''', '''great fear to the ridicule''', '''servile''', '''cruel''', and '''lack of foresight''', among other qualities. Jorge Larraín criticized these older descriptions as "overgeneralized abstractions" impossible to apply to a whole nation.&lt;ref name=Larrain&gt;Larraín, Jorge. ''Identidad chilena. 2001. Editorial LOM.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural expressions ==

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Chile}}
[[File:Músico chileno tocando cueca.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean huaso singing]]

The national dance is the [[cueca]] (short for ''Zamacueca'') and first appeared in 1824. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the ''[[tonada]]''. Arising
imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody. The cueca was promoted by the [[Pinochet]] regime in the 1970s and 1980s for political reasons to promote Chilean nationalism, cultural pride and conservative patriotic fervor.

In the period starting from 1930 to 1970 appears a rebirth in the interest and popularity in [[folk music]] in Chile carried out initially by groups such as Los Cuatro Huasos, who took folk songs from the Chilean country and arranged them vocally and with musical instruments. They gave several recitals in Chile, and in Latin America that contributed with its diffusion. Later appeared other groups such as [[Los de Ramon]], Los Huasos Quincheros, Los Cuatro Cuartos, and others who continued with this diffusion. Also appeared several Chilean folk composers such as [[Raul de Ramon]], [[Margot Loyola]], Luis Aguirre Pinto, [[Violeta Parra]], [[Víctor Jara]], and others that carried out folk investigation and composed folk music that is still sung up to this day.

In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the [[Parra family]] with the [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]], which became associated with political activism and reformers like Chilean [[socialism|socialist]] [[Salvador Allende]] and his [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] government. Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, [[Los Jaivas]], [[Inti-Illimani]], [[Illapu]] and [[Quilapayún]] perform of this music. During the military rule in the 1970s, all forms of public expression contrary to the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] were repressed, and [[protest song]]s, which were played and circulated in a clandestine manner. In the late 1980s and after the return of democracy in the 1990s, new musical bands like [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]], [[Los Tres]] and [[Los Prisioneros]], began to appear, and the rise of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[alternative rock]] there. Even 1970s [[Chilean rock]] bands like the [[Los Ángeles Negros]] regained popularity across Latin America.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Chilean literature|Land of poets}}
[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|Nobel Laureate [[Gabriela Mistral]]]]

Chile's most famous contributions to literature have come from [[Nobel Prize]] poets [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Gabriela Mistral]], whose homes and birthplaces are now museums that attract literary pilgrims to Chile. The majority of Neruda's poetry, as individual books or [http://amzn.com/0872864286 collections of selected poems], as well as his memoirs,  are widely available in English, however Mistral's works are harder to find, though [http://amzn.com/0826328199 collected editions] are available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redpoppy.net/pablo_neruda.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Chilean authors have earned an international reputation in the literary world. The most famous is novelist [[Isabel Allende]], whose ''House of the Spirits'', ''Of Love and Shadows'', and ''Eva Luna'' have all been international bestsellers. She is the niece of president [[Salvador Allende]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The increasingly popular [[Luis Sepúlveda]] has written stylish short novels like ''The Old Man Who Read Love Stories'', and combines travel writing with imaginative fiction in Full Circle: a South American Journey.

[[José Donoso]]'s novel ''Curfew'' recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while [[Antonio Skármeta]]'s novel ''Burning Patience'' (drawing on Neruda's life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, [[Il Postino]] (The Postman).

=== Arts ===
{{Main|Art of Chile}}
[[File:MC0031801.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[Condorito]] [[comics]] collection, published in Chile in 1955.]]

Established in 1849 in the [[University of Chile]], the Chilean Academy of Painting has helped foster fine painting and inspire young artists. [[Roberto Matta]], a 20th-century painter, is a world known artist who used abstract and surrealist technique in his work. [[Carlos Sotomayor]] (1911–1988) is considered one of the main exponents of cubism from South America. [[Camilo Mori]] (1896–1973) was the founder of the Group Montparnasse. [[Claudio Bravo (painter)|Claudio Bravo]] (1936–2011) was a hyperrealist who lived and worked in [[Morocco]] since 1972.

Sculpture has also been prominent in Chile's culture. In the 19th century, sculptor [[Rebeca Matte]] (1875–1929) was the first Chilean woman to embrace the art. She was commissioned to produce a piece by the government of Chile as a gift to the government of Brazil which she called ''"Icarus and Daedalus"'' (United in Glory and Peace).  In 1930, her husband donated a bronze copy to the Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago which is recognized as a leading masterpiece. Matte also created a battle monument as a tribute to the heroes of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. In the 20th century, [[Marta Colvin]] (1907–1995) gained international status by exhibiting her work in cities around the world

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Chilean cuisine}}
[[File:S4020436.JPG|thumb|[[Paila marina]]]]

'''Chilean cuisine''' uses a variety of products due to Chile's location and long coastline. The cuisine arose from the fusion of traditional indigenous ingredients with Spanish culture and traditions. Further European immigration also brought various styles and traditions in cooking were heavily influenced by the [[Italians]] and the [[Germans]]. In the 20th century, [[French cuisine]] marked an important turning point influencing culinary methods and creating a type of [[Criollo people|Criollo]] style that has been implemented now in Chilean cooking. [[British cuisine|British cooking influences]] include the ''onces'' or [[tea]] breaks usually taken in the afternoon among Chileans of all classes and backgrounds. Many Chilean recipes are enhanced and accompanied by [[wine]] and Chilean ''[[pisco]]'', a type of grape [[brandy]] produced in Chile, Pisco is also consumed in neighbouring Peru. Throughout Chile each region spanning from north to south contain a variety of culinary recipes special to each location.

The most important filmmakers include [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] (''[[Palomita Blanca]]''), [[Miguel Littín]] (''[[El chacal de Nahueltoro]]''), [[Silvio Caiozzi]] (''[[Julio comienza en julio]]''), and [[Andrés Wood]] (''[[Machuca]]''). Other entertainment includes [[radio]] and [[television]] with [[TVN (Chile)|TVN]] (Television Nacional de Chile) owned but not paid by the government but funding comes from commercial sponsors by private companies and media productions.

=== Sports ===
{{Main|Sport in Chile}}
[[File:Estadio Nacional de Chile.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Estadio Nacional de Chile]]]]

==== Futbol (soccer) ====
{{Main|Football in Chile}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Chile, and practiced by Chileans from all economic backgrounds, it is the one sport that appeals to both young and old that is the most accessible. The [[Chilean Football Federation|Federación de Fútbol de Chile]] is the governing body of "fútbol" in Chile. Practices such as "baby fútbol", which is a street level scrimmage match, is played on areas made of concrete. Located throughout Chile are football stadiums such as [[Estadio Nacional de Chile]] located in Santiago, and where the final of the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] was held. Chile was banned in [[FIFA]] participation in the early 1990s due to a faked player injury on the field during a 1989 playoff game and could not appear in the 1990 and [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] events as a result.

==== Skiing ====
Chile practices a host of sporting events, and because of its geographical location that is situated between the [[Andes Mountains]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] are done in between those two locations. With more than {{convert|4,000|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} of mountains, Chile is known internationally as one of the world's best skiing destinations and the best in South America. This is a very popular sport in Chile among the wealthier classes (considering that this is an expensive sport in this country). This recognition is based on the excellent quality of the slopes, a beautiful landscape, accessibility and proximity to urban centers. [[Santiago de Chile]] is interested in hosting the [[Winter Olympics]] in the future, destined to be the second site in the southern hemisphere.

The main ski centers are located in Central Chile right in the middle of the Andes, at heights that vary from {{convert|2,400|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} up to {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level. These centers are the ones with the biggest skiing surfaces as well as the best supporting infrastructure.

The centers of Southern Chile are located at lower altitudes and most of them are on volcano slopes. The scenery is notable, including scenic forests and panoramic views.&lt;ref name="Chile Activities: Skiing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gochile.cl/Activ/ski.asp |title=Chile Activities: Skiing |publisher=Gochile.cl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116012433/http://www.gochile.cl/Activ/ski.asp |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surfing ====
{{Main|Surfing in Chile}}
Chile is a great [[surfing]] destination, and from the Northern region to the Central region there are many beaches with the right conditions for the sport. It is possible to surf almost all year round except for the middle of the winter (July and August) when weather conditions are non-conducive to surfing. The water temperature fluctuates between 10&amp;nbsp;°C to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (50° and 68&amp;nbsp;°F).

In northern Chile, the waves are smaller, but very forceful, and between [[Arica]] and [[Iquique]], ''tubes'' are common. The temperature of the water fluctuates between 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (59° and 68&amp;nbsp;°F). Due to the difficult conditions of the [[Atacama Desert]], there are many unexplored, quiet beaches in that area. In the Central Region, the water is a little bit colder, and there are steeper shores and bigger waves.&lt;ref name="Chile Activities: Skiing" /&gt;

==== Basketball ====
In addition to football (soccer), [[basketball]] is particularly popular in southern Chile, where it as an indoor sport can be played all year round despite Southern Chile's cold and rainy winters. The ''NCBAOC'' is the official league. It stands for the National Chile Basketball Association of Chile.

==== Rodeo ====
{{Main|Chilean rodeo}}

[[Chilean rodeo|Rodeo]] is the second most popular sport in Chile{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. It was declared the national sport in 1962. It has since thrived, especially in the more rural areas of the country. Chilean rodeo is different from the [[rodeo]] found in North America. In Chilean rodeo, a team (called a ''collera'') consisting of two riders (called [[Huasos]]) and two horses rides laps around an arena trying to stop a [[calf (animal)|calf]], pinning him against massive cushions. Points are earned for every time the steer is properly driven around the corral, with deductions for faults. Rodeos are conducted in a crescent-shaped corral called a [[medialuna]].

'''Democratic education''' is an educational ideal in which democracy is both a goal and a method of instruction. It brings [[democracy|democratic values]] to education and can include [[self-determination theory|self-determination]] within a community of equals, as well as such values as justice, respect and trust.  Democratic education is often specifically emancipatory, with the students' voices being equal to the teacher's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy Out of Bounds: Untamed Variations of Democratic Education|page=33

==History==
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|thumb|Locke's ''Thoughts'', 1693]]
The history of democratic education spans from at least the 1600s. While it is associated with a number of individuals, there has been no central figure, establishment, or nation that advocated democratic education.&lt;ref&gt;Provenzo, E.F. Jr. (ed) (2008) ''Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. p 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment era===
In 1693, [[John Locke]] published ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. In describing the teaching of children, he declares,

&lt;blockquote&gt;None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of delight or indifferency. Let a child but be order'd to whip his top at a certain time every day, whether he has or has not a mind to it; let this be but requir'd of him as a duty, wherein he must spend so many hours morning and afternoon, and see whether he will not soon be weary of any play at this rate.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1692) Some Thoughts Concerning Education, para 73.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]’s book of advice on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]'', was first published in 1762. Émile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1904), Emile ou l’éducation, Garnier Frères, Paris, page 197: “. . si nous trouvons que ce travail n’est bon à rien, nous ne le reprendrons plus.”&lt;/ref&gt; He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. “The tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,”&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau 1904, page 22 “Il ne doit pas donner des préceptes, il doit les faire trouver.”&lt;/ref&gt; wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make Émile learn science, but let him discover it.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau 1904, page 173: “Qu’il n’apprenne pas la science, qu’il l’invente”&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not teach us to reason; it teaches us to use other people’s reasoning; it teaches us to believe a great deal but never to know anything.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau 1904, page 121: “Substituer des livres à tout cela, ce n’est pas nous apprendre a nous servir de la raison d’autrui; c’est nous apprendre à beaucoup croire, et à ne jamais rien savoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
While Locke and Rousseau were concerned only with the education of the children of the wealthy, in the 19th century [[Leo Tolstoy]] set up a school for peasant children. This was on his own estate at [[Yasnaya Polyana]], Russia, in the late 19th century. He tells us that the school evolved freely from principles introduced by teachers and pupils; that in spite of the preponderating influence of the teacher, the pupil had always had the right not to come to school, or, having come, not to listen to the teacher, and that the teacher had the right not to admit a pupil, and was able to use all the influence he could muster to win over the community, where the children were always in the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo, in "The School at Yasnaya Polyana" in ''Tolstoy on Education'', translated by Leo Wiener (1967), University of Chicago Press, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcivilisation.com/smartboard/shop/smmnsej/tolstoy/chap4.htm|title=3.

===20th century===

====Dom Sierot====
In 1912, [[Janusz Korczak]] founded Dom Sierot, the Jewish orphanage in [[Warsaw]], which was run on democratic lines until 1940, when he accompanied all his charges to the gas-chambers of the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Korczak.html|work=Jewish Virtual Library|title=Janusz Korczak|accessdate=2015-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korczak, Janusz (1991), Von Kindern und anderen Vorbildern, Güterslohe Verlagshaus (translated from the Polish), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korczak, Janusz (1979) Von Kindern und anderen Vorbildern, Güterslohe Verlagshaus, pages 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influential democratic schools====
[[File:SummerhillSchool.jpg|thumb|Main building of the [[Summerhill School]]]]
The oldest democratic school that still exists is [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]], in [[Suffolk, England]], founded in 1921. It features voluntary class attendance and a School Meeting with broad powers.

[[Sudbury Valley School]], founded in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] in 1968, has full democratic governance: The School Meeting manages all aspects of the school, including staff hiring and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudval.com/01_abou_05.html|title=Sudbury Valley School • About SVS - How the School Operates|first=Design by Chris Bird http://cbirdesign.com/, maintenance and programming by Scott David Gray|last=http://www.unseelie.org/|website=www.sudval.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "[[Sudbury school]]" is now a general class of school modeled after this original.

The term Democratic Education originates from The [[Democratic School of Hadera|Hadera democratic school]], the first school in the world called a democratic school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=VwMbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT106&amp;lpg=PT106&amp;dq=Yaacov+hecht&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uF-p0NVJNN&amp;sig=yj-G--8O3Kp0F1nw6wa2rEEVCM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI5pqLiPbZAhUE2aQKHbPAARc4KBDoAQgkMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Yaacov%20hecht&amp;f=false |title=Creative Schools |date= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was founded in Israel in 1987 by [[Yaacov Hecht]]. It is a public school.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Yaacov (2010) Democratic Education: A beginning of a Story, Innovation Culture, {{ISBN|978-0-9745252-9-7}}. pp 57-68&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been embraced by alternative/open schools all over the world, predominantly following the foundation of IDEC – the [[International Democratic Education Conference]], which was first convened at the democratic school in Hadera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationrevolution.org/blog/list-of-democratic-schools/|title=Democratic Schools – Education Revolution – Alternative Education Resource Organization|website=www.educationrevolution.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free schools movement====
In the 1960s, hundreds of [[Free school movement|"free schools"]] opened, many based on Summerhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/a/ahecat22/F07history.html|title=Academic.evergreen.edu End of Life - Tech News|website=academic.evergreen.edu|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[A.S. Neill]], the founder of Summerhill, distanced himself from American Summerhill schools for not successfully implementing the philosophy of "Freedom, not license."&lt;ref&gt;conversation between A.S. Neill and Mario Montessori, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as "Radical Private Schools" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p18&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Free school movement]] (including many schools based on Summerhill&lt;ref name="Duke1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Linden Duke|title=The retransformation of the school: the emergence of contemporary alternative schools in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TucAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=September 1978|publisher=Nelson-Hall|isbn=978-0-88229-294-6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) became a broad movement in the 1960s and 1970s, but was largely renounced by the 1980s. [[Progressive education]] and Dewey’s ideals did influence them, but only indirectly for the most part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathsoflearning.net/books_Free_Schools_Free_People.php|title=Free Schools, Free People|website=pathsoflearning.net|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225162332/http://www.pathsoflearning.net/books_Free_Schools_Free_People.php|archivedate=25 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Networks====
Networks supporting democratic education include:
* The [[Alternative Education Resource Organization]] launched in 1989 to create a "student-driven, learner-centered approaches to education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationrevolution.org/about-aero/|title=About AERO|website=educationrevolution.org|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426171402/http://www.educationrevolution.org/about-aero/|archivedate=26 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual [[International Democratic Education Conference]], first held in 1993.
* The Australasian Democratic Education Community, which held its first conference in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adec.edu.au/|title=ADEC - Australasian Democratic Education Community|website=adec.edu.au|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[European Democratic Education Community]] was founded in 2008, at the first [[European Democratic Education Conference]].
* The Réseau des écoles démocratiques au Québec, or RÉDAQ, was founded in 2012 in order to sponsor the creation of democratic schools in the province of Québec, Canada.
* The [[Alliance for Self-Directed Education]] launched in 2016 to make Self-Directed Education a normal and accessible option for all families.

IDEC 2005 named two core beliefs: self-determination and democratic governance.&lt;ref name="Berlin IDEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.idec2005.org/documentation/resolution/|title=IDEC 2005 - Documentation|first=IDEC 2005|last=Berlin|website=en.idec2005.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EUDEC has both of these beliefs, and mutual respect is also in their belief statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eudec.org/Democratic+Education|title=European Democratic Education Community - Democratic Education|website=www.eudec.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDEN supports schools that self-identify as democratic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idenetwork.org/ IDEN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variety==
Democratic education, same as a Democracy or a democratic government, comes in many different forms. These are some of the areas in which democratic schools differ.

===Curriculum===
Democratic schools are characterized by involving students in the decision-making process that affects what and how they learn. Democratic schools have no mandatory curriculum, considering forced learning to be undemocratic. Some democratic schools officially offer voluntary courses, and many help interested students to prepare for national examinations so they gain qualifications for further study or future employment.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] and [http://www.kapriole-freiburg.de/ the Kapriole]&lt;/ref&gt; Some democratic schools have no official offering of courses, although courses can be offered or requested by school members.&lt;ref name="Sudbury schools"&gt;[[Sudbury schools]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative structure===
Democratic schools often have meetings open to all students and staff, where everyone present has a voice and sometimes an equal vote. Some include parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schuelerinnenschule.at/|title=SchülerInnenschule im Wiener WUK|website=SchülerInnenschule|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These school meetings can cover anything from small matters to the appointment or dismissal of staff and the creation or annulment of rules, or to general expenditure and the structure of the school day. At some schools all students are expected to attend these meetings, at others they are voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idenetwork.org/schools/democratic-schools-all.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516125634/http://www.idenetwork.org/schools/democratic-schools-all.htm |archivedate=2012-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main school meeting may also set up sub-committees to deal with particular issues, such as conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Valley School"&gt;[[Sudbury Valley School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict resolution===
Within the purview of democratic values, there is wide scope for [[conflict resolution|how conflicts are resolved]]. There may be a formal system, with due process and the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Valley School"/&gt; There may be rules but no punishments.&lt;ref&gt;[Sands school]&lt;/ref&gt; Other possibilities include, but are not limited to, a consensus process, mediation, and informal dialogue.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

'''Location:''' Democratic education is not limited to any particular setting. Settings for democratic learning communities include in an office building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shure.or.jp/english/|title=Tokyo Shure|website=shure.or.jp|accessdate=27 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020416014840/http://www.shure.or.jp/english/|archivedate=16 April 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on city streets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.butterflieschildrights.org/|title=Butterflies NGO|website=www.butterflieschildrights.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a rural area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehighlandschool.org|title=The Highland School: democratic boarding and day school in WV, USA|website=The Highland School: democratic boarding and day school in WV, USA|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
While types of democratic education are as numerous as [[List of types of democracy#Types of democracy|types of democracy]], a general definition of democratic education is "an education that democratizes learning itself."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, E. (2003) ''The University in a Corporate Culture.'' Yale University Press. p 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of democratic education vary according to the participants, the location, and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Boyd, P. (2003) ''Middle Grades Education: A Reference Handbook.'' ABC-CLIO. p 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no unified body of literature, spanning multiple disciplines, on democratic education. However, there are theories of democratic education from the following perspectives:

===Cognitive theory===
During the [[practice theory]] movement, there was renewed interest in child development. [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of universal steps in comprehension and general patterns in the acquisition of knowledge was challenged by experiences at democratic schools. "No two kids ever take the same path. Few are remotely similar. Each child is so unique, so exceptional."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=%22Learning%22+Greenberg+Free+at+Last+Learning+-+The+Sudbury+Valley+School&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TkL0NkwkBG&amp;sig=aTvBo6l-92OZUeeW5tPB4-Nr0m8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IEn-SorsDJ2wnQOWuvTzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20steps%20in%20comprehension&amp;f=false, Learning]," Free at Last — The Sudbury Valley School. Retrieved August 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Lave]] was one of the first and most prominent social anthropologists to discuss cognition within the context of cultural settings presenting a firm argument against the [[Functional psychology|functionalist psychology]] that many educationalists refer to implicitly.
For Lave, learning is a process ungone by an actor within a specific context. The skills or knowledge learned in one process are not generalizable nor reliably transferred to other areas of human action. Her primary focus was on mathematics in context and mathematics education.

The broader implications reached by Lave and others who specialize in [[situated learning]] are that beyond the argument that certain knowledge is necessary to be a member of society (a Durkheimian argument), knowledge learned in the context of a school is not reliably transferable to other contexts of practice.

John Locke argues that children are capable of reasoning at a young age:  “It will perhaps be wonder’d, that I mention reasoning with children; and yet I cannot but think that the true way of dealing with them. They understand it as early as they do language; and, if I misobserve not, they love to be treated as rational creatures, sooner than is imagin’d,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Some Thoughts Concerning Education: By John Locke, Esq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7J0IAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=1779|publisher=J. and R. Tonson}}, paragraph 81&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau disagreed: “Use force with children and reasoning with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Jacques Rousseau|author2=John Rousseau|title=Emile, Or on Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2dbYNVDpY8C|accessdate=26 May 2013|date=30 August 2007|publisher=NuVision Publications, LLC|isbn=978-1-61536-196-0}}, p63&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans are innately [[curiosity|curious]], and democratic education supports the belief that the drive to learn is sufficiently strong to motivate children to become effective adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Marano| first1 = Hana Estroff| title = Education: Class dismissed| url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200604/education-class-dismissed| work = Psychology Today| accessdate = May 26, 2013| date = Feb 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism based on cognitive theory====

The human brain is not fully developed until adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human brain development timeline]]&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage of teenagers being responsible for their own education is that "young brains have both fast-growing synapses and sections that remain unconnected. This leaves teens easily influenced by their environment and more prone to impulsive behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/09/the-teen-brain.html|title=The Teen Brain|date=1 September 2008|website=harvardmagazine.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
[[Democracy]] can be valued on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kelsen, Ethics, Vol. 66, No. 1, Part 2: Foundations of Democracy (October , 1955), pp. 1–101&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural theory====

Democratic education is consistent with the cultural theory that "learning in school must be continuous with life outside of school" and that children should become active participants in the control and organization of their community.&lt;ref name="EducationBaker1941"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Progressive Education Association (U.S.). Informal Committee on Evaluation of Newer Practices in Education|author2=George Derwood Baker|author3=Robert Morris William Travers|author4=Mabel Viola Cassell|title=New Methods Vs.

Research on hunter-gatherer societies indicates that free play and exploration were effective transmitters of the societies' culture to children.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, P. Nature’s powerful tutors: The educative functions of free play and exploration. ''Eye on Psi Chi'', 12 (#1), 18-21. 2007. &lt;http://www.psichi.org/Pubs/Articles/Article_645.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[George Dennison]], democratic environments are social regulators: Our desire to cultivate friendships, engender respect, and maintain what George Dennison terms ‘natural authority’ encourages us to act in socially acceptable ways (i.e. culturally informed practices of fairness, honesty, congeniality, etc.).&lt;ref name="Dennison1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Dennison|title= The Lives of Children: The Story of the First Street School |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I74EAAAACAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=Boyton/Cook Publishers|isbn=978-0-86709-483-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism based on cultural theory====

Children are influenced by many curricula beyond the school curriculum: TV curricula, advertisers' curricula, curricula of religious communities, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, encyclopedias etc. and therefore "one of the most significant tasks any school can undertake is to try to develop in youngsters an awareness of these other curricula and an ability to criticize them…it is utter nonsense to think that by turning children loose in an unplanned and unstructured environment they can be freed in any significant way. Rather, they are thereby abandoned to the blind forces of the hucksters, whose primary concern is neither the children, nor the truth, nor the decent future of ... society."&lt;ref name="DealNolan1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terrence E. Deal|author2=Robert R. Nolan|title=Alternative schools: ideologies, realities, guidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xWjuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=1978|publisher=Nelson-Hall|isbn=978-0-88229-383-7|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émile Durkheim]] argues that the transition from primitive to modern societies occurred in part as elders made a conscious decision to transmit what were deemed the most essential elements of their culture to the following generations.  He concludes that modern societies are so complex—much more complex than primitive hunter-gatherer societies—and the roles that individuals must fill in society are so varied, that formal mass-education is necessary to instill social solidarity and what he terms ‘secular morality’.&lt;ref name="Durkheim1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Émile Durkheim|title=Moral education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxl6ULMGqbYC|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=1961|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-14345-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political theory===

There are a variety of political components to democratic education. One author identifies those elements as inclusivity and rights, equal participation in [[decision-making]], and equal encouragement for success.&lt;ref name="English, L.D. 2002 p 21" /&gt; The Institute for Democratic Education's principles of democratic education identifies several political principles,
* The interaction between democratic philosophy and education,
* [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralistic education]],
* School administration by means of democratic procedures,
* Education based on respect for [[human rights]],
* [[Dialogic]] evaluation,
* Dialogic relationships, and
* [[Critical social thought|Critical social thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democratic-edu.org/International/Activities/Course.php "Course for consultants on democratic processes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908052701/http://www.democratic-edu.org/International/Activities/Course.php |date=2008-09-08 }}, Institute for Democratic Education. Retrieved 1/13/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on quality of education====

The type of political socialization that takes place in democratic schools is strongly related to [[deliberative democracy]] theory. Claus Offe and Ulrich Preuss, two theorists of the political culture of deliberative democracies argue that in its cultural production deliberative democracy requires “an open-ended and continuous learning process in which the roles of both ‘teacher’ and ‘curriculum’ are missing. In other words, what is to be learned is a matter that we must settle in the process of learning itself."&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. “Democratic Institutions and Moral Resources” “Political Theory Today.” David Held, ed. Cambridge: Polity, 1991, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political culture of a deliberative democracy and its institutions, they argue, would facilitate more “dialogical forms of making one’s voice heard” which would “be achieved within a framework of liberty, within which paternalism is replaced by autonomously adopted self-paternalism, and technocratic elitism by the competent and self-conscious judgment of citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. “Democratic Institutions and Moral Resources” “Political Theory Today.” David Held, ed. Cambridge: Polity, 1991, 170-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a curricular, administrative and social operation within schools, democratic education is essentially concerned with equipping people to make "real choices about fundamental aspects of their lives"&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, D.J. (2007) ''Democratic Education Stretched Thin: How Complexity Challenges a Liberal Ideal.'' SUNY Press. p 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and happens ''within'' and ''for'' [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, D. (1997) ''Education, Autonomy and Democratic Citizenship: Philosophy in a Changing World.'' Routledge. p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be "a process where teachers and students work collaboratively to reconstruct curriculum to include everyone."&lt;ref name="English, L.D. 2002 p 21"&gt;English, L.D. (2002) ''Handbook of International Research in Mathematics Education.'' Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one conception, democratic education teaches students "to participate in consciously reproducing their society, and conscious social reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, A. (1987) ''Democratic Education.'' Princeton University Press. p 321.&lt;/ref&gt; This role necessitates democratic education happening in a variety of settings and being taught by a variety of people, including "parents, teachers, public officials, and ordinary citizens." Because of this "democratic education begins not only with children who are to be taught but also with citizens who are to be their teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, A. (1987) p 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparation for life in a democracy====

The "strongest, political rationale" for democratic education is that it teaches "the virtues of democratic deliberation for the sake of future citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Curren, R. (2007) ''Philosophy of Education: An Anthology.'' Blackwell Publishing. p 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making, negotiation, and social life of consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Education-Practice-Mission-Practitioner/dp/0807753807/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370321019&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=matthew+knoester |title=Democratic Education in Practice: Inside the Mission Hill School |publisher=Teachers College Press |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civic education====

The concept of the [[hidden curriculum]] includes the belief that anything taught in an authoritarian setting is implicitly teaching authoritarianism. Thus civic education, if taught in a compulsory setting, undermines its own lessons in democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Portis, E. (2003) [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p63746_index.html "Democratic Education and Political Participation,"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia Marriott Hotel, Philadelphia, PA. Retrieved 1/15/09.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief in democratic schools is that democracy must be experienced to be learned.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mg1fAMTBzg&amp;sig=RU2ySV7AFFwxFNMqkAZQ6xHHP1I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qxnfSuCkB4_4mwOx4vWmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved August 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;conversation between A.S. Neill and Mario Montessori, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as "Radical Private Schools" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Aristotle: ''"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them."'' in Bynum, W.F. and Porter, R. (eds) (2005) ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations.'' Oxford University Press. 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument conforms to the cognition-in-context research by [[Jean Lave|Lave]].

Another common belief, which supports the practice of compulsory classes in [[civic education]], is that passing on democratic values requires an imposed structure.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Democratic Education by [[Amy Gutmann]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments about how to transmit democracy, and how much and how early to treat children democratically, are made in various literatures concerning [[student voice]], [[youth participation]] and other elements of [[youth empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendel-Reyes, M. (1998) "A Pedagogy for Citizenship: Service Learning and Democratic Education," ''New Directions for Teaching and Learning. 73'', pp 31 - 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sehr, D.T. (1997) ''Education for Public Democracy.'' [[SUNY Press]]. p 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard progressive visions of education as collaboration tend to downplay the workings of power in society.  If learners are to "develop a democracy," some scholars have argued, they must be provided the tools for transforming the non-democratic aspects of a society.  Democracy in this sense involves not just "participation in decision making," a vision ascribed especially to Dewey, but the ability to confront power with solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C. W. (2008) "The Sociological Imagination"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A. (2010) ''Social Class, Social Action, and Education: The Failure of Progressive Democracy.'' [[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic theory====
Core features of democratic education align with the emerging consensus on 21st century business and management priorities. Such features include increased collaboration, decentralized organization, and radical creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review, (http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/hamel/2009/02/25_stretch_goals_for_managemen.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum theory===
While democratic schools don't have an official curriculum, what each student actually does might be considered their own curriculum.&lt;ref name="Ricci2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlo Ricci|title=The Willed Curriculum, Unschooling, and Self-Direction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CCAtgAACAAJ|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Ricci Publishing|isbn=978-0-9878518-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey &lt;ref&gt;John Dewey 1916 ''Democracy and Education'', Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; was an early advocate of inquiry education, in which student questions and interests shaped curriculum, a sharp contrast to the "factory model" that began to predominate education during the 20th century as standardization became a guiding principle of many educational practices. Although there was a resurgence of inquiry education in the 1980s and 1990s &lt;ref&gt;Kathy Short, Jerome Harste, and Carolyn Burke 1996, "Creating Classrooms for Authors and Inquirers, 2nd edition", Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; the standards movement of the 21st century and the attendant school reform movement have squashed most attempts at authentic inquiry-oriented democratic education practices. The standards movement has reified standardized tests in literacy and writing, neglecting science inquiry, the arts, and critical literacy.

Democratic schools may not consider only reading, writing and arithmetic to be the real basics for being a successful adult.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Greenberg|title=Education in America: A View from Sudbury Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C|accessdate=7 June 2013|date=1 January 1992|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School|isbn=978-1-888947-07-6|pages=19–22|chapter="The Basics" Re-Examined}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.S. Neill said "To hell with arithmetic."&lt;ref&gt;conversation between A.S. Neill and Mario Montessori, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as "Radical Private Schools" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p16&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, there is a common belief that people will eventually learn "the basics" when they develop internal motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Greenberg|title=Free at Last: The Sudbury Valley School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=es2nOuZE0rAC&amp;pg=PA2|accessdate=7 June 2013|year=1995|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School|isbn=978-1-888947-00-7|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mario Montessori 1964, p17"&gt;Mario Montessori, in conversation with A.S. Neill, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as "Radical Private Schools" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p17&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an educator implementing inquiry projects will look at the "next steps" in a student's learning and incorporate basic subject matter as needed. This is easier to accomplish in elementary school settings than in secondary school settings, as elementary teachers typically teach all subjects and have large blocks of time that allow for in-depth projects that integrate curriculum from different knowledge domains.

Allen Koshewa &lt;ref&gt;Allen Koshewa 1999, "Discipline and Democracy: Teachers on Trial" Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; conducted research that highlighted the tensions between democratic education and the role of teacher control, showing that children in a fifth grade classroom tried to usurp democratic practices by using undue influence to sway others, much as representative democracies often fail to focus on the common good or protect minority interests. He found that class meetings, service education, saturation in the arts, and an emphasis on interpersonal caring helped overcome some of these challenges. Despite the challenges of inquiry education, classrooms that allow students to make choices about curriculum propel students to not only learn about democracy but also to experience it.

==Democratic education in practice==

===Play===
A striking feature of democratic schools is the ubiquity of [[Play (activity)|play]]. Students of all ages — but especially the younger ones — often spend most of their time either in free play, or playing [[game]]s ([[video game|electronic]] or otherwise). All attempts to limit, control or direct play must be democratically approved before being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/424/kid-politics|title=Kid Politics|website=thisamericanlife.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play is seen as activity every bit as worthy as academic pursuits, often even more valuable. Play is considered essential for learning, particularly in fostering creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sudval.org/05_underlyingideas.html#02|title=Sudbury Valley School • Online Library. Underlying Ideas|first=Design by Chris Bird http://cbirdesign.com/, maintenance and programming by Scott David Gray|last=http://www.unseelie.org/|website=sudval.org|accessdate=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227122813/http://sudval.org/05_underlyingideas.html#02|archive-date=2017-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reading, writing and arithmetic===

It was Invented by Liam Doherty. Interest in learning to read happens at a wide variety of ages.&lt;ref name="Mario Montessori 1964, p17"/&gt; Progressive educators emphasise students' choice in reading selections, as well as topics for writing. In addition, Stephen Krashen &lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Krashen 2014 /The Common Core: A Disaster for Libraries, A Disaster for Language Arts, a Disaster for American Education Knowledge Quest 42(3): 37-45 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and other proponents of democratic education emphasise the role of libraries in promoting democratic education. Others, such as children's author Judy Blume, have spoken out against censorship as antagonistic to democratic education,&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Blume 2013, https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/09/judy-blume-banned-books"&lt;/ref&gt; while the school reform movement, which gained traction under the federal initiative 'No Child Left Behind' and later under 'Race to the Top' and the Common Core Standards movement, emphasise strict control over curriculum.

==Education in a democratic society==

Democracy must be experienced to be learned.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Valley School"/&gt;

As English aristocracy was giving way to democracy, [[Matthew Arnold]] investigated popular education in France and other countries to determine what form of education suited a democratic age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=3147| work = Teachers College Record| title = Matthew Arnold: Democratic Education reviewed by Russell Kirk| year = 1962| accessdate = May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold wrote that "the spirit of democracy" is part of "human nature itself", which engages in "the effort to affirm one's own essence...to develop one's own existence fully and freely."&lt;ref name="Arnold1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Arnold|title=Democratic education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLf830Psmq4C&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=1962|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11652-2|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the industrial age, [[John Dewey#On education|John Dewey]] argued that children should not all be given the same pre-determined curriculum. In [[Democracy and Education]] he develops a philosophy of education based on democracy. He argues that while children should be active participants in the creation of their education, and while children must experience democracy to learn democracy, they need adult guidance to develop into responsible adults.&lt;ref name="Dewey2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Dewey|title=Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRFWAJJVE_EC|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Indo-European Publishing|isbn=978-1-60444-120-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amy Gutmann]] argues in Democratic Education that in a democratic society, there is a role for everyone in the education of children. These roles are best agreed upon through [[deliberative democracy]].&lt;ref name="Gutmann1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amy Gutmann|title=Democratic Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZf7R6k4WHAC|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=29 March 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2291-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal Democracy and Education investigates "the conceptual foundations, social policies, institutional structures, and teaching/learning practices associated with democratic education." By "democratic education" they mean "educating youth...for active participation in a democratic society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracyeducationjournal.org/home/|title=Democracy &amp; Education journal - Lewis and Clark Graduate School of Education and Counseling|website=democracyeducationjournal.org|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaacov Hecht]] claims that the Democratic Education, being an education that prepares for life in a democratic culture, it is the missing piece in the intricate puzzle which is the democratic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education-cities.com/education-2-0-from-a-pyramid-paradigm-to-a-network-paradigm/?lang=en|title=Education 2.0: From a pyramid paradigm to a network paradigm|website=education-cities.com|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training programs==
Israel's Institute for Democratic Education and Kibbutzim College in Tel Aviv collaborate to offer a Bachelor of Education (B. Ed.) degree with a Specialization Certificate in Democratic Education. [[Student teaching]] placements are in both regular schools and democratic schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smkb.ac.il/en/democratic The Institute for Democratic Education at Kibbutzim College]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

=== The United Nations and democratic education ===

United Nations agreements both support and place restrictions on education options, including democratic education:

Article 26(3) of the United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|publisher = United Nations| title = Universal Declaration of Human Rights| date = 10 Dec 1948| accessdate = 14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this in itself may allow parents the right to choose democratic education, Articles 28 and 29 of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] place requirements on educational programs: Primary education is compulsory, all aspects of each student must be developed to their full potential, and education must include the development of respect for things such as national values and the natural environment, in a spirit of friendship among all peoples.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx |title=Text of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|last1=United Nations General Assembly|date=Nov 20, 1989 |work=ohchr.org|publisher=UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, while Article 12(1) of the Convention mandates that children be able to have input on all matters that affect them, their input will have limited weight, "due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child."&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

===Summerhill===

In 1999, Summerhill received a 'notice of complaint' over its policy of non-compulsory lessons, a procedure which would usually have led to closure; Summerhill contested the notice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/683649.stm|title=Summerhill on trial|work=[[BBC News]]|date=20 March 2000|accessdate=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went before a special educational tribunal. Summerhill was represented by a noted human rights lawyer, [[Geoffrey Robertson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. The government's case soon collapsed, and a settlement was offered. This offer was discussed and agreed at a formal school meeting which had been hastily convened in the courtroom from a quorum of pupils and teachers who were present in court. The settlement guaranteed that future inspections of Summerhill would be consistent with Summerhill's educational philosophy.&lt;ref name=bbc020323&gt;{{cite news|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=23 March 2000|title=Summerhill closure threat lifted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk./1/hi/education/688152.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the storytelling style|music produced from within a fictional world|Diegetic music}}{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

'''Diegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|διήγησις}} from {{lang|grc|διηγεῖσθαι}}, "to narrate") is a style of [[fictional|fiction]] storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:
# details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
# the story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince, A Dictionary of Narratology, 2003, University of Nebraska Press, {{ISBN|0-8032-8776-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# there is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.

In diegesis, the [[narrator]] ''tells'' the story. The narrator presents the actions (and sometimes thoughts) of the characters to the readers or audience. Diegetic elements are part of the fictional world ("part of the story"), as opposed to non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story ("part of the storytelling").

== In contrast to mimesis ==
''Diegesis'' (Greek διήγησις "narration") and ''[[mimesis]]'' (Greek μίμησις "imitation") have been contrasted since [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s times. ''Mimesis'' ''shows'' rather than ''tells'', by means of action that is enacted. ''Diegesis'' is the ''telling'' of a [[Narrative|story]] by a [[narrator]]. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the ''invisible narrator'', or even the ''all-knowing narrator'' who speaks from "outside" in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 373 BC), [[Plato]] examines the "style" of "poetry" (the term includes [[comedy]], [[tragedy]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration."([[Plato]], [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]], Book III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (''diegesis'') and imitation or representation (''[[mimesis]]''). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as him or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary "elsewhere" set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as "hypothetically actual" constructs, since they are "seen" in progress "here and now" without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] argues that kinds of "poetry" (the term includes [[drama]], [[flute]] [[music]], and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or "manner" (section I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III).

== Definition ==
In [[filmmaking]] the term is used to name the story depicted on screen, as opposed to the story in [[Real time (media)|real time]] that the screen narrative is about. Diegesis may concern elements, such as characters, events, and things within the main or ''primary'' narrative. However, the author may include elements that are not intended for the primary narrative, such as stories within stories. Characters and events may be referred to elsewhere or in historical contexts and are therefore outside the main story; thus, they are presented in an ''extradiegetic'' situation.

== In literature ==
For [[Narratology|narratologists]] all parts of narratives—characters, narrators, existents, actors—are characterized in terms of diegesis. For definitions of diegesis, one should consult Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''; [[Gerard Genette]]'s ''Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method'' (Cornell University Press, 1980); or (for a readable introduction) H. Porter Abbott's ''The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative'' (Cambridge University Press 2002). In literature, discussions of diegesis tend to concern discourse/sjužet (in [[Russian Formalism]]) (vs. story/[[Fabula and syuzhet|fabula]]).

Diegesis is multi-levelled in narrative fiction. Genette distinguishes between three "diegetic levels". The '''extradiegetic level''' (the level of the narrative's telling) is, according to Prince, "external to (not part of) any diegesis." One might think of this as what we commonly understand to be the narrator's level, the level at which exists a narrator who is not part of the story being told. The '''diegetic level''' or '''intradiegetic level''' is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. The '''metadiegetic level''' or '''hypodiegetic level''' is that part of a diegesis that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a [[story within a story]], as when a diegetic narrator himself/herself tells a story.

== In film ==
The classical distinction between the diegetic mode and the mimetic mode relate to the difference between the ''epos'' (or [[epic poetry]]) and ''drama''.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (1980, 110–111).&lt;/ref&gt; The "epos" relates stories by ''telling'' them through narration, while drama enacts stories through direct embodiment (''showing''). In terms of classical [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetics]], the cinema is an ''epic'' form that utilizes ''dramatic'' elements; this is determined by the technologies of ''the camera'' and ''editing''. Even in a spatially and temporally continuous scene (mimicking the theatrical situation, as it were), the camera ''chooses'' where to look for us. In a similar way, editing causes us to jump from one place (and/or time) to another, whether it be elsewhere in the room, or across town. This jump is a form of narration; it is as if a narrator whispers to us: "meanwhile, on the other side of the forest". It is for this reason that the "story-world" in cinema is referred to as "diegetic"; elements that belong to the film's narrative world are diegetic elements. This is why, in the cinema, we may refer to the film's ''diegetic world''.

"Diegetic", in the cinema, typically refers to the internal world created by the story that the characters themselves experience and encounter: the narrative "space" that includes all the parts of the story, both those that are and those that are not actually shown on the screen (such as events that have led up to the present action; people who are being talked about; or events that are presumed to have happened elsewhere or at a different time).

Thus, elements of a film can be "diegetic" or "non-diegetic". These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film, but can apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither taking place in the world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a [[non-diegetic insert]]. Titles, subtitles, and [[voice-over]] narration (with some exceptions) are also non-diegetic.

== In video games ==
In video games "diegesis" comprises the narrative game world, its characters, objects and actions which can be classified as "intra-diegetic", by both being part of the narration and not breaking the [[fourth wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://devmag.org.za/2011/02/02/video-game-user-interface-design-diegesis-theory/ |title=Video game user interface design: Diegesis theory| last=Russell| first=Dave| date=2011-02-02| website=Dev.Mag| access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status icons, menu bars and other UI which are not part of the game world itself can be considered as "extra-diegetic"; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information. A noted example of a diegetic interface in video games is that of the ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series, in which the player-character is equipped with an advanced survival suit that projects holographic images to the character within the game's rendering engine that also serve as the game's user-interface to the player to show weapon selection, inventory management, and special actions that can be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/31/4166250/dead-space-user-interface-gdc-2013| title = Deliberately diegetic: Dead Space's lead interface designer chronicles the UI's evolution at GDC| publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]| date = 13 March 2013| accessdate = 15 April 2015| first = Dave| last = Tach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game initially focuses on the twelfth war between the gods Chaos and Cosmos who have summoned several warriors from parallel worlds to fight for them. Upon ending the twelfth cycle, the game remakes the thirteenth war from the original ''Dissidia Final Fantasy'' and adds multiple sidestories. Fights in ''Dissidia 012'' were given the ability to counteract enemies' strongest attacks by using assisting characters, while navigation is now done through  a traditional-styled ''Final Fantasy'' world map.

Development of the game started in August 2009 with the Square staff wishing to improve the gameplay from the first game to provide players with more entertaining features as well as balance several parts. ''Dissidia 012'' has been well received, with publications calling it one of the best PlayStation Portable games.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is largely reminiscent of ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' along with a few changes. The game consists primarily of one-on-one battles, taking place on what is known as a battle map where the two characters duel. Players are able to perform two types of attacks: a Bravery attack and an HP attack. Both characters start with a set amount of Bravery points, the number of Bravery points being equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by an HP attack. Thus, the player must perform several Bravery attacks to steal Bravery points from the opponent so as to increase the power of their HP attack, as Bravery attacks do not cause any damage.

===Additional mechanics===
The mechanics of the battle system include "EX Revenge" and "Assist." EX Mode functions exactly the same as the first game by collecting EX Cores around the battle map to fill up the EX gauge and transform the character into a more powerful state, which allows players to perform a powerful EX Burst attack should an HP attack land during EX Mode. The Assist system is a new element to the game which allows the player to summon an additional ally into battle to either assist in attacking the enemy or defend from an oncoming attack. It is performed using the Assist Gauge, which is built up by using Bravery Attacks.&lt;ref name="Vaan"/&gt; Both modes are supposed to balance each other, because when an EX Burst is executed, the opponent's Assist Gauge is reduced to zero.

The three main countering systems are Assist Breaks, EX Breaks and EX Revenge. An Assist Break is performed by attacking the opponent's Assist character while the player is in EX Mode, causing him/her to be unable to call out the Assist character for a brief period; this also passes the stage's Bravery points to the character. An EX Break is performed by stopping an opponent's EX Mode through the use of an Assist attack which forces the opponent out of EX Mode, additionally passing the stage's Bravery points to the player. Lastly, EX Revenge occurs when trying to activate EX Mode while being attacked. While in the first game it would simply halt the opponent's attack, it now slows down time allowing the player to pummel the opponent instead, though it sacrifices the player's ability to use an EX Burst as it uses up the entire EX Gauge.&lt;ref name="Vaan"/&gt;

===Single-player mode===
[[File:Dissidia 012 Story Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot showing the [[single-player video game|single-player mode]] of the game. The game's world map, with new characters Lightning, Kain and Tifa as the three-member party.]]
The biggest addition is within the single-player story mode of the game, taking place on a traditional-styled ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' world map, with players being able to experience a story while exploring a world with scenarios and events taking place as the story progresses. Players traverse the 3D world map with parties consisting of up to five characters, with players being able to interact in conversations with the characters. When roaming the map, players will encounter enemies known as "Manikins"; when attacked by an enemy, players will be transported to a battle map where battles will take place. There are specially marked shops on the map. The story mode is also party based, similar to the story progression of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. In certain scenarios, parties will be predetermined, but in most cases players are free to select their own party.&lt;ref name="AndDec15"/&gt; Alongside the game's new story mode, the game also includes the first game's story, which has been remade with the 3D world map as well as additional elements added for the new storyline. [[Tetsuya Nomura]], producer and character designer for the game, has said that both storylines played together would result in approximately 60 hours of gameplay.&lt;ref name="AndDec20"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/12/20/flying_get/|title=This Week's Early Flying Get - Added 18:13|author=Anoop Gantayat |date=20 December 2010|work=|publisher=Andriasang|accessdate=20 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707142258/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/12/20/flying_get/|archivedate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
During the twelfth cycle, the war is turning in favor of Chaos. Therefore, Cosmos entrusts her warriors with the task of retrieving the crystals that will help them defeat Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Lightning:''' Cosmos, the goddess of harmony, imbued us with the power she said we would need in order to fight Chaos. What she gave us was something we had no way of using on our own--divine energy that would rest inside us, awaiting the proper catalyst. According to her, it was a strength that would be tempered through battle--by our own wills--and would eventually coalesce to form a crystal. As she told it, that crystal would then grant us, her soldiers, power to rival that of the gods themselves. So, simple as that. Fight the armies of Chaos, collect your crystal, and go take down the god of discord.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cosmos does not foresee Chaos's forces employing an unworldly army of crystalline soldiers known as Manikins, which pose a threat due to their ability to negate the gods' power to revive the warriors after they are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Garland:''' Manikins are merciless. They know only how to deliver death and destruction, from which there can be no return.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing their defeat to be inevitable, Kain and the [[Final Fantasy (video game)#Plot|Warrior of Light]] defeat most of their own allies to stop them from fighting the Manikins and return in the upcoming cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Kain:''' Manikins... Hm. I wonder. How do you place our odds? Against numbers like these, do you think we actually stand to win? / '''Warrior of Light:''' I cannot speak for the outcome, but we can fight as long as we have strength. / '''Kain:''' That's one answer. You are correct. We can fight for as long as we have strength, and almost certainly lose. But IF! IF there were a way to make winning possible, by accepting that loss as inevitable... / ... / '''Lightning:''' You're taking down your own allies and putting them to sleep so they'll get revived?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning opposes this plan and leads the other active warriors—Vaan, Yuna, Laguna, and Tifa—to stop the Manikins once and for all by sealing the portal from which they emerge, with Kain eventually joining them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Lightning:''' Say your 'next battle' were to start now.

It sure can't hurt, can it? And it might just give us a shot. / '''Laguna:''' Guess now's as good a time as any. Just happens I've got some intel that might change the whole game. You wanna even our odds? Try this on: I know where the manikins are coming from.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they succeed, Cosmos is reduced to a weakened state after using much of her power to diminish the Manikin army when they attempt to kill her and the Warrior of Light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix|date=22 March 2011|platform=[[PlayStation Portable]]|quote=&lt;!--'''Garland:''' The manikins march on Cosmos' throne. / '''Lightning''': What?!--&gt;'''Vaan''': What about Cosmos? / '''Kain''': It's too late. / '''Vaan''': "Too late"?! / '''Laguna''': Even if we did go back, we'd never make it in time. Only thing we can do is trust our last line of defence to hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lightning and her group succumb to the Manikins' power and fade away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Lightning''': I'm sure you all understand our...situation. We came here to destroy the portal that connects this world to the Rift. It's the last thing left for us to do. But once we charge into the middle of those manikins, there's no coming back.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the game retells the events of ''Dissidia Final Fantasy'' where returning warriors for Cosmos participate in the thirteenth cycle that ends the conflict between the gods. Once completing the thirteenth cycle, the player also has access to the third and final arc "Confessions of the Creator", in which Shinryu—a powerful entity that absorbs the warriors' memories and experiences following each cycle—traps Cosmos' comrade, Cid of the Lufaine, in a nightmare world where the cycles never end as punishment for saving Cosmos' warriors from the thirteenth cycle following Chaos' defeat. The player selects five characters to fight Feral Chaos, a stronger incarnation of Chaos, and save the imprisoned Cid the nightmare world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote='''Moogle (Cid of the Lufaine):''' The replica of Chaos you defeated was based on him at the time of sealing. I assume both Chaos and Shinryu have increased their powers since then. --I do apologize. I didn't mean to scare you. Beyond here awaits Chaos. --Let's go.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy |developer=Square Enix |publisher=Square Enix |date=March 22, 2011 |platform=PlayStation Portable |quote="Cid has awakened--in the world in which I was felled in the 13th conflict. And another thing happened-- Another miracle. The 'crystals' of the warriors who were defeated despite the strongest resolve have brought 'her' back to that world. And Shinryu departed for the Rift. I guess the conflict will never repeat again. Thank you so much...for saving my father..."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the main story is a set of "Reports", most of which follow the other warriors who participate in the thirteenth cycle, explaining their roles before and during that cycle. Prominent characters in these reports include warriors of Cosmos—[[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Terra Branford|Terra]], [[Cloud Strife|Cloud]] and [[Tidus]]—who fight for the side of Chaos during the twelfth cycle, and Chaos's warrior Jecht, who appears on the side of Cosmos, with the reports detailing how these characters came to switch sides. Furthermore, the Reports cover other events such as how the Warrior of Light enters the conflict and meets Cosmos's previous warriors Prishe and Shantotto, along with Gilgamesh's misadventures upon stumbling into World B.

==Development==
Ideas for a sequel to ''Dissidia Final Fantasy'' were already conceived shortly after its release in Japan with creative producer Tetsuya Nomura wishing to feature Kain Highwind on it.&lt;ref name="interultimania"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2009 | title=Dissidia Final Fantasy Ultimania| language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn= 978-4-7575-2488-0 | pages=696–699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the game started in August 2009 shortly before the release of ''Dissidia Final Fantasy Universal Tuning'', the international version from the prequel. Director Mitsunori Takahashi stated the team wanted the sequel to have more changes than just new characters. This resulted in changes to gameplay features and the inclusion of new ones. The Assist feature was made to add more entertainment to the fights,&lt;ref name="system"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://andriasang.com/compjg/dissidia_ff_interview/|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy Developer Interview|publisher=Andriasang|author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=September 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930012141/http://andriasang.com/compjg/dissidia_ff_interview/|archivedate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to act as a counterbalance to the EX Mode that was the strongest area from the first game.&lt;ref name="siliinter"/&gt; This was done in response to feedback commenting that the EX Mode was too powerful in the original game. The world map was created in order to appeal more the RPG fans.&lt;ref name="GSinter"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/dissidia-012-duodecim-final-fantasy/videos/dissidia-012-duodecim-final-fantasy-interview-with-mitsunori-takahashi-6297966/|title=Dissidia 012: Duodecim Final Fantasy Interview With Mitsunori Takahashi|publisher=GameSpot|author= |date=February 6, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220453/http://www.gamespot.com/dissidia-012-duodecim-final-fantasy/videos/dissidia-012-duodecim-final-fantasy-interview-with-mitsunori-takahashi-6297966/|archivedate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning characters had their movesets modified to provide the player with new strategies when fighting.&lt;ref name="siliinter"/&gt; One of the most revised ones was Firion due to feedback from players.&lt;ref name="1upinter"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/news/nomura-talks-dissidia-sequel|title=Nomura Talks Up Dissidia Sequel|publisher=1UP.com|author= |date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original ''Dissidia'' had a concrete conclusion, the staff decided to make its story a prequel and encourage players to revisit ''Dissidia'' once concluding it.&lt;ref name="siliinter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/18/dissidia-012duodecim-final-fantasy-director-discusses-fighting-game-mechanics/ |title=Dissidia 012[duodecim]: Final Fantasy Director Discusses Fighting Game Mechanics |publisher=Siliconera |author= |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717184840/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/18/dissidia-012duodecim-final-fantasy-director-discusses-fighting-game-mechanics/ |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing new characters proved difficult as the staff chose them based on their popularity and fighting styles.&lt;ref name="system"/&gt; The amount of new characters was restricted due to memory limitations.&lt;ref name="siliinter"/&gt; Vaan's inclusion met several hardships since his Japanese voice actor, [[Kouhei Takeda]], was busy at the time. They decided to replace Takeda with [[Kenshō Ono]] as a result of fan response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/11/15/vaan_voice_change/|title=Vaan Sees a Voice Change in Japanese Dissidia Final Fantasy|publisher=Andriasang|first=Anoop|last=Gantayat| date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=November 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118032639/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/11/15/vaan_voice_change|archivedate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battle system director Takeo Kujiraoka made contact with [[Hiroyuki Ito]] regarding the character's design and moves based on his ''Final Fantasy XII'' appearances, which was well received by Ito.&lt;ref name=dissidia_012_action_ultimania&gt;{{cite book|title=Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy Ultimanina -Action Side- |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/magazine/gamebooks/ff/dddff_action/index.html |author=Studio BentStuff |language=Japanese |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128015111/http://www.square-enix.co.jp/magazine/gamebooks/ff/dddff_action/index.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While designed by Tetsuya Nomura, various of the new alternative outfits the characters were given were based on artworks by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], another designer from the ''Final Fantasy'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yuna and Many Third Forms at the Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy Official Site |url=http://andriasang.com/comtid/yuna_and_third_forms_dissidia_site/ |date=January 21, 2001 |publisher=Andriasang |author=Gantayat, Anoop |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024161609/http://andriasang.com/comtid/yuna_and_third_forms_dissidia_site/ |archivedate=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pre-TGS Flying Get"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/01/21/yuna_and_third_forms_dissidia_site/|title=Yuna and Many Third Forms at the Dissidia Duodecim Final Fantasy Official Site |publisher=Andriasang|author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=January 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324211043/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/01/21/yuna_and_third_forms_dissidia_site/|archivedate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The music for ''Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy'' was composed by [[Takeharu Ishimoto]] and features multiple rearrangements from previous ''Final Fantasy'' themes by other composers. The American band [[Kidneythieves]] also sang the second part of the Feral Chaos' boss theme song, "God in Fire."

'''''DreadOut''''' is an [[Independent game|indie]] [[survival horror]] [[video game]] developed by [[Digital Happiness]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]]. A port for PlayStation 4 was announced but never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allthatsepic.com/epic-gaming/indie-horror-title-dreadout-breathes-life-into-the-genre/ |title=Indie Horror Title "DreadOut" Breathes Life Into the Genre |publisher=All That’s Epic |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thegamesdb.net/search/?string=dreadout&amp;function=Search&lt;/ref&gt; The story is about a group of high school students in Indonesia who come across an old abandoned town. There they are confronted with ghosts and paranormal activities, and one of the students, the protagonist Linda, begins to uncover the secrets of the town and its surrounding area. The game has been compared to the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series.

==Gameplay==
''DreadOut'' is a third-person horror game that uses mechanics similar to those found in the ''[[Fatal Frame]]'' series. The player uses modern gadgets, such as her smartphone and a digital camera, to interact with (or fend off) various kinds of [[Mythology of Indonesia|Indonesian mythical ghosts]], and to help her solve various puzzles. When Linda dies in the game, she awakens in [[Limbo]], depicted as darkness surrounded by candles with a bright light in the distance. By running towards the light, Linda will come back to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.beefjack.com/index.html%3Fp=170381.html |title=Another take on horror:DreadOut |publisher=BeefJack |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent deaths will push the light further and further away from Linda, unless she manages to find three mystical items to keep the light closer to her.

The game features both third and first-person control schemes, with the player navigating environments with a standard over-the-shoulder perspective. If the player decides to use their digital camera to photograph something, they enter a first-person perspective to see through Linda's equipped camera. Any ghosts that are photographed or interacted with in any way will be recorded in a "Ghostpedia" in Linda's notebook. Linda can also find articles and journal entries that describe much of the game's backstory. A recent preview video shows a tablet version of the game, where the player controls Linda via the touch screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lupoentertainment.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/dreadout-eye-on/ |title=Dreadout – Eye On |publisher=LupoEntertainment |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
When a group of senior high-school students go astray from their vacation trip in Indonesia, they discover an old deserted town. They soon realize that something sinister is about to happen. Linda Meilinda, realises something mystical is happening to her.

==Production==

[[Indonesia]]n developer Digital Happiness worked on the game using a team of around 20 people.&lt;ref name="Giantbomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/indonesia-may-be-developing-the-next-great-horror-game/1100-4906/|title=Indonesia May Be Developing the Next Great Horror Game|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After releasing a demo, they sought a [[crowd sourcing]] campaign via [[Indiegogo]]. The campaign asked for $25,000 USD in ending with $29,067 USD. They needed crowd sourcing since the game industry in Indonesia is small and focuses mostly on social or mobile games and were unable to find funding. Digital Happiness founder Rachmad Imron stated: “We have a lot of good human resources but most of them went abroad because there’s no game industry in Indonesia, but we hope this will change soon."&lt;ref name="Giantbomb"/&gt;

'''''Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of the [[altered states of consciousness]] found in [[shamanism]] and [[European witchcraft]] written by German anthropologist [[Hans Peter Duerr]]. First published in 1978 by Syndikat Autoren-und Verlagsgesellschaft under the German title of ''Traumzeit: Über die Grenze zwischen Wildnis und Zivilisation'', it was translated into English by the Hungarian-American anthropologist [[Felicitas Goodman]] and published by [[Wiley-Blackwell|Basil Blackwell]] in 1985.

''Dreamtime'' opens with the premise that many of those accused of witchcraft in early modern Christendom had been undergoing visionary journeys with the aid of a hallucinogenic salve which was suppressed by the Christian authorities. Duerr argues that this salve had been a part of the [[Shamanism in Europe|nocturnal visionary traditions]] associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], and he attempts to trace their origins back to the ancient world, before looking at goddesses associated with the wilderness and arguing that in various goddess-centred cultures, the cave represented a symbolic [[vagina]] and was used for birth rituals.

Later in the book, Duerr looks at ethnographic examples of shamanism, focusing on the [[Entheogen|shamanic use of hallucinogens]] and the experiences which such entheogens induce. He argues that "archaic cultures" recognize that a human can only truly understand themselves if they go to the mental boundary between "civilization" and "wilderness", and that it is this altered state of consciousness which both the shaman and the European witch reached in their visionary journeys. Believing that the modern western worldview failed to understand this process, Duerr criticizes the work of those anthropologists and scientists who had tried to understand "archaic" society through a western rationalist framework, instead advocating a return to "archaic" modes of thought.

''Dreamtime'' was a controversial best-seller upon its initial release in [[West Germany]], and inspired academic debate leading to the publication of ''Der Gläserne Zaun'' (1983), an anthology discussing Duerr's ideas, edited by Rolf Gehlen and Bernd Wolf. Reviews in the Anglophone world were mixed, with critics describing ''Dreamtime'' as unoriginal, factually inaccurate, and difficult to read, but also innovative and well referenced.

==Background==
According to his own account, the idea for writing ''Dreamtime'' first came to Duerr when he was in [[New Mexico]] in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the [[Puye Cliff Dwellings]] and was returning to the [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a [[Tewa people|Tewa Native]] ''yerbatero'' ([[herbalist]]) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the ''yerbatero'' if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the [[pueblo]]s north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances that took place in the subterranean [[kiva]]s. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the [[Los Angeles|Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels]] and study at the [[University of California]]. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing ''Dreamtime''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duerr presented some of his ideas in a lecture given to the members of a philosophy seminar at the [[University of Constance]] in the autumn of 1975, which he repeated at a housewives' club in [[Mannheim]].

The anthropologist Rik Pinxten noted that ''Dreamtime'' was published at a time of new advancements in German anthropology. After a period of intellectual stagnation during the preceding decades, the 1970s saw the rising popularity of the discipline, with a dramatic increase in the number of students enrolling to study [[ethnography]] at West German universities. It also saw increasing interdisciplinary collaboration between anthropologists and philosophers, with several scholars arguing that ethnography was relevant to "philosophical analysis". This increase in philosophical discussion within German anthropology was largely rejected by the "official academic representatives" of the discipline, who believed that it exceeded the "limits of scientific respectability", but it was nonetheless adopted by Duerr in ''Dreamtime''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pin92|Pinxten 1992]]. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the book was first published in West Germany in 1978, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies, becoming a bestseller and arousing both popular and academic interest.&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987 251"&gt;[[#Ste87|Stewart 1987]]. p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fayter 1990"/&gt; According to the American Indologist [[Wendy Doniger|Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty]], ''Dreamtime'' became "the canon of a cult for intellectual former [[hippies]]", dealing as it did with issues such as "drugs, sex, anarchy, [and] lurid religions".&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt; British anthropologist Charles Stewart noted that it was popular among members of the ''alternativer'' German subculture, and for this reason believed that the book could tell anthropologists "a considerable amount about the strivings of modern German society".&lt;ref name="Stewart 1987 251"/&gt;

The book was translated into English by [[Felicitas Goodman|Felicitas D. Goodman]] (1914–2005), a Hungarian-born American anthropologist who had written several books of her own on the subject of religious trance journeys. Duerr noted that of all the translators he had worked with, Goodman showed the greatest dedication to her work.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 ix"&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; For the English-language translation, Duerr included a new preface, in which he noted that he had refused to make changes to the original text despite the insistence of the publisher. Explaining his reasoning, he remarked that "a book is not a dishwasher, where it is advisable to change malfunctioning parts." He accepted that the book had faults, and expressed his hope that the reader would forgive him for leaving them intact in the English translation.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 viii"&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the English-language edition, the main text takes up the first 133 pages of the book, while the footnotes and bibliography occupy the next 324 pages.&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt;

Duerr examines the use of [[flying ointment]] in early modern witchcraft and draws ethnographic parallels from accused witches among the [[Shona people]] of [[Rhodesia]] and witchcraft beliefs of the [[Normanby Island (Papua New Guinea)|Normanby Archipelago]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]].  He concludes that some of those accused of witchcraft in early modern Europe had applied hallucinogenic ointments to their skin to make themselves believe that they were flying to the so-called [[witches' sabbat]], a ritual gathering of witches. Noting the apparent lack of recipes for this salve in the witch trial records, Duerr posits the view that the Christian authorities intentionally covered up the existence of hallucinogenic ointments, fearing that their existence would cast doubt on various aspects of the witches' accounts, including their alleged encounters with the Devil. Duerr maintains that this knowledge might have ultimately led people to cast doubt on even the Devil, a key aspect of early modern Christian cosmology.  Although the use of hallucinogenic ointments was not a factor in every witch trial, it was more prevalent in the earlier trials of the Alpine region.  Duerr connects its use to the nocturnal visionary traditions associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in that region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duerr then looks into the origins of the nocturnal visionary traditions, beginning with the ancient Greek deity [[Artemis]] and her influence on the Roman goddess Diana.  In Alpine lore, Diana survived Christianization as the leader of the nocturnal procession.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Duerr goes further back into the [[Palaeolithic]], where [[Venus figurines]] are interpreted as a "prototype" for the later Greek Artemis, a goddess who was "the unrestrained mistress of animals and plants".  Duerr then describes the relationship between ancient goddesses and caves as a symbol of the female [[vagina]] and explores stories involving caves in [[Greek mythology]], ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and [[Yakuts|Yakut]] folklore.  Duerr  proposes that the association between caves and the vagina is global in scope, as societies around the world use caves in rituals symbolizing birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|right|A woodcut depicting a [[witches' sabbat]], produced by Hans Baldung Grien in 1508. Duerr included it as the tenth plate in ''Dreamtime'', in the midst of a chapter discussing the European witch.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, such as the Alpine ''[[Perchtenlaufen]]'', where women broke social conventions by attacking men or engaging in [[lesbianism]]. Duerr compares these traditions to the ''[[benandanti]]'' of early modern [[Friuli]], and to the [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun|Livonian werewolf]], viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 32–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe the witch as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to the witch trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 40–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples in the historical European folk tradition where criminals have been declared to be outside of the law and banished from the community are illustrated. Duerr connects these outsiders to executioners and warriors who were also outside the law because they had entered the world of the dead.  Similarly, the witches of the early modern period also left the everyday world, and like the [[shamans]] of Siberia experienced their "wild" or "animal aspect" in order to understand their human side.  Duerr uses ethnographic examples from around the world to show that many cultures have used hallucinogenic substances to reach states of consciousness beyond ordinary societal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 60–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duerr provides additional ethnographic examples showing how societal rules were reversed at special times of the year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an "archaic mentality" understand who they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies fail to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 70–75.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Datura]]'', a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed.  The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period.  Among the [[Huichol people]] of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that ''Datura'' is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as [[Barbara Myerhoff]] and [[Carlos Castenada]], but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans mean when they describe their experiences as "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is this feeling that can be described as shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their "wolf nature" by crossing over the boundary from "civilisation" to "wilderness".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 76–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duerr then offers a philosophical discussion on the nature of reality, criticizing [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] like [[George Devereux]] for their beliefs that shamans were mentally ill. Instead he champions the idea that the visionary experiences of shamans should be treated as real rather than illusionary, drawing from the ideas of the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to support his argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 89–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author then examines the role of animals in shamanic visions, paying particular reference to the experiences of the Peruvian anthropologist Carlos Castaneda. Duerr argues that the conversations between the animal and the individual undertaking the vision are neither literal nor delusional, but that the only way to understand this is to situate oneself "on the fence", between the worlds of civilisation and wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duerr argues that modern Western society lacks important facets found in "archaic" societies who adhere to shamanic beliefs, and he asserts that the majority of Western anthropologists who have performed ethnographic fieldwork in these cultures have failed to truly understand them. To correct this, Duerr argues that anthropologists must understand that people in such societies take a "mythic perspective" to the world, often comparing objects and places in the material world to objects and places that exist "outside of time", in the eternal realm of mythology. He connects this with the [[Indigenous Australian]] concept of [[Dreamtime]], an otherworld outside of ordinary space and time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 114–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Duerr once again criticises the approach of Western society and its anthropologists to studying "archaic" spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these "archaic" cultures, people "have a much clearer idea about the fact that we can not ''be'' only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are ''not'', and that we can only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of "archaic" humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. pp. 125–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
Writing in ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'', Gail Hinich claimed that Duerr's ''Dreamtime'' had a "maverick whimsy and passion" that stemmed from its argument that Western society had unfairly forced the "otherworld" into "an autistic tyranny of the self". On a critical note, Hinich believed that despite Duerr's extensive bibliography, he had failed to understand the "critical context in which the intellectual history of the demonized outsider continues to be examined", ignoring the ideas put forward by Edward Dudley and Maximilian Novack in their edited volume ''The Wild Man Within'' (1972) or John Block
Friedman in his ''The Monstrous Races in Medieval Art and Thought'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin86|Hinich 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a review published in the journal ''Forest &amp; Conservation History'', Paul Fayter praised ''Dreamtime'', considering it to be a "groundbreaking ethnographic study" that invites the reader to consider what Western society has lost in its over-reliance on science and [[rationalism]]. Fayter also commented positively on Goodman's translation, noting that she had successfully conveyed Duerr's [[dry humour]] and self-deprecating wit.&lt;ref name="Fayter 1990"&gt;[[#Fay90|Fayter 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph J. Valadez of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] reviewed Duerr's ''Dreamtime'' for the journal ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]''. He felt that the book had brought him to the "edges of [his] own logics", but that this had not been the result of any intellectual argument posed by Duerr; indeed, he suggested that there were "crucial scholarly weaknesses" that made much of Duerr's argument suspect. He ultimately felt that because Duerr had refused to correct his factual mistakes for the English translation, the book had left the realms of scholarship and instead become an "obscure cultural artifact", one which was "represented by the myriad descriptions of cryptic symbols" that are discussed within its pages. Going on to comment on Duerr's main argument regarding the relationship between Wilderness and Civilization, Valadez also expressed his opinion that Duerr had made a "fundamental error" in assuming that Wilderness is not accessible to everyone "by virtue of genetic heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Val87|Valadez 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' journal, Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo proclaimed that it was easy "to get lost" in ''Dreamtime'', believing that the multitude of ethnographic and historical facts presented by Duerr often distracted from the book's main arguments. Although praising the book's contents, Stevens-Arroyo expressed his annoyance at Duerr's use of humour, believing that it was inappropriate in such a serious work of scholarship. He also remarked that Duerr "practices what he preaches", noting that the book was something of an ''apologia'' for his involvement in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counter-cultural and drug subcultures of the 1960s]] and his continuing advocacy of the use of mind-altering substances, in the same style as [[Timothy Leary]]. Considering the work to be an attack on social convention, he believes that Duerr has made use of mind-altering drugs to cross boundaries into altered states of consciousness and that ''Dreamtime'' is his invitation for others to join him. Stevens-Arroyo did praise Goodman's English translation, but argued that the index was too limited.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ste92|Stevens-Arroyo 1992]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a commentary piece for the ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'', Charles Stewart expressed his opinion that ''Dreamtime'' is best described as "the sort of book that Carlos Castaneda might have written if he were a German philosopher." He identifies a series of commonalities between Duerr's work and Castenada's, claiming that Duerr's description of his encounter with the Native American ''yerbatero'' in the book's preface is an "allusion" to Castenada's meeting with [[Don Juan Matus]], which he described in ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]'' (1968). Praising Duerr's use of source material, Stewart notes that many anthropologists would be critical of using ethnographic data to "construct a moral parable" for Western society, and he went on to question whether it was really necessary for Westerners to return to "archaic" modes of thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ste87|Stewart 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The American Indologist [[Wendy Doniger|Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty]] of the [[University of Chicago]] published a review of Duerr's ''Dreamtime'' in ''[[The New York Times]]''. She expressed her opinion that Duerr had put forward a "bold hypothesis" but that ''Dreamtime'' was a "paradigm of borderline academia", consisting of chapter titles written with "charm and wit" that hid "a mountainous scholarly apparatus&amp;nbsp;– 236 pages of 827 notes, with an 86-page bibliography of some 2,400&amp;nbsp;titles, to support 133&amp;nbsp;pages of text." She also identified multiple influences on Duerr's thinking, including historian and philosopher of science [[Paul Feyerabend]], the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, the historian of religions [[Mircea Eliade]], and the anthropologist Carlos Castenada.&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt;

Ultimately, Doniger O'Flaherty was critical of ''Dreamtime'', commenting that "Duerr is attempting to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare, and his book is likely to infuriate both ordinary readers and scholars." Although initially appearing suitable for the average reader, she felt that most would be put off by the "daunting scholarly apparatus" he had employed, and the "heaviness of the argument". Believing that the book was difficult to read, she felt that Duerr had hidden his arguments in the [[footnotes]], and that reading the first third of the book was akin to "wandering stoned through the stacks of a very fine European library, browsing in the sections devoted to witchcraft, hallucinogens and orgiastic cults. It is good fun, but it is not for all tastes."&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt; She equally felt that the book would be criticized by academics and other scholars working in the fields of witchcraft history and the [[history of religion]], who would recognize that the book not only contained multiple factual errors, but also that many of Duerr's arguments were unoriginal, having previously been made by Mircea Eliade and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="Doniger 1985"/&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Kenneth Atchity]] described Duerr's book as being "outstanding for its weirdness and provocation" despite the fact that its "anthropology is neither original nor precise." Atchity maintains that ''Dreamtime'' offers nothing new except "the energy of its serendipity", noting similarities with books such as [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890), [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948),  and the works of Carlos Castenada.  Although of the opinion that it contained "patches of brilliant illumination", Atchity ultimately considered ''Dreamtime'' to be an "obscure essay on the human experience."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atc85|Atchity 1985]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider influence===
In 1983, German academics Rolf Gehlen and Bernd Wolf published ''Der Gläserne Zaun: Aufsätze zu Hans Peter Duerrs "Traumzeit"'' ("The Glass Fence: Essays on Hans Peter Duerr's ''Dreamtime''"), an edited volume of papers discussing Duerr's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geh83|Gehlen and Wolf 1983]].&lt;/ref&gt; Duerr's theories were evaluated by Belgian anthropologist [[Rik Pinxten]] in an [[academic paper]] entitled "Dreamtime: Relativism and Irrationality in the Work of Hans Peter Duerr" (1992), published in the ''Cognitive Relativism and Social Science'' volume. Pinxten discussed the role of German anthropology within academia and its influence on philosophy and described  ''Dreamtime'' as "the most important publication" to emerge from the interaction between the two disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pin92|Pinxten 1992]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her study of feminist-orientated [[Wicca]] in New Zealand (2004), the anthropologist Kathryn Rountree remarked that along with historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s ''[[Ecstasies (book)|Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath]]'' (1989), ''Dreamtime'' offered "perhaps the most detailed investigation so far" of the [[witches' sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rou04|Rountree 2004]]. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Duerr's work was referenced by anthropologist Susan Greenwood in her study of the Wiccan and [[ceremonial magic]]al communities of London, ''[[Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre00|Greenwood 2000]]. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dutch historian [[Willem de Blécourt]], ''Dreamtime'' was responsible for first introducing the 1692 case of [[Thiess of Kaltenbrun]], the 'Livonian werewolf', to Anglophone scholarship. Prior to this, he noted, scholarly debate on the case had been restricted to German-speaking scholars.&lt;ref name="Blecourt 52b"&gt;[[#Blé07|De Blécourt 2007]]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Duerr had briefly discussed the case in the chapter "Wild Women and Werewolves", in which he compared it with various European folk traditions in which individuals broke social taboos and made mischief in public, arguing that they represented a battle between the forces of chaos and order.&lt;ref name="Duerr 1985 34"&gt;[[#Due85|Duerr 1985]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elymais''' or '''Elamais''' (Ἐλυμαΐς, [[Ancient Greek|Hellenic]] form of the more ancient name, '''Elam''') was a [[vassal state|semi-independent state]] of the 2nd century BC to the early 3rd century AD, frequently a vassal under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] control, and located at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]] in the present-day region of [[Khuzestan]], [[Iran]] ([[Susiana]]).&lt;ref name="Hansman"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hansman |first=John F | title= ELYMAIS | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2012-12-24|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/elymais}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that these people were great archers and natives of [[Susa]], which lay to the east of Elymais territory. Most of the Elymais were probably descendants of the ancient Elamites,&lt;ref name="Hansman"/&gt; who once had control of that area in the past. The provinces of Elymais were Massabatice (later Masabadhan), Corbiane and Gabiane.

Nothing is known of their language, even though [[Elamite]] was still used by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] 250 years before the Elymais came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cameron ''Persepolis Treasury Tablets'' (1948), and R. Hallock, ''Persepolis Fortification Tablets'' (1969). See also [[Persepolis Fortification Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Aramaic]] inscriptions are found in Elymais.&lt;ref&gt;Gzella, H. (2008) Aramaic in the Parthian Period: The Arsacid Inscriptions. In Gzella, H. &amp; Folmer, M.L. (Eds.) Aramaic in its Historical and Linguistic Setting. Wiesbaden. P. 107-130&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom of Elymais survived until its extinction by a [[Sassanid]] invasion in the early 3rd century AD.

It is reported in [[2 Maccabees]] that the priests of the temple of Nanea, which is located in [[Susa]], tricked [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and murdered him by throwing rocks on him and dismembering him (2Macc 1:10–17).

==Coinage==
[[File:650521.jpg|thumb|250px|Coin of [[Kamnaskires III]], king of the Elymais, and his wife [[Anzaze]]]]
The [[coins]] of Elymais depicted a king; it is not known whether this was a [[Parthia]]n king or a local ruler, as such information has not come to light. These coins were based on [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] standards of debased [[Drachm]]s and [[Tetradrachm]]s. The royal picture is generally based on Parthian coinage, usually with an anchor with a star in crescent figure. The reverse has a figure or bust of [[Artemis]] with text around it, an eagle, or often only elongated dots (this has led [[numismatists]] to believe that the [[engraver]]s didn't know Greek or copied from coins whose writing was already unintelligible).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parthia.com/parthia_coins_elymais.htm Coins of Elymais&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Euphonia.London.Journal.1870.png|The Euphonia (''The London Journal,'' 1870)|thumb]]
The '''euphonia''' was a talking [[machine]] created in the early to mid-nineteenth century by the Austrian inventor Joseph Faber and exhibited in 1845 in Philadelphia and in 1846 in London. An earlier version of the invention had been destroyed in 1844 by Faber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes and Notices|periodical=Mechanics Magazine|date=July 27, 1844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KY5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=faber+%22the+talking+machine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4jIbfiOnLAhVCXh4KHcxjCLEQ6AEISTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=faber%20%22the%20talking%20machine%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mechanical device that he had reportedly spent over twenty-five years developing, Faber's "Fabulous Talking Machine", which would later be renamed the "euphonia", was constructed of several different mechanisms and instruments: a [[piano]], a [[bellows]], and a mechanical replica of the human throat and [[speech organ|vocal organ]]s. By pressing the keys on the keyboard, a human operator produced sounds that inflated the bellows, caused the mechanical mouth to open, the mechanical tongue to be lifted, and the mechanical jaws to move. Able to produce sentences in English, French, and German, the euphonia was reported by ''The London Journal'' to speak all three with a German accent, a fact attributed to the native language (German) of the inventor. Exhibited with a female mask covering the mechanical mouth, tongue, and jaw and at times with a dress hanging below the mask, the euphonia would perform for audiences, pretending to respond to or mimic the words of the keyboard operator. In describing the euphonia, the 19th century American scientist [[Joseph Henry]] explained "that sixteen levers or keys 'like those of a piano' projected sixteen elementary sounds by which 'every word in all European languages can be distinctly produced.' A seventeenth key opened and closed the equivalent of the glottis, an aperture between the vocal cords. 'The plan of the machine is the same as that of the human organs of speech, the several parts being worked by strings and levers instead of tendons and muscles.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Millikan, Frank Rives|title=Joseph Henry and the Telephone|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/jhpp/JHP_Joseph_Henry_and_the_Telephone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glasses''', also known as '''eyeglasses''' or '''spectacles''', are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic [[lens (optics)|lenses]] mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's [[Human eye|eyes]], typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears.

Glasses are typically used for [[Corrective lens|vision correction]], such as with reading glasses and glasses used for [[nearsightedness]].

Safety glasses provide [[eye protection]] against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible [[light]] or [[radiation]]. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as [[squash (sport)|squash]].

Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking.

[[Sunglasses]] allow better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from high levels of [[ultraviolet light]]. Typical sunglasses are darkened for protection against bright light or glare; some specialized glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in bright light. Most sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be ordered.

Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example [[3D glasses]] for [[3D films]] ([[stereoscopy]]). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, wire, and other materials.

People are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 wearing corrective lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/06/22/good-question-why-do-so-many-of-us-need-glasses/|title=Good Question: Why Do So Many Of Us Need Glasses?|first=Liz|last=Collin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/vision-impact-institute-releases-study-on-corrective-lens-wearers-in-the-u|title=Newsroom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Glasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.

=== Corrective ===
{{Main|Corrective lens|Refractive error}}
[[File:Refraction through glasses 090306.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] [[skyline]] as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of [[refraction]]]]

Corrective lenses are used to correct [[refractive error]]s by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as [[myopia|nearsightedness (myopia)]], [[hypermetropia|farsightedness (hypermetropia)]] or [[astigmatism]]. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is [[presbyopia]], which is caused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a "stronger" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other.

Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] of an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]]. A [[lensmeter]] can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the [[life quality]] of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as [[headaches]] or squinting.

The most common type of corrective lens is "single vision", which has a uniform [[refractive index]]. For people with [[presbyopia]] and [[hyperopia]], [[bifocals|bifocal]] and [[trifocal]] glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and [[progressive lenses]] have a continuous gradient.

[[Reading glasses]] provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from [[drugstore]]s, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like [[astigmatism]] or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.

[[Adjustable-focus eyeglasses]] might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).

[[Pinhole glasses]] are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a [[diffraction]] limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small [[aperture]] in [[photography]].  This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a [[DIY]] fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.

=== Safety ===
{{See also|Eye protection}}
[[File:SafetyGlassesShield.jpg|thumb|[[Eye protection|Safety glasses]] with side shields]]

Safety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in different situations.  They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for [[welding]], which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized [[welding helmet]] is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. [[Nylon]] frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.

=== Sunglasses ===
{{Main|Sunglasses}}
[[File:Woman wearing sunglasses.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing [[sunglasses]]]]

Sunglasses provide improved comfort and protection against bright [[visible light|light]] and often against [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/brandpublishing/sfl-sunglasses-not-just-an-accessory-in-the-sunshine-state-20180312-story.html|title=Sunglasses not just an accessory in the Sunshine State|last=Solutions|first=Sun Sentinel Content|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Photochromic lens]]es, which are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]], darken when struck by UV light.  The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.

Light [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed.  [[Liquid-crystal display]]s often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include teashades and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrorshades]]. Many [[blindness|blind]] people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.

Sunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription.  Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses.  Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses.  Otherwise, many people opt to wear [[contact lens]]es to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.

=== Mixed doubleframe ===
[[File:Doubleframe uplifting eyewear - Nella.gif|thumb|left|Doubleframe eyewear with one set of lenses on the moving frame and another pair of lenses on fixed frame (optional).]]
The doubleframe uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by [[four-bar linkage]]. For example, sunlenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with [[myopia]] lenses that always stay on. [[Presbyopia]] lenses could be also combined and easily removed from field of view if needed without taking off glasses.

=== 3D glasses ===

The [[Stereoscopy|illusion of three dimensions]] on a two dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes.  The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.

[[Anaglyph 3D]] glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A [[polarized 3D system]] on the other hand uses [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An [[active shutter 3D system]] uses electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]]. [[Head-mounted display]]s can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewers eyes.

Anaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at [[3D film|3D movies]].  Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters.  Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.

=== Magnification (bioptics) ===
Glasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands.  An example would be ''[[Bioptics (device)|bioptics]]'' or  ''bioptic telescopes'' which have small [[telescope]]s mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble [[goggles]] or [[binoculars]], or may be attached to existing glasses.

=== Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses ===
Yellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing headaches due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-blocking-glasses-science-screens-not-destroying-vision-2017-2|title=Computer glasses that claim to protect your eyes from screens are selling like crazy, but they probably aren't doing you much good|last=Loria|first=Kevin|date=21 February 2017|website=Business Insider|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/irritated.htm|title=Computer Eye Strain: 10 Steps For Relief|last=Heiting|first=Gary|date=|website=All about vision.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blutechlenses.com/technology/|title=BluTech Lenses – Technology, The story behind BluTech Lenses|work=BluTech Lenses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/new-eyeglass-lenses-block-harmful-blue-light-and-uv-raysM|title=Expert Healthy Vision &amp; Eye Care Tips, News, Articles &amp; Information – Essilor USA|work=essilorusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=protect your vision|url=http://www.bluelightexposed.com/protect-our-vision/#how-can-you-protect-your-vision-against-the-harmful-effects-of-blue-light-exposure|website=Blue light exposed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-glare protection glasses ===
Anti-glare protection glasses, or anti-reflective glasses, can reduce the reflection of light that enters our eyes. The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By reducing the amount of glare on your eyes, vision can be improved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-glare Coating|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/anti-reflective.htm|website=All about Vision.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frames ==
[[File:Szemüveg - 1920-as évek.JPG|thumb|Glasses, {{circa|lk=no|1920s}}, with springy cable temples]]
The ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses which is designed to hold the lenses in proper position.
Ophthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors.&lt;ref name="Optical Course"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harisingh.com/OpticalCourse.htm | title=Optical Course | publisher=OpticalCourse.com | accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parts ===
* pair of eye wires or rims surrounding and holding the lenses in place
* bridge which connects the two eye wires
* chassis, the combination of the eye wires and the bridge
* top bar or brow bar, a bar just above the bridge providing structural support and/or style enhancement. The addition of a top bar makes a pair of glasses [[Ray-Ban Aviator|aviator eyeglasses]]
* pair of brows or caps, plastic or metal caps which fit over the top of the eye wires for style enhancement and to provide additional support for the lenses. The addition of brows makes a pair of glasses [[browline glasses]]
* pair of nose pads that allows a comfortable resting of the eye wires on the nose
* pair of pad arms connects the nose pads to the eye wires
* pair of temples (earpieces) on either side of the skull
* pair of temple tips at the ends of the temples
* pair of end pieces connects the eye wires via the hinges to the temples
* pair of frame-front end pieces
* pair of hinges connects the end pieces to the temples, allowing a swivel movement. Spring-loaded flex hinges are a variant that are equipped with a small spring that affords the temples a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90 degree angle. Repairs can be made by using Self Aligning Spring Hinge Screws. Use screw insertion pliers to push the tip beyond the first barrel of a spring hinge at a 45 degree angle and use a standard screwdriver to tighten. As the screw moves down the barrel, it will move to a 90 degree angle. When finished, use a plier to break off the excess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vigoroptical.com/sealsphi.html|title=Self Aligning Spring Hinge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temple types ===
* Skull temples: bend down behind the ears, follow the contour of the skull and rest evenly against the skull
* Library temples: generally straight and do not bend down behind the ears. Hold the glasses primarily through light pressure against the side of the skull
* Convertible temples: used either as library or skull temples depending on the bent
* Riding bow temples: curve around the ear and extend down to the level of the ear lobe. Used mostly on athletic, children's, and industrial safety frames;
* Comfort cable temples: similar to the riding bow, but made from a [[Elasticity (physics)|springy]] cable of coiled metal, sometimes inside a plastic or silicone sleeve. The tightness of the curl can be adjusted along its whole length, allowing the frame to fit the wearer's ear curve perfectly. Used for physically active wearers, children, and people with high prescriptions (heavy lenses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eyeglasseswarehouse.com/replacementcabletemples.html |title=Cable Temples |access-date=27 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127174407/http://www.eyeglasseswarehouse.com/replacementcabletemples.html |archive-date=27 January 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optiboard.com/forums/showthread.php/21175-Cable-conversion-temple-covers|title=Cable conversion temple covers|website=www.optiboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the image of 1920s frames above.

== Corrective lens shape ==
[[File:Brille eingeklappt fcm.jpg|thumb|Modern glasses with a rectangular lens shape]]

Corrective lenses can be produced in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank.  Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them.  Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes.  For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allows for many trendy and fashionable shapes.  Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used.  However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.

[[Bifocals|Bifocal]], [[Trifocal lenses|trifocal]], and [[progressive lens]]es generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting [[myopia|myopic]] prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.

=== Precursors ===
{{see|Reading stone}}
[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|thumb|Detail of a portrait of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Cardinal and renowned biblical scholar [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] painted by [[Tommaso da Modena]] in 1352]]
[[File:El Greco 048.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of cardinal [[Fernando Niño de Guevara]] by [[El Greco]] circa 1600 shows glasses with temples passing over and beyond the ears]]

Scattered evidence exists for use of vision aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History, Book 37, Chpt.16. Pliny the Elder. John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S. H.T. Riley, Esq., B.A. London. Taylor and Francis, Red Lion Court, Fleet Street. 1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a [[Lens (optics)|convex lens]] to form an enlarged/magnified image was most likely described in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Optics'' (which however only survives in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (10th century) and most notably by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] (''[[Book of Optics]]'', ca. 1021). [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of Ptolemy's ''Optics'' and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of "[[reading stone]]s".

[[Robert Grosseteste]]'s treatise ''De iride'' ("On the Rainbow"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to "read the smallest letters at incredible distances". A few years later in 1262, [[Roger Bacon]] is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=...Optics Highlights: II. Spectacles | publisher =University of Maryland, Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering |url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~taylor/optics2.htm |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the first eyeglasses took place in Northern Italy in the second half of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Kriss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kriss|first1 = Timothy C|last2 = Kriss|first2 = Vesna Martich|title = History of the Operating Microscope: From Magnifying Glass to Microneurosurgery|journal = Neurosurgery|volume = 42|issue = 4|pages = 899–907|date = April 1998|doi = 10.1097/00006123-199804000-00116|pmid = 9574655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed "[[sunglasses]]" for eye protection, without any corrective properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/sunglasses.htm |title= Sunglasses History – The Invention of Sunglasses |accessdate= 2007-06-28 |last=Ament |first=Phil |date= 4 December 2006 | work =The Great Idea Finder |publisher=Vaunt Design Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus,  flat panes of [[smoky quartz]], were used in 12th-century China.{{Refn | group="lower-alpha" | Chinese judges wore dark glasses to hide their facial expressions during court proceedings.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 121}}}} Similarly, the [[Inuit]] have used [[Inuit snow goggles|snow goggles]] for eye protection.

=== Invention ===
[[File:Conrad von Soest, 'Brillenapostel' (1403).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Glasses Apostle'' by [[Conrad von Soest]] (1403)]]
The first eyeglasses were made in Northern Italy, most likely in [[Pisa]], by about 1290:
In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar [[Jordan of Pisa|Giordano da Pisa]] (ca. 1255–1311) wrote "It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered.&amp;nbsp;... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}

Giordano's colleague Friar Alessandro della Spina of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa'' records: "Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart."{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 6}} By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses.{{Sfn | Ilardi | 2007 | p = 9}}

[[File:Medieval Spectacles.jpg|thumb|left|Seated apostle holding lenses in position for reading. Detail from ''[[Death of the Virgin]]'', by the [[Master of Heiligenkreuz]], ca. 1400–30 ([[Getty Center]]).]][[File:Scissors glasses.jpg|thumb|French Empire gilt [[Scissors-glasses|scissors glasses]] (with one lens missing), {{circa|lk=no|1805}}]]
The earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is [[Tommaso da Modena]]'s 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a [[scriptorium]]. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the [[Alps]] in an altarpiece of the church of [[Bad Wildungen]], [[Germany]], in 1403. These early glasses had [[convex lenses]] that could correct both [[hyperopia]] (farsightedness), and the [[presbyopia]] that commonly develops as a symptom of [[aging]]. It was not until 1604 that [[Johannes Kepler]] published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and [[myopia]].{{Refn | group="lower-alpha" | In his treatise ''Ad Vitellionem paralipomena'' [Emendations (or Supplement) to Witelo] (1604), Kepler explained how eyeglass lenses compensate for the distortions that are caused by presbyopia or myopia, so that the image is once again properly focused on the retina.{{Sfn|Ilardi|2007|p=244}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Vasco |last1=Ronchi |last2=Rosen |first2=Edward |title=Optics: The Science of Vision |place=Mineola, [[New York (state)|NY]] |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ht695-SFJYoC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses [[rivet]]ed together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as "rivet spectacles". The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at [[Kloster Wienhausen]], a [[convent]] near [[Celle]] in Germany; they have been dated to ''circa'' 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/college/museyeum/online_exhibitions/spectacles/rivet.cfm |title=Rivet spectacles |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website=www.college-optometrists.org |publisher=The College of Optometrists |access-date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]] is sometimes claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such statement appears in his accounts.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ9nayZZ2oEC&amp;pg=119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 119, footnote c]}}&lt;ref name="Hirschberg 1911 265"&gt;{{Citation | first = Julius | last = Hirschberg | chapter = Geschichte der Augenheilkunde |trans-chapter=History of Ophthamology | page = 265 | editor1-first = Alfred K | editor1-last = Graef | editor2-first = Theodor | editor2-last = Saemisch | title = Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde |trans-title=Handbook of all ophthalmology | place = Leipzig, [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Wilhelm Engelmann | year = 1911 | volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported.{{Sfn | Needham | 1962 | p = 119}}

It is also sometimes claimed that glasses were first invented in India. In 1907 Professor [[Berthold Laufer]] stated in his history of glasses that ''"the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe"''.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, Berthold (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=UgGgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Geschichte der Brille"] (History of eyeglasses), ''Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften'' (Communications on the History of Medicine and the Sciences), '''6''' (4) :  379-385.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science and Civilization in China Vol 4.1 | pages=118–119 | url=http://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1971 article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology it was argued that it: ''"...is therefore most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Susruta"'',&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R.

=== Later developments ===

[[File:Harry S. Truman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harry S. Truman]], 33rd [[President of the United States]], was known to have poor vision.]]

The American scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]], who suffered from both [[myopia]] and [[presbyopia]], invented [[bifocals]]. Serious historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between [[George Whatley]] and [[John Fenno]], editor of ''[[The Gazette of the United States]]'', suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044912/http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] astronomer [[George Airy]] in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucasianchair.org/19/airy.html|title=Sir George Biddell Airy|last=Bruen|first=Robert|work=The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University|publisher=Robert Bruen|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (''[[pince-nez]]''). [[Girolamo Savonarola]] suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a [[hat]]. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed some time before 1727, possibly by the British optician [[Edward Scarlett]]. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as "[[scissors-glasses]]" and [[lorgnette]]s were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.

In the early 20th century, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.zeiss.com/C12567A100537AB9/Contents-Frame/6B49EEA709EAE719C1256919003DAE2B |title=Eyeglass Lenses and Visual Aids from Industrial Production |publisher= Zeiss | accessdate =2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, [[Joshua Silver]] designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/adspecs-eyeglasses-could-provide-sight-for-a-billion.html|title=Adspecs Eyeglasses Could Provide Sight for a Billion|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increasing popularity of [[contact lenses]] and [[laser]] [[Refractive surgery|corrective eye surgery]], glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special [[memory metal]] alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as [[titanium]] alloys, which were not available in earlier times.

===In fashion===
In the 1930s, "spectacles" were described as "medical appliances."&lt;ref name="pullin"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pullin, Graham et al. | date = 2009 | chapter = Fashion Meets Discretion | title = Design Meets Disability | location = Cambridge | publisher = MIT Press | pages = 13–64 | isbn = 9780262162555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. 
In the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and governments also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt;

Graham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; In the past, design for disability has "been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all."&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for "patients", and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer.&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt; It is becoming more common for consumers purchase eyewear with clear, non-prescription lenses, illustrating that glasses are no longer a social stigma, but a fashionable accessory that "frames your face."&lt;ref name="pullin" /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Market===
The market for spectacles has been characterized as having highly [[inelastic demand]], and advertising restrictions in the USA have correlated with higher prices, suggesting that adverts make the spectacles market more [[Price competition|price-competitive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24100330 |doi=10.1086/466740|title=The Effects of Advertising on the Price of Eye Glasses|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=337–52|year=&lt;!--October or February, depending on source --&gt;1972|last1=Benham|first1=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be [[monopolistically competitive]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

There are claims that insufficiently free [[market competition]] inflates the prices of frames, which cost an average of $25-$50 US to make, to an average retail price of $300 in the United States.

Many people require glasses for the reasons listed above.  There are many shapes, colors, and materials that can be used when designing frames and lenses that can be utilized in various combinations.  Oftentimes, the selection of a frame is made based on how it will affect the appearance of the wearer.  Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory.

==== Personal image ====
For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen (as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses), elderly, or physically weak and passive.&lt;ref name=mount&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.seikoeyewear.com/CE/CECourse.cfm?ceID=6 | title = Eyewear | contribution = Understanding Three-Piece Mounting | publisher = Seiko | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028204353/http://www.seikoeyewear.com/CE/CECourse.cfm?ceID=6 | archivedate = 28 October 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = har&gt;{{Citation | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ZFCwrjE3p_IJ:www.haroldlloyd.us/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D28+harold+lloyd+glasses&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj_MCop6_2_lT0-IZxl98FMNlCqvG0K49hJEesJFSUHGeSYJ1JXJjadjDH3wCKD3odO6TDmtBQEeaKRbEONoEtEO56bfmnl8YuqswoBnveM9drSRQyxrwqAKSBZvwEetYF0bP6K&amp;sig=AHIEtbS_WjGJbmXTL_p3fxf9uf474ksuJA | last = Lloyd | first = Annette | title = The Fashion of Harold Lloyd | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma began to fall away in the early 1900s when the popular [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian [[Harold Lloyd]] began wearing a pair of [[horn-rimmed glasses]] as the "Glasses" character in his films.&lt;ref name = mount /&gt;&lt;ref name=har /&gt;

[[File:BarryGoldwater.jpg|thumb|left|Former United States senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[horn-rimmed glasses]]]]
Since, eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals' personal image. Musicians [[Buddy Holly]] and [[John Lennon]] became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called "Buddy Holly glasses" and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called "John Lennon (or [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]) Glasses." [[United Kingdom|British]] comedic actor [[Eric Sykes]] was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were in fact a sophisticated [[hearing aid]] that alleviated his [[deafness]] by allowing him to "hear" vibrations.&lt;ref name= eric&gt;{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4134965.stm | publisher = BBC | title = News | first = Eric | last = Sykes | contribution = Comedy Great | date = 31 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking alternate measures against vision problems: United States Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] and comedian [[Drew Carey]] continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for [[contacts]] and getting [[LASIK|laser eye surgery]], respectively.

Other celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as [[Anne Kirkbride]], who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as [[Deirdre Barlow]] in the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', and [[Masaharu Morimoto]], who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a [[chef]] from his stage persona as [[Iron Chef]] [[Japan]]ese. In 2012 some [[NBA]] players wear [[lensless glasses]] with thick plastic frames like [[horn-rimmed glasses]] during [[Post-game show|post-game interviews]], [[geek chic]] that draws comparisons to [[Steve Urkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V0330Drfkk |title=Whacky NBA Playoff Fashion! |publisher= Google | work = YouTube | accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nba"&gt;{{citation |last= Cacciola |first= Scott |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303822204577466402604980564?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_TheA-Hed |title=NBA Finals: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Other Fashion Plates of the NBA Make Specs of Themselves | edition = oline | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[superhero]] fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero personae: [[Superman]] is well known for wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as [[Clark Kent]], while [[Wonder Woman]] wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style [[bug-eye glasses]] as [[Diana Prince]]. An example of the [[halo effect]] is seen in the [[stereotype]] that those who wear glasses are intelligent.

A '''gratuity''' (also called a '''tip''') is a sum of money customarily given by a client or customer to a service worker in addition to the basic price. Tipping is commonly given to certain [[service sector]] workers for a service performed, as opposed to money offered for a product or as part of a purchase price. Depending on the country or location, it may or may not be customary to tip [[Waiting staff|server]]s in bars and restaurants, [[taxi driver]]s (including [[Peer-to-peer ridesharing|ridesharing]]), [[hair stylist]]s and so on.  The exchange is typically irreversible, differentiating it from the reward mechanism of a placed order, which can be refunded.&lt;ref name="Commerce Clearing House"&gt;{{cite book|title=Employees and Independent Contractors|date=1990|last=Morgan|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v6RAQAACAAJ|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tips and their amount are a matter of social [[convention (norm)|custom]] and [[etiquette]], and the custom varies between countries and settings. In some locations tipping is discouraged and considered insulting, while in some other locations tipping is expected from customers. The customary amount of a tip can be a specific range of monetary amounts or a certain percentage of the bill based on the perceived quality of the service given.

In some circumstances, such as with U.S. government workers&lt;ref name="5CFR2635"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title5-vol3/xml/CFR-2008-title5-vol3-sec2635-204.xml|title=[[Code of Federal Regulations]]|chapter=5. Administrative Personnel|date=January 1, 2008|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more widely with [[police officer]]s, receiving gratuities (or even offering them) is illegal; they may be regarded as [[bribery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/08/nigeria-sergeant-sacked-motorist-bribe-filmed|title=Nigerian sergeant sacked for attempted bribe-taking caught on cameraphone|place=[[Lagos]]|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=May 11, 2014|last=Mark|first=Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fixed percentage [[Mandatory tipping|service charge]] is sometimes added to bills in restaurants and similar establishments. Tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[USA Today]]|date=August 25, 2005|last=Bly|first=Laura|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-08-25-tipping_x.htm|title=The tipping point: Will service charges replace voluntary gratuities?|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical economic point of view, gratuities may solve the [[principal-agent theory|principal-agent problem]]&lt;ref name=videbeck /&gt; (the situation in which an agent, such as a server, is working for a principal, such as a restaurant owner or manager) and many managers believe that tips provide incentive for greater worker effort.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt; However, studies of the real world practice show that tipping is often discriminatory or arbitrary; workers receive different levels of gratuity based on factors such as age, sex, race, hair color and even breast size, and the size of the gratuity is found to be only very weakly related to the quality of service.&lt;ref name=freak/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/05/check-please-3|title=Check, Please|work=[[The New Yorker]]|last=Surowiecki|first=James|date=September 5, 2005|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Waiters.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The first usage of the term "tip" in the sense of giving a gratuity dates back to 1706 (pictured here are European waiters from the early 1900s)]]
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "tip" originated as a slang term and its etymology is unclear. According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the meaning "give a small present of money" began around 1600, and the meaning "give a gratuity to" is first attested in 1706.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tip&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun in this sense is from 1755. The term in the sense of "to give a gratuity" first appeared in the 18th century. It derived from an earlier sense of ''tip'', meaning "to give; to hand, pass", which originated in the [[rogues' cant]] in the 17th century. This sense may have derived from the 16th-century "tip" meaning "to strike or hit smartly but lightly" (which may have derived from the [[Low German]] ''tippen'', "to tap") but this derivation is "very uncertain".&lt;ref name="oed2"&gt;"tip, ''v''.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;" ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. 2nd ed. 1989. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-861186-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "tip" was first used as a verb in 1707 in [[George Farquhar]]'s play ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]''. Farquhar used the term after it had been "used in [[criminal]] circles as a word meant to imply the unnecessary and gratuitous gifting of something somewhat taboo, like a joke, or a [[sure bet]], or illicit money exchanges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/10/the-case-against-tipping/63913/|title=The Case Against Tipping|work=[[The Atlantic]]|last=Hendel|first=John|date=October 1, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of tipping began in [[Tudor England]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12tipping-t.html?hp&amp;_r=0|title=Why Tip?|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Wachter|first=Paul|date=October 9, 2008|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By the 17th century, it was expected that overnight guests to private homes would provide sums of money, known as vails, to the host’s servants. Soon afterwards, customers began tipping in London [[coffee house|coffeehouses]] and other commercial establishments".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The etymology for the synonym for tipping, "gratuity", dates back either to the 1520s, from "graciousness", from the French ''gratuité'' (14th century) or directly from Medieval Latin ''gratuitas'', "free gift", probably from earlier Latin ''gratuitus'', "free, freely given" . The meaning "money given for favor or services" is first attested in the 1530s.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt;

In some languages, the term translates to "drink money" or similar: for example ''pourboire'' in French, ''Trinkgeld'' in German, ''drikkepenge'' in Danish, and ''napiwek'' in Polish. This comes from a custom of inviting a servant to drink a glass in honour of the guest, and paying for it, in order for the guests to show generosity among each other. The term ''bibalia'' in Latin was recorded in 1372.&lt;!-- German WP--&gt;

==Tronc==
A tronc is an arrangement for the pooling and distribution to employees of tips, gratuities and/or service charges in the hotel and catering trade. The person who distributes monies from the tronc is known as the troncmaster. When a tronc exists in the UK, responsibility for deducting [[pay-as-you-earn tax]]es from the distribution may lie with the troncmaster rather than the employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk///manuals/echmanual/ECH13010.htm "Tronc Schemes"]{{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110204191501/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk///manuals/echmanual/ECH13010.htm|date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/430329/E24_2015_v1_0.pdf|title=Tips, Gratuities, Service Charges and Troncs|work=[[HM Revenue and Customs]]|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "tronc" has its origins in the French for collecting box. In June 2008, the Employment Appeals Tribunal ruled in a UK test case ([[Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Annabel’s (Berkeley Square) Ltd]]) that income from a tronc cannot be counted when assessing whether a wage or salary meets the national minimum wage.

===Africa===
====Nigeria====
In [[Nigeria]] tipping is not so common at upscale hotels and restaurants because service charge is usually included in the bill though the employees seldom get this as part of their wages. In recent times however, the service provider usually coerce the customer for tips in a subtle manner. There have been reported cases of security guards asking bank customers for tips.

===Asia===

====China====
In [[China]], traditionally there is no tipping.  However, hotels that routinely serve foreign tourists allow tipping. An example would be tour guides and associated drivers.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/A-few-tips-on-handling-gratuities-worldwide-2519762.php|title=A few tips on handling gratuities worldwide|work=sfgate.com|last=Loose|first=Cindy|date=April 27, 2006|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Hong Kong ====
In [[Hong Kong]], tipping is not typically expected at hotels or restaurant establishments, where a "service charge" of 10% is added to a bill instead of expecting a gratuity. Taxi drivers in Hong Kong may also charge the difference between a fare and a round sum as a "courtesy fee" to avoid making change for larger bills.

====Japan====
Tipping culture is not practiced in [[Japan]] and may cause confusion or insult if attempted without utilizing an envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303456104579489824193262260|title=How Japan Has Perfected Hospitality Culture|author=Strand, Oliver|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other countries in East Asia, Japanese people see tipping as insulting.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/607597/425829.html |title=What to tip when travelling |date=30 August 2005 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510091858/http://tvnz.co.nz/content/607597/425829.html |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it's mostly because the Japanese [[:ja:チップ (サービス)#日本での事情|traditionally accept tips in specialized envelopes]].

====India====
If eating a casual meal -breakfast or snack- with a bill total less than 300 INR, then a 10% tip is expected and appreciated. If small bills are handy, tip can be in multiples of 10 [[Indian rupee|INR]] notes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripzuki.com/blog/how-to-tip-in-india/ How to tip in India - Abbas Slatewala | July 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia tipping is common in large tourist areas, such as [[Bali]] or [[Lombok]]. 10% gratuity is expected at full-service restaurants. Bar tipping is discretional and depends on the style of a bar: in Bali, most bars are owned by expatriates and, normally, expat's country of origin reflects the style of a bar. Pubs do not expect tips. Restaurants – 10% to 15%. High end bars accepts over-the-counter cash tips in any amount. Massage parlous, which are located practically on every corner in Bali, expect 10%–20%. Taxi drivers expect 5%. Bellboys at high end hotels expect around $1 per bag.

====Malaysia====
In [[Malaysia]] tipping is not the norm and is not expected in any service. Instead restaurants can add a service charge of 10% to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meetthecities.com/guide/kuala-lumpur/kuala-lumpur-city-practical-information/ "Practical information about Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"], ''Meet The Cities''&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia the people are familiar with tipping, so if a person does leave a tip then it is accepted and appreciated. When tipping occurs it is usually done by rounding up the bill.

====South Korea====
Tipping is not customary in [[Korea]]n culture, and tipping is not expected in general service industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g294196-s606/South-Korea:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html|work=[[TripAdvisor]]|title=South Korea: Tipping &amp; Etiquette|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people even regard tipping as an inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidetokorea.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/tipping-etiquette-in-korea/|work=guidetokorea.wordpress.com|title=Tipping etiquette in Korea|author=Stafford, Paul|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-end hotels and restaurants often include service charge between 10% to 15%, but it is always included in the bill and customers are not expected to leave separate gratuity for servers beyond what is included in the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/where-tipping-is-actually-considered-rude/story-e6frfqfr-1226701085391|title=Where tipping is actually considered rude|work=news.com.au|author=Schneider, Kate|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
In [[Singapore]], tipping is not practiced and is rarely expected in most instances. However, bars and restaurants typically add a 10% service charge, which is compounded by the 7% [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|Goods &amp; Services Tax]], although it is not given to the wait staff. Taxi drivers given a tip will mistake it for excess cash and return exact change.

====Taiwan====
In [[Taiwan]], tipping is not customary, but all mid and high end restaurants include a mandatory "10% service charge", which is not given to the service staff, but rather considered by Taiwanese law as general revenue, as reported by the Taipei Times in "False Gratuity" on July 9, 2013.

Tipping (''bakshish'') in [[Albania]] is very much expected almost everywhere. In recent times it has become more common, as many foreigners and Albanians living abroad visit Albania. Leaving a tip of around 10% of the bill is customary in restaurants; even porters, guides and chauffeurs expect tips. Duty-free alcohol is often used as a type of tip for porters, bellhops and the like, however some people (such as Muslims) can find it offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travelspedia.com/East-Europe/Albania/2344.html|title=Some Interesting Facts About Albania|accessdate=2017-07-21|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120224058/http://travelspedia.com/East-Europe/Albania/2344.html|archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
Tipping is not required but often expected, particularly in restaurants where roughly 5 to 10% is common. This belongs to the service one got and the restaurant level (low, medium, high prices). In standard restaurants it is OK to round up to the next Euro. By tipping roughly 5% one can't be wrong in bars or restaurants. Taxi bills might be just rounded up to the next Euro. Another common setting where tipping is customary is taxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smartertravel.com/2018/01/22/tipping-in-austria-the-austria-tipping-guide/ |title=Tipping in Austria: The Austria Tipping Guide |date=January 22, 2018 |accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatia====
Even though most people in the service industry are paid a living wage, tips (in Croatian: napojnica, manča) are quite common. 10% (or more, depending on the service) is expected in restaurants. Absence of a tip is generally interpreted as not being satisfied with the food and/or service. In clubs and café bars, it is common to round-up the bill (i.e. 10 if the bill is more than 5 kn, or 100 if the bill is 88 kn). Tips are always expected in cash, even when the bill is paid by a credit card, If you leave a tip with a credit card, please note that the employee does not receive any of it. It is not common to tip hairdressers, but the rounding-up method is common for taxi drivers.

====Denmark====
Tips (''drikkepenge'', lit. "drinking money") are not required in [[Denmark]] since service charges must always be included in the bill by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.d-r-c.dk/artikel.php?p_id=217|title=Drikkepenge eller ej?|work=d-r-c.dk|last=Kønigshøfer|first=Jørgen|accessdate=July 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095305/http://www.d-r-c.dk/artikel.php?p_id=217|archive-date=September 21, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipping for outstanding service is a matter of choice, but is not expected.&lt;ref name="geographica_DK"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.geographia.com/denmark/whattodo.html#restaurants|title=What To Do in Denmark: Restaurants|work=geographia.com|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In [[Finland]] tipping is not customary and never expected.

====France====
Tipping in France is not required, and what you see on the menu is what you get charged. Waiters are paid a living wage and do not depend on tips. Cafés and restaurants include a 15% service charge on the bill, as required by French law for tax assessment. ''Service compris'' indicates that the tip has been added to the bill, but sometimes the wait staff do not receive any of it (it is split between the wait staff and sometimes the restaurant owner can keep a portion of it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/restaurant-tipping-in-france-and-paris-1517962|title=Restaurant Tipping in France and Paris|work=tripsavvy.com|last=Chavanne|first=Phil|date=May 8, 2017|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipping is better received in venues accustomed to tourists, but can be treated with disdain in smaller food establishments and those in more rural areas. The amount of the tip is also critical. A 5% tip will do nicely for good service. For superior service in higher-end eating establishments, a more generous tip would not be out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g187070-s606/France:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html|title=France: Tipping &amp; Etiquette|work=[[TripAdvisor]]|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rare waiter/waitress accustomed to more generous foreign customers has no problem receiving a tip of up to 10% or more. A tip in cash rather than on a credit card may be preferred. Attending a performance in a private theater may be the only case in France where a tip is expected (generally €1), even though it is illegal.

==== Germany ====
[[File:23c3 by taw cloakroom 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Coat check staff are usually tipped for their service and this photo shows a coat-check area at the Berliner Congress Centrum (BCC) in Alexanderplatz, Berlin, Germany]]
Tipping (''Trinkgeld'') is not seen as obligatory. In the case of waiting staff, and in the context of a debate about a minimum wage, some people disapprove of tipping and say that it should not substitute for employers paying a good basic wage. But most people in Germany consider tipping to be good manners as well as a way to express gratitude for good service.

It is illegal, and rare, to charge a service fee without the customer's consent. But a tip of about 5% to 10%, depending on the type of service, is customary. For example, Germans usually tip their waiters but almost never the cashiers at big supermarkets. As a rule of thumb, the more personal the service, the more common it is to tip. Payments by card can include the tip too, but the tip is usually paid in cash when the card is handed over.

At times, rather than tipping individually, a tipping box is set up. Rounding up the bill in Germany is commonplace, sometimes with the comment ''stimmt so'' ("keep the change"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/restaurant-tipping-germany-59081.html|title=Restaurant Tipping in Germany|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Hill|first=Danielle|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than asking for all the change and leaving the tip afterwards. Or the customer says how much he will pay in total, including the tip: thus if the basic price is €10.50, the customer might, rather generously but not unusually, say ''zwölf'' ("twelve"), pay with a €20 note and get €8 in change. When paying a small amount, it is common to round up to the nearest euro (e.g. €1.80 to €2.00).

Sometimes a sign reading ''Aufrunden bitte''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschland-rundet-auf.de/|title=DEUTSCHLAND RUNDET AUF|website=Deutschland rundet auf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("round up please") is found in places where tipping is not common (like supermarkets, or clothing retailers). This requests that the bill be rounded up to the nearest €0.10. This is not to tip the staff, but a charity donation (fighting child poverty), and completely voluntary.

In Germany tips are considered as income, but they are tax free according to § 3 Nr. 51 of the German Income Tax Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/estg/__3.html|title=§ 3 EStG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====
The Hungarian word for tip is {{lang|hu|borravaló}} (literally "money for wine", a loose [[calque]] from {{lang-de|Trinkgeld}}) or colloquially {{lang|hu|baksis}} (from {{lang-fa|بخشش}} ''bakhshesh''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=+baksheesh&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), often written in English as [[backsheesh]]. Tipping is widespread in Hungary; the degree of expectation and the expected amount varies with price, type and quality of service, and also influenced by the satisfaction of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g274881-s606/Hungary:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html|work=[[TripAdvisor.com]]|date=|accessdate=11 May 2014|title=Hungary: Tipping &amp; Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in Germany, rounding up the price to provide a tip is commonplace.

Depending on the situation, tipping might be unusual, optional or expected. Almost all bills include a service charge; similarly, some employers calculate wages on the basis that the employee would also receive tips, while others prohibit accepting them. In some cases a tip is only given if the customer is satisfied; in others it is customary to give a certain percentage regardless of the quality of the service; and there are situations when it is hard to tell the difference from a [[bribe]]. Widespread tipping based on loosely defined customs and an almost imperceptible transition into bribery is considered a main factor contributing to corruption. A particular example of a gratuity is {{lang|hu|hálapénz}} ("gratitude money") or {{lang|hu|paraszolvencia}}, which is the very much expected – almost obligatory even though illegal – tipping of state-employed physicians. ([[Healthcare in Hungary|Hungary's healthcare system]] is almost completely state-run and there is an obligatory social insurance system.)

====Iceland====
In [[Iceland]] tipping (''[[wikt:þjórfé|þjórfé]]'', lit. "serving money") is not customary and never expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whygoiceland.com/tipping-in-iceland.html |title=Tipping in Iceland |publisher=Whygoiceland.com |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign tourists sometimes still tip without thinking because that is the custom in their home country. Tourist guides in Iceland also sometimes encourage their guests to tip them, but there is no requirement to do so.

====Ireland====
It is uncommon for Irish people to tip taxi-drivers or cleaning staff at hotel. Tips are often given to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change (5%–10%) at the table or rounding up the bill.

Although it has been cited that tipping taxi drivers is typical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XuC00pXJQtAC&amp;pg=PA389 |title=Rick Steves' Ireland 2008 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not common in practice.

====Italy====
Tips (''la mancia'') are not customary in Italy, and are given only for a special service or as thanks for high quality service, but they are very uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://tours-italy.com/discover-your-italy/italy-travel-guides/tipping|title=Tipping in Italy|work=tours-italy.com|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all restaurants (with the notable exception of those in Rome)&lt;ref&gt;[http://notes.regione.lazio.it/Produzione/Normativa/Leggi.nsf/RicercaWeb/D8C1233F4E80A4B9C125723600489492 Regional Law 21 (November 29, 2006), article 16 paragraph 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101203431/http://notes.regione.lazio.it/Produzione/Normativa/Leggi.nsf/RicercaWeb/D8C1233F4E80A4B9C125723600489492 |date=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have a service charge (called ''coperto'' and/or ''servizio''). As restaurants are required to inform you of any fees they charge, they usually list the ''coperto''/''servizio'' on the menu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meetthecities.com/guide/milan/milan-city-practical-information/ "Practical information for visitors to Milan"], ''Meet The Cities''. Retrieved on 21 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
Tipping (''fooi'') in the Netherlands is not obligatory; and it is illegal, and rare, to charge a service fee without the customer's consent. However tourists are made to believe{{clarifyme|date=May 2017}} that tipping is required in restaurants, bars, taxis and hotels (bar, restaurant, maids and bellboys). If service was normal or poor, it is normal not to tip, while guests who receive good to excellent service can tip in a 5%–15% range, with an average of 10%, and 20% if service was exceptionally good. Around 1970, regulations were adopted that all indicated prices must include a service charge. As a result, all prices were raised by about 15%. This was called "service compris". Also wages were adjusted so that employees were not dependent on tips.

====Norway====
The service charge is included in the bill. It is uncommon for Norwegians to tip taxi drivers or cleaning staff at hotels. In restaurants and bars it is more common, but not expected. Tips are often given to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change (5%–15%) at the table or rounding up the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reisetips.nettavisen.no/den-store-guiden-til-tipsing/|title=Den store guiden til tipsing|work=reisetips.nettavisen.no|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oslo Servitørforbund'' and ''Hotell- og Restaurantarbeiderforbundet'' (The Labor Union for Hotel and Restaurant Employees) has said many times that they discourage tipping, except for extraordinary service, because it makes salaries decrease over time, makes it harder to negotiate salaries and does not count towards pensions, unemployment insurance, loans and other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/na24/3613016.html|title=Nei, du skal ikke gi tips på restaurant|work=nettavisen.no|last=Blaker|first=Magnus|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dinside.no/okonomi/ikke-tips/61968289|title=Ikke tips!|work=dinside.no|last=Madsen|first=Jon Erland|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ba.no/nyheter/a-gi-tips-er-en-uting/s/1-41-6756745|title=Å gi tips er en uting|work=ba.no|last=Slettevold|first= Andreas|date=July 14, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/--Driks-gar-utover-yrkesstoltheten-167532b.html|title=Driks går utover yrkesstoltheten|work=aftenposten.no|last=Braathen|first=Frøydis |date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
The amount of the tip (''bacşiş'') and method of calculating it will vary with the venue and can vary from 1–2 RON to 10% of the bill. The tips do not appear on bills and are not taxed. If paying by card, the tip is left in cash alongside the bill. While tipping is not the norm, servers, taxi drivers, hairdressers, hotel maids, parking valets, tour guides, spa therapists et al. are used to receiving tips regularly, and are likely to consider it an expression of appreciation for the quality of the service (or lack of it). If offering a tip, 5%–10% of the bill is customary, or small amounts of 5, 10 or 20 RON for services which are not directly billed. For other types of services it depends on circumstances; it will not usually be refused, but will be considered a sign of appreciation. For instance, counter clerks in drugstores or supermarkets are not tipped, but their counterparts in clothing stores can be.

Tipping can be used proactively to obtain favors, such as reservations or better seats. However, care should be taken for it not to be seen as a bribe, depending on circumstances. While tipping is overlooked in Romania, bribery is a larger issue which may have legal consequences. There is an ongoing aversion about both giving and receiving tips in coins, due to the low value of the denominations. It is best to stick to paper money. Offering coins can be considered a rude gesture and may prompt sarcastic or even angry remarks.

On the other hand, the coin handling aversion has resulted in the widespread practice of rounding payments. This is not technically a tip, and as such is not aimed primarily at the individual at the counter, but rather at the business.{{fact|date=May 2017}} Nevertheless, if done with a smile it can be seen as a form of appreciation from the customer towards the clerk. Etiquette demands that one of the parties offers the change, but the other can choose to tell them to keep all or part of it. Small businesses may sometimes force the issue by just claiming they are out of change, or offering small value products instead, such as sticks of gum; this is considered rude and it is up to the customer to accept or call them out{{clarifyme|date=May 2017}} for it. The reverse can also happen, where the clerk does not have small change to make for the customer's paper money, but chooses to return a smaller paper denomination and round down in favor of the customer, in exchange for getting them through faster. The latter usually happens only in the larger store chains.

====Russia====
In Russian language a gratuity is called ''chayeviye'', which literally means "for the tea". Tipping small amounts of money in Russia for people such as waiters, cab drivers and hotel bellboys was quite common before the Communist Revolution of 1917. During the Soviet era, and especially with the Stalinist reforms of the 1930s, tipping was discouraged and was considered an offensive capitalist tradition aimed at belittling and lowering the status of the working class. So from then until the early 1990s tipping was seen as rude and offensive. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the dismantling of the Iron Curtain in 1991, and the subsequent influx of foreign tourists and businessmen into the country, tipping started a slow but steady comeback. Since the early 2000s tipping has become somewhat of a norm again. However, still a lot of confusion persists around tipping: Russians do not have a widespread consensus on how much to tip, for what services, where and how. In larger urban areas, like Moscow and St Petersburg, tips of 10% are expected in high-end restaurants, coffee shops, bars and hotels, and are normally left in cash on the table, after the bill is paid by credit card; or as part of cash payment if a credit card is not used. Tipping at a buffet or any other budget restaurant, where there are no servers to take your order at the table (called ''stolovaya'') is not expected and not appropriate. Fast food chains, such as McDonald's, Chaynaya Lozhka, Kartozhka and so on, do not allow tipping either. Tipping bartenders in a pub is not common, but it is expected in an up-market bar. Metered taxi drivers also count on a tip of 5%–10%, but non-metered drivers who pre-negotiate the fare do not expect one. It should also be noted that the older Russians, who grew up and lived most of their lives during the Soviet era, still consider tipping an offensive practice and detest it. In smaller rural towns, tipping is rarely expected and may even cause confusion.

====Slovenia====
Tipping is not common in Slovenia, and most locals do not tip other than to round up to the nearest euro. Since about 2007, areas visited by many tourists have begun to accept tips of around 10%–20%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g274862-s606/Slovenia:Tipping.And.Etiquette.html Inside Slovenia: Tipping &amp; Etiquette]."

''Concierge.com''. Retrieved 2007-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
Tipping (''propina'') is not generally considered mandatory in Spain, and depends on the quality of the service received. In restaurants the amount of the tip, if any, depends mainly on the kind of locale: higher percentages are expected in upscale restaurants. In bars and small restaurants, Spaniards sometimes leave as a tip the small change left on their plate after paying a bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=elEconomista.es | title=Devuélvame el cambio por favor | website=elEconomista.es | date=January 13, 2009 | url=https://www.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/966136/01/09/devuelvame-el-cambio-por-favorLas-propinas-empiezan-a-desaparecer-de-los-establecimientos-al-mismo-ritmo-que-cae-el-consumo-.html | language=es | access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/460025/0/crisis/propina/madrid/ 20 Minutos]&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel, may expect a tip in an upscale setting. In 2007 the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, blamed excessive tipping for the increase in the inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.elmundo.es/mundodinero/2007/12/15/economia/1197713809.html Solbes achaca la inflación a que no interiorizamos lo que significa un euro]" El Mundo, 15 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
Tipping (''dricks'') is commonly not expected, but is practiced to reward high quality service or as a kind gesture. Tipping is most often done by leaving small change on the table or rounding up the bill. This is mostly done at restaurants (less often if payment is made at the desk) and in taxis (some taxis are very expensive as there is no fixed tariff, so they might not be tipped). Less often hairdressers are tipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/swede1/qt/tippingsweden.htm|title=Tipping Customs in Sweden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tips are taxed in Sweden, but cash tips are not often declared to the tax authority. Cards are heavily used in Sweden as of the 2010s, and tips paid by cards in restaurants are regularly checked by the tax authority.

====Turkey====
In [[Turkey]], tipping, or ''bahşiş'' (lit. gift, from the [[Persian Language|Persian]] word بخشش, often rendered in English as "baksheesh") is usually optional and not customary in many places. Though not necessary, a tip of 5%–10% is appreciated in restaurants, and is usually paid by "leaving the change". Cab drivers usually do not expect to be tipped, though passengers may round up the fare. A tip of small change may be given to a hotel porter.&lt;ref name="turkeytravelplanner1"&gt;"[http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/details/Money/Tipping.html Tipping in Turkey]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
[[File:ChrisRiley and caddy.jpg|thumb|200px|Golfers often tip the caddies who carry their golf clubs]]
Tipping is not expected in Britain the way it is in some other countries, however for the majority of people tipping is customary as a sign of appreciation.  Workers don't officially have to rely on their tips to live and all staff in the UK must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage of £7.83. 

Employers are also banned from topping up wages with tips from customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visitbritain.com/gb/en/plan-your-trip/money/tipping#rDKuGbxeTWLSbVCK.97 | title=Tipping
| website=[[VisitBritain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However rounding up a bill is acceptable (but not required) at restaurants where you are served at the table, and also for barbers, hairdressers and taxi drivers.

Sometimes, more often in London than in other areas, or at expensive restaurants, a service charge may be included in the bill, or added separately. 12.5% is reported as a common amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bernard|last=Davis|first2=Andrew |last2=Lockwood|first3=Peter |last3=Alcott|first4=Ioannis |last4=Pantelidis|title=Food and beverage management|publisher=Routledge|location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=0415506905|page=31|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tipping in Europe|url=http://www.autoeurope.com/go/travel-tips/tipping-in-europe/|publisher=Auto Europe|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a legal requirement to include all taxes and other obligatory charges in the prices displayed, a service charge is compulsory only if it is displayed, or the trader makes it clear verbally, before the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/consumer_w/travel_leisure_and_food_e/consumer_food_and_restaurants_e/restaurant_service_is_poor.htm |title=Restaurant service is poor |accessdate=23 Feb 2015 |date=8 May 2014 |work=[[Citizens Advice]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223175142/http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/consumer_w/travel_leisure_and_food_e/consumer_food_and_restaurants_e/restaurant_service_is_poor.htm |archivedate=23 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, if the level of service is unacceptable, and in particular it falls short of the requirements of the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]], the customer can refuse to pay some or all of a service charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/problem/do-i-have-to-pay-a-service-charge-if-the-service-is-poor-/?a=how-to-complain-if-a-restaurant-fails-to-keep-your-booking|title=Do I have to pay a service charge if the service is poor?|accessdate=23 Feb 2015|publisher=[[Which?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
Tipping is practiced in Canada in a similar manner to the United States. Quebec provides alternate minimum wage schedule for all tipped employees. Some other provinces allow alternate minimum wage schedule for "liquor servers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srv116.services.gc.ca/dimt-wid/sm-mw/rpt3.aspx?lang=eng|title=Current And Forthcoming Minimum Hourly Wage Rates For Young Workers And Specific Occupations}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wendy Leung from ''The Globe and Mail'', it is a common practice in restaurants to have servers share their tips with other restaurant employees, a process called "tipping out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Leung, Wency | title=Should restaurants be barred from taking a share of a server’s tip? | website=The Globe and Mail | date=April 30, 2018 | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/should-restaurants-be-barred-from-taking-a-share-of-a-servers-tip/article4253753/ | access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another newspaper refers to this as a tip pool.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/04/16/government_has_no_ordinance_in_tussle_for_servers_tips.html | location=Toronto | work=[[Toronto Star]] | title=Government has no ordinance in tussle for servers' tips |author=Corey Mintz |date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tipping out the house (the restaurant) is occasionally explained as a fee for covering breakage or monetary error[s]."&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;

A Member of the Ontario Provincial Parliament, Michael Prue, has introduced a Bill in the Ontario Legislature regarding tipping.&lt;ref&gt;Restaurant Tipping: Ontario NDP Wants Ban On Restaurants Skimming Tips. By Keith Leslie, The Canadian Press Posted: 06/11/2012 http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/06/11/restaurant-tips-ndp-ontario-labour-law_n_1587182.html Accessed on June 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 2015 it was reported that "Ontario is banning employers from taking a cut of tips that are meant for servers and other hospitality staff." "The ''Protecting Employees' Tips Act'' makes it illegal for employers "...to withhold their employees' tips, except temporarily if they are pooling all of the gratuities to redistribute them among all employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ontario-employers-servers-tips-1.3354563|title=Ontario moves to protect servers' tips - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Federal tax law considers tips as income. Workers who receive tips are legally required to report the income to the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] and pay [[income tax]] on it. In July 2012, The Star reported that CRA is concerned with tax evasion. An auditing of 145 servers in four restaurants by CRA mentioned in the report uncovered that among 145 staff audited, CDN $1.7million was unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1223335--wait-staff-hiding-tips-from-the-taxman-auditors-find |title=Wait staff hiding tips from the taxman, auditors find &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2012-07-08 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, The CRA was quoted that it will closely check the tax returns of individuals who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips to ensure that the tips are reported realistically.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, D.L.

====Caribbean====
Tipping in the Caribbean varies from island to island. In the Dominican Republic, restaurants add a 10% gratuity and it is customary to tip an extra 10%. In St. Barths, it is expected that a tip be 10% to 15% if gratuity isn't already included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culinarytravel.about.com/od/planningculinarytravel/a/Tipping_Guide_Worldwide.htm |title=Tipping Etiquette and Tipping Guidelines for Restaurants Around the World – Guidelines for Tipping Etiquette in Restaurants Around the World |publisher=Culinarytravel.about.com |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112205916/http://culinarytravel.about.com/od/planningculinarytravel/a/Tipping_Guide_Worldwide.htm |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
[[File:Coco-Taxi Driver - Havana - Cuba.jpg|thumb|200px|A taxi driver waiting for customers]]
Workers in small, economy restaurants usually do not expect a significant tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/mexico-city/practical-information/money-costs |title=Practical travel information on Money and costs in Mexico City – Lonely Planet Travel Information |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tipping in Mexico is common in larger, medium and higher end restaurants. It is customary in these establishments to tip not less than 10% but not more than 15% of the bill as a voluntary offering for good service based on the total bill before value added tax,&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXJGPdl0Vc |title=Reporte Especial: ¿Das propina? Revista del Consumidor TV 10.1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "IVA" in English, [[VAT]]. Value added tax is already included in menu or other service industry pricing since Mexican Consumer Law requires the exhibition of final costs for the customer. Thus, the standard tip in Mexico is 11.5% of the pre-tax bill which equates to 10% after tax in most of the Mexican territory, except in special lower tax stimulus economic zones.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn4good.com/travel/tourist_information/mexico_guidebooks_mexican_embassy_list_visas.htm |title=Mexico Travel Guide tips, Mexico City tourist information, visa requirements, work visas, student accommodation, food, eating on a budget |publisher=Learn4good.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tips to taxi drivers is unusual in Mexico, but the workers use to ask for them to tourists, knowing that is common in other countries. Locally, you only type a taxi when he offers an extra service, like helping with the luggagge or similar help.

A gratuity may be added to the bill without the customer's consent, contrary to the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DFX604Gxqw |title=Qué hacer si te quieren cobrar la propina [Revista del Consumidor Webcast 211 |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; either explicitly printed on the bill, or by more surreptitious means alleging local custom, in some restaurants, bars, and night clubs. However, in 2012, officials began a campaign to eradicate this increasingly rampant and abusive practice not only due to it violating Mexican consumer law, but also because frequently it was retained by owners or management.

If a service charge for tip ("propina" or "restaurant service charge") is added, it is a violation of Article 10 of the Mexican Federal Law of the Consumer and Mexican authorities recommend patrons require management to refund or deduct this from their bill. Additionally, in this 2012 Federal initiative to eliminate the illegal add-ons, the government clarified that contrary even to the belief of many Mexicans, that the Mexican legal definition of tips ("propinas") require it be discretionary to pay so that an unsatisfied client is under no obligation to pay anything to insure the legal definition of a tip is consistent with the traditional, cultural definition, and going as far to encourage all victims subject to the increasing illicit practice report the establishments to the [[PROFECO]], the Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer, for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://revistadelconsumidor.gob.mx/?p=30706 |title=QuĂŠ hacer si… Te quieren cobrar la propina &amp;#124; Revista del Consumidor en LĂnea |publisher=Revistadelconsumidor.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[File:Luzmilla's Waiter.jpg|thumb|200px|A server at Luzmilla's restaurant]]
Tipping is a practiced social custom in the [[United States]]. Tipping by definition is voluntary – at the discretion of the customer. In restaurants offering traditional table service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/07/normal-restaurant-tip/DONV9Oq598hVLBZAqtw0ZM/story.html |title= 20 percent tip? Easier math makes paying the bill a snap |publisher=Boston Globe |date= |accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a gratuity of 15–20% of the amount of a customer’s check is customary when adequate service is provided. In [[buffet]]-style restaurants where the server brings only beverages, 10% is customary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/recipes/table-manners/buffet-tipping-oct01 |title=Tipping for a Buffet – Peggy Post Etiquette |publisher=Good Housekeeping |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher tips may be given for excellent service, and lower tips for mediocre service. In the case of bad or rude service no tip may be given, and the restaurant manager may be notified of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/rules-restaurant-gratuities-36235.html |title=Rules for Restaurant Gratuities &amp;#124; Chron.com |publisher=Smallbusiness.chron.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tips are also generally given for services provided at golf courses, casinos, hotels, spas, salons, and for concierge services, food delivery, and taxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3148.pdf |title=p3184 |website=www.irs.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This etiquette applies to bar service at weddings and any other event where one is a guest as well. The host should provide appropriate tips to workers at the end of an event; the amount may be negotiated in the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Everything Wedding Checklist | last1=Anastasio | first1=Janet | last2=Bevilaqua | first2=Michelle | publisher=F+W Publications | year=2000 | ISBN=978-1-58062-456-5 | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines tippable employees as individuals who customarily and regularly receive tips of $30 or more per month. Federal law permits employers to include tips towards satisfying the difference between employees' hourly wage and minimum wage. Federal minimum wage for tipped employees in the United States is $2.13 per hour, although some states and territories provide more generous provisions for tipped employees. For example, laws in Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Guam specify that employees must be paid the full minimum wage of that state/territory (which is equal or higher than the federal minimum wage in these instances) before tips are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm|title=Minimum Wages for Tipped Employees|publisher=Department of Labor|accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tip pool cannot be allocated to employers, or to employees who do not customarily and regularly receive tips. These non-eligible employees include dishwashers, cooks, chefs, and janitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.pdf|title=Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)|work=[[United States Department of Labor]]|date=December 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King David Hotel Waiters.jpg|thumb|200px|Waiters at the [[King David Hotel]]]]
There is only limited information available on levels of tipping. A study at Iowa State University provided data for a suburban restaurant surveyed in the early 1990s. The mean tip was $3.00 on a mean bill of $19.78. As such, the mean tip rate was 16.1%, and the median tip rate was about 15%.&lt;ref name="ISU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~dicook/stat503/05/cs-tips2.pdf|title=STAT 503 Case Study 1: Restaurant Tipping|accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 research study at Brigham Young University, the sample restaurants had an average tip percentage ranging from 13.57 to 14.69% between 1999 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orca.byu.edu/Journals/2003%20Final%20reports/_msm/jackson.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308145711/http://orca.byu.edu/Journals/2003%20Final%20reports/_msm/jackson.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 study done at Cornell University exploring the relationship between tip amount and quality of service has shown that quality of service is only weakly related to the amount the server is tipped by the guest. This study suggests that servers who provide amazing service are tipped marginally better, if not better at all, than servers who provide standard service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&amp;context=articles|title=Restaurant Tipping and Service Quality: A Tenuous Relationship|last=Lynn|first=Michael|date=2001|website=[[Cornell University]]|access-date=6/4/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Restaurant Association]], only a handful of restaurants in the United States have adopted a no-tipping model and some restaurants who have adopted this model returned to tipping due to loss of employees to competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Skidmore Sell |first=Sarah |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/649e6fd4df5f495b8eeb390a85230607/no-tipping-trend-now-more-restaurants-mixed-results |title=No-tipping trend now at more restaurants, with mixed results |work=Associated Press |date=2016-08-31 |accessdate=2016-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Service charges =====
Service charges are mandatory payments, typically added by caterers and banqueters. A service charge is not to be confused with a tip or gratuity which is optional and at the discretion of the customer. Restaurants commonly add it to checks for large parties.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Restaurant Business|year=1988|volume=87|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bars have decided to include service charge as well, for example in Manhattan, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/11/01/high-end-manhattan-bars-institute-mandatory-tipping/| title = High-End Manhattan Bars Institute Mandatory Tipping
 | publisher = CBS New York |accessdate = 2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure of service charge is required by law in some places, such as in State of Florida&lt;ref&gt;Florida statute 509.214&lt;/ref&gt; A standard predetermined percent, often ~18%, is sometimes labeled as a "service charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/887933271.html?dids=887933271:887933271&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+26%2C+2005&amp;author=Laura+Bly&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.1&amp;desc=The+tipping+point+%3B+Will+mandatory+service+charges+replace+voluntary+gratuities%3F |title="The tipping point: Will service charges replace voluntary gratuities?", USA Today. 2005-08-25 |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2005-08-26 |accessdate=2012-02-06 |first=Laura |last=Bly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=====History=====
Until the early 20th century, Americans viewed tipping as inconsistent with the values of an egalitarian, democratic society.&lt;ref name="Segrave1998"&gt;{{cite book | last=Segrave | first1=Kerry | title=Tipping: An American social history of gratuities | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company | year=1998 | isbn=0786403470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, proprietors regarded tips as equivalent to bribing an employee to do something that was otherwise forbidden, such as tipping a waiter to get an extra large portion of food.&lt;ref name="Segrave1998" /&gt; The introduction of [[Prohibition]] in 1919 had an enormous impact on hotels and restaurants, who lost the revenue of selling alcoholic beverages. The resulting financial pressure caused proprietors to welcome tips, as a way of supplementing employee wages.&lt;ref name="Mentzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The payment of gratuities by customers in the United States: An historical analysis | url=http://www.edwards.usask.ca/faculty/marc%20mentzer/tipping.pdf |journal=International Journal of Management (UK) | date=September 2013| last=Mentzer | first=Marc S. | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=108–120 | issn=0813-0183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, tipping did not arise because of servers' low wages, because the occupation of waiter (server) was fairly well paid in the era when tipping became institutionalized.&lt;ref name="Mentzer2013"/&gt;

In spite of the trend toward tipping as obligatory behavior, six states, mainly in the South, passed laws that made tipping illegal. Enforcement of anti-tipping laws was problematic.&lt;ref name="Segrave1998" /&gt; The earliest of these laws was passed in 1909 (Washington), and the last of these laws was repealed in 1926 (Mississippi).&lt;ref name="Segrave1998" /&gt;  Some have argued that "The original workers that were not paid anything by their employers were newly freed slaves" and that "This whole concept of not paying them anything and letting them live on tips carried over from slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shanker|first1=Deena|title=How American tipping grew out of racism|url=http://qz.com/609293/how-american-tipping-grew-out-of-racism/|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://www.sporkful.com/the-restaurateur-who-got-rid-of-tipping/ |title=The Restaurateur Who Got Rid Of Tipping |website=The Sporkful |publisher=WNYC |host=Dan Pashman |date=2 January 2017 |time=5:04 |access-date=13 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Taxation=====
[[File:USMC-111102-M-HA146-002.jpg|thumb|220px|Hair stylists are among the service workers who are often tipped for their service in the United States]]
Tips are considered income. The entire tip amount is treated as earned wages with the exception of months in which tip income was under $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3148.pdf|title=Publication 3148, A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employees Who Receive Tip Income|publisher=Internal Revenue|accessdate=20012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike wages where payroll tax (social security and medicare tax) are split between employee and employer, the employee pays 100% of payroll tax on tip income and tips are excluded from worker's compensation premiums in most states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax Topics – Topic 761, Tip Income|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc761.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discourages no-tip policies because employers would pay 7.65% additional payroll taxes and up to 9% worker's compensation premiums on higher wages in lieu of tips.

Research finds that consistent tax evasion by waitstaff due to fraudulent declaration is a concern in the US. According to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], between 40% and 50% of tips to waiters are not reported for taxation.&lt;ref&gt;IRS Bulletin No. 2002–47, November 25, 2002, presents some examples of tipping discrepancies that led to some investigations.&lt;/ref&gt; Employers are responsible for Federal Unemployment Insurance premiums on tips paid directly from customers to employees, and this encourages employers to collaborate in underreporting tips.

=====U.S. federal employees=====
The U.S. Government recognizes tips as allowable expenses for federal employee travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104208#11|title=Frequently Asked Questions, Per Diem|website=www.gsa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, U.S. law prohibits federal employees from receiving tips&lt;!-- 2635.102(h) --&gt; under Standards of Ethical Conduct. Asking for, accepting or agreeing to take anything of value that influences the performance of an official act is not allowed.&lt;!--  18 U.S.C. 201(b),--&gt; &lt;ref name="5CFR2635"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/jmd/ethics/generalf.htm |title=USDOJ: JMD: Departmental Ethics Office: Regulations, Authorities &amp; Reference Materials: Do It Right |publisher=Justice.gov |date=1993-01-20 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2011 rule issued by the US Department of Labor which prohibited employers from tip pooling employees who were paid at least the federal minimum wage and who don't “customarily and regularly” receive tips was repealed in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laboremploymentlawblog.com/2018/04/articles/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa/tip-pooling/|title=New Tip Pooling Guidelines For Employers - Labor &amp; Employment Law Blog|date=10 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrn.com/operations/understanding-tip-income-protection-act-2018|title=Understanding the Tip Income Protection Act of 2018|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, workers will have more rights to sue their employers for stolen tips, with assistance from the US Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrn.com/workforce/tip-protection-rider-added-budget-bill|title=Tip protection rider added to budget bill|date=22 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JackNicklausAndSon2006MastersPar3.jpg|thumb|200px|A young man (in white) caddies the golf clubs of an [[Jack Nicklaus|older golfer]]]]
Tipping is not expected or required in Australia. The minimum wage in Australia is reviewed yearly, and as of 2017 it was set at A$17.70 per hour (A$22.125 for casual employees)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairwork.gov.au/pay/national-minimum-wage/pages/default.aspx |title=National minimum wage&amp;nbsp;– Pay&amp;nbsp;– Fair Work Ombudsman |publisher=Fairwork.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is fairly standard across all types of venues. Tipping at cafés and restaurants (especially for a large party), and tipping of taxi drivers and home food deliverers is again, not required or expected. However many people tend to round up the amount owed while indicating that they are happy to let the worker "keep the change".

There is no tradition of tipping somebody who is just providing a service (e.g. a hotel porter). [[Casino]]s in Australia—and some other places—generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered [[bribery]]. For example, in the state of [[Tasmania]], the Gaming Control Act 1993 states in section 56 (4): "It is a condition of every special employee's licence that the special employee must not solicit or accept any gratuity, consideration or other benefit from a patron in a gaming area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;doc_id=94%2B%2B1993%2BAT%40EN%2B20070406010000 |title=Tasmanian Gaming Control Act 1993 |publisher=Thelaw.tas.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern that tipping might become more common in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/101208991 CNBC: "Is Australia at a tipping point, literally?"

====New Zealand====
Tipping is not a traditional practice in New Zealand, though has become less uncommon in recent years&amp;nbsp;– especially in finer establishments. Tipping in New Zealand is likely the result of tourists visiting from tipping cultures (such as the United States of America) who may follow their own tipping customs. It is still extremely rare among locals, especially among the working and middle-class. It is expected that employers pay their staff fairly and the minimum wage is regularly raised with public pressure to ensure minimum wage employees have a reasonable standard of living with rising living costs and inflation. Where tipping does occur among New Zealanders it is usually to reward a level of service that is far in excess of the customer's expectations, or as an unsolicited reward for a voluntary act of service. A number of websites published by the New Zealand government advise tourists that "tipping in New Zealand is not obligatory&amp;nbsp;– even in restaurants and bars. However, tipping for good service or kindness is at the discretion of the visitor".&lt;ref name="NZ Immigration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/study/imacceptedtellmemore/informationforyourfirstfewdays/tippingandservicecharges.htm |title=Tipping and service charges |website=Immigration new Zealand |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2012-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171437/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/study/imacceptedtellmemore/informationforyourfirstfewdays/tippingandservicecharges.htm |archive-date=2013-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sunday Star-Times reader poll in 2011 indicated 90% of their readers did not want tipping for good service to become the norm in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/latest-edition/7036404/A-tip-on-how-to-get-top-service |title=A tip on how to get good service|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Inconsistency of percentage-based gratuities===
[[File:William Powell Frith The crossing sweeper 1893.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Crossing sweeper]]s cleared the way for rich people to cross the road without dirtying their clothes and they were normally tipped for this service (London, 1893), while the modern version of this service are squeegee kids who clean windshields during the time vehicles are stopped for traffic lights]]
In countries where tipping is the norm, such as in the US, Canada, and in a few countries in Western Europe, some employers pay workers with the expectation that their wages will be supplemented by tips. Some have criticized the inherent "social awkwardness" in transactions that involve tipping, the inconsistency of tipping for some services but not similar ones, and the irrationality of basing tips on price, rather than the amount and quality of service (a customer pays a larger tip to a server bringing them a lobster rather than a hamburger, for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7927983.stm | work=BBC News | title=The mechanics of tipping US-style | date=2009-03-07 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in countries where tips are not paid by most but where many do, managers tell new waiters that the salary might not be so high but there will be tips, meaning that waiters get little payment from those who do not pay tips.

===Inconsistency between different culture among tourists===
Some nationalities, such as people from the US, are used to paying tips, and often do so even when they visit countries where this is less of a norm. In contrast, tourists from such countries may neglect to pay tips when they visit countries such as the US where tips are expected.

===Discrimination===
In the Freakonomics blog entitled ''Should Tipping be Banned?'' Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt discussed the issue of gratuities. The authors pointed out that research by Michael Lynn found that "attractive waitresses get better tips than less attractive waitresses. Men’s appearance, not so important". Lynn's research also found that "blondes get better tips than brunettes. Slender women get better tips than heavier women. Large breasted women get better tips than smaller breasted women". A woman server interviewed for the blog stated that she "lost my job because my manager said that I didn’t fit the look of the company, or the restaurant. So I don’t know if it was because I’m a lot more curvier than the other girls or because my skin is darker. I don’t know".&lt;ref name="freak" /&gt;

Lynn states of tipping: "It’s [[Discrimination|discriminatory]]. Yes, and the Supreme Court has ruled that even neutral business practices that are not intended to discriminate, if they have the effect of adversely impacting a protected class are illegal. And so it’s not inconceivable to me that there will be a class-action lawsuit on the part of ethnic minority waiters and waitresses claiming discrimination in terms of employment. And it’s conceivable that tipping might be declared illegal on that basis".&lt;ref name="freak"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://freakonomics.com/2013/06/03/should-tipping-be-banned-full-transcript/|title=Should Tipping be Banned?|work=freakonomics.com|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases where no gratuity is expected===
Tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; In countries such as Australia and Japan where no tipping is provided, the service is found to be as good as in America.&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt;

===Mandatory tipping===
{{main|Mandatory tipping}}
A [[service charge]] is sometimes added to bills in restaurants and similar establishments. Attempts to hide service charge by obstructing the line on the receipt have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Trevor White |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/aug/20/foodanddrink.features6 |title=newspaper: Confessions of a restaurant critic |publisher=Guardian |date= 2006-08-20|accessdate=2012-02-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, criminal charges were dropped in two separate cases over non-payment of mandatory gratuities.

===Bribery and corruption===
[[Bribe]]ry and [[Political corruption|corruption]] are sometimes disguised as tipping. In some developing countries, [[police officers]], border guards, and other [[civil servants]] openly solicit tips, gifts and dubious fees using a variety of local [[euphemisms]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Economic theory===
A 2009 academic paper by Steven Holland calls tipping "an effective mechanism for risk sharing and welfare improvement" which reduces the risk faced by a service customer, because the customer can decide whether or not to tip.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Holland. "Tipping as risk sharing." ''The Journal of Socio-Economics''. Volume 38, Issue 4, August 2009, Pages 641–647&lt;/ref&gt; Tipping is sometimes given as an example of the  [[principal-agent theory|principal-agent problem]] in economics. One example is a restaurant owner who engages servers to act as agents on his behalf.&lt;ref name="videbeck"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2015/04/images/stories/policy-magazine/2004-summer/2004-20-4-steen-videbeck.pdf|title=The Economics &amp; Etiquette of Tipping|work=[[The Centre for Independent Studies]]|last=Videbeck|first=Steen|date=Summer 2004–05|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, "[c]ompensation agreements [can] increase worker effort [...] if compensation is [...] tied to the firm's success" and one example of such a compensation agreement is waiters and waitresses who are paid tips.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;Robert J. Graham. ''Managerial Economics For Dummies''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show however that, in the real world, the size of the tip is only weakly correlated with the quality of the service and other effects dominate.&lt;ref name=freak/&gt;

'''Homecoming''' is the tradition of welcoming back former students and members and celebrating an organization's existence. It is a tradition in many [[high school]]s, colleges, and churches in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==United States==
Homecoming (colloquially known as "hoco" or "HoCo" in some parts of the US){{which|date=October 2018}} is an annual tradition in the United States. People, towns, high schools, and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back alumni and former residents. It is built around a central event, such as a [[banquet]] or dance and, most often, a game of [[American football]], or, on occasion, [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], or [[soccer]]. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary widely. However, they usually consist of a football game played on a school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a [[parade]] featuring the school's [[choir]], [[marching band]], and sports teams, and the coronation of a homecoming queen (and at many schools, a homecoming king). A dance commonly follows the game or the day following the game. When attached to a football game, homecoming traditionally occurs on the team's return from the longest road trip of the season. The game itself, whether it be football or another sport, will typically feature the home team playing a considerably weaker opponent. The game is supposed to be an "easy win" and thus weaker schools will sometimes play lower division schools.

===Origins===
[[File:Homecoming1911.jpg|thumb|right|The [[1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game]] is one of several claimed to be the first college football homecoming game.]]
The tradition of homecoming has its origin in alumni football games held at colleges and universities since the 19th century. Many schools including [[Baylor University|Baylor]], [[Southwestern University|Southwestern]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]], and Missouri&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2006/10/20/traditions-beginnings-mysterious/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorknewstimes.com/articles/2011/09/23/editorials/doc4e7c08259fabd268415990.txt|title=Vincent's Views|work=[[York News-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/sep/23/its-high-school-homecoming-season-on-the-coast/|title=It's high school homecoming season on the Treasure Coast|author=Zaimarie De Guzman|work=TCP|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502012424/http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2011/sep/23/its-high-school-homecoming-season-on-the-coast/|archivedate=2014-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have made claims that they held the first modern homecoming. The [[NCAA]], ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and references from the American TV drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' give the title to the [[University of Missouri]]'s 1911 [[American football|football]] game during which alumni were encouraged to attend. It was the first annual homecoming centered on a parade and a football game.&lt;ref name="battle"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cramton| first =Michael| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The History of Homecoming| publisher =Active.com| date =| url =http://www.active.com/football/Articles/The_History_of_Homecoming| format =| doi =| accessdate =2013-02-28| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130330000433/http://www.active.com/football/Articles/The_History_of_Homecoming| archivedate =2013-03-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]] first faced off against the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]] in the first installment of the [[Border War (Kansas–Missouri rivalry)|Border War]], which was also the oldest college football rivalry west of the [[Mississippi River]] until the teams stopped playing each other in 2012. The intense rivalry originally took place at neutral sites, usually in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], until a new conference regulation was announced that required intercollegiate football games to be played on collegiate campuses.  To renew excitement in the rivalry, ensure adequate attendance at the new location, and celebrate the first meeting of the two teams on the Mizzou campus in [[Columbia, Missouri]], Mizzou Athletic Director [[Chester Brewer]] invited all alumni to "come home" for the game in 1911.  Along with the football game, the celebration included a parade and spirit rally with bonfire. The event was a success, with nearly 10,000 alumni coming home to take part in the celebration and watch the Tigers and Jayhawks play to a 3–3 tie. The Missouri annual homecoming, with its parade and spirit rally centered on a large football game is the model that has gone on to take hold at colleges and high schools across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=3b6196ac-c8ed-4620-a9c9-439789ddd7cc{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mizzou.com/homecoming/history.html|title=VIRTUAL HOMECOMING: THE BIRTH OF AN AMERICAN TRADITION|author=Jon Stephens|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961111073311/http://www.mizzou.com/homecoming/history.html|archivedate=1996-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two collegiate homecoming celebrations predate the University of Missouri football game homecoming event: [[Southwestern University]], in Georgetown, TX and [[Baylor University]], in Waco, TX. By multiple historical accounts, Southwestern held the first homecoming on record on Wednesday, April 21, 1909 in San Gabriel Park. Former students raised funds, provided homes, prepared and served a barbecue supper, and decorated the town buildings. Members of the senior class waited tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=William B.|title=To Survive and Excel: The Story of Southwestern University 1840-2000|date=2006|isbn=0967091241|pages=151|url=http://southwestern.edu/infoservices/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020075521/http://southwestern.edu/infoservices/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northern Illinois University]] has one of the longest-celebrated homecoming traditions in the country. The alumni football game played on Oct. 10, 1903, began NIU's homecoming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myniu.com/blog/homecoming-list/homecoming-festivities/|title=Alumni Village - NIU Alumni Association|work=NIU Alumni Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140930224102/http://myniu.com/blog/homecoming-list/homecoming-festivities/|archivedate=2014-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baylor University|Baylor's]] homecoming history dates back to November 1909 and included a parade, reunion parties, and an afternoon football game (the final game of the 1909 season), a tradition that continued and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/traditions.asp|title=Baylor Alumni Association|work=bayloralumniassociation.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214758/http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/traditions.asp|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=|access-date=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/parade.asp|title=Baylor Alumni Association|work=bayloralumniassociation.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214836/http://www.bayloralumniassociation.com/content/programs_and_awards/parade.asp|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=|access-date=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a gap between 1910 and 1915 when there was no homecoming event, however there has been continuity since 1915. 

The [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] first held its homecoming event in 1910, celebrating the 100th anniversary in 2010.  This event was held annually except for 1918, when it was cancelled because of the influenza epidemic.

===Traditions===

====Homecoming Court====
[[Image:Classic 07.jpg|thumb|2007 [[East LA Classic]] [[Halftime show]] the homecoming [[high school football|football]] game. The Classic is one of the most highly acclaimed and attended high-school football games west of the [[Mississippi River]] and has taken place since 1925.]]

The homecoming court is a representative group of students that, in a coeducational institution, consists of a king and queen, and possibly prince(s) and princess(es). In a single-sex institution, the homecoming court will usually consist of only a king and a prince (for an all-male school) or a queen and a princess (for an all-female school), although some schools may choose to join with single-gender schools of the other gender to elect the homecoming court jointly.

Generally, the king and queen are students completing their final years of study at their school (also called “seniors”), while the prince and princess are underclassmen, often with a prince/princess for each grade. Recently, some high schools have chosen to add categories, such as duke and duchess, to extend the representation of students to include a category in which students with special needs are elected. In high school, 17- or 18-year-old students in their final year are represented by a king or queen; in college, students who are completing their final year of study, usually between 21 and 23 years old.

Local rules determine when the homecoming king and queen are crowned. Sometimes, the big announcement comes at a [[pep rally]], school assembly, or public ceremony one or more days before the football game. Other schools crown their royalty at the homecoming football game, a dance, or other school event.

Often, the previous year's king and queen are invited back to crown their successors. If they are absent for whatever reason, someone else—usually, another previous king or queen, a popular teacher, or other designated person—will perform those duties. Usually, the queen is crowned first, followed by the king. The crowning method also varies by school.

Homecoming court members who are not crowned king or queen are often called escorts or royalty. They are often expected to participate in the week's activities as well. At some schools, a homecoming prince/princess, duke/duchess, etc. (often underclassmen nominated by their classmates) are crowned along with the king and queen; sometimes, middle school and junior high students may partake in the high school activities.

[[File:14497-Homecoming Football vs McMurray-3918 (15726901335).jpg|thumb|left|The 2014 homecoming court at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]]
Classmates traditionally nominate students who have done a lot to contribute to their school, then students vote for members of the court from the nominees. Once the homecoming court candidates are announced, the entire student body votes for the queen and king. The voting is often conducted by [[secret ballot]], but other methods may also be used by certain schools.

====Parade====
[[File:13399-Homecoming Tailgate and Game-1839 (10714677125).jpg|thumb|right|Homecoming parade at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2013]]

Many homecoming celebrations include a parade. Students often select the grand marshal based on a history of service and support to the school and community. The parade includes the school's marching band and different school organizations’ floats created by the classes and organizations and most of the sports get a chance to be in the parade. Every class prepares a float which corresponds with the homecoming theme or related theme of school spirit as assign by school administrators. In addition, the homecoming court takes part in the parade, often riding together in one or more [[convertible]]s as part of the parade. Community civic organizations and businesses, area fire departments, and alumni groups often participate as well. The parade is often part of a series of activities scheduled for that specific day, which can also include a pep rally, [[bonfire]], [[snake dance]], and other activities for students and alumni.

====Tailgate====
[[File:14497-Homecoming Football vs McMurray-9338 (15106869054).jpg|thumb|Homecoming tailgate at Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce in 2014]]

At most major colleges and universities, the football game and preceding [[tailgate party]] are the most widely recognized and heavily attended events of the week. Alumni gather from all around the world to return to their alma mater, reconnect with one another, and take part in the festivities. Students, alumni, businesses, and members of the community set up tents in parking lots, fields, and streets near the stadium to cook food, play games, socialize, binge drink, and even enjoy live music in many instances. These celebrations often last straight through the game for those who do not have tickets but still come to take part in the socializing and excitement of the homecoming atmosphere. Most tents even include television or radio feeds of the game for those without tickets.

====Picnic====
Sometimes during the school week, a picnic can occur. The picnic is very similar to the tailgate party, but it occurs after school or during the school's lunch period.

====Dress-up days====
Throughout the week, many schools (particularly high schools) engage in special dress-up days, sometimes called "Spirit Week", where students are allowed to wear clothing suitable to the theme (e.g., 80s day, [[toga]] day, roll out of bed day, [[cowboy]] day, [[nerd]] day, [[pirate]] day, [[meme]] day, [[Rat Pack]] Day, flannel Friday, What-not-to-wear Wednesday) leading to the homecoming. Students traditionally wear clothing with their school's name, or clothing and makeup of their school's colors on Friday.

====Pep Rallies====
Many schools hold a rally during homecoming week, often one or more nights before the game. The events vary, but may include skits, games, introduction of the homecoming court (and coronation of the king and queen if that is the school's tradition), and comments from the football players or coach about the upcoming game.

At some schools, the homecoming rally ends with a bonfire (in which old wood structures, the rival school's memorabilia and other items are burned in a controlled fire.) Many colleges and high schools no longer hold bonfires because of accidents that have occurred surrounding these events in the past. The most well known accident took place in 1999, when [[Aggie Bonfire#1999 collapse|12 students]] were killed and 27 others were injured at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] when a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} pile of logs that had been assembled for a bonfire collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2006/10/13/news/safety/ |title=Safety concerns hope to protect bonfire for future generations |publisher=TheDartmouth.com |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524090019/http://thedartmouth.com/2006/10/13/news/safety/ |archivedate=2012-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this incident was not associated with homecoming—A&amp;M is one of the few schools that does not organize a homecoming, although it has [[Traditions of Texas A&amp;M University|many unique traditions]]. The bonfire was associated with the annual [[State Farm Lone Star Showdown|rivalry game]] between [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|A&amp;M]] and the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]].

====Alumni Band====
The alumni band consists of former college and university band members who return for homecoming to perform with the current marching band (usually made up from recent graduates to members who graduated years or decades before) either during halftime as a full band or a featured section, e.g. the [[trumpet]] section or the [[tuba]]s and [[drumline]] squads, as well as performing with the current band during the post game concert.

====Homecoming dance====
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
The homecoming dance—usually the culminating event of the week (for high schools)—is a formal or informal event, either at the school or an off-campus location. The venue is decorated, and either a disc jockey or band is hired to play music. In many ways, it is a fall [[prom]]. Homecoming dances could be informal as well just like standard school dances. At high schools, the homecoming dances are sometimes held in the high school gymnasium or outside in a large field. Homecoming dance attire is less formal than prom. Females generally wear knee length dresses with their hair down, and males generally wear a tucked in dress shirt with pants. At prom, females generally wear a more formal gown that goes to the ground with hair up, and males wear suits and tuxedos.

Since most colleges are too large to facilitate a campus-wide dance, these events are usually handled instead by student organizations such as fraternities, sororities, and residential colleges. Because football and alumni events are the focal points of collegiate homecoming, dances often take place during a different week when schedules are more permitting, or not at all.

===Competitions===
At the high school level, students generally compete by grade level in events such as the spirit days, parade floats, and [[powder puff football]]. The competition at the collegiate level is mainly between Greek-letter organizations and, to a lesser degree, residence halls. At most larger schools, fraternities and sororities compete on parade floats, house decorations, skits, talent competitions, and even service events such as blood drives or food drives. Sometimes on coronation night, some schools have games that they play between classes. Such events include the pyramid, the 3 legged race, the pop chug, and tug of war.

===Smaller school homecomings===
While most schools schedule their homecoming activities around football, smaller schools that do not field a football team may plan the annual event at another time of the year. In these instances, basketball, ice hockey or soccer serves as the "big game" for students and alumni. Often in smaller towns with smaller populations, the parade is omitted.

At schools without athletic programs, the centerpiece event is usually a banquet, where alumni are recognized. This format is also used for alumni events of high schools that have either closed or consolidated with other high schools; the high school classes continue to meet and celebrate their years at their now-defunct [[alma mater]]. In other cases, alumni of closed schools will participate with the consolidated school's homecoming, where special recognition is often given for alumni of the once-separate schools.

===Courtwarming===
In some parts of the country, high school basketball has gained a homecoming celebration of its own. Often referred to as ''winter homecoming'', ''hoopcoming'', ''coronation'', ''snowcoming'', "Colors Day," or c''ourtwarming'' (the latter is especially prominent in parts of Missouri), it usually includes rallies, dress-up days, special dinners, king and queen coronations, and other winter-friendly activities typically associated with football homecoming.

==Canada==
Canadian homecoming weekends are often centred on a football game.

In [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], communities have a "[[Come Home Year]]" where people who have moved away from their town come back from across Canada. In 2000, there was a provincial "Come Home Year", where many people came back to visit their various communities.

Homecomings largely only exist among high schools in eastern Canada, and are uncommon at that. [[Newmarket High School]], [[London South Collegiate Institute]], [[Banting Memorial High School]] and [[Earl Haig Secondary School]] are examples of known schools in Ontario to arrange homecomings. Upper Canada College also has a longstanding homecoming tradition, although the event is referred to as "A-Day" (Association Day).

== Church homecomings ==
The term "homecoming" can also refer to the special services conducted by some religious congregations, particularly by many smaller American Protestant churches, to celebrate church heritage and welcome back former members or pastors. They are often held annually, but are sometimes held as one-time-only events, to celebrate the occasion.

'''Incense in China''' is traditionally used in a wide range of [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] activities including, [[Religion in China|religious]] ceremonies, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], [[traditional medicine]], and in daily life. Known as ''xiang'' ({{zh|c=香|p=xiāng|w=''hsiang''|l=fragrance}}), [[incense]] was used by the Chinese cultures starting from Neolithic times with it coming to greater prominence starting from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.&lt;ref name="東方香學研究會"&gt;劉良佑，《香學會典》，臺北：[http://www.incenseart.org.tw 東方香學研究會]，2003&lt;/ref&gt;

One study shows that during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220) &lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph and Lu Gwei-Djen (1974). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality'']. Cambridge University Press. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; there was increased trade and acquisitions of more fragrant foreign incense materials when local incense materials were considered "poor man's incense".&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. (1963). ''The Golden Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It reached its height during the [[Song Dynasty]] with its nobility enjoying incense as a popular cultural pastime, to the extent of building rooms specifically for the use of incense ceremonies.&lt;ref name="東方香學研究會"/&gt;

Besides meaning "incense", the [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]] word ''xiang'' ([[Wikt:香|香]]) also means "fragrance; scent; aroma; perfume; spice". The sinologist and historian [[Edward H. Schafer]] said that in medieval China:
{{cquote|there was little clear-cut distinction among drugs, spices, perfumes, and incenses – that is, among substances which nourish the body and those which nourish the spirit, those which attract a lover and those which attract a divinity.|20||The Golden Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics|Edward H. Schafer&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Edward H. (1963). ''The Golden Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics''. University of California Press. p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Chinese censers==
[[File:Eastern Han ceramic incense burner.JPG|thumb|An [[Eastern Han]] ceramic mountain-censer]]
Words meaning "[[censer]]; incense burner" are [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''lu'' ([[Wikt:爐|爐]] or [[Wikt:炉|炉]]) "brazier; stove; furnace", which was a category of ancient [[Chinese bronzes]]. ''Xianglu'' (香爐, with "incense") means "incense burner; censer" in general. ''Xunlu'' (熏爐, with "smoke; fumigate; cure (food) with smoke", or 薰爐, with "fragrance (of plants); an aromatic grass, ''[[Eupatorium fortunei]]''") means "small censer, esp. for fumigating or scenting clothing". ''Shoulu'' (手爐, with "hand") means "hand-held censer; handwarmer; portable charcoal stove".

The ''boshanlu'' (博山爐 "universal mountain censer"), which became popular during the era of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141 - 87 BC), displayed a microcosmic [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred mountain]] (esp. [[Kunlun Mountains|Mount Kunlun]] or [[Mount Penglai]]). These elaborate censers were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Susan N. (1992). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20062588 "Boshanlu: Mountain Censers of the Western Han Period: A Typological and Iconological Analysis"], ''Archives of Asian Art'' 45:6-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Medicine===
Similar ingredients and processing techniques are involved in production of both incense and [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]s. For example, take ''jiu'' (灸 "[[moxibustion]]"). Incense is believed to have physiological and psychological benefits. For instance, according to the ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' pharmacopoeia, "camphor cured evil vapors in heart and belly, and was especially recommended for eye troubles, including cataract."&lt;ref&gt;Schafer (1963), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time-keeping===
Along with the introduction of [[Buddhism in China]] came calibrated incense sticks and [[incense clock]]s (''xiangzhong'' 香鐘 "incense clock" or ''xiangyin'' 香印 "incense seal").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bedini|first=Silvio A.|year=1963|title=The Scent of Time. A Study of the Use of Fire and Incense for Time Measurement in Oriental Countries|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|volume=53|issue=5| jstor=1005923|doi=10.2307/1005923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet Yu Jianwu (庾肩吾, 487-551) first recorded them: "By burning incense we know the o'clock of the night, With graduated candles we confirm the tally of the watches."&lt;ref&gt;Tr. Schafer (1963), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these incense timekeeping devices spread from Buddhist monasteries into secular society.

===Religion===
[[File:Burning incense sticks at Wutai Shan.jpg|thumb|Burning incense at a [[Temple (Chinese)|Chinese temple]]]]
''Xiangbang'' (香棒, with "stick; club") means "incense stick; [[joss stick]]". Two "incense" synonyms specifying religious offerings to ancestors or deities are ''gāoxiāng'' (高香, ''"high incense"'') and ''gōngxiāng'' (供香, ''"offering incense"'').

The Sunni Muslim [[Hui people|Hui]] [[Gedimu]] and the [[Yihewani]] burned incense during worship. This was viewed as [[Daoist]] or [[Buddhist]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEih57-GWQQC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=ma+bufang+secret+war#v=onepage&amp;q=incense&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E.

===As an art form===
The Chinese developed a sophisticated art form with incense burning like with tea and calligraphy called '''xiangdao''' (香道). It involves various paraphernalia and utensils in various ceramic containers utilised to burn incense. Examples include tongs, spatulas, special moulds to create ideograms with incense powder, etc. all placed on a special small table. It is most often used as an enhancement to a personal space to accompany other arts such as tea drinking and [[guqin]] playing.

==Production==

===Bamboo processing===
Bamboo species with good burning characteristics are harvested and dried. The most common type of bamboo used for producing the sticks is ''Phyllostachys heterocycla cv. pubescens'' (茅竹,江南竹) since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick. Other types of bamboos such as ''[[Phyllostachys edulis]]'' (毛竹) may be used, however due to their fiberous surfaces or relatively thin wood producing good bamboo sticks is more difficult. Longer incense stick are produced using cao bamboo(草竹).&lt;ref name=cky&gt;{{citation |first=Ka-Yan(家恩) |last=Chen(陳) |title=Joss Stick Manufacturing: A Study of a Traditional Industry in Hong Kong |publisher=sunzi1.lib.hku.hk |url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/44/4401661.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried bamboo poles of around 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter are first manually trimmed to length, soak, peeled, and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than 3mm width have been produced.&lt;ref name=cyj&gt;{{citation |last=陳 |first=永順 |title=失落百年 「剖香腳」技藝重現 |publisher=聯合新聞網 |journal=聯合報 |date=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twWiki&gt;{{citation |last=葉|first=月珠|title=香腳|url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/web/content?ID=9540}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production.

===Incense materials===
Chinese incense is made from diverse ingredients with much overlap into the traditional Chinese herbal pharmacopoeia. Of all the incense ingredients some of the most commonly used include:
*''Chenxiang'' (沈香, "[[Agarwood]], aloeswood")
*''Tanxiang'' (檀香 "[[Sandalwood]]")
*''Anxixiang'' (安息香 "[[Benzoin resin]] and wood, gum guggul")
*''Cuibai'' (翠柏 "[[Calocedrus macrolepis]], Chinese incense-cedar")
*''Zhangnao'' (樟腦 "[[Camphor]]").
*''Ruxiang'' (乳香, "[[Frankincense]]")
*''Dingxiang'' (丁香, "[[Cloves]]")
*''Bajiao'' (八角, "[[Star anise]]")
*''Guipi'' (桂皮, "[[Cinnamomum cassia]]")
*''Dahuixiang'' (大回香, "[[Foeniculum vulgare]]")
*''Dahuang'' (大黃, "[[Rheum officinale]]")
*''Hupo'' (琥珀, ''Fossil [[Amber]]'')
*''Gansong'' (甘松 ''[[Spikenard]]'')
*''Chuanxiong'' (川芎 ''[[Ligusticum wallichii]]'')
*''Wujia'' (五加 ''[[Eleutherococcus senticosus]] (Acanthopanax senticosus)'')
*''Beijiaxiang (貝甲香 ''East African marine snails'') [http://www2.kohgen.com/yamadamatukoubokuten2.htm]
*''Jiangzhenxiang'' (降真香) also known as ''zitengxiang'' (紫藤香), [[Lakawood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgGhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Imperial China and Its Southern Neighbours |authors= Victor H Mair, Liam Kelley |pages=222–228 |publisher=ISEAS Publishing |date=30 September 2015|isbn= 978-9814620536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiGuQyCSQ_cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 5, Issue 2 |author= Joseph Needham |page=141 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=27 September 1974|isbn= 978-0521085717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried powdered bark of ''[[Persea nanmu]]''(楠木皮) is used extensively for its mucilaginous qualities, which helps to bind the other powdered ingredients together.

===Processes===
Incense powder is formed into the final product through various methods.&lt;ref name=cky/&gt;

====Lin-xiang====
Incense powder is tossed over wet sticks

====Nuo-xiang====
Incense paste is kneaded around sticks.

====Sculpting====
For large incense pillars, incense paste is piled around a single bamboo stick and sculpted to shape

====Winding====
Incense paste is extruded and wound to produce spiral incense

"'''Inno Nazionale'''" is the [[national anthem]] of the Republic of [[San Marino]]. It was written by [[Federico Consolo]], an Italian [[violin]]ist and [[composer]], and replaced [[Giubilanti d'amore fraterno]] as the national anthem in 1894. This national anthem is one of a few without official lyrics (along with [[Marcha Real|Spain]], [[National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Europe (anthem)|Kosovo]]), and is therefore simply called "Inno Nazionale" (National anthem). It is little known and scarcely heard, but the "Inno Nazionale" is regularly played in the streets of the [[City of San Marino]] by the musicians of the [[Sammarinese Armed Forces]] during national and religious festivals.

'''''It's Garry Shandling's Show''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sitcom]] that was initially broadcast on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] from 1986 to 1990. It was created by [[Garry Shandling]] and [[Alan Zweibel]]. The series is notable for breaking the [[fourth wall]].

==Synopsis==
The 30-minute series stars [[Garry Shandling]] as, more or less, himself: A [[Neurosis|neurotic]], somewhat self-obsessed [[stand-up comedian]] who just happens to be aware he is a television sitcom character. Garry spends just as much time interacting with the studio audience as he does the regular cast members, offering up opening [[monologue]]s and show-closing summations of the episode's events (much like [[George Burns]] on ''[[The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show]]'').  However, on Garry's show, all the supporting characters know they are on a TV show, not just Garry; and the studio audience is often in the storyline.

At the time of the series' production, Shandling actually lived in [[Sherman Oaks, California]], just like the character on the series. His [[condominium]] on the series was styled to be just like his real-life condo, down to the room layout and the furnishings.&lt;ref&gt;DVD commentary from ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'', Season 3, Episode 46, "Garry Acts Like A Moron"&lt;/ref&gt;

Storylines were often manipulated by Shandling to create more favorable outcomes or simply to speed things along. One episode ended years later, for example. Another allowed Shandling to tell the audience that time had passed in order to console an angry neighbor whose wall he had damaged; by the time the scene transitioned, the workmen had already fixed the wall. On America's presidential election night in 1988, Showtime presented a live episode wherein Shandling brought in ''[[Soul Train]]'' host [[Don Cornelius]] to incorrectly announce that [[Michael Dukakis]] had soundly defeated [[George H. W. Bush]].

The series' [[Theme music|theme song]] was "This is the Theme to Garry's Show", sung by Los Angeles musician Bill Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/may/04/midwest_icon_bill_lynch_discovers_how_live_music/|title=Midwest icon Bill Lynch discovers how to 'live the music' |
first=Jon |last=Niccum |date=May 4, 2007 |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's lyrics are self-referential, explaining how the song came to be ("Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song") and asking what the listener thinks of it.

Considered a critical and [[Niche market|niche]] success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museum.tv/eotv/itsgarrysh.htm |title=Encyclopedia of Television - It's Garry Shandling's Show/The Larry Sanders Show |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |year=2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' ran 72 episodes and was on the air for four seasons (1986–1990). The show was later picked up by the broadcast [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network from 1988 to 1990 as part of its Sunday night lineup with minor cuts for language and advertising breaks; Fox began airing the show from the beginning, but due to longer seasons for network shows versus [[Cable television|cable]], had caught up by the time the show left Fox in March 1990. New episodes continued for a few months thereafter on Showtime. The show introduced much of the country to Shandling and paved the way for his more successful run as Larry Sanders on [[HBO]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''.

==Cast and characters==
Throughout the series, the cast was divided into the "Starring" cast, whose names were featured in the opening credits; the "Co-Starring" cast and the "Guest Starring" cast, both of which had the actors' names featured in the end credits.

"'''Kill the Moon'''" is the seventh episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth series]] of the British [[science fiction]] television programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'', written by [[Peter Harness]] and directed by [[Paul Wilmshurst]]. The episode stars [[Peter Capaldi]] and [[Jenna Coleman]], with [[Hermione Norris]] guest starring, and was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 4 October 2014. The episode received polarising reviews from television critics.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Whilst some critics acclaimed the episode and labelled it the best of the season, others criticised its scientific inaccuracy and thematic content.

==Plot==
After the events of "[[The Caretaker (Doctor Who)|The Caretaker]]", [[Clara Oswald]] warns [[Twelfth Doctor|the Doctor]] that her student, [[Courtney Woods]], is still interested in his TARDIS and is trying to clean up the mess inside it she made previously. As they enter the TARDIS, the Doctor stops Courtney from cleaning and offers to take her and Clara on a trip in the time machine.

They arrive in 2049 aboard a [[space shuttle]] filled with nuclear devices on a crash course for Earth's moon. They survive and meet the shuttle's crew, led by Captain Lundvik. Lundvik explains they are on a suicide mission to destroy the moon; some years past, the moon's gravitation influence suddenly changed, causing massive high tides on Earth wiping out much of humanity, and destabilising the orbit of many of mankind's artificial satellites. Lundvik, who had wanted to become one of Earth's space-faring astronauts, offered to go on this mission to save humanity. Privately, Clara asks the Doctor about this point in time, knowing the moon exists in Earth's future, but the Doctor himself is not clear, as this is a point of time in flux.

They travel to a nearby Mexican lunar colony, finding it covered in cobwebs and the colonists dead, entombed in similar webbing. The Doctor confirms the colony's readings that the moon has gained over one billion tons of additional mass. They are attacked by a spider-like creature that kills Lundvik's crew, but the disinfecting spray Courtney brought kills the creature; the Doctor compares it to germs, and wants to study it further. After seeing Courtney safe to the TARDIS, they investigate a crevasse where thousands of the spider-like creature wait, and the presence of [[amniotic fluid]] nearby. The Doctor surprises Clara and Lundvik by diving into the crevasse, promising to meet them later.

The shuttle, with the TARDIS inside, fall into a crack. The Doctor returns and the three take shelter at the colony. The Doctor asserts that the moon is really a giant, 100-million-year-old egg, ready to hatch, the spiders being the equivalent of sterilising microbes on its surface.  The Doctor gets Courtney to join them in the TARDIS. Lundvik becomes even more insistent to blow up the moon, unsure of the nature of the creature that might hatch, which angers the Doctor. The Doctor takes the TARDIS and abandons the three of them, but assures he will be back once they have made a decision. Lundvik prime a remote trigger for the nuclear bombs set on a timer, intent on finishing her mission. Lundvik, Clara, and Courtney argue what to do, and come to a conclusion to let the population of Earth decide. As shown ''in medias res'' at the start of the episode, Clara makes a plea over broadcast channels for Earth to decide the fate of the creature by leaving their lights on to allow the creature to live, or turning off their lights if they should destroy it. Over the next hour, they witness the lights on Earth turn off. Clara changes her mind at the last second and  manages to stop the countdown on the remote detonator. Shortly thereafter the Doctor arrives, assured that they have made the right choice, and evacuates them from the moon as it starts to crumble.

Safely on Earth, they watch as the winged creature inside the moon breaks free of the shell and flies off, but not before laying another egg that becomes a replacement moon for Earth. The Doctor reveals that the sudden interest in the moon will reinvigorate Earth's space program, and Lundvik will get the opportunity to realise her dream. The Doctor returns Courtney and Clara to their rightful time; Clara angrily accosts the Doctor for forcing her to make the decision on the fate of humanity, while the Doctor asserts he cannot be allowed to make those choices himself. Clara tells the Doctor she does not want to see him again, and takes comfort with [[Danny Pink]], though Danny sees she is still not ready to forget the Doctor. Clara returns to her flat that evening and looks reflectively at the moon.

===Continuity===
The Doctor uses a yo-yo to test the moon's gravity inside the shuttle. The [[Fourth Doctor]] used the same method to test gravity in the Nerva space station in ''[[The Ark in Space]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name="factfile"&gt;{{Citation|title=Kill the Moon | publisher =BBC|place=UK|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5MkKGGVwPzfmdwl048Rr8Jn/kill-the-moon-fact-file}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to executive producer Brian Minchin, Capaldi had requested the yo-yo to be similar to the one that Tom Baker had used before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/238418/brian-minchin-interview-doctor-who-series-8-peter-capaldi|title=Brian Minchin interview: Doctor Who series 8, Peter Capaldi | first =Louisa|last=Mellor|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=5 October 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|place=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor tells Clara that "Earth isn't my home", echoing the Fourth Doctor's statement in ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'' (1975) that "The Earth isn't my home, Sarah.  I'm a Time Lord.  I walk in eternity."&lt;ref name="factfile" /&gt;

In "[[The Fires of Pompeii]]" (2008), the [[Tenth Doctor]] says that as a [[Time Lords|Time Lord]], he can see both fixed and mutable points in time. The Twelfth Doctor says the same thing here, but that there are "grey areas", points in time for which he cannot see the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Twelve great moments from ‘Kill the Moon’|publisher=Doctor Who TV|place=UK|url= http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/12-great-moments-from-kill-the-moon-67452.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doctor claims that Courtney will meet "this bloke called Blinovitch". This refers to the [[Blinovitch Limitation Effect]], first mentioned in the [[Third Doctor]] story ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name="factfile" /&gt;

==Production==

===Writing===
The episode was originally written for [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]'s [[Eleventh Doctor]].  An early [[working title]] for the episode was "Return to [[Planet of Fire|Sarn]]", however, this was intended to be misleading.  While briefing Harness on how to write the script, executive producer [[Steven Moffat]] told him to "Hinchcliffe  the shit out of it for the first half", meaning, essentially, to make it frightening.  This was in reference to [[Philip Hinchcliffe]], who produced ''Doctor Who'' from 1974–77, a period known as especially frightening during the classic series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/tantalising-details-on-series-8-episodes-5-8-66791.htm | title = Tantalising Details on Episodes 5–8 of Series 8 |date= 17 September 2014 |website = Doctor Who TV | accessdate = 18 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moffat called the script "intense and emotional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-8-filming-in-lanzarote-hermione-norris-cast-63183.htm | title = Series 8 Filming in Lanzarote, Hermione Norris Cast | date = 12 May 2014 | website = Doctor Who TV | accessdate = 18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harness has said that the episode will see a large change for the show. "I still don’t know how people will take it.

''[[The A.V.

Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Ben Lawrence noted that "'Kill the Moon' was an excellent example of ''Doctor Who'' reaching out to different generations, something it hasn't always done in recent weeks." He felt Coleman was "terrific" and that Capaldi added further layers of complexity to his character. Lawrence stated that the guests were underdeveloped, but concluded that, "it lacked the clever-cleverness that has marred recent episodes and proved how good ''Doctor Who'' can be when it simply tells a story."&lt;ref name="telegraph review" /&gt; Dan Martin, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated that "Clara's outburst was the next stage in what I have loved about this series most of all. More than ever before, they're playing out the reality of running off to fight aliens with a time-travelling space detective. And, guess what, this life is not all wine and roses."  Martin noted that Coleman has been terrific all series stating that "We no longer need to make note of just how good Jenna is this year; she’s already established herself in pantheon of all-time great companions."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', Neela Debnath praised Coleman's performance, articulating that she "impressed again with her fury as she held the Doctor to account. This is the grown up assistant the Time Lord needs to keep him in check" and ultimately closed her review by saying "'Kill the Moon' was an enclosed space adventure with all the claustrophobia that an episode like this demands [...] It was hardly the strongest episode of the series but it was no car crash either.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Independent | title = Doctor Who Kill the Moon review: Peter Capaldi is far darker than Matt Smith &amp; David Tennant | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-kill-the-moon-review-peter-capaldi-is-far-darker-than-matt-smith-and-david-tennant-9765740.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Radio Times]]'' heavily praised the episode, awarding it a perfect 5/5. They also praised Coleman's performance, stating that "Coleman expertly conveys Clara’s terrible dilemma – and later her tearful fury at the Doctor’s behaviour". They described the episode's writing as "audacious, highly imaginative, and is well matched by Paul Wilmshurst’s supremely eerie, cinematic direction", and closed their review by noting "Portentous dialogue, sharp direction, urgent music and a powerhouse performance from Peter Capaldi make this one of the defining moments of the season".&lt;ref name='rt review" /&gt;

[[File:Jenna Coleman Peabody 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Despite mixed reviews for the episode as a whole, [[Jenna Coleman]] received universal acclaim for her performance.]]

[[Den of Geek]] affirmed that "''Doctor Who'' hits top form with 'Kill the Moon'.  And Jenna Coleman has never been better". They also praised Harness' script as "impressive" and said that Wilmshurst "fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count is the key to crawling under people's skins".  They closed their review by saying "The best ''Doctor Who'' episodes have something to say, get under your skin, and keep you pretty much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch as soon as it was done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences".&lt;ref name="den of geek" /&gt; [[The A.V. Club]] also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. They said "'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that ''Doctor Who'' has genuinely surprised me. That fact, above all else, is why tonight’s episode rates as an instant classic" and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that "Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor". They ended their review by claiming that "This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special".&lt;ref name="av club" /&gt;

[[IGN]] labeled the episode as "The best Capaldi Who yet" and awarded it a score of 9.3/10, deemed "Excellent", They praised almost every aspect of the episode, saying "Dramatic, thought-provoking, gorgeously shot, dryly hilarious and consistently compelling, 'Kill the Moon' was easily the best episode of the season so far, and we'd even put good money on it staying that way come the end of November". They also praised Coleman's performance as "explosive and mouth-gapingly compelling" and summarised the episode as "grown-up sci-fi at its best".&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;

In contrast, some reviewers criticised what they perceived to be plot elements alluding to the abortion debate and, moreover, how the issue was dealt with in the script. In a separate review for ''[[The Independent]]'', Ellen E. Jones described the episode as "perhaps the weakest so far... The grey moon surface provided an uninspiring backdrop for what amounted to a galactic metaphor for the pro-choice debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-series-8-kill-the-moon-bbc1--tv-review-perhaps-the-weakest-episode-so-far-this-series-9776006.html | title = Doctor Who series 8 Kill the Moon, BBC1 TV review: perhaps the weakest episode so far in this series | newspaper = The Independent}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', Ewan Spence described the script as "leaden and heavy... the lack of consequences to [Clara's] decision left the episode with a hollow ring." The review praised Capaldi's and Coleman's performances, but concluded that "'Kill the Moon' wasn't good drama, it delivered false controversy, and it did not respect the debate it was trying to start in the viewers at home."&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;

For ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'', Elizabeth Harper gave the episode one and a half stars and felt it was "a mess of pseudoscience". She summarised that "This episode is a string of scenes that don't make a lot of sense, but are vaguely held together by virtue of the fact that they all happen on the same channel in the same one-hour period." She added finally that "The last scene, however, is genuinely good."&lt;ref name="escapistmagazine.com"/&gt;

Other reviews were also critical of the episode's lack of scientific accuracy, mainly around Earth's moon. Writing for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], [[Phil Plait]] remarked, "The science mistakes were so egregious and so obvious that they kept pulling me right out of the story. A lot of the mistakes were fixable with a simple Google search."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Plait | first = Phil | date = 6 October 2014 | url =http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/10/06/slate_plus_doctor_who_podcast_episode_7_kill_the_moon.html | title = Slate Plus Doctor Who Podcast Episode 7: "Kill the Moon" | publisher = Slate}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for Doctor Who TV, Clint Hassell had a similar objection. While he praised both the actors' performances and the story's ability to "examine aspects of the human condition", he said the episode was "also terrible, presenting a version of science so incorrect that it almost creates a new genre – 'not-so-science fiction'". Though part of the fun of the show is "obviously make-believe, sciencey-wiencey facts and jargon", he believed that, "When [The Doctor] states blatantly wrong science 'facts' because the writer couldn’t be bothered to think rationally, or consult a scientist, that makes the Doctor look like an idiot, and...ruins part of the believability of the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hassell | first = Clint | date = 6 October 2014 | url =http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/kill-the-moon-review-67479.htm | title = Kill The Moon Review | publisher = Doctor Who TV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kirby Buckets''''', also known as '''''Kirby Buckets Warped''''' for the third season, is an American [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] television series that aired on [[Disney XD]] from October 20, 2014 to February 2, 2017. Although a [[live-action]] series, the series also includes [[animated cartoon]] sequences of Kirby's drawings. The series stars [[Jacob Bertrand]], Olivia Stuck, Mekai Curtis, Cade Sutton, and [[Tiffany Espensen]].

== Plot ==
Kirby Buckets dreams of becoming a famous animator like his idol, Mac McCallister, and interacts with his cartoon creations. Similar to Nicholas Martin in ''[[McGee and Me!]]'', Kirby sees his drawings take shape as he and his two best friends, Fish and Eli, go on outrageous and unpredictable adventures.

In the third season, Kirby is sued by Dawn and forbidden from drawing ever again. During a trip to the principal's office he finds a small orb device which allows him to travel to alternate realities. Using it, Kirby accidentally sends his parents to an alternate dimension, and picks up their counterparts from a ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]''-like universe. Now Kirby must find his parents, while having a little fun along the way.

'''Learning sciences''' ('''LS''') is an interdisciplinary field that works to further scientific understanding of [[learning]] as well as to engage in the design and implementation of learning innovations, and the improvement of instructional methodologies. Research in the learning science traditionally focuses on cognitive-psychological, social-psychological, and cultural-psychological foundations of human [[learning]], as well as on the design of learning environments. Major contributing fields include [[cognitive science]], [[computer science]], [[educational psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[applied linguistics]].  Over the past decade, researchers have also expanded their focus to the design of curricula, [[informal learning]] environments, instructional methods, and policy innovations.

== Domain definition ==
As an emerging discipline, the learning sciences are still in the process of defining itself.  Accordingly, the identity of the field is multifaceted, and varies from institution to institution.  However, the International Society of Learning Sciences (ISLS, [http://www.isls.org/]) summarizes the field as follows:  "Researchers in the interdisciplinary field of learning sciences, born during the 1990s, study learning as it happens in real-world situations and how to better facilitate learning in designed environments – in school, online, in the workplace, at home, and in informal environments. Learning sciences research may be guided by constructivist, social-constructivist, socio-cognitive, and socio-cultural theories of learning." ISLS has a large worldwide membership, is affiliated with two international journals: ''[[The Journal of the Learning Sciences|Journal of the Learning Sciences]]'', and ''[http://ijcscl.org International Journal of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning]'', and sponsors the biennial Computer Supported Collaborative Learning conference and International Conference of the Learning Sciences on alternate years.

Although controlled experimental studies and rigorous qualitative research have long been employed in learning science, LS researchers often use [[design-based research]] methods.  Interventions are conceptualized and then implemented in natural settings in order to test the [[ecological validity]] of dominant theory and to develop new theories and frameworks for conceptualizing learning, instruction, design processes, and educational reform. LS research strives to generate principles of practice beyond the particular features of an educational innovation in order to solve real educational problems, giving LS its interventionist character.

== History ==

Several significant events have contributed to the international development of learning science. Perhaps the earliest history can be traced back to the [[cognitive revolution]].

In the United States, an important effort to create a graduate program in learning science took place in 1983 when [https://sites.google.com/site/janhawkinsaward/home Jan Hawkins] and [[Roy Pea]] proposed a joint program between Bank Street College and the [http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/ New School for Social Research].  Called "Psychology, Education, and Technology" (PET), the program had a planning grant supported by the Sloan Foundation. In the end the program would have required new faculty, though, and the institutions involved never established such a program. [[Roger Schank]]'s arrival at Northwestern University in 1988 helped start the Institute for Learning Sciences.  In 1991, Northwestern initiated the first learning science doctoral program, designed by and launched by [[Roy Pea]] as its first director.  The program began accepting students in 1992, and after Pea became dean the program directorship was taken over by Brian Reiser. Since that time, a number of other high quality graduate programs in learning science began to appear around the world, and the field is continuing to be recognized as an innovative and influential area for education research and design.

''[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/authors/hlnsauth.asp The Journal of the Learning Sciences]'' was first published in 1991, with [[Janet Kolodner]] as founding editor.  Yasmin Kafai and Cindy Hmelo-Silver took over as editors in 2009, and then Iris Tabak and Joshua Radinsky took over as editors in 2013. ''[http://ijcscl.org/ The International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]'' was established as a separate journal in 2006, edited by Gerry Stahl and Freiderich Hesse. These journals, while relatively new in the field of education research, rapidly escalated and continue to place in upper ranks of the Educational Research section of the [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] impact factor rankings.

The Institute for the Learning Sciences hosted the first International Conference for the Learning Sciences (ICLS) in August 1991 at Northwestern University (edited by Lawrence Birnbaum, and published by the AACE but no longer available). The first biennial meeting of the ICLS also took place at Northwestern University, in 1994.  [http://www.isls.org The International Society of the Learning Sciences] was established in 2002.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

By integrating multiple fields, learning science extends beyond other closely related fields in distinguishable  ways.  For example, learning science extends beyond [[psychology]], in that it also accounts for, as well as contributes to [[Computing|computational]], [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] approaches to the study of learning.  Similarly, learning science draws inspiration from [[cognitive science]], and is regarded as a branch of cognitive science; however, it gives particular attention to improving [[education]] through the study, modification, and creation of new technologies and learning environments, and various interacting and [[Emergence|emergent]] factors that potentially influence the [[learning]] of humans.

Many learning science researchers employ [[design-based research]] [[methodology]].  The growing acceptance of [[design-based research]] [[methodology]] as a means for study is often viewed as a significant factor distinguishing learning science from many of the fields that contribute to it. By including [[design-based research]] within its [[methodological]] toolkit, learning science qualifies as a "design science", with characteristics in common with other design sciences that employ [[Design Science (methodology)|design science]] such as [[engineering]] and [[computer science]].   Learning science is also considered by some as having some degree of overlap with [[instructional design]], although historically the two communities have come about in different ways and at times emphasized different programs of research, as described in a special issue of the journal ''Educational Technology'' in 2004.

However, it should be emphasized that [[design-based research]] is by no means the only [[research methodology]] used in the field.  Many other methodologies—including computational modeling, experimental and quasi-experimental research, and non-interventionist [[ethnographic]]-style qualitative research [[methodologies]]—have long been and continue to be employed in learning science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7475">There is a '''[[legend]] of the Leather Bridge''' ({{lang-de|Sage von der Ledernen Brücke}}) in several regions of Germany and Switzerland. The word ''lederne'' could also have meant "ladder" or "lantern".

== Palatinate ==
[[File:BurgErfenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Erfenstein Castle from the south]]
[[File:Burgspangenbergrp.jpg|thumb|Spangenberg Castle from the north]]
According to legend, there was once a leather bridge crossing the [[Elmstein valley]] between the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatine]] castle of [[Erfenstein Castle|Erfenstein]], high above the left bank of the [[Speyerbach]] river, and a second castle, [[Spangenberg Castle (Rhineland-Palatinate)|Spangenberg]], on the opposite side of the valley. Two brothers, or at least two close friends, who visited each other frequently, decided to build the bridge in order to avoid having to take the difficult path through the valley between the two castles and over the then wild River Speyerbach.

Their friendship continued for many years. But one day the two lords, having feasted together at the Spangenberg again, began a heated argument. No doubt, an excess of wine had contributed to the situation. One word led to another and finally the Erfenstein lord, beside himself with rage, returned over the bridge, having shouted loudly, "I will never come back!" Equally furious, the lord of Spangenberg roared after him, "You don't need to; I'll see to that!" And when the lord of Erfenstein reached the middle of the bridge, Spangenberg cut the leather straps with his sword. The bridge fell into the depths and the lord of Erfenstein plunged to his death. One source records that the dispute was because one lord, who was a bachelor and the golden-haired wife of his brother had fallen in love and the bridge was used for their trysts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TNoCEYmIziUC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Story+of+the+%22Leather+Bridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nasHU-mPDcGM7AbhvIGIDQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Story%20of%20the%20%22Leather%20Bridge%22&amp;f=false ''Up the Wooden Hill: The Tale of Two Families''] by Jill Schaefer. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvZiC5ZEqQQC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sage%20von%20der%20Ledernen%20Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;f=false ''Pfälzerwald und Deutsche Weinstraße: Wandern &amp; Einkehren. 50 Touren. Mit GPS ...''] by Jörg-Thomas Titz. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.   &lt;/ref&gt;

Ever after this murder there was bitter enmity between the owners of the two castles and they damaged one another whenever they could.

The historic background to the legend is that the two castles were always owned by different overlords – initially Spangenberg to the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Speyer prince-bishop]] and Erfenstein to the [[counts of Leiningen]] – who in were always in competition with one another. When, later, their ownership changed, a conflict broke out, the Weißenburg Feud, between Elector [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] and his cousin, Duke [[Louis I of Palatinate-Zweibrücken|Louis&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]]. As a result both castles were destroyed in 1470; first, Erfenstein, and then, Spangenberg. 

Technically, to make a bridge made of soft, sagging material such as leather would not have been practicable because the height of the castles above the floor of the valley (about one hundred metres) would not be enough to span the five hundred metres between them.

== Eifel ==
A leather bridge is supposed to have linked the two castles of [[Stolzenburg (Eifel)|Stolzenburg]] and Pielstein over the [[Urft (river)|Urft]]. According to local legend, their knights lived in the lap of luxury, demanding [[socage]] from the farmers, yet allowing their children to play skittles along the bridge with loaves of bread, whilst the subjects were dying of hunger. God himself is said to have destroyed both castles by unleashing a natural disaster.

== Sauerland ==
Near [[Arnsberg]] legend has it that the devil made a leather bridge between the castles of [[Rüdenburg]] and [[Arnsberg Castle|Arnsberg]] in order to provide an escape route for the beleaguered lord of Rüdenburg and his men. This was done in gratitude for the hospitality that the Rüdenburgers had previously unwittingly shown the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h3tBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwCA ''Geschichte Arnsbergs...: Mit einer alten Ansicht von Stadt und Schloss Arnsberg nebst Abtei Wedinghausen''] by Karl Feaux de Lacroix (1895). Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nördlinger Ries ==
In the valley of [[Kartäusertal]], on the southern edge of the [[Nördlinger Ries]] there was supposed to have been a leather bridge between the three sister castles of Rauhaus, [[Hochhaus Castle|Hochhaus]] and [[Niederhaus Castle|Niederhaus]]. According to legend, whoever "cut the leather bridge" would have his castle swallowed up by the earth.

It is assumed that the ''lederne Brücke'' in this story, actually means a "bridge of lights", in other words that there was a communication link between the castles that was maintained using light signals. When, one day, Rauhaus Castle became unoccupied, the light bridge was interrupted. The castle was then plundered by the local populace and [[slighted]]; it was thus practically "swallowed by the earth".

== Thuringia ==
In [[Mellingen (Thuringia)|Mellingen]] on the River [[Ilm (Saale)|Ilm]] southeast of  [[Weimar]] there were once two castles: one on the Kapellenberg hill and the  Heinrichsburg, both of which were probably destroyed during the [[Saxon Fratricidal War]]. Both castles, separated by about 1.5 kilometres, were supposed to have been connected by a leather bridge. Especially in the older literature (around 1900) it is posited that this legend is a mythological reference to [[Edda]].

== Vogtland ==
Near [[Elsterberg]] on the [[White Elster]] are the ruins of [[Elsterberg Castle]]. A leather bridge is supposed to have joined the old castle over a distance of several hundred metres to the newer buildings.

== Lower Lusatia ==
An evil [[Wends|Wendish]] prince, or according to other [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] legends a Wendish king called ''Prebislav'' in the 10th century, is supposed to have lived in a castle in the ''Teufelslauch'' northeast of [[Friedland (Lower Lusatia)|Friedland]] in the direction of the village of ''Reudnitz''. In order to pursue his crimes as a  [[robber knight]], he left the castle over a leather bridge that he rolled out in front of him and rolled up behind him. When he robbed a man who was in league with the devil, the devil whipped up a mighty [[thunderstorm]]. A lightning bolt killed the prince and the floods caused the castle to sink into the ground. All that remains are the water-filled depressions of the ''Teufelslauch'' ("Devil's Hole").

== Switzerland ==
In [[Wileroltigen]] a tale is told of tunnels, a leather bridge and a stone grave. The castle of [[Oltigen Castle|Oltigen]] and the castle of Wileroltigen were first mentioned in 1006. Along with Hugo of Mümpelgard (Montbéliard), Count of Oltigen they came to an evil end in May 1410, according to [[Conrad Justinger]].

This article lists languages depending on their approach to [[grammatical gender]].

==No grammatical gender==
Certain language families, such as the [[Austronesian]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language families have no grammatical genders (see [[genderless language]]).

*[[Ainu language|Ainu]]
*[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]; Afrikaans has [[Afrikaans grammar#Pronouns|three gendered pronouns]], but not other grammatical gender, very similar to English.)

*[[Carolinian language|Carolinian]] ([[Austronesian]])
*[[Chamorro language|Chamoru]] ([[Austronesian]])
*[[Cebuano Language|Cebuano]]
*[[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[Sino-Tibetan Languages|Sino-Tibetan]]; modern Chinese has three gendered pronouns, but doesn’t have  grammatical gender in the sense of noun class distinctions.)
*[[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] ([[Turkic languages|Turkic]])
*[[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] ([[Turkic languages|Turkic]])
*[[English language|English]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]; English has three gendered pronouns, but no longer has grammatical gender in the sense of noun class distinctions.)
*[[Esperanto (language)|Esperanto]] ([[Constructed language|Constructed]])&lt;ref&gt;http://babel.ucsc.edu/~hank/105/Esperanto16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Estonian language|Estonian]] ([[Uralic languages|Uralic]])
*[[Fijian language|Fijian]] ([[Austronesian]])
*[[Finnish language|Finnish]] ([[Uralic languages|Uralic]])
*[[Gagauz language|Gagauz]] ([[Turkic languages|Turkic]])
*[[Georgian language|Georgian]]
*[[Gilbertese]] ([[Austronesian]])
*[[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]
*[[Guarani language|Guarani]]
*[[Haitian Creole]]

*[[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ([[Austronesian]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7Uvh-60JooC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=hawaiian+pronouns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YcZrsxf9RI&amp;sig=ga2NAbup30NXrudwZlzs-nWY4RE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPupqFp_3MAhUO3WMKHRKBAdgQ6AEIaTAN#v=onepage&amp;q=ka%20kakou&amp;f=false|title=Hawaiian Grammar|last=Elbert|first=Samuel H.|last2=Pukui|first2=Mary Kawena|publisher=University of Hawaii Press - HONOLULU|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=136-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There is a noun class system but it is flexible and determined by how the arguments in a statement interact with each other. Therefore, it doesn't constitute a grammatical gender. For example, a house is kino ʻō (o class) because you can go into it so "your house" would be "kou hale." However, if you build the house yourself, the possessive would take the kino ʻā form "kāu hale.")

==Common and neuter==
In these languages, animate nouns are predominantly of common gender, while inanimate nouns may be of either gender.
*[[Danish language|Danish]] (Danish has four gendered pronouns, but only two grammatical genders in the sense of noun classes.)
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]] (The ''masculine'' and the ''feminine'' have merged into a ''common gender'' in standard Dutch, but a distinction is still made by some when using pronouns, and in Southern-Dutch varieties. See [[Gender in Dutch grammar]].)
*[[Hittite language|Hittite]] (The Hittite "common" gender contains nouns that are either masculine or feminine in other Indo-European languages, while the "neuter" gender continues the inherited Indo-European neuter gender.)
*[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (In the [[Bergen]] dialect, and in some sociolects of [[Oslo]].)
*[[Swedish language|Swedish]] (The distinction between ''masculine'' and ''feminine'' still exists for people and some animals. Some dialects retain all three genders for all nouns.) (Swedish has four gendered pronouns, but only two grammatical genders in the sense of noun classes.)

==Animate and inanimate==

*[[Basque language|Basque]] (the declension of the nominal phrase in the locative cases differs depending on the animacy of the referent; a different and unrelated masculine/feminine distinction is present in the verbal [[allocutive agreement#Basque|allocutive agreement]])
*[[Elamite language|Elamite]]
*[[Georgian language|Georgian]] - different verbs are used in various cases (to put, to take, to have etc.), while referring to animate or inanimate objects.
*Many [[Indigenous languages of the americas|Native American languages]], including most languages of the [[Algic languages|Algic]], [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070904225112/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/rclt/StaffPages/aikhenvald%2Bdownloads/ClassifiersELL2published.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics, 1996. p.437&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] [[language family|language families]], as well as isolates such as [[Mapudungun]]
*[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]

In many such languages, what is commonly termed "animacy" may in fact be more accurately described as a distinction between human and non-human, rational and irrational, "socially active" and "socially passive" etc.

==Masculine, feminine, and neuter==

*[[Asturian language|Asturian]]
*[[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]
*[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] *
*[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] *
*[[Croatian language|Croatian]] *
*[[Czech language|Czech]] *
*[[Dutch language|Dutch]] - the ''masculine'' and the ''feminine'' have merged into a ''common gender'' in standard Dutch, but a distinction is still made by many when using pronouns.

*[[Faroese language|Faroese]]
* (West) [[West Frisian language|Frisian]]
*[[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]

*[[Latin]]
*[[Limburgish]]
*[[Low German]]
*[[Luxembourgish]]
*[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]
*[[Marathi language|Marathi]]
*[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] - the three-gender system is widely used throughout the country, except in the [[Bergen]] dialect (some sociolects in [[Oslo]] lack it as well), where the dialect allows feminine nouns to be given the corresponding masculine inflections or do not use the feminine gender at all.
*[[Old English]]
*[[Old Irish]]
*[[Old Persian]]
*[[Old Prussian]]
*[[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]
*[[Polish language|Polish]] *
*[[Romanian language|Romanian]] - the neuter gender (called ''neutru'' or sometimes ''ambigen'' in Romanian) has no separate forms of its own; neuter nouns behave like masculine nouns in the singular, and feminine in the plural. This behavior is seen in the form of agreeing adjectives and replacing pronouns. See [[Romanian nouns]].
*[[Russian language|Russian]] *
*[[Sanskrit]]
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]] *
*[[Slovak language|Slovak]]*
*[[Slovene language|Slovene]] *
*[[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]]
*[[Swedish language|Swedish]] - as in Dutch, the ''masculine'' and the ''feminine'' have merged into a ''common gender'' in standard Swedish. But many dialects, mainly in [[Dalarna|Dalecarlia]], [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] (Finland) and northern Sweden, have preserved three genders in spoken language.
*[[Telugu language|Telugu]]
*[[Tamil language|Tamil]]
*[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] *
*[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] 

Note: in Slavic languages marked with an asterisk (*), traditionally only ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter'' genders are recognized, with ''animacy'' as a separate category for the masculine and feminine (in [[East Slavic languages]]) or masculine only (elsewhere); the actual situation is similar to Czech.

[[File:Loreley rhine valley wp d schmidt 08 07.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the left bank of the [[Rhine]] at [[St. Goar]] ]]

The '''Lorelei''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒr|ə|l|aɪ}}; {{lang-de|Loreley}} {{IPA-de|loːʀəˈlaɪ, ˈloːʀəlaɪ|lang}}) is a 132&amp;nbsp;m (433&amp;nbsp;ft) high, steep [[slate]] rock on the right bank of the River [[Rhine]] in the [[Rhine Gorge]] (or [[Middle Rhine]]) at [[Sankt Goarshausen]] in Germany.

== Etymology ==

[[File:Lorelei View.JPG|thumb|250px|View of the Rhine as seen from the Lorelei]]
The name comes from the old German words ''lureln'', [[Rheinland|Rhine]] dialect for "murmuring", and the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] term ''[[ley (landform)|ley]]'' "rock". The translation of the name would therefore be: "murmur rock" or "murmuring rock". The heavy currents, and a small [[waterfall]] in the area (still visible in the early 19th century) created a murmuring sound, and this combined with the special echo the rock produces to act as a sort of amplifier, giving the rock its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loreleytal.com/hansenorden/hansen-blatt/1997nr50/loreley.htm Loreley - Ein Beitrag zur Namendeutung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615180737/http://www.loreleytal.com/hansenorden/hansen-blatt/1997nr50/loreley.htm |date=2006-06-15 }}. Accessed June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The murmuring is hard to hear today owing to the urbanization of the area. Other theories attribute the name to the many boating accidents on the rock, by combining the German verb {{wikt-lang|en|lauern}} ("to lurk, lie in wait") with the same "ley" ending, with the translation "lurking rock".

After the [[German spelling reform of 1901]], in almost all German terms, the letter "y" was changed to the letter "i", but some [[proper noun]]s have kept their "y", such as [[Bayern]], [[Speyer]], [[Spay, Germany|Spay]], [[Tholey]], ([[Rheinberg]]-)Orsoy and including [[Loreley]], which is thus the correct spelling in German.

== Original folklore and modern myth ==
[[File:Heine Bronx 1.jpg|thumb|[[Lorelei Monument]] by [[Ernst Herter]], a [[Heinrich Heine]] memorial in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]]]]
The rock and the murmur it creates have inspired various tales. An old legend envisioned dwarfs living in caves in the rock.

In 1801, German author [[Clemens Brentano]] composed his ballad ''Zu [[Bacharach]] am Rheine'' as part of a fragmentary continuation of his novel ''Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter''. It first told the story of an enchanting female associated with the rock. In the poem, the beautiful Lore Lay, betrayed by her sweetheart, is accused of bewitching men and causing their death. Rather than sentence her to death, the bishop consigns her to a nunnery. On the way thereto, accompanied by three knights, she comes to the Lorelei rock. She asks permission to climb it and view the Rhine once again. She does so and thinking that she sees her love in the Rhine, falls to her death; the rock still retained an echo of her name afterwards. Brentano had taken inspiration from [[Ovid]] and the [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] myth.

In 1824, [[Heinrich Heine]] seized on and adapted Brentano's theme in one of his most famous poems, "Die Lorelei". It describes the eponymous female as a sort of [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] who, sitting on the cliff above the Rhine and combing her golden hair, unwittingly distracted shipmen with her beauty and song, causing them to crash on the rocks. In 1837 Heine's lyrics were set to music by [[Friedrich Silcher]] in the [[art song]] "Lorelei"&lt;ref&gt;Note: A scan of the sheet music and lyrics (printed in 1859; note the spelling "[[:File:DBP 1989 1425 Friedrich Silcher.jpg|Lorelei]]") are available on the commons in three images: [[:File:Lorelei1.gif]], [[:File:Lorelei2.gif]], [[:File:Lorelei3.gif]]&lt;/ref&gt; that became well known in [[German-speaking lands]]. A [[Musical setting|setting]] by [[Franz Liszt]] was also favored and dozens of other musicians have set the poem to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Lorelei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lorelei character, although originally imagined by Brentano, passed into German popular culture in the form described in the Heine–Silcher song and is commonly but mistakenly believed to have originated in an old [[fairy tale|folk tale]]. The French writer [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] took up the theme again in his poem "La Loreley", from the collection ''[[Alcools]]'' which is later cited in [[Symphony No. 14 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 14]] (3rd movement) of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].

'''Marathi literature''' is the body of literature of [[Marathi Language|Marathi]], an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language spoken mainly in the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]] and written in the [[Devanagari]] script. 

==History==
Yadav period is significant in the history of maharashtra. 
Marathi literature is the oldest of the Indo-Aryan literatures, dating to about 1000 CE. In the 13th century, two Brahmanical sects arose, the Mahanubhava and the Varakari Panth, that both shaped Marathi literature significantly. The latter sect was perhaps the more productive, for it became associated with bhakti movements, particularly with the popular cult of Vithoba at Pandharpur. It was out of this tradition that the great names of early Marathi literature came: Jnaneshvara, in the 13th century; Namdev, his younger contemporary, some of whose devotional songs are included in the holy book of the Sikhs, the Adi Granth; and the 16th-century writer Eknath, whose best-known work is a Marathi version of the 11th book of the Bhagavata-purana. Among the bhakti poets of Maharashtra, the most famous is Tukaram, who wrote in the 16th century. A unique contribution of Marathi is the tradition of povadas, heroic stories popular among a martial people. This tradition was particularly vital during the 17th century, when Shivaji, the great Maratha king, led his armies against the might of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

=== Yadava period ===
[[File:Jnandev.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dnyaneshwar]] as imagined  by the Ravi Varma press]]
Epigraphic evidence suggests that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, the earliest records of actual literature in Marathi appear only in the late 13th century.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=54}} The early Marathi literature emerged during the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Seuna (Yadava)]] rule, because of which some scholars have theorized that it was produced with support from the Yadava rulers.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=74,86}} The Yadavas did regard Marathi as a significant language for connecting with the general public,{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=x}} and Marathi replaced Kannada and Sanskrit as the dominant language of the inscriptions during the last half century of the Yadava rule.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=53}} However, there is no evidence that the Yadava royal court directly supported the production of Marathi literature with state funds.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=74}}

The early Marathi literature was mostly religious and philosophical in nature,&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"&gt;{{cite book | editor =  Nagendra |author1=Kusumavati Deshpande  |author2=Sadashiva Shivaram Bhave | title=Indian Literature | year = 1988 | chapter = Marathi | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC&amp;pg=PA202 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | publisher=Prabhat Prakashan | pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was composed by the saint-poets belonging to [[Mahanubhava]] and [[Warkari]] sects. During the reign of the last three Yadava kings, a great deal of literature in verse and prose, on astrology, medicine, [[Puranas]], [[Vedanta]], kings and courtiers were created. ''Nalopakhyan'', ''Rukmini Swayamvar'' and Shripati's ''Jyotishratnamala'' (1039) are a few examples.

Bhaskarbhatta Borikar of the Mahanubhava sect is the first known poet to have composed hymns in Marathi.&lt;ref name="Datta2006"&gt;{{cite book | author=Amaresh Datta | title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1624 | accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2006 | publisher=Sahitya Akademi | isbn=978-81-260-1194-0 | page=1624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dnyaneshwar]] (1275–1296) was the first Marathi literary figure who had wide readership and profound influence.&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"/&gt; His major works are ''[[Amrutanubhav]]'' and ''[[Bhavarth Deepika]]'' (popularly known as ''Dnyaneshwari''). ''Bhavarth Deepika'' is a 9000-couplets long commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]].

[[Namdev]], the  Bhakti saint and contemporary of Dnyaneshwar is the other significant literary figure from this era. Namdev composed religious songs in Marathi as well as [[Hindi]]; some of his Hindi compositions are included in the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].

Another early Marathi writer was [[Mukundaraja]], who wrote ''Vivekasindhu'' and ''Paramamrita''. Both the works deal with the [[Advaita]] philosophy.&lt;ref name="Shrikant2009"&gt;{{cite book | author= Shrikant Prasoon | title=Indian saints and sages | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvJa5nTi3VsC&amp;pg=PA139 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | year= 2009 | publisher=Pustak Mahal | isbn=978-81-223-1062-7 | pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some earlier scholars dated him to the 12th century, and considered ''Vivekasindhu'' as the first literary book in Marathi, dating it to 1188. However, most linguistic historians now date Mukundaraja to 14th century or later: the ''Vivekasindhu'' was likely written after ''Lilacharita'' and ''Dnyaneshwari''.{{sfn|Christian Lee Novetzke|2016|p=88}}

=== Sultanate period ===

There was relatively little activity in Marathi in the early days of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] (1347–1527) and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] (1527–1686). The Warkari saint-poet [[Eknath]] (1533–1599), the main successor of Dnyaneshwar, was a major Marathi literary figure during this period. He made available an authentic, edited version of Dnyaneshwari, which had been forgotten after the Islamic invasion of Deccan.&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"/&gt; He also wrote several [[abhang]]s (devotional poems), narratives and minor works that dealt with the [[Bhagavata Purana]]  He wrote ''[[Eknathi Bhagwat]]'', ''[[Bhavarth Ramayan]]'', ''Rukmini Swayamwar Hastamalak'', and ''[[Bharud]]''. Dasopant was another minor but notable poet from this era.&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"/&gt; Mukteshwar (1574-1645), the grandson of Eknath, too, wrote several works in Marathi including a translation of the epic [[Mahabharata]].

''[[Krista Purana]]'', written by the Goa-based Christian missionary [[Thomas Stephens (Jesuit)|Thomas Stephens]], was first published in 1616. It is written in a mix of Marathi and Konkani languages, and the first copy was printed in the Roman script, and tells the story of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Winand1994"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Winand M. Callewaert | author2=Rupert Snell | title=According to Tradition: Hagiographical Writing in India | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrMwdEqHLzEC&amp;pg=PA164 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | year=1994 | publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag | isbn=978-3-447-03524-8 | pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maratha period ===
[[File:Tukaram by Raja Ravi Varma.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tukaram]]]]

The [[Maratha]]s, the Marathi-speaking natives, formed their own kingdom in the 17th century. The development of the Marathi literature accelerated during this period. Although their leader, [[Shivaji]], was formally crowned as the king in 1674, he had been the de facto ruler of a large area in Western Maharashtra for some time.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2017}} [[Tukaram]] and [[Samarth Ramdas]], who were contemporaries of Shivaji, were the well-known poets of the early Maratha period.&lt;ref name="Sadarangani2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Neeti M. Sadarangani | title=Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVQrKJbJ2JIC&amp;pg=PA45 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | year=2004 | publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons | isbn=978-81-7625-436-6 | pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tukaram]] (1608–1650) was the most prominent Marathi [[Varkari]] spiritual poet identified with the [[Bhakti movement]], and had a great influence on the later Maratha society. His contemporary, [[Samarth Ramdas]] composed ''[[Dasbodh]]'' and ''Manache Shlok'' in Marathi.

In the 18th century, several well-known works like Yatharthadeepika (by [[Vaman Pandit]]), ''Naladamayanti Swayamvara'' (by [[Raghunath Pandit]]), ''Pandava Pratap'', ''Harivijay'', ''Ramvijay'' (by Shridhar Pandit) and ''Mahabharata'' (translation by [[Moropant]]) were produced. The historical section of the old Marathi literature contained the [[Bakhar]]s and the ''Katava''s. Krishna Dayarnava and Sridhar were other leading poets during the [[Peshwa]] rule.&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"/&gt; [[Mahipati]], the author who wrote the biographies of the Bhakti Saints also belonged to this era.

=== British Period ===
[[File:Sarvajanik Satya Dharma Pustak.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of the book ''Sarvajanik Satya Dharma Pustak'' by [[Jyotiba Phule]].]]
The [[British Raj|British colonial period]] (also known as the Modern Period)  saw standardisation of Marathi grammar through the efforts of the Christian missionary [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]]. Carey's dictionary had fewer entries and Marathi words were in Devanagari script instead of the Modi script prevalent at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Chavan, Dilip. (2013). “Language Politics: Translation of Coercion into Consent”, Language Politics under Colonialism: Caste, Class and Language Pedagogy in Western India, Cambridge Scholars, 71-135&lt;/ref&gt; Carey also translated the new and old testament of the bible into Marathi in 1811 and 1820 respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=George|title=The life of William Carey : shoe-maker and missionary|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781108029186|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZLa787pY5gMC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=%22William+carey%22+marathi+#v=snippet&amp;q=%22William%20carey%22%20marathi%20bible&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionaries was compiled by Captain [[James Thomas Molesworth]] and Major [[Thomas Candy]] in 1831. The book is still in print nearly two centuries after its publication.,&lt;ref name="Nagendra_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James, Molesworth, Thomas Candy|first=Narayan G Kalelkar|title=Molesworth's, Marathi-English dictionary|year=1857 |edition=2nd &lt;!-- |year=1975 corrected reprint --&gt;|publisher=J.C.

The colonial authorities also worked on standardizing Marathi under the leadership of [[James Thomas Molesworth|Molesworth]] . They used Brahmins of [[Pune]] for this task and adopted the [[Sanskrit]] dominated dialect spoken by this caste in the city as the standard dialect for Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chavan|first1=Dilip|title=Language politics under colonialism : caste, class and language pedagogy in western India|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=978-1443842501|pages=136–184|edition=first|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zuIxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=pune+standard+dialect#v=snippet&amp;q=poona%20marathi&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Christian missionaries introduced the Western forms to the Marathi literature. 
{{#tag:ref|According to Hartmut Scharte, Professor Emeritus of Sanskrit, University of California, Los Angeles, USA vide his book "A History of Indian Literature - Grammatical Literature", the author of the first Marathi Grammar was Venkata Madhava, who was a lecturer in Fort St. George College, Madras (now Chennai). Venkata Madhava's three works on Marathi (as was spoken by the then large Maratha colony of Tanjore) exist only in the autographs of the author or his assistant Bhima Pandita. His Marathi Grammar book "महाराष्ट्र प्रयोग चंद्रिका" was written cir. 1827. It has 227 sutras in Samskrt and is accompanied by a Samskrt commentary, a Marathi commentary and Marathi illustrations. The Samskrt section is written in Devnagari script and the Marathi in Modi script. The grammar which generally follows the Siddhanta Kaumudi in its design, was probably meant to introduce Marathi to the neighbouring Tamil speakers.|group=note}}

Marathi at this time was efficiently aided by Marathi Drama. Here, there also was a different genre called 'Sangit Natya' or Musicals. The first play was V.A. Bhave's Sita Swayamvar in 1843 Later Kirloskar (1843–85) and G.B. Deval (1854-19l6) brought a romantic aroma and social content. But Krishnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar (1872-1948) with his banned play Kichaka-Vadh (1910) set the trend of political playwriting. These were followed by stalwarts like [[Ram Ganesh Gadkari]] and [[Prahlad Keshav Atre]].

The modern poets like [[Keshavsuta]], Balakavi, Govindagraj, and the poets of [[Ravi Kiran Mandal]] (such as [[Madhav Julian]]) wrote poetry which was influenced by the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] and Victorian English poetry. It was largely sentimental and lyrical. [[Prahlad Keshav Atre]], the renowned satirist and a politician wrote a parody of this sort of poetry in his collection ''Jhenduchi Phule''.

[[Sane Guruji]] (1899–1950) contributed to the children's literature in Marathi. His major works are  ''[[Shyamchi Aai]], ''Astik'' and ''Gode Shevata''. He translated and simplified many Western Classics and published them in a book of stories titled ''Gode Goshti'' (Sweet Stories).

=== Beginning of journalism ===

On January 6, 1832, [[Balshastri Jambhekar]] of the [[Elphinstone College]] began ''Darpan'', the first Marathi-English fortnightly magazine.&lt;ref name="Vilanilam2005"&gt;{{cite book | author=John V. Vilanilam | title=Mass Communication In India: A Sociological Perspective | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBU6pN7toHsC&amp;pg=PA57 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | date=5 November 2005 | publisher=Sage Publications | isbn=978-0-7619-3372-4 | pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 1841, Govind Vithal Kunte began ''Prabhakar''. Kunte was the first professional Marathi journalist. Prabhakar eulogised Indian art and culture. ''Jnyanodaya'' was begun in 1842 by Christian missionaries in Western India. ''Jnyan Prakash'' was started on 12 February 1849 in Pune. It was edited by Krishnaraj Trimbak Ranade. It was a weekly till 1904, when it became a daily. It ceased publication in 1951. It was a prestigious journal and supported education and social reform. Hari Narayan Apte, a famous Marathi novelist served as its editor. Some of its contributors included Mahadev Govind Ranade and Gopal Krishna Gokhale.

In the early years of Marathi journalism, most periodicals were concerned with spreading education and knowledge. These include ''Jaganmitra'' (from Ratnagiri), ''Shubh Suchak'' (from Satara), ''Vartaman Dipika'', ''Vartaman Sangrah''. In 1862, ''Induprakash'' was begun in Bombay (now Mumbai). It was a bilingual journal, edited by M.G. Ranade. It criticised orthodoxy and was the mouthpiece of many social reforms. In 1877, [[Jyotiba Phule]] and Krishnarao Bhaskar began ''[[Deenbandhu]]'', as part of the Dalit upliftment movement. Deenabandhu was the organ of the Satyashodhak Samaj founded by Phule.

[[File:Kesari Editorial.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'']]
On 4 January 1881, [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] began ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'', along with [[Gopal Ganesh Agarkar]]. In 1887, Agarkar left to start ''[[Sudharak|sujeet Sudharak]]'' (bilingual) along with Gopal Krishna Gokhale. After Agarkar's death in 1895, it ceased publication. In 1889, ''K. Navalkar'' started the weekly Vartahar to highlight atrocities committed by Europeans. In 1890, Hari Narayan Apte began ''Karmanuk'' as a family entertainment paper. It contained articles on science. Also in 1890, Anandrao Ramachandra Dharandhar started ''Bhoot'' published every new and full moon day. It was the first Marathi paper to carry cartoons on political and social matters. It was very popular but ceased publication in 1904.

==Present times (1947- ==

[[Vishnu Sakharam Khandekar]] (1889–1976)'s ''Yayati'' won him the [[Jnanpith Award]] for 1975. He also wrote many other novels, short stories, essays etc. His major works are ''Don Dhruv'' (Two Poles), ''[[Ulka]]'' (Meteorite), ''[[Krounchavadh]]'', ''[[Jalalela Mohar]]'', ''[[Amrutvel]]''.

Marathi drama flourished in the 1960s and 1970s, with literary figures like Vasant Kanetkar, [[Kusumagraj]] and [[Vijay Tendulkar]]. 

The major paradigm shift {{citation needed|reason=why you say so|date=June 2016}} in Marathi literature sensibilities  began in the forties with the  modernist poetry of B.S. Mardhekar. In the mid fifties, the [[little magazine]] movement gained momentum. It published writings which were non-conformist, radical and experimental. [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]] literary movement also gained strength due to the little magazine movement. This radical movement was influenced by the philosophy of [[Babasaheb Ambedkar]] and challenged the literary establishment which was largely middle class, urban, and upper [[caste]] people. The little magazine movement threw up many noted writers. [[Bhalchandra Nemade]] is a well-known novelist, critic and poet. Sharad Rane is a well-known child literary figure. The notable poets include [[Arun Kolatkar]], [[Dilip Chitre]], [[Namdeo Dhasal]], [[Vasant Abaji Dahake]] and [[Manohar Oak]]. [[Bhau Padhye]], [[Vilas Sarang]], Shyam Manohar, [[Suhas Shirvalkar]] and Visharm Bedekar are well known fiction writers.&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nalini Natarajan|author2=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|author3=Shripad D. Joshi|title=Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28778-7|pages=207–233|chapter=8 Twentieth Century Marathi Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major shift sensibility began in the nineties with the poems and criticism of Shridhar Tilve and  the  poetry of poets associated with Saushthav, Abhidhanantar and Shabadavedh. In the post nineties, this 'new little magazine movement' gained momentum and poets like Shridhar Tilve who stood against postmodernism and nativism and poets like [[Manya Joshi]], [[Hemant Divate]], Sachin Ketkar, [[Mangesh Narayanrao Kale]], [[Saleel Wagh]], Mohan Borse, Nitin Kulkarni, Nitin Arun Kulkarni, [[Varjesh Solanki]],  Sandeep Deshpande, Vasant Gurjar who touched the new areas of post-modern life. The poetry collections brought out by Abhidhanantar Prakashan, Time and Space, Popular Prakashan, Navta Prakashan and the regular issues of the magazine Abhidhanantar and IRREGULAR issues of Saushthav, Shabdvedh are taking Marathi poetry to the global standards.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2015}} Another leading wave in contemporary Marathi poetry is the poetry of new dalit wave poets like Arun Kale, Bhujang Meshram and new deshi wave poets like Pravin Bandekar, Shrikant Deshmukh and Veerdhaval Parab.

Marathi science fiction has a rich heritage and boasts of modern complex stories. The  known Marathi science fiction authors are Dr. [[Jayant Narlikar]], Dr [[Bal Phondke]], Subodh Javadekar, Niranjan Ghate, and [[Laxman Londhe]].

Over the last century or so, a number of  producing encyclopedias have been produced in marathi. These include . [[Shridhar Venkatesh Ketkar|Shreedhar Venkatesh Ketkar's]] 'Dnyaankosh', Siddheshwarshastri Chitrao's 'Charitra Kosh', [[Mahadevshastri Joshi|Mahadevshastri Joshi's]] 'Bharatiy Sanskrutikosh', and [[Laxmanshastri Balaji Joshi|Laxmanshastri Joshi's]] 'Dharmakosh' and '[[Marathi Vishwakosh]]'.
The Marathi theatre was complimented by Marathi films which did not enjoy a continuous success. Starting with [[V. Shantaram]] and before him the pioneer [[Dadasaheb Phalke]] (during the British period), Marathi cinema went on to influence contemporary Hindi cinema. Marathi language as spoken by people here was throughout influenced by drama and cinema along with contemporary literature.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2015}}

=== Dalit Literature ===
It was  in 1958, that the term "Dalit literature" was used for the first time, when the first conference of ''Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Sangha'' (Maharashtra Dalit Literature Society) was held at [[Mumbai]], a movement inspired  by 19th century social reformer,  [[Jyotiba Phule]] and eminent dalit leader, Dr. [[Bhimrao Ambedkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of twentieth-century literatures of India |last=Natarajan |first=Nalini  |authorlink= |author2=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|chapter= Chap 13: Dalit Literature in Marathi by Veena Deo|year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-28778-3|page=363 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=Dalit+literature&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Dalit%20literature&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''{{lang|sw|Mungu ibariki Afrika|italic=no}}'''" ({{Lang-en|"God bless Africa"}}) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Tanzania]]. It is the [[Swahili language]] version of [[Enoch Sontonga]]'s popular hymn "{{lang|xh|[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]|italic=no}}".&lt;ref name=citizen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/oped/National-symbols--What-happened-to-the-giraffe-/-/1840568/2029084/-/mikixd/-/index.html |title=National symbols? What happened to the giraffe? |publisher=The Citizen |date=1990-03-21 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word {{lang|sw|Mungu}} in Swahili means [[God]] and the title of the anthem therefore translates as "God bless Africa".

== History ==
"Mungu ibariki Afrika" was translated and became the anthem of [[Tanganyika]]. It was essentially assigned&lt;!--the rights were assigned?  authorship of the song is attributed?--&gt; to [[Enoch Sontonga]], who died in 1905. Mungu ibariki Afrika used the tune to "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" with a Swahili translation of the words. It is not known who composed the lyrics but it is known that it was [[Samuel Mqhayi]] and Enoch Sontonga who created the early versions used by the [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/tz.htm| title=Tanzania: Mungu ibariki Afrika | publisher=NationalAnthems.info | accessdate=2014-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the tune has been assigned&lt;!--diction, again--&gt; to Sontonga it is thought that the tune was originally written by [[Joseph Parry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18770309 Joseph Parry's Te Deum: Premiere for lost composition], James McLaren, "012, BBC News, retrieved 22 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citizen/&gt;

===Swahili translation===
It was first performed in Swahili at a ceremony on 8 December 1961 following the independence of Tanganyika from the [[British Empire]]. "Mungu ibariki Afrika" was composed to replace the British national anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]" as the national anthem of Tanganyika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =James   | last =Taylor | title =The Political Development of Tanganyika| publisher = Stanford University Press | edition =  | year = 1963| isbn = 0804701474 | page = 217}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Tanganyika the first African nation to adopt the tune of "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" as its national anthem.&lt;ref name=pic&gt;{{cite book | first =Bev   | last =Pritchett | title =Tanzania in Pictures| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| edition =  | year = 2007| isbn = 0822585715 | page = 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Tanganyika formed a union with [[Zanzibar]], which created the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar (later renamed to Tanzania). The newly united country adopted "Mungu ibariki Afrika" as its national anthem instead of Zanzibar's anthem.&lt;ref name=pic /&gt; Tanzania's use of "Mungu ibariki Afrika" led the way for other African countries such as [[Zimbabwe]], [[Ciskei]] and [[Transkei]] adopted "Nkosi Sikelel' Afrika", in parts, as their national anthems. South Africa where the song comes from use only some of the words, Zambia uses only the tune and other countries have now abandoned its use.&lt;ref name=na /&gt; "Mungu ibariki Afrika" was inspired by the [[African National Congress]]'s use of "[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]" ("God Bless Africa") as its party song after its use at [[Ohlange High School]]. The ANC anthem led to "Mungu ibariki Afrika" being selected as the national anthem of Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thabombekifoundation.org.za/Pages/Thabo-Mbeki-at-the-University-of-Dar-es-Salaam,-in-honour-of-the-Centenary-of-the-ANC-22.aspx |title=Address of the Patron of the TMF, Thabo Mbeki, at the University of Dar-es-Salaam, in honour of the Centenary of the ANC: 22 November, 2012 |publisher=Thabombekifoundation.org.za |date= |accessdate=2014-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195445/http://www.thabombekifoundation.org.za/Pages/Thabo-Mbeki-at-the-University-of-Dar-es-Salaam,-in-honour-of-the-Centenary-of-the-ANC-22.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historymatters.co.za/a-tribute-to-enoch-sontonga-nkosi-sikelel-i-afrika-2/ |title=A Tribute To Enoch Sontonga: "Nkosi Sikelel’ I-Afrika" |publisher=History Matters |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130144814/http://historymatters.co.za/a-tribute-to-enoch-sontonga-nkosi-sikelel-i-afrika-2/ |archivedate=30 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Jay   | last =Heale | title = Tanzania| publisher = Marshall Cavendish | edition =  | year = 2010| isbn = 0761434178 | page = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mungu ibariki Afrika" is also used as a hymn requesting Tanzania remain united and independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thefoundation.or.tz/index.php/en/reports-publications/publications?download=31:july-sept2013 |title=FCS enables multitudes to participate in draft constitution discussion |first=Jacob |last=Mugini |journal=The Foundation |publisher=The Foundation for Civil Society |issue=July–September 2013 |year=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanganyika and later Tanzania had concerns about religious unrest between [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s after independence. This was because of [[Christianity|Christian]] references in government proceedings and official oaths. The wording of "Mungu ibariki Afrika" was intended to help offset this by being inclusive of the different religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Ludwig   | last =Freider | title =Church and State in Tanzania: Aspects of Changing in Relationships, 1961-1994| publisher = BRILL, | edition =  | year = 1999| isbn = 9004115064 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mungu ibariki Afrika" is sung daily at Tanzanian schools. A circular issued in 1998 by the nation's [[Ministry of Education and Vocational Training|Commissioner of Education]] recommended the singing of the national anthem as a way to promote [[patriotism]] in Tanzania's youth.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{cite web|author=17 June 2013 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201306170026.html |title=Tanzania: Dons Fault Court Over Suspension of Students (Page 1 of 2) |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2013-06-17 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a legal issue arose over the anthem after students who were members of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] refused to sing the song at their primary and secondary schools in [[Mbozi District]], [[Mbeya Region]]. Five students were expelled from school and 122 others received other forms of discipline for their refusal.&lt;ref name=aa/&gt; They objected to singing the anthem because they believed it suggested obeisance to the [[flag of Tanzania]] before God.&lt;ref name=cit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/magazine/sound-living/-/1843780/1958398/-/s1lvpy/-/index.html |title=How much of our religion must we bring to school? |work=The Citizen |first=Esther |last=Kibakaya |date=18 August 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2010, the [[High Court of Tanzania]] ruled that the schools' disciplinary actions were appropriate.&lt;ref name=aa /&gt;&lt;ref name=cit /&gt; The [[Court of Appeal of Tanzania]] overturned that ruling on 12 July 2013, indicating that the disciplinary action taken by the school was unlawful and stating that there was no obligation to sing the national anthem in Tanzanian law.&lt;ref name=cit /&gt;

Fine [[linen]] muslin was formerly known as '''sindon'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st&amp;nbsp;ed. "sindon, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the traditional art of weaving ''[[Jamdani]]'' muslin in Bangladesh was included in the list of [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Jamdani recognised as intangible cultural heritage by Unesco |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/jamdani-recognised-as-intangible-cultural-heritage-by-unesco/ |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and history ==
'''Muslin''' ([[AmE]]: Muslin gauze) from French ''mousseline'', from Italian mussolina, from Mussolo ‘Mosul’ ([[Mosul]], Iraq, where European traders are said to have first encountered the cloth). Although this view has the fabric named after the city where Europeans first encountered it (Mosul), the fabric is believed to have originated in Dhakeshwari, now Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="ghosh"&gt;{{citation |last1=Ghosh |first1=G. K. |last2=Ghosh |first2=Shukla |date=1995 |title=Indian Textiles: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xbRLoG5MAkC&amp;pg=PA35 |publisher=APH Publishing |pages=35– |isbn=978-81-7024-706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman made note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhmi in Arabic). Bengali muslin was traded throughout the Muslim world, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. In many Islamic regions, such as in Central Asia, the cloth was named ''Daka,'' after the city of Dhaka.&lt;ref name="Eaton1996"/&gt;

Subsequently, the word Muslin found its place in various European languages as French ''mousseline'', Italian ''mussolina'' etc.,

During the [[Roman period]], muslin was the foremost export of [[Masulipatam]], in Andhra Pradesh. Bengali khadi muslin was so prized by well-dressed ladies of Rome that according to Roman legend, "an ounce of muslin used to sell in Rome for an ounce of gold".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |publisher=G.

In 1298, Marco Polo described the cloth in his book ''The Travels.'' He said it was made in Mosul, Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Polo|Polo, Marco]].

Under British rule, the British East India company could not compete with the local Muslin with their own export of cloth to India. Muslin production was repressed and the knowledge eradicated. There is a story that weavers were systematically rounded up and their hands mutilated with removal of their thumbs, but this seems to be a misreading of a report from 1772 that spinners were treated "with such injustice that instances have been known of their cutting off their thumbs, to prevent their being forced to wind silk."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Bolts |first1=William |date=1772 |title=Considerations on India affairs |publisher=J Almon |page=194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Edwards |first=Michael |date=June 1976 |title=Growth of the British Cotton Trade 1780-1815 |publisher=Augustus M Kelley Pubs |page=37 |isbn=0-678-06775-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Marshall |first=P.

John |date=2013 |title=Many avatars : challenges, achievements and the future |location=[S.l.] |publisher=Friesenpress |isbn=1-4602-2893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During British colonial rule in the eighteenth century, the Bengali muslin industry was ruthlessly suppressed by various colonial policies,&lt;ref name="Bolts1772"&gt;{{citation |last=Bolts |first=William |authorlink=William Bolts |date=1772 |title=Considerations on India affairs: particularly respecting the present state of Bengal and its dependencies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98lNAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Printed for J. Almon |pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; which favored imports of industrially manufactured textiles from Britain. Brutality to muslin weavers was intense, William Bolts noting in 1772 that "instances have been known of their cutting off their thumbs to prevent their being forced to wind silk."&lt;ref name="Bolts1772"/&gt;{{rp|194}}{{Repetition inline|date=October 2018}} As a result, the quality of muslin suffered greatly and its finesse was nearly lost for two centuries.

There have been various attempts at reviving the muslin industry in modern Bangladesh. In present day, many different types of muslins are produced in many different places, including Dhaka.

The word muslin is also used colloquially. In the United Kingdom, many sheer cotton fabrics are called muslin, while in the United States, muslin sometimes refers to a firm cloth for everyday use, which in the UK and Australia is known as calico.

== Uses ==
=== Dress-making and sewing ===
[[File:Muslin-Dresses-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Advantages of wearing Muslin Dresses!'' (1802), [[James Gillray]] caricatured a hazard of untreated muslin: its flammability.]]

When [[sewing]] clothing, a [[dressmaker]] may test the fit of a garment, using an inexpensive muslin fabric before cutting pieces from expensive fabric, thereby avoiding potential costly mistakes. This garment is often called a "muslin," and the process is called "making a muslin." In this context, "muslin" has become the generic term for a test or fitting garment, regardless of what it is made from.

Muslin is also often used as a backing or lining for quilts, and thus can often be found in wide widths in the quilting sections of fabric stores.

=== Shellac polishing ===
Muslin is used as a French polishing pad.

=== Culinary ===

* In a funnel when decanting fine wine or port to prevent sediment from entering the decanter
* To separate liquid from mush (for example, to make apple juice: wash, chop, boil, mash, then filter by pouring the mush into a muslin bag suspended over a jug)
* To retain a liquidy solid (for example, in home cheese-making, when the milk has curdled to a gel, pour into a muslin bag and squash between two saucers (upside down under a brick) to squeeze out the liquid whey from the cheese curd)

Muslin is the material for the traditional [[pudding cloth|cloth]] wrapped around a [[Christmas pudding]].

Muslin is the fabric wrapped around the items in [[barmbrack]], a fruitcake traditionally eaten at Halloween in Ireland.

Muslin is used when making traditional [[Kava culture#Fiji|Fijian Kava]] as a filter.

[[beekeeping|Beekeepers]] use muslin to filter melted beeswax to clean it of particles and debris.

=== Theater and photography ===
Muslin is often the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the background of [[set construction|sets]] and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated properly, can be made translucent.

It also holds dyes well. It is often used to create nighttime scenes because when dyed, it often gets a wavy look with the color varying slightly, such that it resembles a night sky. Muslin [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinks]] after it is painted or sprayed with water, which is desirable in some common techniques such as [[Flats (theater)|soft-covered flats]].

In video production as well, muslin is used as a cheap [[Chroma key|greenscreen or bluescreen]], either pre-colored or painted with latex paint (diluted with water). It is commonly used as a background for the [[chroma key]] technique.

Muslin is the most common backdrop material used by photographers for formal portrait backgrounds. These backdrops are usually painted, most often with an abstract mottled pattern.

In the early days of [[silent film]]-making, and up until the late 1910s, movie studios did not have the elaborate lights needed to illuminate indoor sets, so most interior scenes were sets built outdoors with large pieces of muslin hanging overhead to diffuse sunlight.

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Semplici medicamenti per i soldati.jpg|thumb|A [[first-aid]] packet of 5m of "hydrophilic muslin", given to Italian soldiers in World War I]]
Surgeons use muslin [[gauze]] in [[cerebrovascular]] [[neurosurgery]] to wrap around [[aneurysm]]s or intracranial vessels at risk for bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pool |first=J. |date=1976 |title=Muslin gauze in intracranial vascular surgery. Technical note. |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=127–128 |doi=10.3171/jns.1976.44.1.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought is that the gauze reinforces the artery and helps prevent rupture. It is often used for aneurysms that, due to their size or shape, cannot be microsurgically clipped or coiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Berger |first1=C. |last2=Hartmann |first2=M. |last3=Wildemann |first3=B. |date=March 2003 |title=Progressive visual loss due to a muslinoma – report of a case and review of the literature |journal=European Journal of Neurology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=153–158 |doi=10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00546.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early aviation ===
The Wright Brothers, in search of a light and strong covering for their gliders and the 1903 Wright Flyer (the first heavier-than-air powered aircraft), selected Pride of the West muslin as a covering for wings and control surfaces. A large piece of the fabric used on the original Wright Flyer (1903) was passed down to Wright descendants. The fabric was made available to The Wright Experience&lt;ref&gt;The Wright Experience&lt;/ref&gt;(reproduction of the Wright gliders and Flyer and reenactment of the first flight on its 100th anniversary) for examination as it was no longer commercially available a century after its use by the Wrights. To create an authentic modern reproduction of the original fabric, three different companies were needed which produced the thread, the weaving, and the finishing).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5956">A '''naval tradition''' is a [[tradition]] that is, or has been, observed in one or more [[Navy|navies]].

[[File:Dzwon ORP Iskra II.jpeg|thumb|right|120px|Ship bell of [[Ship prefix|ORP]] Iskra II - [[Polish Navy]] school tall ship]]
A basic tradition is that all ships commissioned in a navy are referred to as [[Ship|ships]] rather than [[Marine vessel|vessels]], with the exception of [[submarines]], which are known as [[Boat|boats]]. The prefix on a ship's name indicates that it is a commissioned ship. For example,
USS is an acronym which expands to United States Ship; in the Royal Navy, HMS expands to Her Majesty's Ship (or when a King reigns, His Majesty's Ship); in the Indian Navy, INS expands to Indian Navy Ship, and so forth.

An important tradition on board British naval vessels (and later those of the U.S. and other nations) has been the [[ship's bells|ship's bell]]. This was historically used to mark the passage of time on board a vessel, including the duration of four-hour watches. They were also employed as warning devices in heavy fog, and for alarms and ceremonies. The bell was originally kept polished first by the ship's cook, then later by a person belonging to that division of the ship's personnel.

Another important tradition is that of Piping someone aboard the ship. This was originally used to give orders on warships when shouted orders could not have been heard. The piping was done by the ship's boatswain and therefore the instrument is known as the [[boatswain's call|boatswain's Pipe or boatswain's call]]. The two tones it gives and the number of blasts given off, signify the order given. It is also used in a ceremonial way, i.e., to "pipe" someone aboard the ship&amp;nbsp;— usually captains, including the ship's captain, and more senior officers.

By English tradition, ships have been referred to as a "she". However, it was long considered bad luck to permit women to sail on board naval vessels. To do so would invite a terrible storm that would wreck the ship.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The only women that were welcomed on board were [[figurehead (object)|figureheads]] mounted on the prow of the ship. In spite of these views, some women did serve on board naval vessels, usually as wives of crewmembers.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Image:Soldiers firing a 40mm saluting cannon.JPEG|thumb|right|225px|A cannon on a naval vessel's deck fired during the arrival of a dignitary.]]
The custom of [[Salute#Naval cannon fire|firing cannon salutes]] originated in the British [[Royal Navy]]. When a cannon is fired, it partially disarms the ship, so firing a cannon for no combat reason showed respect and trust. The British, as the dominant naval power, compelled the ships of weaker nations to make the first salute. As the tradition evolved, the number of cannon fired became an indication of the rank of the official being saluted.

Commissioned ships and submarines of the [[Royal Navy]] wear the [[White Ensign]] at the stern whilst alongside during daylight hours and at the main-mast whilst under way. When alongside, the ''Union Jack'' as distinct from the Union Flag, is flown from the [[jackstaff]] at the bow, but can only be flown underway in special circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-use.html#sea |title=Use of the Union Jack at Sea |publisher=Flags of the World |accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fleet review]] is a tradition of assembling the fleet before the monarch. In June 2005, to mark the bi-centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, 167 ships of the RN, and 30 other nations, were present at a fleet review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article537597.ece |title=French top gun at Fleet Review |publisher=The Times |date=2005-06-26 |accessdate=2007-07-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naval [[salute]] differs from the military salute in that it has the palm turned down, rather than outwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/info/faqs_1.html#salute |title=FAQs; Salutes |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RN has evolved a rich volume of [[slang]], known as ''Jack-speak''. Nowadays the British sailor is usually ''Jack'' (or ''Jenny'') rather than the more historical ''[[Jack Tar]]''. Nicknames for a British [[sailor]], applied by others, include ''Matelot'' (pronounced "matlow"), and ''[[Alternative words for British|Limey]]'' - mainly redundant in use within the Royal Navy. Royal Marines are fondly known as ''Bootnecks'' or often just as ''Royals''.&lt;ref name="jackspeak"/&gt;
[[Nickname]]s for the service include ''The Andrew'' or ''Andrew Miller'' (of uncertain origin, possibly after a zealous [[Impressment|press ganger]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Admiralty Manual of Seamanship |year=1964 |publisher=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17840 |title=FAQs;Royal Navy's nickname |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629230746/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17840 |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Senior Service'' as the oldest of the military branches.&lt;ref name="jackspeak"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jolly |first=Rick |title=Jackspeak |publisher=Maritime Books Dec 2000 |isbn=0-9514305-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3804 |title=Naval Slang |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702221448/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3804 |archivedate=2007-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[Merchant_Navy#British_Merchant_Navy|Merchant Navy]] the Royal Navy is known as ''The Grey Funnel Line''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Prose ''Tristan''}}
The '''Prose ''Tristan''''' is an adaptation of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] story into a long [[prose]] [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]], and the first to tie the subject entirely into the arc of the [[Arthurian legend]]. It was also the first major Arthurian prose cycle commenced after the widely popular [[Lancelot-Grail]] (Vulgate Cycle), which influenced especially the later portions of the Prose ''Tristan''. 

According to the prologue, the first part of the book (i.e. everything before the Grail material) is attributed to the otherwise unknown Luce de Gat, and were probably begun between 1230 and 1235. The work was expanded and reworked sometime after 1240.{{sfnp|Curtis|1994|p=xvi}} In the epilogue, a second author names himself as "Helie de Boron," asserting that he is the nephew of the first author of the Arthurian Grail cycles, poet [[Robert de Boron]].{{Efn|Or a "relative of Robert", in some manuscripts ({{harvp|Curtis|1994|p=xvii}}).}}{{sfnp|Curtis|1994|p=xvii}} Helie de Boron claims, like the so-called authors of the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', to have picked up the story where Luce left off. Neither the biographies of the two authors, nor the claim that they had been translating the work from a [[Latin]] original are taken seriously by scholars.{{harvp|Curtis|1994|p=xvii}}&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Emmanuèle (1958). “Luce de Gast et Hélie de Boron, le chevalier et l’écriture”. In ''Romania'' 106 (1985): 326-340; Curtis, Renée L. (1958). “The Problems of the Authorship of the Prose Tristan”. In ''Romania'' LXXIX (1958): 314-38.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
The first part of the work stays closer to the traditional story as told by verse writers like [[Béroul]] and [[Thomas of Britain]], but many episodes are reworked or altered entirely. Tristan's parents are given new names and backstories, and the overall tone has been called "more realistic" than the verse material though there are moments where characters sing.{{sfnp|Curtis|1994|pp=xxii–xxv}} [[Tristan]]'s guardian Governal takes him to [[France]], where he grows up at the court of King [[Pharamond]]. He later arrives at the court of his uncle [[Mark of Cornwall|Mark]], [[Kingdom of Cornwall|King of Cornwall]], and defends his country against the [[Ireland|Irish]] warrior [[Morholt]]. Wounded in the fight, he travels to Ireland where he is healed by [[Iseult]], a renowned doctor and Morholt's niece, but he must flee when the Irish discover he has killed their champion. He later returns, in disguise, to seek Iseult as a bride for his uncle. When they accidentally drink the love [[potion]]&lt;ref&gt;Controversially, Tristan does not fall in love with Iseult "love at first sight." Instead, he falls in love with her because the pagan knight [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]] falls in love with her first.&lt;/ref&gt; prepared for Iseult and Mark, they engage in a tragic affair that ends with Tristan being banished to the court of [[Hoel]] of [[Brittany]]. He eventually marries Hoel's daughter, also named Iseult.

Especially after this point, however, the traditional narrative is continually interrupted for side adventures by the various characters and episodes serving to "Arthurianize" the story.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, Keith (1991). "Prose Tristan." In [[Norris J. Lacy]] (Ed.), ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 374–375. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Tristan's rivalry with the [[Saracen]] knight [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]] is given substantial attention. Additionally, in the long version, Tristan leaves Brittany and returns to his first love, and never sees his wife again, though her brother [[Kahedin]] remains his close companion. Tristan is compared frequently to his friend [[Lancelot]] in both arms and love, and at times even unknowingly engages him in battles. He becomes a [[Knights of the Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]] (taking Morholt's old seat) and embarks on the Quest for the Holy Grail before abandoning the idea to stay with Iseult at Lancelot's castle. 

The Grail Quest has been a source of controversy regarding the ''Tristan en prose''. Instead of writing new material, the author chose to insert (or interpolate) the entire ''Queste del Saint Graal'' from the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]] into the Tristan story. The result of this copying undermines the sanctity of the Vulgate Quest itself.&lt;ref&gt;The ''interpolation'' of the ''Vulgate Queste'' begins in Volume 6 of Ménard's edition. On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31. Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance of [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts which do not include the Grail material preserve the earlier version of the lovers' deaths, while the longer versions have Mark kill Tristan while he plays the harp for Iseult, only to see her die immediately afterwards.

==Scholarship==
Before any modern editions of the ''Prose Tristan'' were attempted, scholars were dependent on an extended summary and analysis of all the manuscripts by Eilert Löseth in 1890 (republished in 1974). Of the modern editions, the long version is made up of two editions: one edited by Renée L. Curtis and the other by Philippe Ménard.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Renée L., ed. ''Le Roman de Tristan en prose'', vols. 1-3 (Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1963-1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ménard, Philippe exec. ed. ''Le Roman de Tristan en Prose'', vols. 1-9 (Geneva: Droz, 1987-1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis' edition of a simple manuscript (Carpentras 404) covers Tristan's ancestry and the traditional legend up to Tristan's madness. However, the massive amount of manuscripts in existence dissuaded other scholars from attempting what Curtis had done until Ménard hit upon the idea of using multiple teams of scholars to tackle the infamous Vienna 2542 manuscript. His edition follows from Curtis', includes Tristan's participation in the Quest for the Holy Grail and ends with Tristan and Iseult's  death and the first signs of Arthur's fall. Richard Trachsler is currently preparing an edition of the "continuation" of the ''Prose Tristan''. The shorter version, which contains no Grail Quest, is published by Joël Blanchard in five volumes.

Though part of the larger prose cycles, which dominated all things Arthurian after the early 13th century, the originality of the ''Tristan en prose'' is found in the author's use of lyrical poems to express characters' hopes, despair or anger. Various books and articles have studied the lyrical content of the ''Prose Tristan'' whether expressed as riddles in verse, letters in verse, songs of mockery or love songs.&lt;ref&gt;Lods, Jeannee (1955). "Les parties lyriques du ''Tristan'' en prose" in ''Bulletin Bibliographique de la Société International Arthurienne'' 7: 73-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fotitch, T. and Steiner, R. (1974). ''Les Lais du Roman de Tristan en Prose''. Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the ''Prose Tristan'' functions like a musical. Characters placed in extreme situations actually "break into song." All of this is appropriate considering Tristan's traditional link to poetry.

The Prose ''Tristan'' had a huge effect on subsequent medieval literature and treatments of the Arthurian legend. Characters like [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], [[Dinadan]], and [[Lamorak]], all of whom first appear in the ''Tristan'', achieved popularity in later works. The pagan knight Palamedes even lent his name to the ''[[Palamedes (romance)|Romance of Palamedes]]'', a later work that expands on episodes from the ''Tristan''. This material is also preserved in the ''Compilation'' of [[Rustichello da Pisa]] and numerous later redactions in several languages. The Prose ''Tristan'' also influenced the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], the next major prose treatment of the Arthurian mythos, and served as the source for the Tristan section of Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.

'''''Short Cuts''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy-drama]] film, directed by [[Robert Altman]]. Filmed from a screenplay by Altman and Frank Barhydt, it is inspired by nine [[Short story|short stories]] and a poem by [[Raymond Carver]]. The film has a [[Los Angeles]] setting, which substitues the [[Pacific Northwest]] backdrop of Carver's stories. Short Cuts traces the actions of 22 principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection. The role of chance and luck is central to the film, and many of the stories concern death and infidelity.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Matthew Modine]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Lori Singer]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Buck Henry]], [[Lily Tomlin]], actress and singer [[Annie Ross]], and musicians [[Huey Lewis]], [[Lyle Lovett]] and [[Tom Waits]].

==Plot==
A fleet of helicopters sprays for [[medfly|medflies]] and reveals all the characters along the path of their flight. Dr. Ralph Wyman ([[Matthew Modine]]) and his wife, Marian ([[Julianne Moore]]), meet another couple, Stuart ([[Fred Ward]]) and Claire Kane ([[Anne Archer]]) - an out-of-work salesman and a party clown respectively - at Zoe Trainer's ([[Lori Singer]]) cello concert and make a spontaneous Sunday dinner date. Marian's sister, Sherri ([[Madeleine Stowe]]), is married to philandering cop Gene ([[Tim Robbins]]), who invents unbelievable stories to hide his affair with Betty Weathers ([[Frances McDormand]]). Betty is in the process of divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy ([[Peter Gallagher]]). Waitress Doreen Piggot ([[Lily Tomlin]]) is married to an alcoholic limo driver, Earl ([[Tom Waits]]). Television commentator Howard Finnigan ([[Bruce Davison]]) lives with his wife, Anne ([[Andie MacDowell]]), and their young son, Casey (Zane Cassidy), next door to Zoe and her mother, cabaret singer Tess ([[Annie Ross]]). Their pool cleaner is Jerry Kaiser ([[Chris Penn]]), whose wife, Lois ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), works from home as a phone sex operator by tending to the children while she talks off strange men. Jerry and Lois are friends with Doreen's daughter, Honey ([[Lili Taylor]]), and her husband, Bill ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), who works as a makeup artist.

The day before the eighth birthday of Casey, Doreen hits him with her car as he is running to school. Casey appears fine and refuses Doreen's offer of a ride home, as she is a stranger. His mother comes home from ordering his birthday cake to find him slumped lethargically on the couch. Howard convinces her to take Casey to the hospital, where he remains unconscious. The baker, Andy Bitkower ([[Lyle Lovett]]), calls the next day to inform Ann that the cake is ready, but Howard, wanting to keep the line free, briskly ends the conversation. The baker immediately calls back, incensed at being hung up on. While the Finnigans maintain their vigil, Bitkower continues to call and harass the couple. Howard's estranged father Paul ([[Jack Lemmon]]) turns up at the hospital and recalls that Casey's hospitalization reminds him of the day that Howard was in a car accident as a boy. When Howard's mother went to her sister's house, she found her in bed with her husband, whom she had seduced. That led to the estrangement between father and son.

Stuart and his two friends, Gordon ([[Buck Henry]]) and Vern ([[Huey Lewis]]), harass Doreen at the diner before they head out on their three-day fishing trip. On the first day, they find a young woman's body, submerged near some rocks. After some debate, they decide to tie her to the rocks, continue fishing, and report the body when they are done. When he comes home, Stuart eventually admits to Claire what they had done, and she is disgusted that they could fish for days with the woman's body nearby. The body is identified as a 23-year-old woman, and Claire visits the funeral home out of a sense of guilt.

Stormy visits Betty's house while she is away with their son Chad (Jarrett Lennon), ostensibly to pick up his mother's clock, but instead spends the day destroying her belongings. Bill and Honey entertain themselves in the apartment that they are watching while its owners are on vacation by taking some pictures of Honey in which Bill has made her up to look as if she has been brutally beaten. Gene abandons the family dog on a strange street because he cannot endure its barking, but after several days of his distraught children's inquiries, he returns to the neighbourhood and retrieves the dog, who has been picked up by Vern's family. The Wymans get into a massive argument just before their dinner party with the Kanes. Marian admits to an affair. Both couples alleviate their stress by drinking heavily, and the party lasts all night long.

One day, Casey's eyes begin to flutter. Ann's excitement grows, but just as he appears to be fully waking, he suddenly dies. Seeing that and being overwhelmed, Howard's father, Paul, leaves the hospital while the distraught couple returns home and informs Zoe of Casey's death. The next day, they go to the bakery to shame Bitkower over his abuse of them. When he learns why they never picked up the cake, he asks them to stay and gives them baked goods. Zoe, worn to the breaking point by her mother's alcoholism and her isolation, commits suicide by starting a car engine inside her garage; she plays the cello as she asphyxiates. Later that day, her mother discovers Zoe's death and is bewildered.

When Honey picks up the pictures from the developer, they are mixed up with Gordon's. He is horrified to see the pictures of Honey, who is apparently beaten so badly, and she is horrified by the pictures Gordon took of the submerged body on his fishing trip. They walk away from each other, memorizing each other's license plates. Honey and Bill are on their way to a picnic with Jerry and Lois. In the park, Jerry and Bill try to rape two young women they encountered earlier, and Bill quickly makes an excuse to divvy up into couples. As he and one of the girls walk away from Jerry and the other girl, they hear her scream. They turn around to see Jerry hitting her in the head with a rock, just as a major earthquake strikes. In the aftermath, Jerry's murder of the girl is attributed to a falling rock during the earthquake.

'''''The Cobra Event''''' is a 1998 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[novel]] by [[Richard Preston]] describing an attempted [[bioterrorism]] attack on the [[United States]]. The perpetrator of the attack has [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] a [[virus]], called "Cobra", that fuses the incurable and highly [[contagious disease|contagious]] [[common cold]] with one of the world's most [[virulent]] diseases, [[smallpox]]. The disease that results from the virus, called brainpox in the novel, has symptoms that mimic those of [[Lesch–Nyhan syndrome]] and the common cold. The book is divided between descriptions of the virus and the government's attempt to stop the imminent threat posed by it.

==Plot summary==
The book is divided into 6 sections. The first section, called "Trial", starts with a teenage girl named Kate Moran who dies violently one day in school. The next section, titled "1969", describes tests done in the 1960s by the U.S. government involving weaponized viruses. The third section, "Diagnosis", describes the [[autopsy]] of Kate Moran and introduces the key characters of Dr. Alice Austen, Mark Littleberry, and Will Hopkins. The last three sections—"Decision", "Reachdeep", and "The Operation"—describe these three characters' journey to discover the source of the lethal Cobra virus.

=="Cobra" and its effects==
The virus described in the novel is a fictional [[Chimera (virus)|chimera]] that attacks the human brain. The infective agent, code-named "Cobra" by the protagonists, is a [[recombinant virus]] made from modified variants of the [[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|nuclear polyhedrosis virus]] (which normally infects moths and butterflies), [[rhinovirus]], and [[smallpox]].

The infection initially presents [[common cold]]-like symptoms and a characteristic [[blister]]ing process in the nose and mouth, before invading the [[nervous system]]. Although not as [[Contagious disease|contagious]] as the [[influenza]] virus, it spreads rapidly through the same vectors as the common cold, mainly via airborne particulate matter coming in contact with the [[mucous membranes]] of the respiratory system. Although [[tussis]] is the primary source of these particles, the inclusion of nuclear polyhedrosis virus allows Cobra to form crystals, which can be easily processed into a fine powder.

The [[optic nerve]]s of the eye, accessed through the eyelid, and [[olfactory nerve]]s of the nose provide a direct pathway for the neurotropic Cobra virus to spread to the [[central nervous system]], where the virus takes root. Once present in brain matter, the virus begins to replicate exponentially. Infected brain cells experience growth of viral crystals in their nuclei, eventually leading to [[lysis]] of the cell. The [[brain stem]], which controls the basic functions of life, is heavily affected by this growth. The Cobra virus also knocks out the gene for the [[enzyme]] [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRT), whose absence causes [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]]. As a result, patients experience both [[autocannibalism|autocannibalistic]] urges and increased aggression toward others. These neurological symptoms develop within a matter of hours, eventually resulting in death due to the severe damage to the brain stem. Cobra is so aggressive in its growth that autopsies reveal a brain almost liquefied by cell lysis.

==Impact of the book==
President [[Bill Clinton]] was reportedly sufficiently impressed by the scenarios described in the book that he asked aides and officials for closer study and suggested more funding for research into bioterrorism threats. However, there is some variation in the assorted accounts of this episode in his administration: about his degree of concern, who was asked to help, the depth of inquiry, the formal status of his orders, and the magnitude of expense involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EEDD1739F937A15752C1A9649C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Where Terrorism Meets Optimism", Margo Nash, New York Times, 24 Nov 2002]
:"President Bill Clinton asked the F.B.I. to determine whether the events described in ''The Cobra Event'' could really happen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gmytM_-gwVkC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=the.cobra.event&amp;sig=-nupjC8QHL_d6Ikl5D_wCZTg5lQ ''Fatal Future?: Transnational Terrorism and the New Global Disorder'', p. 117, footnote 2], which cites "U.S. Still Unprepared for Biological Attack", [[Dallas Morning News]], April 26, 1998, and says
:"...Clinton's reading of Preston's novel reportedly led Clinton to issue an executive order directing drastically increased funding for research on the threat of advanced biological terrorist weapons."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27173953_ITM "''Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War''.

:"Clinton began pushing the book on friends and fellow government officials, including House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], and had Pentagon officials brief him on its plausibility. The response he got was not reassuring. From then on, in the words of one national security official, Clinton became "obsessed" with the threat of biological weapons."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KQx97J4WMYAC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;vq=Clinton&amp;dq=the.cobra.event&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=Yg-0xKyVfgyySrYOPsYE_zKs4f8 ''Our Cannibals, Ourselves'', Priscilla L. Walton, p. 157, footnote 8]
:"According to [Judith] Miller et al., President Clinton was so struck by the scenario depicted in ''The Cobra Event'' that he asked [[John Hamre]], deputy secretary of defense, "whether he thought the novel's scenario was plausible.  Could a terrorist unleash an unstoppable plague with designer pathogens?" (226).  Subsequently, a committee was struck to investigate bioterrorist scenarios."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorism: Critical Concepts in Political Science'', [[David C. Rapoport]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kdGlbkQm5bgC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=the.cobra.event+clinton&amp;lr=&amp;sig=dRzt13PvS9_8hNc9ZyRAxIWke6I p. 186]
:"In April 1998, as a result of having read the Richard Preston novel, ''The Cobra Event'', the president held a meeting with a group of scientists and Cabinet members to discuss the threat of bioterrorism.  The briefing impressed Clinton so much that he asked the experts to brief senior officials in [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]].  On May 6 they delivered a follow-up report, calling for the stockpiling of vaccines (an idea that was soon dropped.)  ''The Washington Post'' reported with regard to the stockpiling proposal that 'Some administration officials outside the White House expressed surprise at how fast the president and his [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff had moved on the initiative .... noting with some concern that it had not gone through the customary deliberative planning process.' [11] Critics noted that not all scientific experts were disinterested; some stood to gain financially if the government invested large sums in developing technology against bioterrorism."
Note 11, above, is to Washington Post, 21 May 1998, p. A1.

'''''The Tragedy of Man''''' ({{Lang-hu|'''Az ember tragédiája'''}}) is a 2011 Hungarian animated drama film directed by [[Marcell Jankovics]], starring Tibor Szilágyi, [[Mátyás Usztics]], Ágnes Bertalan, Tamás Széles and Piroska Molnár. The narrative is set in several different eras, spanning from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical creation]] to 50,000 BC and from there to a distant future ahead of our time, and follows [[Adam]], [[Eve]], and [[Lucifer]] as they explore humanity and the meaning of life. Each segment has a different visual style to reflect the art of the respective time periods. The film is based on the 1861 play ''[[The Tragedy of Man]]'' by [[Imre Madách]].

The film went into production in 1988 but encountered difficulties as the production model for Hungarian cinema changed. The segments were financed individually and sometimes exhibited independently at film festivals and on Hungarian television. After 23 years in production, the finished film premiered in 2011.

==Plot==
[[God]] creates the universe. [[Lucifer]] mocks God for the shortcomings of humanity, which he predicts will soon aspire to become God. As the primaeval spirit of negation, he claims to be as old as God and demands his share of the world, which he is granted in the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and the Tree of Immortality.

Lucifer tempts [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] eat the [[forbidden fruit]]. Expelled from the [[Garden of Eden]] and abandoned by God, Adam reasons that he is no longer obliged to show God any gratitude. He decides to live from his own strength alone. Lucifer offers Adam to experience his own future, and takes him from the Stone Age into the future, throughout human history.

In [[ancient Egypt]], Adam is [[Pharaoh Djoser]] in 2650 BC who falls in love with Eve in the form of a slave woman. Adam abolishes slavery, but Lucifer argues that it would be futile, as history would prove. Adam is taken to [[ancient Greece]], where [[democracy]] has resulted in corruption and foul political play. Adam appears as [[Miltiades]] in 489 BC and is sentenced to death after the masses have been agitated against him. Disillusioned, Adam is taken to [[ancient Rome]] in 67 AD where he and Lucifer enjoy themselves with [[gladiator]] games and prostitutes. As decadence makes the civilization fall apart, Adam and Eve encounter [[Saint Peter]] and then [[Jesus]], and turn to God, who gives them a message of love and fraternity. Adam becomes [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]] in 1096 AD but is disgusted by the [[East–West Schism]] and pettiness within the church. He falls in love with Eve who is locked inside a monastery.

Adam is then [[Johannes Kepler]] in Prague, 1608. He seeks eternal wisdom by studying the physical world while his wife is unfaithful. Adam becomes [[Georges Danton]] during the [[French Revolution]] in Paris, 1794. Eve appears as an aristocrat who is [[guillotine]]d and as a prostitute who revels in the revolutionary terror. Danton is eventually put before the [[National Convention]] and executed for conspiring with the aristocracy. Once again in the body of Kepler, Adam wakes up from a dream. He recognizes that ideas are more powerful and long-lasting than individual men. Adam and Lucifer visit Victorian London in 1897 as unnamed Englishmen, which Adam initially finds impressive but Lucifer argues is decayed on a spiritual level, as everything has become a commodity. Adam tries to court Eve and is eventually able to seduce her, right after [[World War I]], with the help of jewels and a Gypsy fortune teller. When social unrest erupts in the 20th century, Adam wishes for a society ruled after scientific principles for the common good.

Lucifer brings Adam to a future [[Egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] [[World government|world state]]. Although initially positive, Adam immediately regrets the disappearance of nations, as he thinks people should have a past and an identity to hold on to. Animals and plants which are not useful are extinct and the useful ones have been genetically modified. Adam questions the [[Materialism|materialist]] worldview and is arrested for criminal thinking. Eve appears as a mother who is punished for refusing to let society educate her child. Adam and Lucifer travel further to a dehumanized future in space. Adam is at first unsettled, but when the spirit of Earth urges him to return, he proclaims that his spirit can live beyond the body. On the verge of annihilation, Adam changes his mind and promises to keep striving on Earth. He accepts mortality and man's struggle.

In a distant [[ice age]], the last remains of humanity are dying. The few people Adam encounters are deformed savages. Lucifer argues that they do not differ in nature from humans of any other era.

Adam wakes up in his cave 50,000 BC. He joins Lucifer on a cliff, where he argues for the existence of [[free will]], while Lucifer reminds him of the futility of human ambition. Adam argues that he can still go against God by committing suicide. As he is about to leap from the cliff, Eve finds him and tells him that she is pregnant. God urges Adam to keep having faith. Adam decides to follow God's word and accepts struggle as an end in itself.

==Production==
[[Marcell Jankovics]] wrote the screenplay for the film in 1983. It is based on [[Imre Madách]]'s 1861 play ''[[The Tragedy of Man]]''. The film went into production in 1988 at [[Pannonia Film Studio]]. Jankovics expected a typical animated feature to take three years to produce, but since ''The Tragedy of Man'' would have twice the running time of a typical film he expected it to take six years to make. After the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|fall of communism in Hungary]] in 1989, Jankovics could no longer rely on the state-funded system he had produced his previous films within and had to seek alternative ways to finance the project.&lt;ref name="Ito"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=2012-11-09|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/movies/the-tragedy-of-man-by-marcell-jankovics-animator.html|title=Living Through Animated Millenniums|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jankovics-Marcell.jpg|thumb|Jankovics in 2010]]
The film was produced one segment at a time, after which production ceased until funding had been secured for the next segment.&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; Just like in the original play, there is a total of 15 segments. Each of these were animated in a different visual style. Over the years, several segments were exhibited individually at film festivals and shown on the public television network [[Duna TV]], although the majority of the material was never shown publicly until the entire film was finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Varga|first=Ferenc|date=2011-10-12|url=http://www.origo.hu/filmklub/blog/keszuloben/20111012-vegre-bemutatjak-jankovics-marcell-23-eve-keszulo-filmjet-az.html|title=Végre bemutatják Jankovics Marcell 23 éve készülő filmjét|language=Hungarian|work=Origo|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 some funding was secured when Jankovics' 1974 short film ''[[Sisyphus (film)|Sisyphus]]'' was used in an American car commercial which was shown at the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name="Ito" /&gt; In 2011 the film received 19.5 million [[Hungarian forint|forint]] from the culture department of the Ministry of National Resources. The total cost of the film corresponded to 600 million forint (approximately two and half million U.S. Dollars) in the exchange rate at the time of the release. After 23 years in production, the last post-production work was finished in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gőzsy|first=Kati|date=2011-11-30|url=http://index.hu/kultur/cinematrix/ccikkek/2011/11/30/az_en_palyamnak_vege/|title=Az én pályámnak vége|work=[[Index.hu]]|language=Hungarian|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Bill Stamets of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The animation styles vary throughout this chronology of human folly, but this wary sermon stays on message[.] ... Lucifer the interlocutor delights in the endless conflict between human reason and a hands-off God.&lt;ref name="Stamets"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stamets|first=Bill|date=2013-06-06|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/20522654-421/short-reviews-of-the-closed-circuit-and-the-tragedy-of-man.html|title=Short reviews of ''The Closed Circuit'' and ''The Tragedy of Man''|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219230427/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/20522654-421/short-reviews-of-the-closed-circuit-and-the-tragedy-of-man.html|archivedate=2014-02-19|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stamets continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To add strains of grandeur, [Jankovics] draws on works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. He thrills when visualizing the French Revolution as a tri-color mob in motion. Later, twisting [[DNA]] strands are depicted nearly as mystically. All told, ''The Tragedy of Man'' is illustrated [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Stamets" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Uniform of the Day''', when referred to in a [[military]] sense, is the designated [[uniform]] all [[military personnel]] are required to wear on that particular day. It is often designated by the senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] on the [[Military base|base]].&lt;ref name='manual'&gt;{{cite book | title = Uniform Regulations | publisher = United States Marine Corps | year = 1922 | page = 1 sec. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally the uniform is determined by the seasons (e.g. winter blues or summer whites for Navy) however, special occasions (e.g. visiting dignitaries) or weather changes may also dictate changes to the uniform of the day.

The uniform of the day instruction is broadcast over the [[1MC]] at reveille on board U.S. Navy ships.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24553, Gruppe des Wandervogels aus Berlin.jpg|Group from Berlin c. 1930|thumb|right]]

'''''Wandervogel''''' is the name adopted by a popular movement of [[German Youth Movement|German youth groups]] from 1896 onward. The name can be translated as rambling, hiking, or wandering bird (differing in meaning from "Zugvogel" or [[migratory bird]]) and the ethos is to shake off the restrictions of society and get back to nature and freedom. Soon the groups split and they originated ever more organisations, which still all called themselves ''Wandervogel'', but were organisationally independent. Nonetheless the feeling was still of being a common movement, but split into several branches.

==History==
The Wandervogel movement was officially established on 4 November 1901 by Karl Fischer, a former pupil of Herman Hoffmann Fölkersamb, who had formed a study circle at the boys' Berlin-Steglitz grammar school where he was teaching in 1895.  The Wandervogel soon became the pre-eminent German youth movement.  It was a back-to-nature youth organization emphasizing freedom, self-responsibility, and the spirit of adventure, and took a nationalistic approach, stressing Germany's Teutonic roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/Youth/youth/org/nat/ger/wander.htm|title=German nationalist youth groups : Wandervogel|website=histclo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After [[World War I]], the leaders returned disillusioned from the war. The same was true for leaders of [[Germany|German]] [[Scouting in Germany|Scouting]]. So both movements started to influence each other heavily in Germany. From the ''Wandervogel'' came a stronger culture of [[hiking]], adventure, bigger tours to farther places, [[Neo-romanticism|romanticism]] and a younger leadership structure. Scouting brought [[uniform]]s, [[flag]]s, more organization, more camps, and a clearer [[ideology]]. There was also an educationalist influence from [[Gustav Wyneken]].

Together this led to the emergence of the [[Bündische Jugend]]. The ''Wandervogel'', German [[Scouting]] and the Bündische Jugend together are referred to as the [[German Youth Movement]].

They had been around for more than a quarter of a century before [[Nazism|National Socialists]] began to see an opportunity to utilize some methods and symbols of the German Youth Movement and incorporate it in the [[Hitler Youth]].

This movement was very influential at that time. Its members were [[romanticism|romantic]] and prepared to sacrifice a lot for their ideals. That is why there are many to be found on both sides in the [[Third Reich]]. Some of the ''Wandervogel'' groups had [[German Jews|Jewish]] members; Jewish youth and adults had their own Wandervogel group called "Blau-Weiss" ("blue-white"), and this eventually became a Zionist youth movement; other Jewish scouting movements such as [[Hashomer Hatzair]] were influenced by the ''Wandervogel''. Other groups within the movement were [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] or close to the Nazi government. Therefore, one can later find prominent members subscribing to the Third Reich and other prominent members resisting it.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

From 1933 the Nazis outlawed the ''Wandervogel'', German Scouting, the Jungenschaft, and the Bündische Jugend, along with most youth groups independent of the Hitler Youth. Only Church-affiliated groups survived, lasting until almost 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Priepke | first = Manfred | title = Die evangelische Jugend im Dritten Reich 1933–1936 | publisher = Norddeutsche Verlagsanstalt | year = 1960 |pages = 187–189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
Before [[World War II]], in a context of cordial relations with Germany, and in an effort to promote healthy activities for young people throughout the country, Japan's Ministry of education launched the movement among Japanese universities, calling it the {{nihongo|Health Promotion Wandervogel Association|奨健会ワンダーフォーゲル部|Shōkenkai Wandāfōgeru-bu}}. The first WanderVogel student club was created in 1935 in [[Rikkyo University]]. It then spread to [[Keio University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwv.sakura.ne.jp/kwv/|title=ＫＷＶ 慶應義塾大学ワンダーフォーゲル部|website=kwv.sakura.ne.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Meiji University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~wangel/&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1937 on to several other universities around the country, especially after World War II, in the context of high economic growth and popularization of mountaineering.

==Modern aspects==
The ''Wandervogel'' movement was refounded after [[World War II]] and exists in Germany to this day with around 5,000 members in many different associations, as well as in neighboring countries.

In Japan, it is now a fairly renowned student club with activities like mountaineering, [[sawanobori]] and [[ski touring]].

==Influence==
{{See also|History of the hippie movement}}
Some authors have seen the ethos and activities of the Wandervogel as an influence on later social movements, in particular the [[hippie]] movement which developed in the United States during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hippy.com/php/article-243.html Gordon Kennedy &amp; Kody Ryan, ''Hippie Roots &amp; The Perennial Subculture'', excerpt from ''Children of the Sun; A Pictorial Anthology From Germany To California, 1883-1949'', 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830033310/http://www.hippy.com/php/article-243.html |date=2007-08-30 }} {{ISBN|0-9668898-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandervogel.com/wandervogel_faq.html|title=Wandervogel - Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.wandervogel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===

Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence. Did It Work?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was and still is controversy regarding the effectiveness of this program in reducing HIV/AIDS through advocating abstinence and whether this would actually empower women in Africa.
