The film is set in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]] in the final years of the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] era. It tells the story of two students, roommates in a university dormitory, who try to procure an [[Abortion law|illegal abortion]]. Inspired by an anecdote from the period and the general social historic context, it depicts the loyalty of the two friends and the struggles they face.

Mungiu and cinematographer [[Oleg Mutu]] shot it in [[Bucharest]] and other Romanian locations in 2006. After making its world premiere at Cannes, ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' made its Romanian debut on 1 June 2007, at the [[Transilvania International Film Festival]]. It opened to critical acclaim, and was noted for its [[minimalism]] and intense themes.

The film won three awards at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]], including the [[Palme d'Or]]. It went on to win [[List of accolades received by 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days|numerous honours]], including Best Film at the [[European Film Awards]] and Romania's national [[Gopo Awards]]. ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' became the subject of some controversy over censorship, the [[abortion debate]], and its exclusion from the [[80th Academy Awards]], but in 2016 it was named one of [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].

==Plot==
In 1987, two university students in an unnamed [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] town, Otilia Mihartescu and Gabriela "Găbița" Dragut, are roommates in a dormitory. When Găbița becomes pregnant, the two young women arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe in a hotel, where he is to perform an [[abortion in Romania|illegal abortion]].  At the college dorm, Găbița and Otilia review the items they need for the day. As Găbița nervously sits and waits, Otilia [[black market|barters and buys]] soap and cigarettes from the dormitory shop. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday. Otilia initially declines, relenting after Adi becomes upset.

Otilia heads to the Unirea hotel where Găbița has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under Găbița's last name. Consequently, Otilia visits another hotel, the Tineretului, and after much begging and haggling, is able to book a room at an expensive rate. After speaking with Găbița on the telephone, Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Mr. Bebe, although he had asked Găbița that she meet him personally. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that Găbița is not at the planned hotel.

At the Tineretului, Mr. Bebe discovers that Găbița's claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie, and that it has been at least four months. This changes the procedure and also adds the risk of a murder charge.  While the two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] for the abortion, it slowly becomes clear that Mr. Bebe expects both women to have sex with him. Desperate and distressed, Otilia has sex with Mr. Bebe so that he will not walk out on them, as does Găbița. Mr. Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into Găbița's uterus, and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by Găbița's lies, yet continues to help and care for her.

Otilia leaves Găbița at the Tineretului to attend Adi's mother's birthday party. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They converse about trivial matters while Otilia and Adi remain silent. After Otilia accepts a cigarette in front of Adi's parents, one of the guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders. Adi and Otilia retreat to his room, where she tells him about Găbița's abortion. They begin debating what would happen if it were Otilia who was pregnant, as Adi is opposed to abortion. After the argument, Otilia calls Găbița from Adi's house. Găbița does not answer, so Otilia decides to return to the hotel.

When Otilia enters the hotel room Găbița is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has been expelled and is in the bathroom. Otilia wraps the fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag, while Găbița asks her to bury it. Otilia walks outside, finally climbing to the top of a building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and dropping the bag in a trash chute. She returns to the Tineretului and finds Găbița sitting in its restaurant. Otilia sits and tells Găbița that they are never going to talk about the episode again. Otilia stares blankly at Găbița.

===Historical background===
{{further|Decree 770}}
[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|The film is based on [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s Romania of the 1980s.]]
[[Romanian Communist Party]] leader Nicolae Ceaușescu enacted the abortion law Decree 770 in 1966 in order to increase the population,{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} which was falling in the 1960s and continued to fall, aside from one year after the decree's enactment.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}} The procedure was permitted in only extremely limited circumstances.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}} The law was not based on any religious opposition to abortion,{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=110}} but on the government's authority and control over its citizens.&lt;ref name="Porton35"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=1 March 2008 |last=Porton |first=Richard |title=Not Just an Abortion Film: An Interview with Christian Mungiu |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |p=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Adriana Gradea further argued justifications for the decree rendered a view of women as second-class citizens, with no right to be heard.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=110}} In the 1980s, the decree was strengthened to mandate gynecological appointments, to assess if individual women could reproduce.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=125}} Author Dominique Nasta judged the film to be an accurate portrait of the oppression, and on the poor state of the [[economy of Romania]] in the later days of Ceaușescu's regime.{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}}

During the years of Decree 770, the only available abortion methods, all illegal, could prove fatal to women, causing thousands of deaths.{{sfn|Deutscher|2017}} According to Mungiu's notes he shared with the press, the death toll was 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2151224 |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |last=Taylor |first=Ella |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908114213/http://www.laweekly.com/film/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-2151224 |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradea cited a 10,000 estimate.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=109}} Sanctions against contraception were also in place,{{sfn|Cardullo|2012|p=335}} and [[sex education]] was rare.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}} Following the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], abortion was made lawful, and subsequently unrestricted in the first 14 weeks.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=162}}

===Development===
The initial idea for ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' was inspired by an anecdote from Communist Romania that director [[Cristian Mungiu]] had heard.&lt;ref name="republik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4months3weeksand2days.com/blog/2007/05/17/interview-republik/ |title=Interview with Cristian Mungiu |publisher=Official website |last=Sandu |first=Ana Maria, ''RE:PUBLIK'' |date=25 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630011210/http://www.4months3weeksand2days.com/blog/2007/05/17/interview-republik |archivedate=30 June 2007 |language=Romanian |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had heard it from a friend 15 years prior to the film, the incident occurred five years before that, in 1987, a date that Mungiu noted in the screenplay.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Cristian Mungiu|Mungiu, Cristian]] |date=2008 |title=Interview with the Director Cristian Mungiu |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Mongrel Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mungiu, himself a decrețel (born in the time of Decree 770),{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} wanted to create a serious film focusing on the true story, which still affected him and felt tragic more than 15 years later.&lt;ref name="republik"/&gt; He conducted interviews with others who lived through the period, to determine if the experience was common.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt; Aside from the anecdote, depicting the 1980s in Romania was appealing because he remembered the time, and "The attraction is for the stories that I know from that period. They belong to me. They belong to my generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2053849.htm |last=Stratton |first=David |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks &amp; 2 Days Interview |date=2014 |work=[[ABC Online]] |accessdate=1 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511074221/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2053849.htm |archivedate=11 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped that basing the story on a factual account would also distinguish it from previous [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian films]]: 
{{quote|I remember watching many [[propaganda film|propagandistic]] examples of Romanian cinema and thinking nothing like that ever happened to us. These people were talking the same language but still looked like aliens.&lt;ref name="Debruge2008"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=17 January 2008 |last=Debruge |first=Peter |title=Cristian Mungiu |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |p=A18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In setting out to write the screenplay, he intended the focus to be less on the abortion, and more on the time and its people. He said, "it's also a film about responsibilities and decision-making".&lt;ref name="Foundas"/&gt; As he continued writing, he stated pushing a political point was not so much a factor in editing, as he opted not to delete potential scenes if they felt credible, asking "Would this reasonably have happened, and does it make sense to the story to keep it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18755277 |last= |first= |title='4 Months' Raises the Iron Curtain on Abortion |date=7 February 2008 |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=1 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902093329/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18755277 |archivedate=2 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mungiu revised the screenplay numerous times during productions, creating 17 drafts. The major revision was the emergence of Otilia as the sole protagonist, while Găbița's part was reduced.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt; In Mungiu's mind, Otilia had become determined to help Găbița because their shared life in the dormitory over four years would have created an emotional tie between them.&lt;ref name="Decade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2009/12/decade-cristian-mungiu-on-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-246089/ |last=Mungiu |first=Cristian |title=Decade: Cristian Mungiu on '4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days' |date=23 December 2009 |work=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628231957/http://www.indiewire.com/2009/12/decade-cristian-mungiu-on-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-246089/ |archivedate=28 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced on a budget of under €600,000.&lt;ref name="SBS"/&gt;

Casting took place during the autumn of 2006.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt; Because of the extended takes, Mungiu sought actors who could remember large amounts of dialogue, and found that  [[Vlad Ivanov]] was ideal for a 25-minute sequence.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter2008/4months.php#.WVPoZ2jyvIU |last=Smith |first=Damon |title=Once Upon a Time in Romania |date=Winter 2008 |work=[[Filmmaker Magazine]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616200435/http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter2008/4months.php#.WVPoZ2jyvIU |archivedate=16 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mungiu viewed [[audition]]s of many young women for the two protagonists.&lt;ref name="republik"/&gt; [[Anamaria Marinca]] had not worked with Mungiu before reading the screenplay, and found the story intriguing. She had performed on television, but had not appeared in a film before.&lt;ref name="Foundas"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-director-cristian-mungiu-interview/Content?oid=2166203 |last=Foundas |first=Scott |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days Director Cristian Mungiu Interview |date=6 February 2008 |work=[[SF Weekly]] |accessdate=28 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628232348/https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-director-cristian-mungiu-interview/Content?oid=2166203 |archivedate=28 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On initially meeting Marinca, the director could not picture her in the lead role, but was won over when she began reading the first page of the screenplay.&lt;ref name="republik"/&gt; She had experience on stage, so the lengthy takes were agreeable to her.&lt;ref name="Debruge2008"/&gt; [[Laura Vasiliu]] also had stage experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formula-as.ro/2008/820/lumea-romaneasca-24/laura-vasiliu-cred-in-povestile-fericite-9641 |last=Vasiliu |first=Laura |title=Laura Vasiliu - 'Cred in povestile fericite' |date=2008 |work=Formula A.S. |language=Romanian |accessdate=29 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112104/http://www.formula-as.ro/2008/820/lumea-romaneasca-24/laura-vasiliu-cred-in-povestile-fericite-9641 |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Filming began in October 2006, with the objective to complete it by May, so that it could be entered into the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; After [[location scouting]] during the fall,&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt; most of the filming was done in [[Bucharest]], with some scenes filmed in a hotel in [[Ploiești]].&lt;ref name="republik"/&gt; Bucharest in 2006 was no longer how it would have appeared in 1987, due to new windows and other additions to the historic buildings. Production designer Mihaela Poenaru drew on her recollections of the period to prepare the locations.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The Mr. Bebe character was also given a red [[Dacia 1300|Dacia]] car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2014 |last=Grancea |first=Mihaela |title=Historical Context of Mungiu's Movie 432 |url=http://upm.ro/cci3/CCI-03/Hst/Hst%2003%2002.pdf |publisher=[[Petru Maior University of Târgu Mureș]] |accessdate=7 September 2017 |p=29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908153513/http://upm.ro/cci3/CCI-03/Hst/Hst%2003%2002.pdf |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|name="Dacia"|Mungiu once commented about the period: "the only car you can see on the streets is Dacia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinema.usc.edu/events/event.cfm?id=12053 |last=Ago |first=Alessandro |title=Tales From the Golden Age |date=15 September 2011 |publisher=[[University of Southern California]] |accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} In several scenes, the indoor locations were so small that the camera had to be placed outside of the room.&lt;ref name="Decade"/&gt;

[[File:Dacia 1300 1977 Bulldogtreffen 2012.JPG|250px|thumb|A red [[Dacia 1300|Dacia]] was used in production.]]
To highlight the emotional state of the characters, the film was shot in long [[take]]s, [[close-up]]s were avoided, and a [[film score|score]] was not used.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt; In Mungiu's mind, this would "keep a proper distance from the subject and be honest with the story".&lt;ref name="Porton38"/&gt; Cinematographer [[Oleg Mutu]] opted for a minimalist approach, lighting the backgrounds to display items common in 1987 while attempting not to distract from the characters too much.&lt;ref name="Mutu"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Mutu, Oleg |date=2008 |title=Interview with the Director of Photography Oleg Mutu |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Mongrel Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutu and Mungiu had previously developed a formula of lengthy takes and [[medium shot]]s with the director's first feature film, ''[[Occident (film)|Occident]]''.{{sfn|Bazgan|2013|p=164}} Mungiu found the dinner scene to be the most difficult to shoot, as including a large number of actors in a long take made it difficult to focus. It took 17 attempts over five days to complete the scene.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt;

In one scene, the aborted fetus is visible on screen for approximately 14 seconds, the length it took for the actors to deliver the dialogue, with Mungiu opting not to edit out the shot since it "was part of the story".&lt;ref name="Porton"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=1 March 2008 |last=Porton |first=Richard |title=Not Just an Abortion Film: An Interview with Christian Mungiu |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |p=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chute featured at the end of the film was constructed for the film, as there was not one at the location. The crew dropped bags of cabbage and potatoes to create the [[sound effect]].&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt;

Due to Mungiu saying Romania did not use streetlights in 1987, Mutu considered other ways to light the final scenes, where the camera would move with Marinca for 200 metres.&lt;ref name="Porton38"/&gt; Mutu set up lights from building roofs for this sequence, employing a rod and [[paper lantern]]s for the camera.&lt;ref name="Mutu"/&gt;

==Themes and interpretations==
Academic Judit Pieldner summed up the plot as "the story of a friendship facing a moral test".{{sfn|Pieldner|2016|p=105}} Scholar Florentina C. Andreescu opined the two female protagonists share emotional loyalty, while in the wake of Mr. Bebe's abuses, Otilia becomes increasingly suspicious of Adi.{{sfn|Andreescu|2013|p=118}}

Professor László Strausz said that the film emphasises the ways that Romania's abortion laws inflicted humiliations on the protagonists, particularly between people of differing authority and sex.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=126}} He argued that class and generational conflicts are presented in the dinner party scene, where the characters have more food than lower classes, discuss social issues such as conscription into the [[Romanian Armed Forces]], and treat Otilia as representative of the "new generation" that does not appreciate what it has been given.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=132}} Academic Claudiu Turcuș remarked that the dinner scene, where the characters look down on some careers and act as if smoking in front of one's elders is disrespectful, shows how regressive they are.{{sfn|Turcuș|2017|p=230}} [[Ovidius University]] author Ileana Jitaru credited the film for reconstructing "an entire communist class ideology which divided society into 'working class people' and 'intellectuals'". Jitaru specifically cited the dinner scene, where the conversation makes much of the divide between those with university degrees and those with none.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=5}} The attendees boast about belonging to the middle class, and make denigrating comments about Otilia's rural origins.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|p=131}}

The term "communism" is never mentioned,{{sfn|Turcuș|2017|p=230}} the existence of Decree 770 is only implied,{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=109}} and dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu is never named.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Despite this, communism is a major subject.{{sfn|Godeanu-Kenworthy|Popescu-Sandu|2014|pp=225–248}} Andreescu found that in many locations, one power is dominant; in some, the government, while in others, an underground power or [[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopia]] forms.{{sfn|Andreescu|2013|p=116}} The hotel room where the abortion is performed becomes a location outside of the government's supervision. Mr. Bebe exploits this, boasts of the worth of his expertise and notes the risk he is taking, in order to extort the women for sex.{{sfn|Andreescu|2013|p=118}} Turcuș instead interpreted the scene as Mr. Bebe presenting himself as the "new man", sharing the women's legal peril and an openness to sexuality, while in fact being "the communist brute".{{sfn|Turcuș|2017|p=231}} ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'' writer Constantin Parvulescu stated "''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' provides an astute balance of [[Ostalgie|ostalgia]] and anti-communist memorial". Parvulescu elaborated that the beginning gives a view of place and possessions that could be nostalgic, but these become overruled by crisis in the communist society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/4months/ |last=Parvulescu |first=Constantin |title=The cold world behind the window: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Romanian cinema’s return to real-existing communism |date=2009 |work=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901015530/https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/4months/ |archivedate=1 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist Adriana Gradea suggested that silence is a theme of the film, and citizens of communist nations would use silence to endure and resist. This is seen at the end, where Otilia forbids further discussion of the abortion. The lack of a score can also be seen as contributing to sense of pending danger.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=112}}

[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|250px|thumb|The dinner scene is accidentally reminiscent of the Last Supper.]]
The fact that the characters live in poverty is reflected in a scene where Mr. Bebe accosts his mother for wanting to buy sugar.{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} When Otilia is searching for Mr. Bebe, there is also a line of people visible in the background queuing for food, reflecting the lack of food security in the 1980s.{{sfn|Strausz|2017|pp=130-131}} Additionally, the characters are often impolite towards each other. Mungiu explained that this was related to the poverty, saying "You need people in a society to have reached a certain standard of living before they can be polite".&lt;ref name="Decade"/&gt; The bartering scenes reflect how corporate goods common west of the [[Iron Curtain]] were prohibited in Romania and were viewed as luxuries.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=6}}

The dinner scene is reminiscent of the [[Last Supper]].  Author Doru Pop acknowledged the differing number of characters and no male Jesus, but asserted that it is relevant to have a dinner while a tragedy is unfolding.{{sfn|Pop|2014|p=146}} Mungiu conceded that such similarities were accidental, and that once he appreciated the potential analogy during production, the filmmakers added a more focused view of Otilia to reveal her stress.&lt;ref name="Mungiu"/&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Desaturated blues and greens.jpg|thumb|An ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' critic positively reviewed the [[colour scheme]],&lt;ref name="Wise"/&gt; which academic Ileana Jitaru identified as including desaturated greys, blues and greens.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=6}}]]
Scholar Dominique Nasta saw the style as a "[[minimalism|minimalist]], 'less is more' line".{{sfn|Nasta|2016|p=169}} [[British Film Institute]] writer Ben Walters judged it "simple and rigorous, with scenes composed of only one or two shots". Walters remarked on "handheld, mobile, almost literally breathtaking" shots, and on the impact of still scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/4146 |last=Walters |first=Ben |title=Heartbreak Hotel: Film of the Month: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |date=6 June 2012 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803003952/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/4146 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Brian Gibson assessed the photography as "patient, alert, dogged
in its observation of Otilia's endeavours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vueweekly.com/4_months_3_weeks_and_2_days/ |last=Gibson |first=Brian |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |date=6 March 2008 |work=[[Vue Weekly]] |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901015448/http://www.vueweekly.com/4_months_3_weeks_and_2_days/ |archivedate=1 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the photography, academic Ileana Jitaru found "simple, austere and realistic compositions in which the [[black humour]] is a stylistic means of anchoring the theme(s)".{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=4}} Jitaru also commented on the colour scheme, observing "cold desaturated colours", particularly greys, blues and greens in the beginning.{{sfn|Jitaru|2014|p=6}} Additionally, the story, set during a single day, is related by [[Real time (media)|real time]] narrative in its scenes, although minutes or hours may separate the events in separate scenes.{{sfn|Rabiger|Hurbis-Cherrier|2013|p=61}}

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Bradshaw]] interpreted the style as "a nightmare of social-realist suspense".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/worldcinema.drama |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks &amp; 2 Days |date=11 January 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=6 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907121855/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/11/worldcinema.drama |archivedate=7 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' critic Jonathan Romney characterized it as "claustrophobic" in parts and an "intense [[realism (arts)|realist]] exercise".&lt;ref name="Romney"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/4-months-3-weeks-2-days-15-769821.html |last=Romney |first=Jonathan |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks &amp; 2 Days (15) |date=13 January 2008 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=6 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907030408/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/4-months-3-weeks-2-days-15-769821.html |archivedate=7 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, he also believed that the hotel scenes communicate "a sense of almost supernatural horror", and asks of the noise heard after Mr. Bebe chastises his mother: "A backfire? A gunshot? Who can tell? But it lends the scene its bizarre, oppressive air of ill omen".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; Critic Peter Debruge declared the style "the antithesis of your well-lit, elegantly shot Hollywood movies — or the locally made films of Mungiu's childhood".&lt;ref name="Debruge2008"/&gt;

Journalist Steven Boone said that while the film was well reviewed for "its bracing drabness, its ugliness, its lack of style", he believed it was "beautiful and stylized", because "it is ''alive'' and piercingly present-tense". He compared it with the films of the [[Dardenne brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/a-miraculous-frame-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-take-three |last=Boone |first=Steven |title=A Miraculous Frame: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days: Take Three |date=25 January 2008 |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918073826/https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/a-miraculous-frame-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-take-three |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Lauren Wissot judged the story "a suspense thriller", comparable to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. She felt "heat" in each frame, writing "we're waiting for the bomb— the constant threat of imprisonment or death that defined life under Nicolae Ceaucescu".&lt;ref name="Wissot"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/time-warped-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-take-two |last=Wissot |first=Lauren |title=Time Warped: 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days: Take Two |date=25 January 2008 |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |accessdate=31 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016042448/http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/time-warped-4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-take-two |archivedate=16 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from reflecting the length of the fictional pregnancy, the 4-3-2 form of the title creates the impression of rushed countdown reinforcing the thriller genre aspects, Gradea wrote.{{sfn|Gradea|2016|p=109}}

Responding to analogies to the Dardennes' style, Mungiu said in 2008 that he had only seen their ''[[La Promesse]]'' (1996) but was now interested in seeing more, and that he had asked the brothers to attend a showing of his film.&lt;ref name="Porton38"/&gt; Mungiu compared his style more to those of [[Miloš Forman]] and [[Jiří Menzel]], though he said he was influenced more by certain films than by a director's general filmography.&lt;ref name="Foundas"/&gt;

Although the film won the Cinema Prize of the French National Education System at Cannes, protests by the [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion movement]] led [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French Education Minister]] [[Xavier Darcos]] to consider banning it from French high schools.

Peter Bradshaw remarked on the sharpness of Otilia and the apparent naiveté of Găbița, but considered this is how their crisis could have affected them, and praised the film as "a masterpiece of intimate desperation".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; In ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', Damon Wise gave it five stars, positively reviewing the cinematography, colour scheme, and the depiction of the black-market terror created when something is outlawed.&lt;ref name="Wise"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/4-months-3-weeks-2-days/review/ |last=Lee |first=Benjamin |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks And 2 Days Review |accessdate=16 July 2017 |date=29 December 2007 |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716170315/http://www.empireonline.com/movies/4-months-3-weeks-2-days/review/ |archivedate=16 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Independent''{{'}}s Jonathan Romney named it a "masterpiece", acknowledging the description "Romanian abortion drama" would be off-putting for some viewers but defending it as "harrowing".&lt;ref name="Romney"/&gt; Writing for ''[[Le Monde]]'', Thomas Sotinel called the film excellent and cited Marinca for an intense performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cinema/article/2007/08/28/4-mois-3-semaines-2-jours-l-horrible-jour-de-gloire-d-otilia_948424_3476.html |last=Sotinel |first=Thomas |title='4 mois, 3 semaines, 2 jours': l'horrible jour de gloire d'Otilia |accessdate=16 July 2017 |date=28 August 2007 |work=[[Le Monde]] |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Baptiste Morain of ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' remarked on the film's powerful emotions, and credited Mungiu with managing to do much with little.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/4-mois-3-semaines-2-jours/ |last=Morain |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=4 mois, 3 semaines, 2 jours |accessdate=16 July 2017 |date=28 August 2007 |work=[[Les Inrockuptibles]] |language=French |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730113424/http://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/4-mois-3-semaines-2-jours/ |archivedate=30 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources view the film as indicative of a broader renaissance in Romanian cinema in the 2000s, particularly in light of other successful Romanian films. These include [[Cristi Puiu]]'s ''[[The Death of Mr. Lazarescu]]'', which won the ''[[Prix un certain regard]]'' at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]]; [[Corneliu Porumboiu]]'s ''[[12:08 East of Bucharest]]'', which won the ''[[Camera d'Or]]'' at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]; and [[Cristian Nemescu]]'s ''[[California Dreamin' (film)|California Dreamin']]'', which won the ''Prix un certain regard'' at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.&lt;ref name="SBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldnewsaustralia.com.au/region.php?id=137301&amp;region=3 |last= |first= |title=Romania shines at Cannes |date=28 May 2007 |work=SBS World News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020195547/http://worldnewsaustralia.com.au/region.php?id=137301&amp;region=3 |archivedate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/13/drama.worldcinema |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks &amp; 2 Days |last=French |first=Philip |date=13 January 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402131741/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/13/drama.worldcinema |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion debate===
On its international release, the film became partially viewed through the lens of the [[abortion debate]], with [[Emma Wilson]] writing in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that [[IMDb]] user reviews were highlighting this and comparing it to ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''.{{sfn|Wilson|2008|p=18}}{{refn|group=n|name="Juno"|Despite perceptions, ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' star [[Ellen Page]] said her film was not intended as anti-abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/298588 |title=Juno star has a mind of her own |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Howell |first=Peter |date=30 January 2008 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331100902/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/298588 |archivedate=31 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Wilson observed ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' displayed the aborted fetus, comparable to the [[United States pro-life movement|U.S. pro-life movement]]'s use of such images, but argued the film was closer to [[pro-choice]] ideology in its focus on the law's harm to women. Wilson further argued that the true point was the loyalty of the two characters.{{sfn|Wilson|2008|p=18}} Mungiu said the fetus shot was not linked to the pro-life movement, as Romanians did not commonly use these depictions and the abortion debate was no longer prominent there.&lt;ref name="Porton"/&gt; Anti-abortion protests comparable to those in the U.S. or Ireland did not occur in Romania until 2005, when the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] commented on the matter.{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=162}} Mungiu also declined to state his position on abortion, and said he attempted to keep his film and his personal position separate.{{sfn|Badt|2010|p=107}} Scholars Oana Godeanu-Kenworthy and Oana Popescu-Sandu argued the film was simply about communism, and the minimalism allowed for foreign audiences to see what they wanted, including a statement on the abortion debate.{{sfn|Godeanu-Kenworthy|Popescu-Sandu|2014|pp=225–248}}

In the [[feminism in Canada|Canadian feminist]] magazine ''[[Herizons]]'', reviewer Maureen Medved judged ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' to approximate a [[horror film]] in depicting the abuses that women suffer when abortion is illegal.&lt;ref name="Medved"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=1 January 2009 |last=Medved |first=Maureen |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |magazine=[[Herizons]] |volume=22 |issue=3 |p=54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], ''Time'' critics Mary and Richard Corliss also cited the film to discourage electing a candidate opposed to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', saying the film revealed potential negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1709046,00.html |last1=Corliss |first1=Mary |last2=Corliss |first2=Richard |title=How Not to Have an Abortion |accessdate=25 August 2017 |date=1 February 2008 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729161943/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1709046,00.html |archivedate=29 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Australian Feminist Law Journal]]'', [[Fiona Jenkins]] interpreted the story as a morally ambiguous argument that safe abortion services should be allowed, but that Otilia telling Găbița they will never talk about the matter reflects her "trauma not only of what she has undergone but what she has done".{{sfn|Jenkins|2009|p=63}} Peter T. Chattaway, writing for ''[[Christianity Today]]'', opined that "The abortion itself is handled in a way that could be seen to support both sides of the abortion debate", given the abuse to women, but also the portrayal of "the procedure's bloody aftermath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/4months3weeksand2days.html |last=Chattaway |first=Peter T. |title=4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days |accessdate=29 June 2017 |date=25 January 2008 |work=[[Christianity Today]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826170735/http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/4months3weeksand2days.html |archivedate=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Waltraud Maierhofer also interpreted it as "not simply for or against abortion". Maierhofer commented a woman will consider many things in making a choice, including health, finances and what the potential child would face. In a discussion with Adi, Otilia indicates she would not be ready to enter a marriage and raise a family. Găbița's reasons are never said; it can be presumed she made the decision herself, though Maierhofer wrote at times she appears "irresponsible".{{sfn|Maierhofer|2017|p=161}}

==Legacy==
Following the Academy Award controversy, the Academy reformed its methodology of choosing Best Foreign Language Film nominees, allowing a committee of approximately 20 members to name three favourite candidates, balancing out a shortlist composed by a second committee made up of hundreds of voters.&lt;ref name="Zeitchik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/24/entertainment/la-et-oscar-foreign-20110224 |last=Zeitchik |first=Steven |title=Foreign-language Oscar nominees portray true grittiness |accessdate=25 August 2017 |date=14 December 2012 |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919101138/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/24/entertainment/la-et-oscar-foreign-20110224 |archivedate=19 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Zeitchik of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked the nominees of 2011 reflected the change, displaying unorthodox and challenging subject matter such as youth violence (''[[In a Better World]]''), incest by rape (''[[Incendies]]'') and particularly torture (''[[Dogtooth (film)|Dogtooth]]'').&lt;ref name="Zeitchik"/&gt; In 2013, ''[[The Wrap]]'' named Mungiu "The Man Who Changed Oscar’s Rules".&lt;ref name="Pond"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/man-who-changed-oscars-rules-70591/ |title=The Man Who Changed Oscar’s Rules |accessdate=30 September 2017 |last=Pond |first=Steve |date=2 January 2013 |work=[[The Wrap]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930173418/http://www.thewrap.com/man-who-changed-oscars-rules-70591/ |archivedate=30 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mungiu reportedly planned ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' to be the first in a loose series of films titled "Tales from a Golden Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=26 October 2007 |last=Griffin |first=John |title=Romanian director shoots for the soul |newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |p=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mungiu explained that "the golden age of Romania" is a term used nationally for Ceaușescu's final nine years in power, though he said people then suffered "shortages and hardship".&lt;ref name="Porton35"/&gt; He intended to make six [[short film]]s under the banner "Tales from the Golden Age", and then allow younger directors to take over the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=1 March 2008 |last=Porton |first=Richard |title=Not Just an Abortion Film: An Interview with Christian Mungiu |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |pp=35–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he released a single film called ''[[Tales from the Golden Age]]'', following ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'' in depicting the Ceaușescu era and starring Vlad Ivanov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/tales-from-the-golden-age-1200474749/ |last=Weissberg |first=Jay |title=Review: 'Tales From the Golden Age' |accessdate=25 August 2017 |date=20 May 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628231317/http://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/tales-from-the-golden-age-1200474749/ |archivedate=28 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His next film, ''[[Beyond the Hills]]'' (2012), similarly depicted Romanian extremism, and Mungiu was inspired to make the cinematic adaptation after seeing the stage version in New York while promoting ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/movies/sacrifice-at-the-altar-of-intolerance.html?mcubz=3 |last=Rohter |first=Larry |title=Sacrifice at the Altar of Intolerance |accessdate=7 September 2017 |date=1 March 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908043322/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/movies/sacrifice-at-the-altar-of-intolerance.html?mcubz=3 |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|name="Oscar"|Unlike ''4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'', ''[[Beyond the Hills]]'' was shortlisted for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name="Pond"/&gt;}}

==Methodology==
Ranks and scores are assigned by weighing various indicators and rewarding or penalizing the city as appropriate.  These indicators are classified into two broad categories: ''Personal Health'', which measures the health habits and outcomes for city residents, including their physical activity, diet, and chronic health problems, and ''Community and Environment'', which includes scores to measure the availability and convenience of local parks, farmers' markets, alternative transportation, and community recreation facilities like pools, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/methodology/|title=Methodology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After becoming the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 21 July 1940, Lithuania followed the abortions laws of the Soviet Union. On 27 June 1936, the USSR banned abortions unless there was a danger to the life of the mother or the child would inherit a serious disease from the parents. Under this law abortions were meant to be performed in maternity homes and hospitals, and physicians who disregarded this risked one to two years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

On 23 November 1955, the Soviet Union issued a decree which allowed abortions to be available on request. Later that year abortion was restricted so that it could only be performed in the first three months of pregnancy unless the birth would endanger the mother. Physicians had to perform abortions in hospitals and, unless the mother was in danger, a fee was charged.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; If the abortion was not performed in a hospital, the physician could be imprisoned for one year, while a person not in possession of a medical degree could be imprisoned for two years. The serious injury or death of a pregnant woman could result in the sentence being extended up to eight years.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt;

The Government of the USSR was concerned about the rate of illegal abortions and attempted to decrease their occurrence. On 31 December 1987, the Soviet Union announced that it would allow many medical institutions to perform abortions until the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; In 1989, there were 50,100 abortions and 55,782 live births in Lithuania. By 2010, the number of abortions decreased to 6,989 abortions and 35,626 live births.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-lithuania.html|title=Statistics of Abortions in Lithuania|publisher=Johnston`s Archive|year=2011|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 9.8 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2000, the [[total fertility rate]] in Lithuania was 1.4 children/per woman, which the government officially wants to increase.&lt;ref name="United Nations"/&gt; Lithuania's low fertility rate, and its [[Catholic Church in Lithuania|Catholic traditions]] make abortion a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vitaelitera.lt/ojs/index.php/akuserija-ir-ginekologija/article/download/154/153.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several attempts in recent years to adopt a more restrictive law on abortion, especially after 2005. Such attempts are particularly associated with the [[Poles in Lithuania|Polish minority]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hrmi.lt/en/seimo-zmogaus-teisiu-komitete-kelia-skinasi-siulymas-drausti-abortus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/lithuania-abortion-ban-initiative/11508&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adducted thumb syndrome recessive form''' is a [[rare disease]] affecting multiple systems causing malformations of the palate, thumbs, and upper limbs. The name Christian syndrome derives from Joe. C. Christian, the first person to describe the condition. Inheritance is believed to be [[autosomal recessive]],&lt;ref name=Fitch&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitch N, Levy EP |title=Adducted thumb syndromes |journal=Clin. Genet. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=190–8 |year=1975 |pmid=1175322 |doi= 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1975.tb01493.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by mutation in the [[CHST14]] (carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14) gene.&lt;ref name=NCBI&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
This syndrome is characterised by typical facial appearance, slight build, thin and translucent skin, severely adducted thumbs, [[arachnodactyly]], [[Club foot|club feet]], joint instability, [[facial cleft]]ing and bleeding disorders, as well as heart, kidney or intestinal defects. Severe [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] and developmental delay and decreased muscle tone may also be present during infancy. Cognitive development during childhood is normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/QnASelected.aspx?diseaseID=8486|title=Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, musculocontractural type – Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=April 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
This syndrome is associated with [[microcephaly]], [[arthrogryposis]] and [[cleft palate]] and various craniofacial, respiratory, neurological and limb abnormalities, including [[bone]] and [[joint]] defects of the upper limbs, [[Adduction|adducted]] thumbs, [[camptodactyly]] and [[talipes equinovarus]] or calcaneovalgus. It is characterized by craniosynostosis, and myopathy in association with congenital generalized [[hypertrichosis]].&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author =Rapini, Ronald P. |author2 =Bolognia, Jean L. |author3 =Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1008 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Patients with the disease are considered [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]]. Most die in childhood. Patients often suffer from respiratory difficulties such as [[pneumonia]], and from [[seizures]] due to dysmyelination in the brain's [[white matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kunze J, Park W, Hansen KH, Hanefeld F |title=Adducted thumb syndrome.

'''Autistic Pride Day''', originally an [[Aspies for Freedom]] initiative, is a pride celebration for autistics held on 18 June each year.&lt;ref name="TEDacrossautismspectrum"&gt;{{cite news |title=Playlist: All across the autism spectrum |url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/06/18/playlist-all-across-the-autism-spectrum/ |publisher=ted.com |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-18 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autismstrategyscotland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autismstrategyscotland.org.uk/news/autistic-pride-day.html|title=Autistic Pride Day celebrated on June 18|publisher=The Scottish Strategy for Autism|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic pride|Autistic pride]] recognises the importance of pride for autistics and its role in bringing about positive changes in the broader society.

==Autistic pride==
[[File:AutismPrideFlag small.png|thumb|One version of an Autism Pride Flag. The rainbow infinity symbol is more commonly used]]
On June 18 every year, organisations around the world celebrate Autistic Pride Day, with events around the world, to connect with one another through autistic events and demonstrate to allistics (people not on the autism spectrum) that autistic people are unique individuals who should not be seen as cases for treatment.&lt;ref name="TEDacrossautismspectrum" /&gt;

Autistic Pride Day was first celebrated in 2005 by [[Aspies for Freedom]] and it quickly became a global event which is celebrated widely online and offline.&lt;ref name="autismstrategyscotland" /&gt; AFF modelled the celebration on the gay pride movement.&lt;ref name="SanerDisease" /&gt; According to Kabie Brook, the co-founder of Autism Rights Group Highland (ARGH), "the most important thing to note about the day is that it is an autistic community event: it originated from and is still led by autistic people ourselves", i.e. it is not a day for other charities or organisations to promote themselves or stifle autistic people. The rainbow infinity symbol is used as the symbol of this day, representing "diversity with infinite variations and infinite possibilities".&lt;ref name="autismstrategyscotland" /&gt;

During [[gay pride]] and other events, a rainbow flag is used featuring a white infinity symbol on a tri-colour background or a rainbow infinity symbol against a white or black background. (In Canada, only the rainbow infinity is used, because the white infinity symbol is in use on the Metis flag) &lt;ref name=AutismPride&gt;{{cite web|author=White, Barrett|url=http://www.outsmartmagazine.com/2016/08/a-tale-of-two-closets-twainbow-aids-the-lgbt-and-autistic-communities|title=A Tale of Two Closets: Twainbow Aids the LGBT+ and Autistic Community|publisher=OutSmart Magazine|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT]]+ [[autistic]] charity [[Twainbow]] oversaw the selection and [[online]] voting in 2015.

Autistic pride points out that autistic people have always been an important part of human culture. Being autistic is a form of neurodiversity. As with all forms of neurodiversity, most of the challenges autistic people face come from other people's attitudes about autism and a lack of supports and accommodations (ableism), rather than being essential to the autistic condition. For instance, according to Gareth Nelson, many autism- related organizations promote feelings of pity for parents, rather than fostering understanding &lt;ref name=SanerDisease&gt;{{cite news|author=Saner E |title='It is not a disease, it is a way of life' |work=The Guardian |date=2007-08-07 |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0,,2143123,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-07 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820055604/http://society.guardian.co.uk/health/story/0%2C%2C2143123%2C00.html |archivedate=20 August 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRAutism&gt;{{cite web|author=Shapiro, Joseph|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5488463|title=Autism Movement Seeks Acceptance, Not Cures|publisher=NPR|date=June 26, 2006|accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2013}} Autistic activists have contributed to a shift in attitudes away from the notion that autism is a deviation from the norm that must be treated or cured. Autistic self-advocacy organizations, which are led and run by autistics, are a key force in the movement for autistic acceptance and autistic pride.&lt;ref name=Baron-Cohen2000&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Dev Psychopathol |year=2000 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=489–500 |title= Is Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism necessarily a disability? |author= Baron-Cohen S |pmid=11014749 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400003126}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine released an article entitled "Autistic and proud" on the first Autistic Pride Day that discussed the idea.&lt;ref name=AutisticProud&gt;{{cite news |last=Trivedi |first=Bijal |title=Autistic and proud of it |date=18 June 2005 |work=New Scientist |location= London |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625041.500-autistic-and-proud-of-it.html |accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CADASIL''' or '''CADASIL syndrome''', involving '''cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy''', is the most common form of hereditary [[stroke]] disorder, and is thought to be caused by [[mutation]]s of the ''[[Notch 3]]'' gene on [[chromosome 19]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Joutel A, Corpechot C, Ducros A |title=Notch3 mutations in CADASIL, a hereditary adult-onset condition causing stroke and dementia |journal=Nature |volume=383 |issue=6602 |pages=707–10 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8878478 |doi=10.1038/383707a0 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the [[leukodystrophies]]. The most common clinical manifestations are [[migraine]] headaches and [[transient ischemic attack]]s or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.&lt;ref name="Chabriat1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chabriat H, Vahedi K, Iba-Zizen MT |title=Clinical spectrum of CADASIL: a study of 7 families. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy |journal=Lancet |volume=346 |issue=8980 |pages=934–9 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7564728 |display-authors=etal| doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(95)91557-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006 |page=545 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition was identified and named by French researchers [[Marie-Germaine Bousser]] and [[Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve]], in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cadasilfoundation.org/bousser.html |title=History of CADASIL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9026542|title=[CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy)] - Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
CADASIL may start with attacks of [[migraine]] with [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] or subcortical transient ischemic attacks or strokes, or mood disorders between 35 and 55 years of age. The disease progresses to [[subcortical dementia]] associated with [[pseudobulbar palsy]] and [[urinary incontinence]].

[[Ischemic stroke]]s are the most frequent presentation of CADASIL, with approximately 85% of symptomatic individuals developing [[transient ischemic attack]]s or stroke(s). The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years (range 30–70). A classic [[lacunar syndrome]] occurs in at least two-thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common. It is worthy of note that ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recurrent silent strokes, with or without clinical strokes, often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia. A case of CADASIL presenting as schizophreniform organic psychosis has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2015.02.006 | title=CADASIL presenting as schizophreniform organic psychosis | journal=General Hospital Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The underlying pathology of CADASIL is progressive degeneration of the [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle cells]] in [[blood vessel]]s. [[Dominance (genetics)|Autosomal dominant]] mutations in the ''[[Notch 3]]'' gene (on the long arm of chromosome 19) cause an abnormal accumulation of Notch 3 at the [[cytoplasmic]] membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells both in [[cerebrum|cerebral]] and extracerebral vessels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Joutel A, Andreux F, Gaulis S |title=The ectodomain of the Notch3 receptor accumulates within the cerebrovasculature of CADASIL patients |journal=J.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:CADASIL - very high mag.jpg|thumb|A [[micrograph]] showing punctate [[immunostaining]] (brown) with a Notch 3 [[antibody]], as is characteristic in CADASIL.]]
MRIs show hypointensities on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|T1-weighted images]] and [[hyperintensities]] on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|T2-weighted images]], usually multiple confluent white matter lesions of various sizes, are characteristic. These lesions are concentrated around the [[basal ganglia]], peri-[[Ventricular system|ventricular]] [[white matter]], and the [[pons]], and are similar to those seen in [[Binswanger disease]].&lt;ref name="Chabriat1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Ropper AH, Brown RH |chapter=Cerebrovascular Diseases |title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-07-141620-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These white matter lesions are also seen in asymptomatic individuals with the mutated gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tournier-Lasserve E, Joutel A, Melki J |title=Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy maps to chromosome 19q12 |journal=Nat.

The definitive test is sequencing the whole [[Notch 3]] gene, which can be done from a sample of blood. However, as this is quite expensive and CADASIL is a systemic [[arteriopathy]], evidence of the mutation can be found in small and medium-size arteries. Therefore, skin biopsies are often used for the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Joutel A, Favrole P, Labauge P |title=Skin biopsy immunostaining with a Notch3 monoclonal antibody for CADASIL diagnosis |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2049–51 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11755616 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07142-2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ueda M, Nakaguma R, Ando Y |title=[Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)] |language=Japanese |journal=Rinsho Byori |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=242–51 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19363995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
No specific treatment for CADASIL is available. While most treatments for CADASIL patients' symptoms – including migraine and stroke – are similar to those without CADASIL, these treatments are almost exclusively empiric, as data regarding their benefit to CADASIL patients is limited.&lt;ref name="Andre"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=André|first1=Charles|title=CADASIL: pathogenesis, clinical and radiological findings and treatment|journal=Arq.

In one small study, around 1/3 of patients with CADASIL were found to have cerebral microhemorrhages (tiny areas of old blood) on [[MRI]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Though there are few clinical trials currently (2018) ongoing, there are natural history studies that patients can join. Studies can be found at [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov www.clinicaltrials.gov]. The [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02821780 CADASIL Disease Discovery Study (NCT02821780)] was the first prospective study in the US, sponsored by the National Institute of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) starting in 2016 and led by principal investigator Manfred Boehm.

== In popular culture ==
[[John Ruskin]] has been suggested to have suffered from CADASIL.&lt;ref name="Kempster"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempster PA, Alty JE |title=John Ruskin's relapsing encephalopathy |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2520–5 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18287121 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn019 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18287121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin reported in his diaries having visual disturbances consistent with the disease, and it has also been suggested that it might have been a factor in causing him to describe [[James Whistler]]'s ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket]]'' as "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face". This resulted in the famous libel trial that resulted in a jury's awarding Whistler one farthing damages.&lt;ref name="Kempster"/&gt;

Recent research into the illness of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has suggested that his mental illness and death may have been caused by CADASIL rather than tertiary syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemelsoet D, Hemelsoet K, Devreese D |title=The neurological illness of Friedrich Nietzsche |journal=Acta Neurol Belg |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18575181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the early death of the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]], at age 37, from a stroke has been potentially linked to CADASIL.  His sister, [[Fanny Mendelssohn]], was similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chambermusictoday.blogspot.com/2008/09/mendelssohns-premature-death.html|title=Blogger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Health care reform in the United States}}
{{BillClintonseries}}
{{Hillary Clinton series}}
}}
The '''Clinton health care plan''' was a 1993 [[Health care reform in the United States|healthcare reform]] package proposed by the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]] and closely associated with the chair of the task force devising the plan, [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton]].

[[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|The president had campaigned]] heavily on health care in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]]. The task force was created in January 1993, but its own processes were somewhat controversial and drew litigation. Its goal was to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide [[universal health care]] for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. The president delivered a major health care speech to the [[US Congress]] in September 1993. During his speech he proposed an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees.

Opposition to the plan was heavy from [[American conservatism|conservatives]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], and the [[health insurance|health insurance industry]]. The industry produced a highly effective television ad, "[[Harry and Louise]]", in an effort to rally public support against the plan.

Instead of uniting behind the original proposal, many Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Hillary Clinton was drafted by the Clinton Administration to head a new Task Force and sell the plan to the American people, which ultimately backfired amid the barrage from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and considerably diminished her own popularity. On September 26, 1994, the final compromise Democratic bill was declared dead by [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[George J. Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/us/health-care-debate-overview-national-health-program-president-s-greatest-goal.html?pagewanted=all

== Provisions ==
[[File:Hillary Clinton healthcare presentation 53520u (cropped1.jpg|thumb|First Lady Hillary Clinton at her presentation on health care in September 1993|left]]

According to an address to Congress by then-President Bill Clinton on September 22, 1993, the proposed bill would provide a "health care security card" to every citizen that would irrevocably entitle him or her to medical treatment and preventative services, including for pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bill|first1=Clinton|title=Address on Health Care Reform (September 22, 1993)|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/speech-3926|website=Mill Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018221153/http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/speech-3926|archive-date=October 18, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve this, the Clinton health plan required each [[US citizen]] and permanent [[resident alien]] to become enrolled in a qualified health plan on his or her own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Clinton's Health Plan: What the States Must Do; States Are Wary Partners In President's Big Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/us/clinton-s-health-plan-what-states-must-states-are-wary-partners-president-s-big.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=The New York Times|date=23 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Clinton's Health Plan: The Overview; Congress is given the Clinton plan for health care|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/us/clinton-s-health-plan-overview-congress-given-clinton-proposal-for-health-care.html?pagewanted=all|website=New York Times|accessdate=15 October 2016|date=23 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14 billion in 1993 and reaching $38 billion in 2003.

The plan also specified which benefits must be offered;   a National Health Board to oversee the quality of health care services; enhanced physician training; the creation of model information systems;  federal funding in the case of the insolvency of state programs; rural health programs;  long-term care programs; coverage for abortions, with a "conscience clause"  to exempt practitioners with religious objections; malpractice and antitrust reform; fraud prevention measures; and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, among other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=19 November 1993|last1=Moffitt|first1=Robert E.|title=A Guide to the Clinton Health Plan|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1993/11/a-guide-to-the-clinton-health-plan|publisher=Heritage Foundation|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 October 1993|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Clinton's Health Plan: The Overview; Congress is given the Clinton plan for health care|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/us/clinton-s-health-plan-overview-congress-given-clinton-proposal-for-health-care.html?pagewanted=all|website=New York Times|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance, and one serious illness away from losing all their savings. Millions more are locked into the jobs they have now just because they or someone in their family has once been sick and they have what is called the [[preexisting condition]]. And on any given day, over 37 million Americans—most of them working people and their little children—have no health insurance at all. And in spite of all this, our medical bills are growing at over twice the rate of inflation, and the United States spends over a third more of its income on health care than any other nation on Earth.}}

Starting on September 28, 1993, Hillary Clinton appeared for several days of testimony before five congressional committees on health care.&lt;ref name="PBS_Timeline"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/may96/background/health_debate_page1.html "Events leading up to Clinton's Healthcare Address to Congress,"] Timeline from [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''The System''.

Prominent opposition to the Clinton plan was led by [[William Kristol]] and his policy group [[Project for the Republican Future]], which is widely credited with orchestrating the plan's  defeat through a series of now legendary "policy memos" faxed to Republican leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/opinion/18edsall.html?ex=1326776400&amp;en=4ac5968a31842091&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Happy Hours | first=Thomas B. | last=Edsall | date=January 18, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American conservatism|Conservatives]], [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], and the [[health insurance|health insurance industry]] proceeded to campaign against the plan, criticizing it as being overly bureaucratic and restrictive of patient choice:
The conservative [[Heritage Foundation]] argued that "the Clinton Administration is imposing a top-down, command-and-control system of global budgets and premium caps, a superintending National Health Board and a vast system of government sponsored regional alliances, along with a panoply of advisory boards, panels, and councils, interlaced with the expanded operations of the agencies of Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor, issuing innumerable rules, regulations, guidelines, and standards."&lt;ref&gt;Moffit, Robert.

The effort also included extensive advertising criticizing the plan, including the famous "[[Harry and Louise]]" ad, paid for by the Health Insurance Association of America, which depicted a middle-class couple despairing over the plan's complex, bureaucratic nature.&lt;ref name="Cohn_TNR"&gt;[[Jonathan Cohn|Cohn, Jonathan]].

Meanwhile, instead of uniting behind the President's original proposal, other Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Some criticized the plan from the left, preferring a [[single-payer healthcare]] system. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Litigation==
The First Lady's role in the secret proceedings of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] in relation to the [[Federal Advisory Committee Act]] (FACA), which requires openness in government. The Clinton White House argued that the [[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 3 2|Recommendation Clause]] in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="amicus brief"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=971067 |title=Amicus Brief of J. Gregory Sidak in Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons v.

Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.aapsonline.org/clinton/AAPS/APPOPIN.PDF Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, Inc. v.

Page 5A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February 1993, the [[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]], along with several other groups, filed a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and [[Donna Shalala]] over closed-door meetings related to the health care plan. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of the task force. In 1997, Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide [[Ira Magaziner]] in his ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/19/us/judge-rules-government-covered-up-lies-on-panel.html "Judge Rules Government Covered Up Lies on Panel"], By Robert Pear. From ''The New York Times'', December 19, 1997; accessed January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned in 1999 the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/us/court-clears-clinton-aide-in-lying-case.html "Court Clears Clinton Aide In Lying Case"], by Neil A.

== Defeat ==
In August 1994, Democratic [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[George J. Mitchell]] introduced a compromise proposal that would have delayed requirements of employers until 2002 and exempted small businesses. However, "even with Mitchell’s bill, there were not enough Democratic Senators behind a single proposal to pass a bill, let alone stop a filibuster."&lt;ref&gt;Pantel, Kant and Rushefsky, Mark.[https://books.google.com/books?id=wGEsQ_fXA9AC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=mitchell+and+%22september+26+1994%22+and+health&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NuDif3Cuk8&amp;sig=1BJAbQYGL8cgm8NqSm3_b3PLemk#PPA108,M1 Politics, Power, and Policy Making: The Case of Health Care Reform in the 1990s] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks later, Mitchell announced that his compromise plan was dead and that health care reform would have to wait at least until the next Congress. The defeat weakened Clinton politically, emboldened Republicans, and contributed to the notion that she was a "big-government liberal" as decried by conservative opponents.&lt;ref name="NYT_Evolution"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/13/nyregion/13hillary.ready.html?ex=1278907200&amp;amp;en=ca200c39b840ad53&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss "The Evolution of Hillary Clinton,"] ''The New York Times'', July 13, 2005. Accessed June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 mid-term election became, in the opinion of one media observer, a "referendum on big government – Hillary Clinton had launched a massive health-care reform plan that wound up strangled by its own red tape."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Evan. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15674090/site/newsweek "Decline and Fall"], ''Newsweek''.  (November 20, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In that 1994 election, the [[Republican revolution]], led by [[Newt Gingrich]], gave the GOP control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate for the first time since the [[83rd United States Congress|83rd Congress]] of 1953–1954, ending prospects for a Clinton-sponsored health care overhaul.

Comprehensive [[health care reform in the United States]] was not seriously [[Health care reform debate in the United States|considered]] or [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|enacted]] by Congress until [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] election in 2008.

== Controversy in retrospect and perspective ==
In 1997, the Clinton administration supported an experimental program in New York that paid medical schools to train fewer doctors to reduce a "glut of physicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9708/24/doctor.glut/ |title=Report: U.S. to pay hospitals not to train doctors - August 24, 1997 |publisher=CNN |date=1997-08-24 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, as a US senator from New York, Hillary Clinton argued in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the current health care system is unsustainable, and she offered several solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary Rodham]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/magazine/now-can-we-talk-about-health-care-181056.html?sec=health&amp;pagewanted=all "Now Can We Talk About Health Care?"] ''The New York Times'', April 18, 2004. Accessed June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her article also mentioned areas of agreement with onetime opponent Newt Gingrich, and likewise, Gingrich has expressed agreement with Clinton on some aspects of health care, including a bill to modernize medical record keeping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/11/AR2005051101846.html "Gingrich, Clinton Collaborate on Health Care Bill,"] ''[[Associated Press]]'' in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 12, 2005.

Accessed June 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, referring to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, "I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done."&lt;ref name="NYT_Evolution"/&gt; Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: "I think that both the process and the plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;Toner, Robin and [[Anne Kornblut|Kornblut, Anne]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/washington/10hillary.html?ei=5070&amp;en=b3e5eae2515beefd&amp;ex=1181361600&amp;pagewanted=print "Wounds Salved, Clinton Returns to Health Care,"] ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2006. Accessed June 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

She received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and insurance companies for her 2006 re-election in the Senate, including several insurance companies that were members of the Health Insurance Association of America that helped defeat the Clinton Health Plan in 1994.&lt;ref name="Hernandez_NYT_1995"/&gt; [[Charles N. Kahn III]], a Republican who was executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association in 1993 and 1994, refers to his previous battles with Clinton as "ancient history," and says "she is extremely knowledgeable about health care and has become a Congressional leader on the issue."&lt;ref name="Hernandez_NYT_1995"/&gt;

Until the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Affordable Healthcare for America Act]], a combination of factors kept health care off the top of the agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, [[health maintenance organization]]s were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative Republican majority in Congress or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;Krugman, Paul, and Wells, Robin.  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"], New York Review of Books, March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clinton health care plan remains the most prominent national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican [[Mitt Romney]]'s health care plan, which has been implemented in Massachusetts,&lt;ref name="Cohn_TNR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Michael.

Clinton, I would be urging her to boast that her approach to health-care reform enjoys support from conservatives like the Heritage Foundation and Gov. Romney. If I were advising Gov.

In September 2007, former Clinton Administration senior health policy advisor [[Paul Starr]] published an article, "The Hillarycare Mythology,"&lt;ref name="tap091407"&gt;[[Paul Starr]], [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_hillarycare_mythology "The Hillarycare Mythology"], ''[[The American Prospect]]'', 2007-09-14. Accessed 2007-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote that Bill, not Hillary, Clinton, was the driving force behind the plan at all stages of its origination and development; the task force headed by her quickly became useless and was not the primary force behind formulating the proposed policy; and "[n]ot only did the fiction of Hillary's personal responsibility for the health plan fail to protect the president at the time, it has also now come back to haunt her in her own quest for the presidency."&lt;ref name="tap091407"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) can develop after a severe crush injury and rarely after a relatively minor injury. The legs and the forearms are the most frequent sites affected by compartment syndrome. Other areas of the body such as thigh, buttock, hand, and foot can also be affected.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

===Acute===
[[File:Acute Compartment Syndrome with blister formation.JPG|thumb|Acute compartment syndrome with blister formation in the arm of a child]]
There are five characteristic signs and symptoms related to acute compartment syndrome: pain, [[paraesthesia]] (reduced sensation), paralysis, [[pallor]], and pulselessness.&lt;ref name="Don2014"/&gt; Pain and paresthesia are the early symptoms of compartment syndrome.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

* '''Pain''' - The pain would be disproportionate to the findings of the physical examination and is not relieved by [[analgesia]] up to and including [[morphine]]. The pain is aggravated by passively stretching the muscle group within the compartment. However, such pain may disappear in the late stages of the compartment syndrome.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt; The role of [[local anaesthesia]] in delaying the diagnosis of compartment is still being debated.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;
* '''Paresthesia''' (altered sensation)  - A person may complain of "pins &amp; needles", numbness, and a tingling sensation. This may progress to loss of sensation ([[anesthesia]]) if no intervention has been made.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;
* '''Paralysis''' -  Paralysis of the limb is a rare, late finding. It may indicate both a nerve or muscular lesion.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;
* '''Pallor and pulselessness''' - A lack of pulse rarely occurs in patients, as pressures that cause compartment syndrome are often well below arterial pressures. Absent pulses only occurs when there is arterial injury or during the late stages of the compartment syndrome.&lt;ref name="Don2014"/&gt;

The limb with compartment syndrome is often associated with a firm, wooden feeling on deep palpation.&lt;ref name="Don2014"/&gt;

===Chronic===
The symptoms of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) are brought on by exercise and consist of a sensation of extreme tightness in the affected muscles followed by a painful burning sensation if exercise is continued. After exercise is ceased, the pressure in the compartment will decrease within a few minutes, relieving painful symptoms. Symptoms will occur at a certain threshold of exercise which varies from person to person but is rather consistent for a given individual and can range anywhere from 30 seconds of running to about 10–15 minutes of running. CECS most commonly occurs in the lower leg, with the anterior compartment being the most frequently affected compartment.&lt;ref name="Bong"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bong MR, Polatsch DB, Jazrawi LM, Rokito AS | title = Chronic exertional compartment syndrome: diagnosis and management | journal = Bulletin | volume = 62 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 77–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16022217 | url = http://hjdbulletin.org/files/archive/pdfs/639.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foot drop is a common symptom of CECS.&lt;ref name="Awbrey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Awbrey|first1=Brian|last2=Shingo|first2=Tanabe | name-list-format = vanc |title=Chronic Exercise-Induced Compartment Syndrome of the Leg|journal=Harvard Orthopaedic Journal|volume=1|issue=7|url=http://www.orthojournalhms.org/volume1/html/articles07.html|access-date=16 October 2014|dead-url=no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924061850/http://www.orthojournalhms.org/volume1/html/articles07.html|archive-date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications===
Failure to relieve the pressure can result in [[necrosis]] of tissue in that compartment, since capillary perfusion will fall leading to increasing [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen deprivation]] of those tissues. This can cause [[Volkmann's contracture]] in affected limbs. As intercompartmental pressure rises during compartment syndrome, perfusion within the compartment is reduced leading to ischemia, which if left untreated, results in necrosis of nerves and muscles of the compartment (Shears, 2006). [[Rhabdomyolysis]] and subsequent [[renal failure]] are also possible complications.

==Causes==

===Acute===
The most common cause of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) are fractures, which account for 69% to 75% of the cases. Leg compartment syndrome is found in 2 to 9% of the [[tibia]]l fractures. There is no difference in incidences of compartment syndrome between open and closed fractures. [[Rhabdomyolysis]] is associated with 23% of the cases. In this case, inflammation and soft tissue swellings would determine the rise of intra-compartmental pressure. Injury to blood vessels such as [[popliteal artery]] have a high incidence of compartment syndrome by reducing blood supply to soft tissues. Such reduction in blood supply can cause a series of inflammatory reactions that promote the swelling of the soft tissues. Such inflammation can be further worsened by [[reperfusion therapy]].&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt; Because the [[fascia]] layer that defines the compartment of the limbs does not stretch, a small amount of [[bleeding]] into the compartment, or [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the muscles within the compartment, can cause the pressure to rise greatly. Other causes such as [[Drug injection|intravenous drug injection]], [[orthopedic cast|cast]]s, prolonged limb compression, [[crush injuries]] and eschars from [[burn]]s can also cause compartment syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid18186372"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konstantakos EK, Dalstrom DJ, Nelles ME, Laughlin RT, Prayson MJ | title = Diagnosis and management of extremity compartment syndromes: an orthopaedic perspective | journal = The American Surgeon | volume = 73 | issue = 12 | pages = 1199–209 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18186372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17906430"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salcido R, Lepre SJ | title = Compartment syndrome: wound care considerations | journal = Advances in Skin &amp; Wound Care | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 559–65; quiz 566-7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17906430 | doi = 10.1097/01.ASW.0000294758.82178.45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare causes of compartment syndrome are: gluteal compartment syndrome due to injury to [[superior gluteal artery]], and those with [[anticoagulant]] therapy has increase risk of bleeding into a closed compartment.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

[[Abdominal compartment syndrome]] occurs when the intra-abdominal pressure exceeds 20 mmHg and abdominal perfusion pressure is less than 60 mmHg, associated with organ dysfunction and organ failures. There are three causes of abdominal compartment syndrome: primary (haemorrhage and organ odema), secondary (vigorous [[fluid replacement]] which causes formation of [[ascites]] and rise in intra-abdominal pressure), and recurrent (compartment syndrome recurred after the treatment of secondary compartment syndrome).&lt;ref name="pmid18382196"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maerz L, Kaplan LJ | title = Abdominal compartment syndrome | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = S212-5 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18382196 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318168e333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic===
When compartment syndrome is caused by repetitive use of the muscles, it is known as chronic compartment syndrome (CCS).&lt;ref name="pmid18063715"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wanich T, Hodgkins C, Columbier JA, Muraski E, Kennedy JG | title = Cycling injuries of the lower extremity | journal = The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 748–56 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18063715 | url = http://www.jaaos.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18063715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17992173"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verleisdonk EJ | title = The exertional compartment syndrome: A review of the literature | journal = Ortopedia, Traumatologia, Rehabilitacja | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 626–31 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 17992173 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually not an emergency, but the loss of circulation can cause temporary or permanent damage to nearby nerves and muscles.

Complementary to chronic compartment syndrome is another subset known as chronic exertional compartment syndrome CECS, often called exercise induced compartment syndrome EICS.&lt;ref name=pmid15039267&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cetinus E, Uzel M, Bilgiç E, Karaoguz A, Herdem M | title = Exercise induced compartment syndrome in a professional footballer | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–9 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15039267 | pmc = 1724759 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2003.004630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CECS of the leg is a condition caused by exercise which results in increased tissue pressure within a limited fibro-osseous compartment&amp;nbsp;– muscle size may increase by up to 20% during exercise.&lt;ref name=pmid10222542&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touliopolous S, Hershman EB | title = Lower leg pain.

This is commonly seen in athletes who train rigorously in activities that involve constant repetitive actions or motions.&lt;ref name=pmid15039267/&gt; In athletic popular culture there is a catchphrase, "Feel the burn," which references these conditions as something to strive for when training, weightlifting or otherwise working out. They are not understood as symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Why-Muscles-Burn-When-Working-Out-7170096 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-23 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115051947/http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Why-Muscles-Burn-When-Working-Out-7170096 |archive-date=2017-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms involve numbness or a tingling sensation in the area most affected.

==Pathophysiology==
In a normal human body, blood flow from the artery to vein requires a pressure gradient. When this pressure gradient is diminished, blood flow from the artery to the vein is reduced. This causes excessive fluid to go out from the capillary wall into spaces between the soft tissues cells, causing oedema and rise in intra-compartmental pressure. Swelling of the soft tissues compresses the blood and lymphatic vessels further, causing more fluid to enter the intercellular spaces, leading to more compression, eventually leading to lack of oxygen in the soft tissues (tissue [[ischaemia]]) and tissue death ([[necrosis]]). Tingling and abnormal sensation ([[paraesthesia]]) can begin as early as 30 minutes from the start of tissue ischemia and permanent damage can occur as early as 12 hours post onset.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Apart from the typical signs and symptoms, measurement of intra-compartmental pressure is also important for diagnosis. A transducer connected to a catheter is inserted 5&amp;nbsp;cm into the zone of injury.&lt;ref name="Don2014"/&gt; A pressure higher than 30 mmHg of the [[diastolic pressure]]  in conscious or unconscious person is associated with compartment syndrome; and fasciotomy is indicated. For those with hypotension, a pressure of 20 mmHg higher than the intra-compartmental pressure is associated with compartmental syndrome.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

Most commonly compartment syndrome is diagnosed through a diagnosis of its underlying cause and not the condition itself.  According to Blackman one of the tools to diagnose compartment syndrome is X-ray to show a tibia/fibula fracture, which when combined with numbness of the extremities is enough to confirm the presence of compartment syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid10730989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackman PG | title = A review of chronic exertional compartment syndrome in the lower leg | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 32 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S4-10 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10730989 | doi = 10.1249/00005768-200003001-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Acute===
Any [[orthopedic cast]]s or dressing applied on the affected limb should be removed. Cutting of cast will reduce the intra-compartmental pressure by 65%, followed by 10 to 20% pressure reduction once padding is cut. After the cast removal, the limb should be placed at the heart level for adequate perfusion. The vital signs of the patient should be closely monitored. If the clinical condition does not improve, then [[fasciotomy]] is indicated to decompress the compartments. An incision large enough to decompress all the compartments is necessary. Such procedure is performed inside an [[operating theatre]] under general or local anaesthesia.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt; However, the timing of wound closure is still debatable. Wound edges need to be debrided and irrigated before closure. Usually, wound closure would be done seven days after fasciotomy.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

===Chronic===
Chronic compartment syndrome in the lower leg can be treated conservatively or surgically. Conservative treatment includes rest, anti-inflammatories, and manual decompression. Elevation of the affected limb in patients with compartment syndrome is contraindicated, as this leads to decreased vascular perfusion of the affected region. Ideally, the affected limb should be positioned at the level of the heart. The use of devices that apply external pressure to the area, such as splints, casts, and tight wound dressings, should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer RS, White KK, Smith JM, Groppo ER, Mubarak SJ, Hargens AR | title = Intramuscular and blood pressures in legs positioned in the hemilithotomy position : clarification of risk factors for well-leg acute compartment syndrome | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Surgery is the most effective treatment for compartment syndrome. Incisions are made in the affected muscle compartments so that they will decompress. This decompression will relieve the pressure on the venules and lymphatic vessels, and will increase bloodflow throughout the muscle. Left untreated, chronic compartment syndrome can develop into the acute syndrome and lead to permanent [[muscle]] and [[nerve]] damage.

A military study conducted in 2012 found that teaching individuals with lower leg chronic exertional compartment syndrome to change their running stride to a forefoot running technique abated symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diebal AR, Gregory R, Alitz C, Gerber JP | title = Forefoot running improves pain and disability associated with chronic exertional compartment syndrome | journal = The American Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1060–7 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22427621 | doi = 10.1177/0363546512439182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow up studies are needed to confirm the finding of this study.

[[Hyperbaric medicine|Hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] has been suggested by case reports&amp;nbsp;– though as of 2011 not proven in controlled randomized trials&amp;nbsp;– to be an effective adjunctive therapy for crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischemias, by improving wound healing and reducing the need for repetitive surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhms.org/ResourceLibrary/Indications/CrushInjury/tabid/274/Default.aspx |title=Crush Injury, Compartment syndrome, and other Acute Traumatic Ischemias | author = Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society |access-date= |dead-url=yes  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508193828/http://www.uhms.org/ResourceLibrary/Indications/CrushInjury/tabid/274/Default.aspx |archive-date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouachour G, Cronier P, Gouello JP, Toulemonde JL, Talha A, Alquier P | title = Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of crush injuries: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial | journal = The Journal of Trauma | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 333–9 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8760546 | doi = 10.1097/00005373-199608000-00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
A mortality rate of 47% has been reported for acute compartment syndrome of the thigh. According to one study the rate of [[fasciotomy]] varied from 2% to 24%.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The annual incidence of acute compartment syndrome is 1 to 7.3 per 100,000. Men are ten times more likely than women to develop ACS. Mean age for ACS in men is 30 years. Meanwhile for women, the mean age is 44 years.&lt;ref name="Alessio 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Via AG, Oliva F, Spoliti M, Maffulli N | title = Acute compartment syndrome | journal = Muscles, Ligaments and Tendons Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–22 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25878982 | pmc = 4396671 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1343">'''Deglycyrrhizinated licorice''', or '''DGL''' or '''GutGard''', is an [[herbal supplement]] typically used in the treatment of [[gastric ulcer|gastric]] and [[duodenal]] [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]. It is made from [[licorice]] from which the [[glycyrrhizin]] has been removed.

Deglycyrrhizinated liquorice plus antacid is marketed in [[Europe]], [[South Africa]], and [[Canada]], as the medicinal preparation [[Caved-S]]. In the [[United States]], DGL is marketed as an [[herbal supplement]].

==Research==
Glycyrrhizin is known to cause negative [[side effects]], such as [[hypertension]] and [[edema]]; removing the glycyrrhizin is meant to avoid these symptoms.

According to [[MedlinePlus]] and the ''Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database'', licorice is "possibly effective" for [[dyspepsia]] in combination with other herbs, but there is "insufficient evidence" to rate its effectiveness for other conditions.&lt;ref name=MLP&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/881.html Licorice]: [[MedlinePlus]] Supplements, [[United States National Library of Medicine]], [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding stomach ulcers, specifically, there is "some evidence...that specially prepared licorice will speed the healing of stomach ulcers".&lt;ref name="MLP" /&gt;

==Midwifery, direct-entry==
[[File:Midwife home appointment.jpg|thumbnail|right|A pregnant woman receives a visit from a midwife in her home.]]

A direct-entry midwife is a midwife who has become credentialed without first becoming a nurse.  There are direct-entry midwifery programs that prepare students to become Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) or Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.midwife.org/midwifery-education-programs|title=pathways to midwifery education|website=ACNM|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://narm.org/certification/history-of-the-development-of-the-cpm/|title=History of the Development of the CPM  {{!}} NARM|website=narm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certified Professional Midwives are known for being "more natural and less intervention oriented."&lt;ref name="autogenerated219"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rausch|first1=Christopher|title=The Midwife and the Forceps;The Wild Terrain of Midwifery Law in the United States and Where North Dakota is Heading in the Birthing Debate|journal=North Dakota Law Review|date=2008|volume=84|issue=I|pages=219–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, these midwives typically work outside of the hospital setting in homes and birth centers and do not employ methods for [[childbirth]] that [[physicians]] in [[hospitals]] commonly use such as [[caesarean section]], [[forceps]] and other types of equipment and drugs.

===Legality of direct-entry midwifery in the United States===

While [http://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-a-direct-entry-midwife_1583.bc direct-entry midwifery] is popular and legal in many cultures around the world, it struggles to gain legality in several states in the U.S. [[Nurse midwife|Nurse-midwives]] can practice legally in all 50 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Status of U.S. Midwives|url=http://mana.org/about-midwives/legal-status-of-us-midwives|website=mana.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Certified Professional Midwives are regulated and licensed in 23 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Catherine|title=American Women: Birthing Babies at Home|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2011940,00.html|website=time.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

23 states don’t regulate Certified Professional Midwives or provide an avenue for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Catherine|title=American Women: Birthing Babies at Home|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2011940,00.html|website=Time.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties for practicing as a midwife without a CNM credential range from a misdemeanor to a Class C Felony.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheyney|first1=Melissa|last2=Everson|first2=Courtney|last3=Burcher|first3=Paul|title=Homebirth Transfers in the United States: Narratives of Risk, Fear, and Mutual Accommodation|journal=Qualitative Health Research|date=March 2014|volume=443|issue=24|url=http://qhr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/443.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states include [[Alabama]], [[Connecticut]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Nevada]], [[North Carolina]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]] and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State By State|url=https://mana.org/about-midwives/state-by-state|website=mana.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Dakota, for instance, is one of many states that have no official laws regulating or prohibiting the practice of midwives without a CNM credential. States can unintentionally encourage issues with midwifery by not providing standards or licensure opportunities to ensure the competency of midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rausch|first1=Christopher|title=The Midwife and The Forceps: The Wild Terrain of Midwifery Law in the  United States and Where North Dakota is Heading in the Birthing Debate|journal=North Dakota Law Review|date=2008|volume=84|issue=1|pages=219–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, practicing midwifery without having a CNM credential in these states is basically equivalent to practicing medicine without a license and has severe penalties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated219"/&gt;

Some states, while they regulate the profession, make it very difficult for midwives to obtain licenses to perform. Hawaii is one of these states. While Certified Professional  Midwifery is legal in [[Hawaii]], licensure has been deemed too expensive and is unavailable to most, according to the [[Midwives Alliance of North America]]. [[Delaware]] is another state that, while it regulates the profession, sets up obstacles that make it difficult for CPMs to practice in the state. Theoretically, Delaware CPMs are able to obtain a permit to practice, but one hasn’t been issued since 2007.

===The decline of midwifery in the United States ===
The decline of midwifery in the [[United States]] can be contributed to a number of complex factors: the rise of the American Medical Association and the growth of hospitals in the country in the late 1800s and early 1900s shifted births from the home to the hospital.&lt;ref name="tulane14"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crilley|first1=Claire|title="The midwife must be abolished!":  The Fall of Midwifery in Mid-Twentieth Century New Orleans|journal=Newcomb College Institute Research on Women, Gender, &amp; Feminism|date=July 2014|volume=1|issue=2|pages=14–20|url=https://library.tulane.edu/journals/index.php/NAJ/article/view/199/142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fall can also be attributed to the movement toward universities teaching gynecology and surgery as well as advancements in technology such as [[anesthesia]] and forceps. All of this led physicians to see midwives as competition instead of partners. They were also worried about what people would think about doctors if it appeared that anyone so uneducated could perform the work of a medical professional.&lt;ref name="autogenerated219"/&gt;
During this time period, organized medicine launched a  campaign to convince the public that hospital births were the best option, while painting midwives as unintelligent, untrustworthy and criminal.&lt;ref name="tulane14"/&gt; However, it wasn’t just physicians who joined in the campaign against midwifery – by the late nineteenth century, wealthy, [[pregnant]] women joined in because they though childbirth was less painful and safer if performed by physicians&lt;ref name="autogenerated307"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=Sarah Anne|title=Born by the Woman, Caught by the Midwife: The Case for Legalizing Direct-entry Midwifery in all 50 States|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine|date=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=307–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The case for legalizing certified professional midwifery===

Statistics show that American women want alternatives to hospital births. 20 percent of women indicated in a study in 2006 that if they have the option to have a non-hospital delivery with readily available medical backup, they would take it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated307"/&gt;
The State of the World’s Midwifery report supports the profession, urging governments to recognize it as vital to maternal and newborn health services. It also urges governments to consider establishing a scope of practice, specified credentials for entering the profession and educational standards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated323"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandall|first1=Jane|title=Every Woman Needs a Midwife, and Some Women Need a Doctor Too|journal=Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care|date=December 2012|volume=39|issue=4|pages=323–326|doi=10.1111/birt.12010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those who argue for the legalization of direct-entry midwifery also cite its health benefits, both to the mother and the fetus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated323"/&gt;
Women who give birth in hospitals experience higher risks and adverse effects than women who give birth with a midwife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakala|first1=Carol|last2=Corry|first2=Maureen|title=Evidence-Based Maternity Care:  What It Is and What It Can Achieve|journal=Childbirth Connection|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also show that the use of midwives in childbirth can decrease maternal and newborn mortality as well as stillbirths, perineal trauma, instrumental births, intrapartum analgesia and anesthesia, severe blood loss, preterm births, newborn infants with low birth weigh, hypothermia and neonatal intensive care units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ten Hoope-Bender|first1=Petra|title=Improvement of maternal and newborn health through midwifery|journal=Lancet|date=2014|pages=1226–1235|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60930-2|volume=384|issue=9949}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also indications that midwife assisted childbirth is safer than birth in a hospital because there’s a lower chance of intervention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated307"/&gt;

===The case against legalizing certified professional midwifery===
Those debating against the legalization of certified professional midwives usually question the competence, regulation and scope of midwives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated307"/&gt; Questions regarding whether CPMs should be legally recognized as birth attendants, what their job should allow them to do, and who is responsible for their regulation surface.&lt;ref name="autogenerated307"/&gt; Health care professional also cite recent studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1501738#t=article&lt;/ref&gt; that have shown that hospital births have lower rates of perinatal death, neonatal death, 5-minute Apgar scores &lt; 4, and neonatal seizures when compared to planned out-of-hospital births, including those with a midwife. Also of note, while hospital births are associated with higher rates of intervention such as forceps, labor induction, labor augmentation, and cesarean delivery, the data is skewed, as midwives do not have the necessary training to use the aforementioned techniques when deemed medically necessary.

===Common routes for licensure===

Many CPMs also support regulation and licensure because they believe limitations on a legalized profession would outweigh having to operation under the threat of prosecution in states where the profession is illegal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated219"/&gt; For instance, to qualify for licensure in [[California]], a midwife must complete a three-year postsecondary midwifery education program and pass a licensing examination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated219"/&gt;
In [[Minnesota]], licensed midwives are required to screen potential clients, and only accept those who are expected to have a “normal” delivery. In 1994, the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) formed, as it recognized a need for direct-entry midwives to obtain national certification. State regulation of direct-entry midwifery was varied, and the professional associated realized the professional needed certification standards. As of 1994, direct-entry midwives can receive certification through NARM and be designed as certified professional midwives (CPMs). Now, for states that regulate the profession, most of them require midwifery candidates to take the NARM exam and complete NARM certification before receiving a license from the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stover|first1=Sarah|title=Born by the Woman, Caught by the Midwife: The Case for Legalizing Direct-Entry Midwifery in All Fifty States|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine|date=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=307–351.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however certification and licensure is only recognized in states that legalize and recognize midwifery.” In order to be recognized as a CPM by NARM, a midwife must meet three criteria: meet all education requirements and pass a certification exam; meet minimum experience requirements; document proficiency in all midwifery skills (Stover, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;325). This can take anywhere between three and five years. This certification also must be renewed every three years.

==Legality==
Double-dead meat comes from pigs that died from disease which are illegally cut up for sale. This meat has a dark hide and the hairs of the skin remains stuck to the fat even if it is dipped in boiling water. Hot meat on the other hand can be fit for human consumption but did not pass the necessary sanitary standards.&lt;ref name="1000 tons"/&gt; The sale of double-dead meat is against the law in the Philippines, where under the Republic Act 9296 also known as the Meat Inspection Code and specifically the Consumer Act of the Philippines, a violator faces the penalty of a fine amounting to between [[Philippine peso|Php]] 1,000.00 and Php 10,000.00 plus not less than six months but not more than five years [[imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="pigsite"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Authorities charge man caught transporting double dead meat in Pasay | publisher =GMANews.tv | date = 2008-10-15 |url =http://www.gmanews.tv/story/127155/(Update)-Authorities-charge-man-caught-transporting-double-dead-meat-in-Pasay | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) is tasked to monitor the meat industry process from the slaughterhouse to the markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=33:economy&amp;id=2155:govt-to-monitor-markets-slaughterhouses-to-prevent-sale-of-double-dead-meat&amp;Itemid=60|title=Govt to monitor markets, slaughterhouses to prevent sale of double-dead meat|last=Ng|first=Jennifer A.|date=2008-11-19|publisher=Business Mirror|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also able to confiscate meat products that were unable to pass their standards.

== In popular culture ==

An episode of ''[[Bitag]]'', an investigative television program hosted by [[Ben Tulfo]] investigated a case of hot meat commerce in [[Bulacan]]. The suspected [[slaughterhouse]] was promptly raided by the authorities.

Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ignacio R. Bunye described an [[Impeachment#Philippines|impeachment complaint]] in 2006 against President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as double dead meat and that it was in the best interest of the Philippines to "bury it" and move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/news/default.asp?i=15517|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185717/http://www.gov.ph/news/default.asp?i=15517|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-03|title=Bunye laughs off new impeachment complaint as 'double dead meat'|date=2006-06-28|publisher=Official Website of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=2009-03-16}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1940s fisherman Henrique Penna from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] reported that he had discovered cases of [[leishmaniasis]] in Brazil's countryside.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  The disease had not been previously detected in Brazil, and as a response, [[Carlos Chagas]] of the [[Oswaldo Cruz Institute]] organized a commission leishmaniasis to be headed by his son Evandro Chagas.

In 1938 this commission became the ''Instituto de Pathologia Experimental do Norte'', or Northern Institution for Experimental Pathology (IPEN), with a mission to study leishmaniasis and other regional diseases. In 1940 Evandro Chagas died in a plane crash. To acknowledge his work as a scientist, the government changed the name of the former IPEN into the Evandro Chagas Institute.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.pa.gov.br/en/iechistory.htm |title=History |author= |date= |work=About IEC |publisher=Evandro Chagas Institute |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The IEC organized local volunteers to participate in the [[iPrEx]] study, which was a [[clinical trial]] testing the efficacy of a drug used as a [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] against HIV infection.

[[File:Head of Feronia (cropped).jpg|thumb|Head identified as Feronia ''(Archaeologic Museum of Rieti)'']]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Feronia''' was a goddess associated with wildlife, fertility, health, and abundance. As the goddess who granted freedom to slaves or civil rights to the most humble part of society, she was especially honored among [[plebeians]] and [[freedmen]]. Her festival, the ''Feroniae'', was November&amp;nbsp;13 (the ''[[ides (calendar)|ides]]'' of November) during the ''[[Ludi]] Plebeii'' ("[[Ludi Plebeii|Plebeian Games]]"), in conjunction with [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Fortuna Primigenia]]; both were goddesses of [[Praeneste]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]]. (1908). ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'', pp.&amp;nbsp;252–254. London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Dorcey. (1992). ''The Cult of Silvanus: A study in Roman folk religion'', p.&amp;nbsp;7. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Note that the similar-sounding ''[[Feralia]]'' on February&amp;nbsp;21 is a festival of [[Jupiter (mythology)#Epithets of Jupiter|Jupiter Feretrius]], not Feronia.

==Etymology==
Feronia's name is derived from a [[Sabine]] adjective corresponding to Latin ''fĕrus''.&lt;!-- incomprehensible -- or (shqip Albanian) Fero.nia.(i her fero) or/.like.exmpl"Apollonia (i her Apollo)". .Tuscany. tosk.,--&gt; ''Feronia'' comes from Etruscan, but with a long vowel, i.e. ''Fērōnǐa''. The root ''fer'' has cognate words in every [[Indo-European language]] (e.g. Greek θήρ, θήριον) and is also the root of the [[Vedic]] god [[Rudra|Rudrá]]’s name. [[Latin language|Latin]] ''fĕrus'' means "not cultivated, untamed" (''Thesaurus Linguae Latinae''), "of the field, wood", "untamed", "not mitigated by any cultivation" (Forcellini ''Totius Latinatis Lexicon'') which fits the environment of the sanctuaries of Feronia and is very close to ''rudis'' (rude).

Feronia is one of the Roman and Italic goddesses whose name is formed by a root ending with the suffix ''-ona'' or ''-onia''. This form of a noun denotes a difficult or dangerous state or condition: The deity is a sovereign of that danger, only to help man to best avoid damage or get the greatest advantage, such as [[Angerona]] for the ''angusti dies'' near the winter solstice.

==Myths and functions==
Many versions of Feronia’s [[Cult (religion)|cult]] have been supposed, and it is not quite clear that she was only one goddess or had only one function in ancient times. Some Latins believed Feronia to be a harvest goddess, and honoured her with the [[Harvest festival|harvest firstfruits]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] xxvi.11.8.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to secure a good harvest the following year.

Festus's entry on the ''picus Feronius''&lt;ref&gt;Festus p.&amp;nbsp;308 L&lt;up&gt;2&lt;/up&gt; as cited by Dumézil p.&amp;nbsp;363.&lt;/ref&gt; of Trebula Mutuesca testifies the goddess had also prophetic qualities among the [[Sabines]], as did the ''picus martius'' of Tiora Matiena ascribed to the [[Indigenous peoples of Europe|Aborigines]]. Feronia also served as a goddess of travellers, fire,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and waters.

===Freedmen and Libertas===
[[Varro]] identified Feronia with [[Libertas]], the goddess who personified Liberty.&lt;ref name="servius8"&gt;[[Servius]], in his note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.564, says that Varro called the goddess Liberty ''Feronia'' or ''Fidonia''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Servius]], Feronia was a [[tutelary deity|tutelary goddess]] of freedmen (''dea libertorum'').&lt;ref name="servius8"/&gt; A stone at the Terracina shrine was inscribed "let deserving slaves sit down so that they may stand up free." [[Livy]] notes&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.1.18.&lt;/ref&gt; that in 217&amp;nbsp;BCE freed women collected money as a gift for Feronia.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus'', p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some sources state that slaves were set free at her temple near Terracina.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1966, volume&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabine tribal patron===
She was among the deities that Sabine [[moneyer]]s placed on their coins to honor their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Gary D. Farney, ''Ethnic Identity and Aristocratic competition in Republican Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt; She may have been introduced into Roman religious practice when [[Manius Curius Dentatus]] conquered [[Sabinum]] in the early 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Farney, ''Ethnic Identity'', p.&amp;nbsp;286, citing Coarelli.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insistence on wild places===
Two stories about her sanctuary of Terracina highlight the character of Feronia as goddess of the wilderness: Servius writes that when a fire destroyed her wood and the locals were about moving the statues to another location, the burnt wood suddenly turned green.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' VII 800 as cited by Dumézil 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny states that all attempts at building towers in times of war between Terracina and the sanctuary of Feronia have been abandoned because all are without exception destroyed by lightning bolts.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Natural History'' II 146 as cited by Dumézil 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;362.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess thus refused any continuity and linkage with the nearby town.

===Role in the Aeneid===
In [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', troops from [[Feronia (Etruria)|Feronia's grove]] fight on the side of [[Turnus]] against [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.800.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arcadian king [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] recalls how in his youth he killed a son of Feronia, [[Erulus]], who like [[Geryon]] had a triple body and a triple soul; Evander thus had to kill him thrice.&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 8.564, and Servius's note to the passage.&lt;/ref&gt; Vergil identifies Erulus as the king of [[Praeneste]], but he is otherwise unknown in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Fratantuono, ''Madness Unchained: A Reading of Virgil's Aeneid'' (Lexington Books, 2007), pp.&amp;nbsp;242 and 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dumézil's interpretation===
[[Georges Dumézil]]&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil ''La religione romana arcaica''. Con un'appendice sulla religione degli Etruschi Edizione e traduzione a cura di Furio Jesi: Milano Rizzoli 1977 (Italian translation conducted on an expanded version of the 2nd edition of ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris Payot 1974) pp.&amp;nbsp;361-366.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Feronia to be a goddess of wilderness, of untamed nature, and nature's vital forces &amp;ndash; but honoured because she offers man the opportunity to put those forces to good use in acquiring nurture, health and fertility. She fecundates and heals, therefore despite her being  worshipped only in the wild she receive the first-fruits of the harvest, because she permits men to domesticate the wild forces of vegetation, favouring the transformation of that which is uncouth into that which is cultivated. 

Dumézil compares her to Vedic god [[Rudra]]: He is similar to Feronia in that he represents that which has not yet been transformed by civilization &amp;ndash; he is the god of the ''rude'', of the jungle, at one time dangerous and uniquely useful, healer thanks to the herbs within his domain, protector of the freed slaves and of the outcast. Feronia, though, has only the positive or useful function of putting the forces of wild nature at the service of man.

==Cult and cult sites==
[[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] to Feronia are found mostly in central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dorcey, ''The Cult of Feronia'', p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferona's shrines were all located in the wild, far from human settlements. [[Varro]], however, places Feronia in his [[List of Roman deities#Sabine gods|list of Sabine gods]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wHEGcPZZmHwC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Novensides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=30#v=onepage&amp;q=Novensides&amp;f=false 5.74] (Latin).&lt;/ref&gt; who had altars in Rome.

Feronia's cults at [[Aquileia]] and Terracina were near springs that were used in her rites.&lt;ref&gt;Farney, ''Ethnic Identity'', p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Horace]] speaks of the water ''([[lympha]])'' of Feronia, in which "we bathe our face and hands."&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Satires'' 1.5.24, as cited by R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p.&amp;nbsp;480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capena, Etruria===
Her ''lucus'' at Capena was a place where everybody was allowed to come for worship and trade, attracting people from different nations, Sabines, Latins, Etruscans, and others from even farther away. The grove provided everybody with a neutral territory in which peace must not be perturbed.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p.&amp;nbsp;364 citing Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' III 32, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feronia’s temple at the base of [[Mt. Soracte]] which was near Capena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], v: ''Sub monte Soracte urbs est Feronia&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Lucus Feroniae]]'', or "grove of Feronia" ([[Fiano Romano]]) was the site of an annual festival in her honour,&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], v.2.9; Filippo Coarelli, ''I Santuari del Lazio in eta Repubblicana'' (Rome) 1987&lt;/ref&gt; which was in the nature of a trade fair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Otfried Müller]], ''Die Etrusker '' (1828) identified her as a goddess of the marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt; The place, in the territory of [[Capena]] in southwestern [[Etruria]], was plundered of its gold and silver by [[Hannibal]]'s retreating troops in 211 BCE, when he turned aside from the [[Via Salaria]] to visit the sanctuary;&lt;ref&gt;Livy 26.11&lt;/ref&gt; later it became an [[Augustus|Augustan]] ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. Its status as a colony is recorded in a single inscription, copied in a manuscript of the rule of the [[Abbey of Farfa|Farfa Abbey]]&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Vaticanus Latinus'' 6808.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''colonia Iulia Felix Lucoferonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lily Ross Taylor]], "The Site of Lucus Feroniae" ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''10''' (1920), pp.&amp;nbsp;29-36. Taylor identified the site as [[Nazzano]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxur, Terracina===
Another important site was near Anxur ([[Terracina]], southern [[Latium]]), in a wood three Roman miles from the town, where [[Servius]] recorded a joint cult of "the boy Jupiter" (''puer Iuppiter'') under the name of Anxyrus and "Juno the Virgin" (''Iuno virgo''), whom he identifies as Feronia.&lt;ref&gt;Coarelli 1987; Servius, note to ''Aeneid'' 7.799.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to another tradition, slaves who had just been freed might go to the shrine at [[Terracina]] and receive upon their shaved heads the ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'', a hat that symbolized their liberty.

[[File:Largo di Torre Argentina cat 9.jpg|thumb|Ruin of the temple of Feronia at Largo di Torre Argentina]]
===Campus Martius, Rome===
Her temple in the [[Campus Martius]], in what is now [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], was probably located in a grove as well according to an inscription found on the site.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gatti. (1905). ''Notizie degli Scavi'', p.&amp;nbsp;15, cited by Dumézil (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;362.&lt;/ref&gt; It was  established before 217&amp;nbsp;BCE. It may have been dedicated by Curtius Dentatus following his victory over the Sabines. His building program also included the [[Anio Vetus]], a major new [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]], and a number of fountains near the temple.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Stamper, ''The Architecture of Roman Temples: The Republic to the Middle Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late continuation===
[[Charles Godfrey Leland]] found surviving traditions concerning the "witch" Feronia in 19th century 
[[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;Leland, ''Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition'' 1892, ch. III "Feronia"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14962">'''Health in the United States''' refers to the overall health of the population of the United States.

== Infectious disease ==
Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) remain a major public health challenge in the United States. [[Center for Disease Control|CDC]] estimates that there are approximately 19 million new STD infections yearly. The two most commonly reported infectious diseases with 1.5 million total cases (2009) are [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]]. Adolescent girls (15–19 years of age) and young women (20–24 years of age) are especially affected by these two diseases.&lt;ref name = "CDC2011"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/Features/dsSTDData/ Chlamydia and Gonorrhea — Two Most Commonly Reported Infectious Diseases in the United States], CDC, April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chlamydia ===
[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] remains the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States. There were more than 1.2 million cases of chlamydia (1,244,180) reported to CDC in 2009, the largest number of cases ever reported to CDC for any condition.&lt;ref name = "CDC2011"/&gt;

=== Gonorrhea ===
There were 301,174 reported cases of [[gonorrhea]] in 2009 (10 percent less than in 2008)— making gonorrhea the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. In 2009, the gonorrhea rate for women was slightly higher than for men.&lt;ref name = "CDC2011"/&gt;

=== Syphilis ===
In 2009, there were 13,997 reported cases of primary and secondary [[syphilis]] — the most infectious stages of the disease — the highest number of cases since 1995 and an increase over 2007 (11,466 cases).&lt;ref name = "CDC2011"/&gt;

==Vaccination==
The [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] makes scientific recommendations which are generally followed by the federal government, state governments, and private health insurance companies.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

All 50 states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children in order to enroll in public school, but various exemptions are available depending on the state. All states have exemptions for people who have medical contraindications to vaccines, and all states except for California, West Virginia, and Mississippi allow religious exemptions, while eighteen states allow parents to cite personal, conscientious, philosophical, or other objections.&lt;ref name=ncsl&gt;{{cite web|title=States with Religious and Philosophical Exemptions from School Immunization Requirements|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of parents are using religious and philosophical exemptions: researchers have cited this increased use of exemptions as contributing to loss of [[herd immunity]] within these communities, and hence an increasing number of disease outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciolli A | title = Mandatory school vaccinations: the role of tort law | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 129–37 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18827888 | pmc = 2553651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = May T, Silverman RD | title = 'Clustering of exemptions' as a collective action threat to herd immunity | journal = Vaccine | volume = 21 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 1048–51 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12559778 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00627-8 | url = https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/1805/6156/1/Faiola_2014_vizcom.pdf | format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state [[child protective services]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diekema DS | title = Responding to parental refusals of immunization of children | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 1428–31 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15867060 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-0316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

See [[Vaccination schedule]] for the vaccination schedule used in the United States.

Immunizations are often compulsory for military enlistment in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= [[United States Department of Defense]] | title=MilVax homepage |url=http://www.vaccines.army.mil/default.aspx |access-date=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All vaccines recommended by the U.S. government for its citizens are required for [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/i-693|title=Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record|date=|work=USCIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement stirred controversy when it was applied to the [[HPV vaccine]] in July 2008 because of the cost of the vaccine, and because the other thirteen required vaccines prevent diseases which are spread by a respiratory route and are considered highly contagious, while HPV is only spread through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gardasil requirement for immigrants stirs backlash |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122282354408892791 |date=2008-10-01 |access-date=2009-01-18 |author=Jordan M |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, this requirement was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33973646/ns/health-health_care/t/hpv-vaccine-no-longer-required-green-cards/#.WZH6o3eGOV4|title=HPV vaccine no longer required for green cards|date=17 November 2009|website=nbcnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===

The United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox.&lt;ref name="McAllister-Grum_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McAllister-Grum K | title = Pigments and Vaccines: Evaluating the Constitutionality of Targeting Melanin Groups for Mandatory Vaccination | journal = The Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 217–247 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28910223 | doi = 10.1080/01947648.2017.1303288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, Boston had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodge JG, Gostin LO | title = School vaccination requirements: historical, social, and legal perspectives | journal = Kentucky Law Journal | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 831–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 15868682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1855 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school, this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, Pennsylvania in 1895, and later the Midwest, South and Western US. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001 /&gt;

These school vaccination resulted in political debates throughout the United States. An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893 in Chicago, where less than 10 percent of the children were vaccinated despite the twelve year old state law.&lt;ref name=Hodge2001 /&gt; Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to 90% by 1979.&lt;ref name=malone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malone|first=Kevin M|author2=Hinman, Alan R |title=The Public Health Imperative and Individual Rights|journal=Law in Public Health Practice|year=2003|pages=262–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1922 the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case ''Zucht v. King''. The court decided that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health.&lt;ref name=malone /&gt; In 1987, a measles epidemic occurred in Maricopa County, Arizona and  another court case, ''Maricopa County Health Department vs. Harmon'', examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the states need to protect against the spread of disease. The court decided that it is prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles had passed.&lt;ref name=malone /&gt;   
 
Schools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Opt-out criteria is determined at a state level. In the United States, opt-outs take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2015, 47 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Only Mississippi, West Virginia and California do not permit religious exemptions.&lt;ref name=calibill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/california-governor-signs-strict-school-vaccine-legislation/ar-AAcm68T?ocid=ansnewsap11|title=California governor signs strict school vaccine legislation|author=Horowitz, Julia|publisher=Associated Press|date=30 June 2015|access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 states allow personal or philosophical opposition to vaccination.&lt;ref name=ncsl /&gt;

Over the last decade vaccination rates have been declining in the United States. Although the rate is fairly limited on a larger scale, vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks are occurring in pockets across the U.S. “In 2012, exemption rates ranged from a low of approximately 0.45 percent in New Mexico, to a high of 6.5 percent in Oregon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradford|first=W. David|last2=Mandich|first2=Anne|date=August 2015|title=Some State Vaccination Laws Contribute To Greater Exemption Rates And Disease Outbreaks In The United States|url=https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1428|journal=Health Affairs|language=en|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1383–1390|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1428|issn=0278-2715}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The outbreaks have significant correlations with unvaccinated children, and state policy exemption processes. California, which is currently in the process of changing their state exemption policies, dealt with a recent, 2015, measles outbreak stemming from the popular Disneyland park. Significantly, most of the afflicted were unvaccinated, which eventually spread to over 17 separate states across the U.S&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oster|first=Emily|date=July 2016|title=Does Disease Cause Vaccination? Disease Outbreaks and Vaccination Response|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w22464.pdf|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w22464}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If the federal government works to provide an equal vaccination regualtion nationally, immunization rates should begin to rise, while preventable outbreaks should diminish.

==Old age==
In 1790, people over the age of 65 were less than 2% of the American population. In 2017, they are about 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gawande|first1=Atul|title=Being Mortal|date=2014|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|isbn=9781846685828|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Susan George - How the other half dies the real reasons for world hunger.jpeg|200px|right]]
'''''How the Other Half Dies: The Real Reasons for World Hunger''''' is a book by Franco-American activist [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], a member of the [[Transnational Institute]]. It was originally published in 1976, not long after the [[World Food Conference]], and has been reprinted several times since. 

In the book, George examines and disputes two popular ideas: first, that there is not enough food, and second, that the world is over-populated. She argues that the planet could easily feed its present population and many more. She also insists that the problem is not climate change and that food technology will not provide the solution. George instead believes that the problem is that world food supply is controlled by the wealthy elite and that the poor have no say on the terms of trade that keep them hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=Mark |title=In perspective: Susan George |url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj86/obrien.htm |journal=International Socialism |issue=86 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title is a parody of [[Jacob Riis]]'s book ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]''.

'''Inclusive recreation''', also known as adaptive or accessible recreation, is a concept whereby people with [[disabilities]] are given the opportunity to participate in [[recreational]] activities. Through the use of activity modifications and [[assistive technology]], athletes or participants in [[sports]] or other recreational pursuits are able to play alongside their non-disabled peers.  The [[Boy Scouts of America]], for example, has about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled members throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="grolier"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://nbk.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=a2003470-h | title =Boy Scouts | format = | work =The New Book of Knowledge | publisher =Grolier Online | accessdate =2008-02-24}} {{subscription required}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptive methods==

===Activity modifications===
'''Activity modifications''' are changes made to a game or activity that allow all players to have an equal or more equal chance of doing well. One example of an activity modification is a [[wheelchair basketball]] game, where players use [[wheelchairs]]. The players' inability to walk is not a factor in how well they play.

===Assistive devices===
'''Assistive devices''' are any machines or equipment used to level the playing field in a mixed-ability competition, or to allow someone the opportunity to participate that could not do so without its benefit. Good examples of assistive devices are [[swimming pool lift]]s that lower non-ambulatory swimmers into a pool, and [[standing frames]] that allow [[wheelchair]] users to stand up while playing ball. Many municipal governments in the U.S. use adaptive recreation as a way to meet the requirements of the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA), specifically its section dealing with public services. Governments are required by ADA law to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities in order to allow them participation in sports and recreation programs.

4. Some activities require few modifications. Here, wheelchair users participate in glider flying as pilots, at Portmoak Airfield, Scotlandwell, Scotland, UK.

==Programs and models==
Some organizations have the means to establish large programs for many participants in an activity. A plan for creating inclusive recreation may include staff training on inclusive practices, the purchase or construction of universally-accessible equipment, and tracking success and addressing further accessibility needs as they arise. A variety of inclusion concepts and models exist, which may focus on inclusive recreation program content, or on the processes of inclusion themselves. These include the Cincinnati Model for Inclusion, the Supportive Recreation Inclusion (SRI) Model, the Together We Play (TWP) service-delivery model, and the CITI Model, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive Recreation|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736087469|pages=71–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Staff training is a crucial step in managing the success of an inclusive recreation program. A lack of awareness on the part of staff can have a negative impact on recreation participants; for example, assuming inappropriately that a person with a visual-impairment needs to be spoken to in a loud and slow voice can result in the participant disengaging from the activity. Training recommendations may include addressing both negative attitudes and behaviours through "personal contact and interaction", by working with people with disabilities. Staff are encouraged to promote "self-determination" among recreation participants, which "increases a person's learning and sense of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive Recreation|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736087469|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapeutic recreation==
Therapeutic recreation is intended to help a patient adapt to a chronic disabling condition. A certified therapeutic recreation specialist uses their specialized training, along with professional standards, to develop programs that can accommodate the particular needs of patients. Therapeutic recreation may be part of a school's [[special education]] programming, or it may be part of a hospital's, community's, or organization's programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">'''Johannes Burchart I''' (1546-1616), born '''János [[Both family|Both Bélaváry]] de Szikava''' ({{lang-hu|Szikavai és Bélaváry Both János}}), was a [[Baltic German]] [[pharmacist]] and [[druggist]] and the first of a line of doctors and pharmacists who owned the [[Raeapteek]] in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], from 1582 to 1911. He was also lord of [[Haabneeme]] and [[Vanamõisa, Lääne-Viru County|Wannamois]], close to Tallinn.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], son of Ambrose, where his ancestors were lords and barons of the kingdom of Hungary, including [[John Both de Bajna]] (d. 1493), [[ban of Croatia]].

János (Johann) left the kingdom of Hungary after the [[:fr:Bataille de Kerelőszentpál|Battle of Kerelőszentpál]] in 1575, after which [[Stephen Báthory]] ascended the [[Voivode of Transylvania|throne of Transylvania]] and [[Proscription|proscribed]] supporters of [[Gáspár Bekes]]. He took refuge successively in [[Salzburg]] (1575-1578) and [[Munich]] (1578-1580), then went to [[Jelgava]] in [[Latvia]], and finally settled in [[Tallinn]], then in the [[kingdom of Sweden]], in 1580 under the name Burchart. With the permission of the Council of Tallinn, he became on 30 April 1583 the official pharmacist of the city by taking over the [[Raeapteek]], founded by the city in around 1420.

He married Anna von Kampferbeck (d. 1603), daughter of Johann (d. 1562), counselor then Mayor of Tallinn, and granddaughter of Heinrich von Dellingshausen (d. 1525), [[alderman]] of Tallinn (1508-1511). His name, Johannes, was given to the eldest son of each succeeding generation, down to Johann Burchart X.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7774">'''Junhyong Kim''' is the Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn Term Endowed Professor of Biology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the author of over eighty published scientific papers.

==Career==
Kim specializes in computational biology, genomics, and evolutionary biology. Originally from South Korea, he received his undergraduate degree in Microbiology at [[Seoul National University]]. During his undergraduate years, he became strongly interested in computer science and programming. He developed a program to fold tRNA sequences published in the Korean Journal of Biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S.T. | last2 = Kim | first2 = J. | last3 = Kang | first3 = H.S. | year = 1984 | title = A computer program for searching for tRNA gene from base sequences of DNA | url = | journal = Korean Biochemical Journal | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 275–287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper is now known as the first computational biology paper published in Korea. He received his PhD in Ecology and Evolution at [[Stony Brook University]] in 1992 under the supervision of Lev Ginzburg and Dan Dykhuizen. His dissertation was entitled "Factors influencing the growth of populations and their spatial distribution."  His post-doctoral research was with Margaret Kidwell at the [[University of Arizona]] working on molecular evolution of Drosophila species. In 1994, he became an assistant professor in the Department of Biology at [[Yale University]] and was promoted to a tenured position in 2000. In 2002 he moved to the University of Pennsylvania where he is currently the Edmund J. and Louise Kahn Term Endowed Professor in Biology, an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science, and the Co-Director of the [[Penn Genome Frontiers Institute]]. He has been on the Steering Committee and the Conference Chair for [[Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics]]; program chair and program committee for [[ISMB|Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]]; and he is the longest running Associate Editor for [[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics]]. Junhyong Kim's honors include the [[Sloan Foundation]] Young Investigator Award, Yale Faculty Award, Visiting Fellow at the Newton Institute ([[Cambridge University]]) and [[IHES]] (France), [[Ellison Medical Foundation]] Senior Scholar in Aging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kim has worked on a diverse set of research areas. His early works concentrated on mathematical phylogenetics, which started during his graduate school with Drs. [[Robert R. Sokal]] and F. James Rohlf who pioneered computational methods in evolutionary tree estimation. Among his works in this area, Junhyong Kim introduced the use of algebraic geometric techniques in phylogenetic estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = Slicing hyperdimensional oranges: The geometry of phylogenetic estimation | url = | journal = Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 58–75 | doi=10.1006/mpev.2000.0816}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, working with [[John Carlson (biologist)|John Carlson]] at Yale, he developed a novel algorithm for computationally identifying G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR) without using primary sequence homology, which led to the cloning of olfactory receptors in insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his move to Penn, his research as concentrated on comparative functional genomics, especially gene expression and RNA biology in two model systems. In one area, he is working with budding yeast to understand the mechanisms and evolution of timing control for gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Juvenile dermatomyositis''' ('''JDM''') is an [[idiopathic inflammatory myopathy]] (IMM) of presumed [[autoimmune dysfunction]] resulting in muscle weakness among other complications. It manifests itself in children; it is the pediatric counterpart of [[dermatomyositis]].  In JDM, the body's [[immune system]] attacks blood vessels throughout the body, causing [[inflammation]] called [[vasculitis]]. In the [[United States]], the incidence rate of JDMS is approximately 2-3 cases per million children per year. The UK incidence is believed to be between 2-3 per million children per year, with some difference between ethnic groups. The sex ratio (Female : Male) is approximately 2:1.  Other Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies include; '''juvenile [[polymyositis]]''' ('''PM'''), which is rare and not as common in children as in adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
The vasculitis caused by JDMS manifests itself predominantly in two ways:

One is a distinctive [[rash]].  The rash often affects the [[face]], [[eyelid]]s, and [[hand]]s, and sometimes the skin above joints, including the [[knuckle]]s, [[knee]]s, [[elbow]]s, etc. The color of the rash is a pinkish purple, and is called [[heliotropium|heliotrope]] (after a flower of the same name with approximately this color).  On the hands and face, the rash very closely resembles [[allergy|allergies]], [[eczema]], [[fifth disease]], or other more common skin condition, but the heliotrope color is unique to the inflammatory process of JDMS.  Some children develop [[calcinosis]],                                                   which are calcium deposits under the skin.  The rash is the source of the "dermato-" part of the name of the disease.

The second symptom caused by vasculitis is [[muscle inflammation]].  This symptom is the source of the "-myositis" part of the name of the disease ("myo" = muscle, "-itis" = inflammation of).  Muscle Inflammation causes [[muscle weakness]], which can cause [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[Accident-proneness|clumsiness]], not keeping up physically with peers, and eventually inability to perform tasks like climbing stairs, lifting objects, and performing other manual tasks.  Other signs may include falling, [[dysphonia]], or [[dysphagia]].  The muscle weakness often causes a medical misdiagnosis of [[muscular dystrophy]] or other muscle disease.  Some patients develop [[contractures]], when the muscle shortens and causes joints to stay bent; exercise, occupational therapy, and physical therapy can prevent this.  The muscles first affected tend to be [[Distal|proximal]] (i.e., neck, shoulders, back, and abdominal).  About half of children with JDMS also have pain in their muscles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ailments.com/1042/Juvenile_Dermatomyositis.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705212633/http://www.ailments.com/1042/Juvenile_Dermatomyositis.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other symptoms may include irritability, weight loss, and mouth ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1193/mainpageS1193P1.html |title=Juvenile Dermatomyositis &amp;#124; Boston Children's Hospital |publisher=Childrenshospital.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child becomes irritable, fatigued, reluctant to socialize, and the face becomes flushed easily, physicians refer to this constellation of symptoms as "misery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalakas|first=Marinos C.|date=2015-04-30|title=Inflammatory Muscle Diseases|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra1402225|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=18|pages=1734–1747|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1402225|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25923553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progression===
The speed of the progression of JDMS is highly variable.  Nearly all JDM patients have some skin involvement.  The JDMS rash usually occurs as the initial symptom.  Sometimes it is so slight as not to be recognized for what it is until muscle symptoms appear.  Sometimes muscle symptoms never appear at all or occur very gradually over the course of months, and sometimes going from normal strength to being unable to walk within days.  Usually, muscle symptoms appear weeks to months after the onset of the rash.

==Cause==
The underlying cause of JDM is unknown.  It most likely has a [[genetics|genetic]] component, as other [[autoimmune disease]] tend to run in the families of patients.  The disease is usually triggered by a condition that causes immune system activity that does not stop as it should, but the trigger is almost certainly not the cause in most cases. Common triggers include [[immunization]]s, [[infection]]s, injuries, and [[sunburn]].

==Diagnosis==
Proximal muscle weakness, characteristic skin rash and elevated muscle enzymes are routinely used to identify JDM. Typical [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and muscle biopsy changes are considered the next most useful diagnostic criteria, followed by myopathic changes on electromyogram, calcinosis, dysphonia and nailfold capillaroscopy. Other useful criteria include myositis-specific or -related antibodies, nailfold capillaroscopy, factor VIII-related antigen, muscle ultrasound, calcinosis and neopterin.&lt;ref name = Brown2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown VE, Pilkington CA, Feldman BM, Davidson JE |title=An international consensus survey of the diagnostic criteria for juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=990–3 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16467366 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/kel025 |url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/8/990.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Once a diagnosis of JDMS is made, the treatment is often a 3-day course of Intravenous ("pulse") steroids ([[methylprednisolone]], Solu-Medrol), followed by a high dose of oral [[prednisone]] (usually 1–2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight) for several weeks.  This action usually brings the disease under control, lowering most lab tests to or near normal values.  Some minor improvement in muscle symptoms may also be seen in this time, but normally it takes a long time for full muscle strength to be regained.

Once the disease process is under control, oral steroids are tapered gradually to minimize their side effects.  Often, steroid-sparing drugs, such as [[methotrexate]]&lt;ref name="pmid18586175"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feldman BM, Rider LG, Reed AM, Pachman LM |title=Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies of childhood |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9631 |pages=2201–2212 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18586175 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60955-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60955-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[chemotherapy]] drug) or other [[DMARD]]s, are given to compensate for the reduction in oral steroids.  Once the oral steroids are reduced to a less toxic level, the sparing agents can also be gradually withdrawn.  Lab results are closely monitored during the tapering process to ensure that the disease does not recur.

In the cases where steroids or second-line drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective, there are other treatments that can be tried.  These include other chemotherapy drugs, such as [[ciclosporin]], [[infliximab]], or other DMARDs.  Another is [[intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIg), a blood product that has been shown to be very effective against JDMS.

To treat the skin rash, anti-malarial drugs, such as [[hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) are usually given.  Topical steroid creams ([[hydrocortisone]]) may help some patients, and anti-inflammatory creams (such as [[tacrolimus]]) are proving to be very effective. Dry skin caused by the rash can be combatted by regular application of [[sunscreen]] or any moisturizing cream. Most JDM patients are very sensitive to sun exposure, and sunburn may be a disease activity trigger in some, so daily application of high-SPF sunscreen is often recommended.

== Prognosis ==
Of the children diagnosed with and treated for JDM, about half will recover completely. Close to 30 percent will have weakness after the disease resolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemd.com/dermatomyositis/outlook.htm |title=Dermatomyositis: Outlook |publisher=Freemd.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children will go into remission and have their medications eliminated within two years, while others may take longer to respond or have more severe symptoms that take longer to clear up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/j/jdms/ |title=Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) |publisher=Cincinnatichildrens.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common lasting effect of JDM is [[childhood arthritis]].

A '''medical cannabis card''' or '''medical marijuana card''' is a state issued identification card that enables a patient with a [[Medical doctor|doctor]]'s recommendation to obtain, possess, or cultivate [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for medicinal use despite marijuana's lack of the normal [[New drug application (FDA)|Food and Drug Administration]] testing for safety and efficacy. These cards are issued by a state or country in which [[medical cannabis]] is recognized. Typically a patient is required to pay a fee to the state in order to obtain a medical marijuana card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/diseasesconditions/chronicdisease/medicalmarijuanaprogram/pages/noticeofommpfeechanges.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115103850/http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/MedicalMarijuanaProgram/Pages/NOTICEOFOMMPFEECHANGES.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states with medical marijuana card programs, the card is valid for up to 12 months and may be renewed{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. It usually needs another evaluation by the doctor and required to pay card fee again which costs less than initial registration. Legal states also have different requirements for obtaining a medical marijuana card. Medical marijuana cards in the United States are now possible to obtain in 30 states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delgado|first1=Frank|title=An Introduction to MMJ: The Where and What of Medical Marijuana Cards|url=https://mmjrecs.com/an-introduction-to-mmj-the-where-and-what-of-medical-marijuana-cards/|publisher=MMJRecs|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including states with legalized recreational marijuana such as [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] as well as other states such as [[California]] and [[Massachusetts]].

The process of acquiring medical marijuana card may vary with the Specific [[State law (United States)|State's Law]] and Policies. Each of the 30 states does not have unique requirements for obtaining medical marijuana card, need to consult the laws of a specific state to determine.

'''Mexel Industries S.A.''' is a medium-sized [[company (law)|company]] based in [[Verberie]] (Oise), [[France]]. Founded in 1990 to develop solutions to treating the water used for cooling in industrial processes, the company is known for its patented biodegradable organic emulsions, environmentally safe, that act at the interfaces level, between the [[molecules]].

Mexel industries S.A. was awarded the Picardie DRIRE 2005 trophy for sustainable development.
Mexel 432, cited by the IPPC (European Union) as one of the “[[Best Available Technology]] to Industrial Cooling”, in accordance with European regulations is registered by the US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], the [[APVMA]] (Australia) and the OSPAR (Oslo-Paris Convention, Denmark).

== Biofilm removal system ==

Industrial processes experience problems with [[fouling]] from a variety of biological and chemical sources that significantly increase their operating and maintenance costs and decrease their [[efficiency]].

Mexel 432 is injected in [[microdose]] (+ / -5 ppm) for a 30 minute duration once per day. It migrates to the surface and deposits a molecular film (10&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;mm).

The mixture of [[aliphatic]] [[amine]] [[surfactants]] is a micro and macro [[anti-fouling]] material that acts as a [[corrosion inhibitor]] and scale dispersant as well as having activity against [[freshwater]] and [[seawater|saltwater]] [[mussels]] and [[barnacles]]. It [[adsorb]]s to exposed surfaces and forms a protective anti-fouling [[biofilm]] on internal components when present is circulating water. Once the material is absorbed to a surface, [[biofouling]] organisms cannot form an attachment and it remains in place until it degrades, and this minimizes its presence in outfall.

By removing the biofilm from system surfaces, Mexel 432 is effective in inhibiting toxic [[algae]] ([[Naegleria fowleri]]) blooms and growth of [[bacteria]] colonies by species including [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|SRB]], [[Thiosulfate-reducing bacteria|TRB]] and [[legionella]]. Mexel 432 is not sufficiently toxic to kill these [[organism]]s in the [[water]] column, but it retards population growth by eliminating their [[habitat]].

The [[emulsion]] is non-[[oxidant]] and tensioactive.

== Applications ==

Mexel 432 offers a solution for the protection of open and semi open cooling circuits, such as:&lt;br /&gt;
- Thermal, Nuclear and Hydro Power Plants&lt;br /&gt;
- Ships, Industrial Plants (steel&amp; paper, Oil &amp; Gas, refineries, offshore rigs, LPG units)&lt;br /&gt;
- Irrigation, Water Networks, Sewage Plants&lt;br /&gt;
- Desalination Plants&lt;br /&gt;
- Fire fighting systems using fresh or salt water

The Mexel process is today installed in a large number of power stations worldwide.

== Characteristics of Mexel 432 ==

- No impact on the environment&lt;br /&gt;
- Not toxic to Mammals&lt;br /&gt;
- Over two year shelf life&lt;br /&gt;
- Biodegradable&lt;br /&gt;
- Non oxidant&lt;br /&gt;
- Non dispersant&lt;br /&gt;
- Anti fouling&lt;br /&gt;
- Anti scaling

The '''Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale''' (NBAS), also known as the '''Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale''' (BNAS),&lt;ref name = Kaplan&gt;Kaplan, R. M., &amp; Sacuzzo, D. P.(2010). '''Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, &amp; Issues, Eighth Edition.''' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 1973 by Dr. [[T. Berry Brazelton]] and his colleagues. This test purports to provide an index of a newborn's abilities, and is usually given to an infant somewhere between the age of 3 days to 4 weeks old.&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt; This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed [[organism]], even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby's strengths, [[adaptive response]]s and possible [[vulnerabilities]]. This knowledge may help [[parent]]s develop appropriate strategies for [[caring in intimate relationships]] to enhance their earliest relationship with the child.

The Brazelton scale produces a total of 47 scores, of which 27 are behavioral related and 20 are elicited responses. These scores measure a variety of areas including the "neurological, social, and behavioral aspects of a newborn's functioning."&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt; Additionally, "factors such as reflexes, responses to stress, startle reactions, cuddliness, motor maturity, ability to habituate to sensory stimuli, and hand-mouth coordination are all assessed."&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;

Validity evidence is strong for the Brazelton scale, providing a considerable research base. This scale has been used widely as a research tool as well as a diagnostic tool for special purposes. Following is a list of various research projects that have implemented the Brazelton scale:
*"Used to evaluate the effects of low birth weight on premature infants"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Used it to study the effects of cocaine use in pregnancy"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Prenatal alcohol exposure"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Prenatal Iron deficiency"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Prenatal maternal mood"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Prenatal maternal dopamine levels"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Environmental agents"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Parent-infant attachment"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"Gender differences in newborns"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;
*"High-risk neonates"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;

Despite the influence of the Brazelton scale, it has some drawbacks. The biggest is that no norms are available. Therefore, as examiners and researchers say that one infant scored higher than another one, there is no standard sample with which to compare. Further, the scores are not completely understood; further testing is required. As for validity, it has "poorly documented predictive and construct validity."&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt; It also does not do a good job at predicting later intelligence, although the scale is supposed to assess the "infant's role in the mother-infant social relationship"&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt; from which high scores are supposed to presume "high levels of intelligence.".&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;

Therefore, the value of the test is as a research tool and a supplement test to medical testing procedures. But as a predictor of future intelligence, it is very unsatisfactory. Because of this, some wonder what the scale is really measuring.&lt;ref name = Kaplan /&gt;

Training is necessary for effective and reliable administration of the NBAS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">The '''Neuwirth Law''' is a [[France|French]] [[French law|law]] which lifted the ban on [[birth control]] methods on December 28, 1967, including oral contraception. It was passed by the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] on December 19, 1967. The law is named after [[Lucien Neuwirth]], the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] politician who proposed it. It replaced a law from 1920 that not only forbade all forms of contraception, but also information about contraception. The law was not fully implemented until 1972 due to administrative breakdowns.

== Background ==
Following the great losses of the [[First World War]], all birth control means and their promotion had been banned in 1920 to ensure population growth. However, some French people could still get information and products from abroad.&lt;ref name=Causette/&gt; Several proposals had been made to unban birth control before 1966.&lt;ref name=Leridon/&gt; In 1965, legalization of oral contraception was discussed by [[François Mitterrand]] during that year's presidential election, which shocked General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Sébastien Grall, Brigitte Peskine | date = | title = Interview de Mitterrand | trans-title = M.

== History ==
Neuwirth was a long-time opponent to the 1920 law, and faced opposition from the right to repeal it. He met with de Gaulle to provide reasoning for a new bill, and de Gaulle relented in letting one be drafted and considered.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first=National|last=Assembly|title=Lucien Neuwirth - Base de données des députés français depuis 1789 - Assemblée nationale|url=http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/5534|work=www2.assemblee-nationale.fr|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; With some help from the French birth control movement (''Mouvement français du planning familial''&amp;thinsp;), Neuwirth wrote a law draft to legalize birth control in May of 1966.&lt;ref name=LeMonde&gt;{{cite news|language=fr|title=Mort de Lucien Neuwirth auteur de la loi sur la pilule|journal=[[Le Monde]]|date=2013-11-26|issn=1950-6244|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2013/11/26/mort-de-lucien-neuwirth-auteur-de-la-loi-sur-la-pilule_3520184_3382.html|access-date=2017-12-12|author1=André Passeron|author2=Gaëlle Dupont}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neuwirth created a special commission with other members Mitterand and [[Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier]]. This commission brought in various institutions, associations, and scientists including [[Jacques Monod]], [[François Jacob]], [[Alfred Sauvy]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Neuwirth wrote a second bill representing the work of the commission and presented it to the new assembly on April 12, 1967. The assembly debates were sharp, but disciplined.&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Le Bras, « Maîtrise des naissances : vie privée et défi planétaire », ''Concordance des temps'', Broadcast of March 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The critics were mainly the conservatives who relayed the positions of Catholic organizations and ''l’Ordre des médecins'' - a national doctor organization. Debate concentrated around limits and freedom of prescriptions. Proponents for creating limits for contraceptive prescriptions noted the existing requirement on the practice of therapeutic abortion, where the opinion of three doctors was necessary.

Formally proposed during the spring of 1967,&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; the Neuwirth Law, or the ''loi relative à la régulation des naissances et abrogeant les articles L. 648 et L. 649 du code de la santé publique''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi n° 67-1176 du 28 décembre 1967 relative à la régulation des naissances et abrogeant les articles L. 648 et L. 649 du code de la santé publique {{!}} Legifrance|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006068299&amp;dateTexte=19671231|work=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as approved by the joint committee, was passed with [[French communist party|left-wing]] support&lt;ref name=Causette&gt;{{cite news|title=Lulu la Pilule|date=December 2017|journal=Causette|number=84|author=Anna Cuxac|pages=56-57|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 19&amp;nbsp;December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=fr|title=50 ans de la loi Neuwirth : « On ne voit pas tout le chemin parcouru »|date=2017-12-19|author=Gaëlle Dupont|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2017/12/19/50-ans-de-la-loi-neuwirth-on-ne-voit-pas-tout-le-chemin-parcouru_5231655_3224.html|access-date=2017-12-19|website=lemonde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law received support from all of the opposition party and part of the majority party. It was promulgated on 28&amp;nbsp;December under the name ′law relative to birth regulation′.&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; Contraception and the contraceptive pill were authorized by the law but were not reimbursable by [[Social security in France|Social security]].

The relative [[Decree#France|executive decrees]] were blocked by the conservative government, notably Jean Foyer, then minister for Health, some as late as 1974.&lt;ref name=LeMonde/&gt; In the intervening years, oral contraceptives were on the market, but were routinely being prescribed for other purposes. In 1974, contraceptives became reimbursable under Social security.

Today in France, contraception is regulated in articles L5134, R5134 and R2311-13 of the public health code. Abortion was not affected by the Neuwirth Law, and was prohibited until the [[Abortion in France|Veil Law]] of January 17, 1975, which provided for the decriminalization of conditional abortion.

== Consequences ==
Jointly with the [[Simone Veil|Veil Law]] of 1974 which unbanned [[abortion]], the Neuwirth law allowed couples to reduce the number of both wanted and unwanted births,&lt;ref name=Leridon&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/pop_0032-4663_1999_hos_11_1_6981|last1=De Guibert-Lantoine|first1=C.|last2=Leridon |first2=Henri|title=Contraception in France: An Assessment After 30 Years of Liberalization (Population, 4, 1998)|journal=Population, an English selection|number=1|year=1999|pages=89-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a decrease of the fertility from 2.5 to 1.81 children by woman in 1985.&lt;ref name=Regnier&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.ined.fr/fichier/s_rubrique/19107/pesa439.en.pdf|title=After forty years of contraceptive freedom, why so many unplanned pregnancies in France?|first1=Arnaud|last1=Régnier-Loilier|first2=Henri|last2=Leridon|journal=Populations &amp; Societies|number=439|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FDR-Wheelchair-February-1941.jpg|thumb|260px|Rare photograph of Roosevelt in a wheelchair, with Ruthie Bie and [[Fala (dog)|Fala]] (1941)]]

The paralytic illness of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] began in 1921 when the future [[President of the United States]] was 39 years old. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He was diagnosed with [[poliomyelitis]] at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) – an autoimmune neuropathy which Roosevelt's doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility. In 1926, his belief in the benefits of [[hydrotherapy]] led him to found [[Warm Springs Historic District|a rehabilitation center]] at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]. He avoided being seen using his wheelchair in public, but his disability was well known and became a major part of his image. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.

In August 1921, 39-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the time a practicing lawyer in New York, joined his family at their vacation home at [[Campobello Island|Campobello]], a Canadian island off the coast of Maine. As former [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], he had spent two weeks in mid-July in Washington, D.C., giving testimony to a Senate committee investigating a Navy scandal.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collier |first1=Peter |author-link1=Peter Collier (political author) |last2=Horowitz |first2=David |author-link2=David Horowitz |date=1994 |title=The Roosevelts: An American Saga |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster  |isbn=0671652257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247–248}} On August 5, Roosevelt sailed up the New England coast with his friend and new employer, [[Van Lear Black]], on Black's [[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|ocean-going yacht]]. Among those at Campobello when Roosevelt arrived were his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]], their children, his political aide [[Louis Howe]], Howe's wife, and their young son.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tobin |first1=James |title=The Man He Became: How FDR Defied Polio to Win the Presidency |date=2013 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0743265165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–42}}

On August 10, after a day of strenuous activity, Roosevelt came down with an illness characterized by [[fever]], [[paralysis|ascending paralysis]], facial paralysis, prolonged [[bowel]] and [[urinary bladder|bladder]] dysfunction, and numbness and [[dysesthesia|hypersensitivity of the skin]].&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|47}} Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down.

Roosevelt came close to death from the illness. He faced many life-threatening medical problems including the possibility of respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, injury to the urethra or bladder, decubitus ulcers, clots in the leg veins, and malnutrition. Eleanor’s nursing care was responsible for Roosevelt’s survival.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|148–151}}

===Timeline===

'''July 28:''' 
Roosevelt visited the Boy Scout Jamboree at [[Bear Mountain State Park]].

'''August 5–8:''' 
Roosevelt traveled to Campobello on board the yacht ''[[USS Sabalo (SP-225)|Sabolo]]''.

'''August 9:'''
Roosevelt fell into the cold waters of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. Later, arrived at Campobello.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|233}}

'''August 10:'''
Roosevelt spent the day physically active. Afterward, he complained of chills, nausea, and pain in his lower back. He skipped dinner and went to bed. Chills lasted through the night.&lt;ref name="Collier-1994"/&gt;{{rp|252}} &lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|235}}

'''August 11:'''
In the morning, one of his legs felt weak. Roosevelt had fever.
Dr. Eben H. Bennet, a [[general practitioner]] in the nearby village of [[Lubec]] who had known the Roosevelts for years, visited Roosevelt and diagnosed a bad summer cold. By the evening, one leg was paralyzed, and the other had become weak.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|50–51}} &lt;ref name=Ditunno&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1097/00002060-200208000-00001 |vauthors=Ditunno JF, Herbison GJ |title= Franklin D. Roosevelt: diagnosis, clinical course, and rehabilitation from poliomyelitis |journal= Am J Phys Med Rehabil |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=557–66 |year=2002 |pmid=12172063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''August 12:'''
Both legs were paralyzed. His temperature was 102&amp;nbsp;°F. Pain shot through his legs, feet and back.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51, 54}}
Bennet suggested a consultation with Dr. [[William Williams Keen|William W. Keen]], an eminent retired neurosurgeon vacationing nearby.&lt;ref name="Ditunno"/&gt;
Roosevelt's legs were numb. They then became painfully sensitive to touch. He could not pass urine.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt; By evening, his hands were affected.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

'''August 13:'''
Roosevelt was paralyzed from the chest down. On that day and the following, his hands, arms, and shoulders were weak. He had difficulty moving his bowels and required [[enema]]s.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen made what Eleanor described as "a most careful, thorough examination".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|57–58}}

'''August 14:'''
Roosevelt continued to be unable to pass urine for two weeks, and required [[Urinary catheterization|catheterization]]. His fever continued for a total of six to seven days.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}
Keen repeated his examination, a bending and prodding that [[Elliott Roosevelt|Elliott]] later termed "excruciating" for his father.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|58}}
Keen diagnosed a clot of blood to the lower spinal cord, and prescribed massage of the leg muscles.&lt;ref name=Ditunno/&gt;
Eleanor and Howe began massaging Roosevelt's legs as instructed by Keen, bringing on agonizing pain.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 15:'''
Prostrate and mildly sedated, Roosevelt was occasionally delirious.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

'''August 19:'''
Frederic Delano, Roosevelt's uncle, had received a letter from Louis Howe requesting to find a doctor to come see Roosevelt. Delano called his son-in-law, a physician, who recommended he speak to another physician, a Dr. Parker. Parker told Delano that the case sounded like infantile paralysis, and that the leading authorities on the disease were at the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission in Boston. Delano caught a train and arrived the next morning.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

'''August 20:'''
Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] was at his office when Delano telephoned Brigham Hospital on Saturday morning. Levine said the senior members of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission, Dr. Lovett and Dr. Peabody, were out of town, but he would try to answer Delano's questions. After reviewing the messages Delano had received from Campobello, Levine thought Roosevelt was suffering from acute poliomyelitis. He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|64–65,327}} &lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}}
Delano phoned and wrote Eleanor the same day,&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|239}} advising her to stop massaging Roosevelt's legs, and to disregard Keen's advice: "I think it would be very unwise to trust his diagnosis where the Inf. Paralysis can be determined by test of the spinal fluid."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}
Eleanor communicated with Keen, who "very strenuously" resisted the idea of poliomyelitis. Keen asked Lovett to visit Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|66}}

'''August 22:'''
Lovett met Levine for dinner. Lovett asked how to distinguish whether paralysis was caused by poliomyelitis or by a clot or lesion of the spinal cord.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

'''August 23:'''
Lovett left for Campobello.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 24:'''
Lovett saw Roosevelt and performed a "more or less superficial" examination since Roosevelt was highly sensitive to touch. The arms were weak; the bladder was paralyzed; the left thumb indicated atrophy. Roosevelt could not stand or walk, and Lovett documented "scattered weakness, most marked in the hips".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

'''August 25:'''
Roosevelt's temperature was 100&amp;nbsp;°F. Both legs were paralyzed. His back muscles were weak. There was also weakness of the face and left hand. Pain in the legs and inability to urinate continued.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}} 
After a brief conference with Keen, Lovett saw Roosevelt. Lovett informed him that the "physical findings" presented a "perfectly clear" diagnosis of poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|69–70}}
Lovett ordered an end to massage, which had no benefit and caused pain, and recommended a trained nurse to care for Roosevelt.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

'''September 1:'''
Roosevelt was still unable to urinate. His leg pain continued.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''September 14:'''
Roosevelt was transported to New York, by boat and train, a long and painful journey.

'''September 15:'''
Roosevelt was admitted to Presbyterian Hospital in New York City for convalescence, under the care of Dr. [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], an expert on poliomyelitis and Roosevelt's personal physician. Lovett continued to consult from Boston.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|76}}
There was pain in the legs, paralysis of the legs, muscle wasting in the lower [[lumbar]] area and the buttocks, weakness of the right triceps, and gross muscle twitching in both forearms.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|234}}

'''October 28:'''
Roosevelt was transferred from Presbyterian Hospital to his house on East 65th Street. His chart still read "not improving".&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

'''Later:'''
Roosevelt exercised daily. His hamstrings tightened, and his legs were encased in plaster to straighten them by degrees.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|238}}
There was gradual recovery, but he remained paralyzed from the waist down.

=== Diagnosis ===
After falling ill, Roosevelt was seen by four doctors. [[Eben Homer Bennet]], the Roosevelt family doctor, diagnosed a heavy cold. [[William Williams Keen|William Keen]], a retired neurosurgeon, thought Roosevelt had a blood clot. [[Robert Lovett (physician)|Robert Lovett]], an expert on the orthopedic management of children paralyzed from poliomyelitis, diagnosed "infantile paralysis", as did [[George Draper (physician)|George Draper]], Roosevelt's personal physician.

Roosevelt's physicians never mentioned [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, indicating that they were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|204}} All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|203}} In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic flaccid paralysis, it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|232}}

=== Warm Springs ===
[[File:FDR-and-three-polio-patients-Warm-Springs-1925.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt with polio patients in Warm Springs, Georgia (1925)]]
Roosevelt first traveled to [[Warm Springs Historic District|Warm Springs]], Georgia, on October 3, 1924. For many years to come Warm Springs would be where he would retreat in comfort for [[hydrotherapy]]. On April 29, 1926, he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"&gt;{{Cite book |title=FDR’s Splendid Deception |last=Gallagher |first=Hugh |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, Inc |year=1985 |isbn=0918339502 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}} One of Roosevelt's primary goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|222–226}}

=== Governor and President ===
In 1929 Roosevelt was elected Governor of New York and moved into the Governor's Mansion in Albany. Before he moved in, the mansion was made wheelchair-friendly with ramps and an elevator.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|68–87}}

Roosevelt won the Presidential election in 1932 in a landslide victory and became the first, and so far only, disabled person to be President of the United States. Before he moved into the White House, ramps were added to make it wheelchair-friendly. Any pictures of the President were taken at certain angles and at a distance.&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|88–105}}

==Efforts to rehabilitate==
[[File:FDR-Pool-Warm-Springs-1929.jpg|right|thumb|Roosevelt at Warm Springs (1929)]]
Roosevelt was totally and permanently paralyzed from the waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"/&gt;  For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/from-the-castle-fdrs-stamps-144524734/?no-ist |title=From the Castle - FDR's Stamps |author=G. Wayne Clough |magazine=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him to determine the extent of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another.&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"/&gt; He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood]], he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|241}}

In October 1922, Roosevelt visited his law office at the [[Equitable Building (Manhattan)|Equitable Building]], where a welcome-back luncheon had been arranged. The chauffeur assisting him failed to brace the tip of his left crutch and Roosevelt fell onto the highly polished lobby floor. Laughing, he asked two young men in the crowd of onlookers to help get him back on his feet. After the luncheon, he told friends it was a "grand and glorious occasion". He did not return to his office for two months.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Geoffrey C. |authorlink1=Geoffrey Ward |last2=Burns |first2=Ken |authorlink2=Ken Burns |date=2014 |title=The Roosevelts: An Intimate History |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |isbn=9780307700230}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}}

Roosevelt believed that warmth and exercise would help rebuild his legs. He bought a run-down 71-foot houseboat and, in February 1923, sailed to Florida with friends and a small crew. Eleanor found it dull and left, but Roosevelt sailed for weeks, fishing and spending time with a succession of friends who came to visit. He designed a pulley system that lowered him into the water to swim. In May 1923, Lovett documented no overall improvement over the preceding year, but Roosevelt would not accept his doctors' determination that further progress was unlikely. He tried a range of therapies and made two more voyages on his houseboat, but his efforts had no effect.&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|247–249}}

"Between 1925 and 1928, Franklin would spend more than half his time—116 of 208 weeks—away from home, struggling to find a way to regain his feet," wrote biographer [[Geoffrey Ward]]. "Eleanor was with him just 4 of those 116 weeks, and his mother was with him for only 2. His children hardly saw him."&lt;ref name="Burns-2014"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Roosevelt lost the use of his legs and two inches of height, but the subsequent development of the rest of his body gave him a robust physique, and he enjoyed many years of excellent health. [[Jack Dempsey]] praised his upper-body musculature, and Roosevelt once landed a 237-pound shark after fighting it on his line for two hours.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gunther |first=John |authorlink=John Gunther |date=1950 |title=Roosevelt in Retrospect |url=https://archive.org/details/rooseveltinretro00gunt |location=New York |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] |oclc=466356}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241, 266–267}}

With his physiotherapist at Warm Springs, Roosevelt laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso. For this "two-point walk", he would grip the arm of a strong person with his left hand, and brace himself with a cane in his right.

== Social impact ==
Roosevelt was the United States' first disabled president, so there has been discussion concerning how he handled his health. Disability advocate [[Hugh Gallagher (advocate)|Hugh Gallagher]] posited that Roosevelt was desperate to appear able-bodied. When discussing Roosevelt's limited use of a wheelchair in public, Gallagher stated, "This was not by accident. It was a strategy that served to minimize the extent of his handicap, to make it unnoticed when possible and palatable when it was noticed.".&lt;ref name="gallagher-1985"/&gt;{{rp|xiv}} Historian James Tobin argued that Roosevelt used his disability to his advantage. Tobin stated, "But he could, instead, show himself to be something he had never been seen as before: a fighter and, and better yet, an underdog; not a man to pity, not a man to envy, but a man to cheer."&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|273}} Despite any controversy, Roosevelt has become an inspirational figure for disabled people around the world. The [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial|Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] includes a statue of Roosevelt in a wheelchair.

Roosevelt was able to convince many people that he was getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches, Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the podium.

His public appearances were choreographed to avoid the press covering his arrival and departure, which would have shown him getting into or out of a vehicle. When possible, his vehicle was driven into a building's parking garage for his arrivals and departures.  On other occasions, the vehicle would be driven onto a ramp to avoid steps, which Roosevelt was unable to ascend.  When that was not practical, the steps would be covered with a ramp with railings, with Roosevelt using his arms to pull himself upward. When traveling by train, Roosevelt often appeared on the rear platform of the [[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|presidential railroad car]].  When he boarded or disembarked, the private car was sometimes shunted to an area of the railroad yard away from the public for reasons of security and privacy. When Roosevelt's train used a ramp and the president was on a publicly known trip, he insisted on walking on the ramp no matter how difficult.

Journalist [[John Gunther]] reported that in the 1930s he often met people in Europe, including world leaders, who were unaware of Roosevelt's paralysis.&lt;ref name="gunther1950"/&gt;{{rp|239}} [[David Brinkley]], who was a young White House reporter in World War II, stated that the Secret Service actively interfered with photographers who tried to take pictures of Roosevelt in a wheelchair or being moved about by others. The Secret Service commonly destroyed photographs they caught being taken in this manner; however, there were occasional exceptions.&lt;ref name="Pressman Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/07/12/the-myth-of-fdrs-secret-disability/|title=The Myth of FDR's Secret Disability |author=Pressman, Matthew |accessdate=Aug 12, 2013 |work=Time|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748188-2,00.html | work=Time | title=THE PRESIDENCY: New Quarters | date=December 17, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT Goldberg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Richard T. |date=1981 |title=The Making of Franklin D.

===March of Dimes===
{{main|March of Dimes}}

On January 3, 1938, Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt; [[Basil O'Connor]], an attorney and close associate of Roosevelt, helped establish the foundation and was its president for more than three decades.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baghdady |first=Maddock J. |title=Marching to a Different Mission |journal=Stanford Social Innovation Review |year=2008 |pages=60–65 |url=http://www.ssireview.org/images/articles/2008SP_casestudy_baghdady_maddock.pdf |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's annual fundraising campaign coincided with Roosevelt's birthday on January 30. The organization initially focused on the rehabilitation of victims of paralytic polio and supported the work of [[Jonas Salk]] and others that led to the development of [[polio vaccine]]s. Today, the March of Dimes focuses on preventing premature births, congenital disabilities, and infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Baghdady Spring 2008 60–65"/&gt;

Because he founded the March of Dimes, a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] was chosen to honor Roosevelt after his death. The [[Dime (United States coin)#Franklin D.

==Retrospective diagnosis==

===Analysis of symptoms===
A 2003 peer-reviewed study of Roosevelt's paralytic illness, using three diagnostic methods - pattern recognition, reconstructing the pathogenesis, and [[Bayesian analysis]] - favored a diagnosis of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] (GBS) over poliomyelitis.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Goldman AS, Schmalstieg EJ, Freeman DH, Goldman DA, Schmalstieg FC | title=What was the cause of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's paralytic illness? | journal=Journal of Medical Biography | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=232–40 | year=2003 | pmid=14562158 | url=http://www.ehdp.com/out/jmb_2003_v11_p232-240.pdf | doi= | accessdate=2017-07-04 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Bayesian analysis, the best estimate of the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of GBS was 1.3 per 100,000. For paralytic polio in Roosevelt's age group, an annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 1.0 per 100,000 was used. The paralytic polio rate was derived from the exceptionally severe polio epidemic that struck New York City in 1916, to tilt the odds in favor of polio. The prior probability of paralytic polio in Roosevelt’s age group in the United States in 1921 was likely much lower because paralytic polio was at one of its lowest ebbs in the Northeastern region of the country at that time.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|123}} &lt;ref name="History of Vaccines"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/polio |title=History of Polio |date= |website=The History of Vaccines |publisher=[[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|26}} In July 1921, three cases were reported in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 26, 1921 |title=Find Infantile Paralysis; Three Cases Develop in Paterson  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/07/26/archives/find-infantile-paralysis-three-cases-develop-in-paterson-health.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By late August some 100 cases were reported in the state of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 23, 1921 |title=Infantile Paralysis is Spreading Up State  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/08/23/archives/infantile-paralysis-is-spreading-up-state-about-100-cases-are.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rates for GBS and paralytic polio, and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, Roosevelt's symptoms were analyzed by Bayesian analysis to obtain posterior probabilities, as listed below.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Six of eight symptoms favored GBS, with the [[posterior probability]] of GBS shown for each:
* 98% - Roosevelt’s paralysis was symmetric and ascending, and progressed more than four days, whereas the paralysis in poliomyelitis is typically asymmetric, variable in its ascent or descent, and usually progresses for only two to four days. A review of the medical research literature revealed only one report of paralytic polio with a symmetric, ascending paralysis.
* 98% - Roosevelt's numbness and [[hyperesthesia]] rarely if ever occur in paralytic polio (motor neurons affected), but are common in GBS (sensory neurons also affected).
* 98% - A consistent descending pattern of recovery from paralysis is absent in paralytic polio, but common in GBS.
* 97% - Facial paralysis, as Roosevelt had, in the absence of other cranial nerve abnormalities, is not consistent with a polio diagnosis, but is common in GBS.
* 93% - Roosevelt's prolonged bladder and bowel dysfunction are rare in paralytic polio, since polioviruses do not attack autonomic nerves, but are common in GBS.
* 93% - [[Meningismus]] (neck stiffness), a characteristic feature of paralytic polio, was absent in Roosevelt’s case.

Two of eight symptoms favored polio, with the [[posterior probability]] of polio shown for each:
* 99% - Roosevelt had fever up to 102&amp;nbsp;°F (38.9&amp;nbsp;°C), which is rare in GBS, although the pattern of the fever that Roosevelt experienced was atypical of paralytic polio.
* 72% - Roosevelt had permanent paralysis, which occurs in about 50% of paralytic polio survivors, and only about 15% of cases of GBS.

Using all eight symptoms in a Bayesian analysis, based on disease incidence rates and symptom probabilities from the medical literature, the overall probability that Roosevelt had GBS is over 99%.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|242–250}}

===When might exposure have occurred?===
It is possible Roosevelt was exposed to an infectious agent at the Boy Scout Jamboree in late July. The two-week interval before the onset of his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis,&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|13–30}} and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|183}} There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', a major causative agent of GBS.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

===Was Roosevelt predisposed to polio?===
It has been stated that Roosevelt may have been predisposed to paralytic polio by genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|40}} However, such a genetic predisposition has never been discovered.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|195}} Several authors have stated that Roosevelt was more vulnerable to polio since he was raised on an isolated family estate&lt;ref name="NPR Tobin"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/25/247155522/roosevelts-polio-wasn-t-a-secret-he-used-it-to-his-advantage | title=Roosevelt's Polio Wasn't A Secret: He Used It To His 'Advantage' | date=November 25, 2013 |website=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had little contact with other children until he entered Groton at age 14. However, Roosevelt was not a "boy in a bubble". He had many possible exposures to polioviruses before 1921. Most polio cases are asymptomatic or a mild illness. Yet those asymptomatic individuals can transmit the viral infection.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|109}} When the prior probability of paralytic polio was artificially made 100-fold higher, to 99.4%, overall Bayesian analysis of Roosevelt's symptoms still greatly favored GBS (99.97% posterior probability). Roosevelt’s symptoms are typical of GBS, not of paralytic polio, so they overwhelm the initial prior probability.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Was a lumbar puncture done?===
A 2014 book argued that a lumbar puncture was done, based on excerpts from an "unpublished note" by Dr. [[Samuel A. Levine]] of the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission. The book stated, "Levine's private note indicates that Dr. Lovett did examine the cerebrospinal fluid and knew very well that a high level of white blood cells was consistent with poliomyelitis. . . . If Lovett had discovered a low white blood cell count, he would have doubted that poliomyelitis was the cause of Roosevelt's illness. Yet Lovett wrote George Draper that "I thought [the diagnosis] was perfectly clear as far as the physical findings were concerned.""&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|327–328}}

A 2017 book finally published the note. Based on the full text, the note was not found to support the idea that a spinal tap was performed, because: 
1) The note, written many years after 1921, had many errors. 
2) Levine never saw Roosevelt. 
3) Levine did not mention who did the procedure, or the results. 
4) Lovett had made it clear he would not do the procedure. 
5) None of Roosevelt's physicians at Campobello were equipped to do the procedure. 
6) "Physical findings" means information gained from a physical examination of the patient. Lovett described many "physical findings": hyperesthesia, facial paralysis, etc. But neither he, any of Roosevelt's other physicians at Campobello, Roosevelt, Eleanor, nor any of Roosevelt's associates ever said that a spinal tap was done.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Goldman | first1=Armond S. | last2=Goldman | first2=Daniel A. | date=2017 | title=Prisoners of Time: The Misdiagnosis of FDR's 1921 Illness | publisher=EHDP Press | isbn=978-1939824035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183–201}}

The 2017 book went on to say: "Given the invasive nature of a spinal tap, and the difficulty that would have occurred doing the procedure on a patient in FDR’s condition, it seems highly unlikely that a direct observer would have failed to mention anything about it. . . . Even if a spinal tap had been performed, it would have been done at the earliest about 15 days after the onset of the neurological illness, around when Lovett first saw Roosevelt. . . . One should keep in mind that the classical distinction between paralytic polio and GBS, the concentrations of leukocytes and total protein in CSF, blurs after the first several days of the onset of paralysis in both diseases."&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|193,198}}

== Could the outcome have been changed? ==
"In any event, there was no cure for either disease in 1921," [[The Defining Moment|wrote]] biographer [[Jonathan Alter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alter |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |date=2007 |title=The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=355 |isbn=9780743246019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Levine mistakenly thought that the main benefit of a spinal tap, if done, would be to improve the outcome by lowering elevated CSF pressure.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|192}} And even today, some authors mistakenly believe that Roosevelt's paralysis, assuming a polio diagnosis, could have been prevented with early intervention.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;{{rp|45,49,62,66}} However, there is no objective evidence that a spinal tap lessens the possibility of paralysis in polio. And it is unlikely Roosevelt's physicians would have tried human serum injections into the CSF, or that such injections would have helped. Lovett did not think the injections were useful, and there were alarming meningeal symptoms associated with them, probably secondary to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes.&lt;ref name="pot-2017"/&gt;{{rp|199–200}} Concerning GBS, virtually all of the effective measures that are currently standard practice for the medical management of GBS were not developed until many decades after Roosevelt's 1921 illness, so Roosevelt's prognosis would not have improved even if GBS had been diagnosed.&lt;ref name="jmb-2003"/&gt;{{rp|238}}

'''Saint Peregrine Laziosi (Pellegrino Latiosi)''' (c. 1260 – 1 May 1345) is an Italian saint of the [[Servite Order]] (Friar Order Servants of Mary). He is the [[patron saint]] for persons suffering from [[cancer]], AIDS, or other illness.

==Life==
Peregrine Laziosi was born around 1260, the only son of an affluent family in [[Forlì]], in northern [[Italy]]. At that time Forli was part of the Papal States. Peregrine's family supported the anti-papal faction. In 1283 the residents of Forlì were under interdict.&lt;ref name=servite&gt;[http://stperegrine.org/biography/ Biography of St. Peregrine, The Order of Friar Servants of Mary]&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Philip Benizi]], Prior General of the Friar Servants of Saint Mary, was sent to try to reconcile the divided community. While trying to preach in Forlì, Philip was heckled and struck by the eighteen-year-old Peregrine. He was driven from the city with insults and violence. Peregrine repented and asked Philip for forgiveness. St. Philip received him with kindness. The moment had a profound effect on Peregrine. Filled with remorse, he began to pray more and to channel his energies into good works. A few years later, he joined the Servites in Siena and went on to be ordained a priest.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1373 Foley OFM, Leonard. ''Saint of the Day: Lives, Lessons, and Feast'' (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:St. Peregrine.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue in the Peregrine Chapel of the Serra Chapel in [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]]]]

After some years he was sent back to Forlì, where he founded a new Servite house there and became well known for his preaching and holiness as well as his devotion to the sick and poor. It is said that he miraculously multiplied grain and wine during a severe shortage in his area.&lt;ref name=servite/&gt; People took to calling him the "Angel of Good Counsel," so grateful were they for his wise advice so freely given.&lt;ref name=fma&gt;[http://www.franciscanmissionassoc.org/requests_stperegrine_story.cfm "The Story of St. Peregrine", Franciscan Mission Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the special penances he imposed on himself was to stand whenever it was not necessary to sit. When tired he would support himself on a choir stall. At the age of sixty he developed an infection in his right leg.&lt;ref name=benburb&gt;[http://www.servites-benburb.com/st_peregrine.php "St. Peregrine OSM", Our Lady of Benburb Priory]&lt;/ref&gt; His condition deteriorated to the point that the physician decided to amputate his leg.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;

The night before the operation Peregrine spent time praying before a fresco of the Crucifixion in the chapter room. He fell into a deep trance-like sleep and seemed to see Jesus descend from the cross to touch his leg.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt;

The following day, the doctor arrived to perform the amputation and finding no sign of the cancer, spread news of the miraculous cure throughout the town. This only increased the people’s regard for Peregrine.  The saint died of a fever on May 1,1345 at the age of eighty five.  An extraordinary number of people from the town and countryside honored him in death.  Some of the sick who came were healed through his intercession.&lt;ref name=servite/&gt;

==Veneration==
His body rests in the Servite church of Forlì, the Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php Basilica of Saint Pellegrino Laziosi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417182044/http://www.basilicasanpellegrinolaziosi.it/old/santo_en.php |date=April 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Paul V declared him blessed in 1609 and Pope Benedict XIII canonized him in 1726.&lt;ref name=servite/&gt; The liturgical feast of Saint Pellegrino/Peregrine is on May 1.

Peregrine is considered the [[patron saint]] of those suffering from [[cancer]]. The National Shrine of Saint Peregrine is located  at Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago, Illinois, as a ministry of the Friar Servants of Mary.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;[http://stperegrine.org/national-shrine/ National Shrine of St. Peregrine, Friar Servants of Mary]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a St. Peregrine Shrine at [[The Grotto]], at The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother, in Portland, Oregon.s. A St. Peregrine Mass is celebrated at The Grotto on the first Saturday of each month at 12 noon in the Chapel of Mary. &lt;ref name=grotto&gt;[http://www.thegrotto.org/about-us/st-peregrine/ The Grotto, The National Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is also a St. Peregrine Shrine in Muntinlupa City in the Philippines. It houses a relic taken from St. Peregrine himself, a rib. It is currently on display in the church's Relic Chapel.  There is a Saint Peregrine Cancer Shrine with Perpetual Eucharistic Adoration at Christ the King Catholic Church in Mesa, Arizona. The mission of this St. Peregrine Shrine is to promote perpetual adoration of Jesus Christ and to pray for those affected by cancer. In the midst of suffering, a sanctuary for spiritual healing and emotional peace is offered. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cancershrine.com/about-us/mission-statement/ | title=Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There also is a statue of St. Peregrine in the Mission church of San Juan Capistrano in southern California.  (One does NOT have to be near a statue to ask St. Peregrine to intercede with God on one's behalf.)

==Legacy==
According to some, the lesson of '''Peregrine’s''' life is not that God worked a miracle, but that a faithful servant placed himself, unconditionally, in the hands of God. Peregrine’s trust in God therefore serves as a model for those dealing with sickness.&lt;ref name=grotto/&gt; However, his recovery has been cited as an example of the potency of the immune system in fighting cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmj.bmj.com/content/79/938/672 Cann SH, Van Netten JP, Van Netten C.

{{MEDREF|date=November 2013}}
'''Postmenopausal confusion''' is a symptom of [[menopause]]; women face problems with [[brain|cognition]] during and after menopause due to hormonal imbalances.

==Causes==
{{cleanup|reason= primary sources removed, off-topic text that belongs at [[menopause]] removed, remaining text cited to reviews needs to .. well ... be rewritten to say something unique that cannot be covered at [[menopause]]|date=November 2013}}
[[File:Hormones estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH during menstrual cycle pt.svg|thumb|Hormones estradiol, progesterone, LH and FSH during menstrual cycle pt]]
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|Major steroid hormones]]
Estrogen affects the serotonergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic systems, all of which are key to maintaining regular functioning in both survival and cognition.  [[Seratonin]] and [[dopamine]] also play key roles in mood, which alters drastically with menopause as these hormone levels decrease, as a result of estrogen decline.  Furthermore, the ratio of testosterone to estrogen changes as testosterone is now of higher quantity, causing a more easily angered disposition and allowing stress to seem more prevalent than before menopause.&lt;ref name=Brizendine /&gt;

During menopause, the [[amygdala]], which controls emotion, and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates judgment, become more regular.&lt;ref name=Brizendine&gt;{{cite book|last=Brizendine|first=Louann|title=The female brain|year=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|pages=135–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogens, a group of hormones including estradiol and estrone, are secreted by the ovaries and the secretion is regulated by [[leutenizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH), both of which are produced by the pituitary gland. In women, estrogen levels fluctuate during the [[menstrual cycle]] but reach a steady decline and then remain at low levels postmenopause.&lt;ref name=estrogen-alzheimers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rettberg|first=Jamaica R. |author2=J.

Behavioral studies suggest that estradiol augments cognition that occurs within the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[hippocampus]].  It can also enhance [[long term potentiation]] (LTP) which is key at the neurocellular level for memory and learning and is mostly affected at the neuroanatomical level of CA1 pyramidal cells, NMDAr receptors, and AMPAr receptors.&lt;ref name=mott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mott|first=Natasha N.|author2=Toni R.

[[Microglia]] are glial cells in the brain that make estrogen and produce [[cytokines]] and immune proteins in response to estrogen.&lt;ref name=microglia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Ivaldo|author2=Frederick Naftolin|title=Brain health and cognitive and mood disorders in ageing women|journal=Best Practice and Research Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology|year=2013|volume=27|pages=661–672|pmid=24007951|doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2013.06.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cells play a large role in neuroinflammation which can in turn lead to disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis, [[Alzheimer's]] disease, and [[Parkinson's]] disease.  Estrogen can play an anti-inflammatory role with microglia, which can protect the CNS against the stimuli that promote such diseases.&lt;ref name="estrogen-alzheimers- microglia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vegeto|first=Elisabetta|author2=V.

At the cellular level, oestrogen binds to nuclear receptors, such as oestrogen receptors ER α/β, and acts as a [[transcription factor]]. It increases the production of anti-apoptotic proteins and prevents the initiation of [[apoptosis]].  It also activates antioxidants which work as defenses reducing negative factors such as glutathione levels and oxidative DNA damage in mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borras|first=C. |author2=J.

==Treatment==
[[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|Hormone therapy]] also known as estrogen therapy is the most common treatment for menopausal symptoms.

===Cognition===

Estrogen has direct effects on the hippocampus, which in turn relates to mood, including increasing [[dendritic spine]] density and increasing the volume and [[neurogenesis]] of the hipposcampus; these are key to greater cognition as key neuronal circuits are maintained.&lt;ref name="neurobiological review"/&gt; Pharmaceutical companies are currently developing estrogen receptor ligands as anti-inflammatory agents to reduce neuroinflammation of microglia which leads to neurodegenerative disorders. However, other cellular targets may overtake the focus of the estrogen treatment as estrogen works as an anti-apoptotic hormone for neurons, induces growth of neural stem cells, increases [[neuroglia|astroglial]] cells ability to secrete neuroprotective molecules while also reducing their formation of [[neurotoxin]]s, and reduces adhesion to [[endothelial]] cells.&lt;ref name="estrogen-alzheimers- microglia" /&gt;

The most common treatment is hormone replacement therapy or estrogen therapy. Women using hormone therapy for at least two years have increased blood flow to the hippocampus and temporal lobe as compared to those who did not undergo therapy.&lt;ref name="neurobiological review" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maki|first=PM|title=Estrogen effects on the hippocampus and frontal lobes|journal=International journal of fertility and women's medicine|year=2005|volume=50|issue=2|pages=67–71|pmid=16334413}}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas of the brain are key to memory.&lt;ref name=plasticityBrinton&gt;{{cite journal| last=Maki| first=P.M.|author2=S.M.Resnick| title=Effects of estrogen on patterns of brain activity at rest and during cognitive activity: a review of neuroimaging studies|journal=NeuroImage|year=2001|volume=14|pages=789–801|pmid=11554798| issue=2| doi=10.1006/nimg.2001.0887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, women who do not undergo therapy have been found to have less metabolic activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, while those with estrogen therapy did not show a significant metabolic change.

==History==
Research on menopause as a whole declined with the end of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) studies, but research on the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause—especially the treatment of cognitive decline—continues.  New research refutes the WHI findings that estrogen therapy (ET) is not a useful treatment for menopausal symptoms.&lt;ref name=mott /&gt;  This is especially shown in Alzheimer's research as the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study refuted the argument that a decline in oestrogens and progestogens seen during menopause increases vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;ref name=grimm-alzheimers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=A. |author2=Y.

'''Primary morbid gain''' or '''secondary morbid gain''' are used in [[medicine]] to describe the significant subconscious psychological [[motivation|motivators]] patients may have when presenting with symptoms. It is important to note that if these motivators are recognized by the patient, and especially if symptoms are fabricated or exaggerated for personal gain, then this is instead considered [[malingering]].

'''Primary morbid gain''' produces positive internal motivations.  For example, a patient might feel guilty about being unable to perform some task. If a medical condition justifying an inability is present, it may lead to decreased psychological stress. Primary gain can be a component of any disease, but is most typically demonstrated in [[conversion disorder]] – a psychiatric disorder in which stressors manifest themselves as physical symptoms without organic causes, such as a person who becomes blindly inactive after seeing a murder. The "gain" may not be particularly evident to an outside observer.

'''Secondary morbid gain''' can also be a component of any disease, but is an external motivator. If a patient's disease allows him/her to miss work, avoid military duty, obtain financial compensation, obtain drugs, or avoid a jail sentence, these would be examples of a secondary gain.  An example would be an individual having stomach cramps when household chores are completed by a family. In the context of a person with a significant mental or psychiatric disability, this effect is sometimes called '''secondary handicap'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Robert, Carmel Harrison, and Melany Ball.  "Secondary Handicap &amp; Learning Disability: A Component Analysis."  ''Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Research and Practice'', 2008, 5, 300-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tertiary morbid gain''', a less well-studied process, is when a third party such as a relative or friend is motivated to gain sympathy or other benefits from the illness of the victim.

'''Quality of life''' ('''QOL''') is the general [[well-being]]  of individuals and societies, outlining negative and positive features of life. It observes life satisfaction, including everything from physical health, family, education, employment, wealth, safety, security to freedom, religious beliefs, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/iese/2013/09/04/quality-of-life-everyone-wants-it-but-what-is-it/#405f6fdb2c7d|title=Quality Of Life: Everyone Wants It, But What Is It?|last=Barcaccia|first=Barbara|date=4 September 2013|website=Forbes/ Education|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; QOL has a wide range of contexts, including the fields of [[international development]], healthcare, politics and employment. It is important not to mix up the concept of QOL with a more recent growing area of [[Quality of life (healthcare)|health related QOL]] (HRQOL&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Cancer Patient and Quality of Life|url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/7/2/120|journal = The Oncologist|year = 2002|access-date = 7 May 2015|issn = 1083-7159|pmid = 11961195|pages = 120–125|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.7-2-120|first = Andrew|last = Bottomley}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An assessment of HRQOL is effectively an evaluation of QOL and its relationship with health.

Quality of life should not be confused with the concept of [[standard of living]], which is based primarily on income.

==Overview==
Standard indicators of the quality of life include not only wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging.&lt;ref name="DHG"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Derek |display-editors= 4 |editor1-last= Gregory |editor1-link= Derek Gregory |editor2-first= Ron |editor2-last= Johnston |editor3-first= Geraldine |editor3-last= Pratt |editor4-first= Michael |editor4-last= Watts |editor4-link= Michael Watts |editor5-first= Sarah |editor5-last= Whatmore |title=Dictionary of Human Geography |edition=5th |date=June 2009 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-4051-3287-9 |chapter= Quality of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]], ed.

According to ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]]:
{{quote|While Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit policy goal, adequate definition and measurement have been elusive. Diverse "objective" and "subjective" indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on [[subjective well-being]] (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred renewed interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index169.html|author=Costanza, R.|displayauthors=etal|year=2008|title=An Integrative Approach to Quality of Life Measurement, Research, and Policy|journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S.|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One approach, called [[engaged theory]], outlined in the journal of ''Applied Research in the Quality of Life'', posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | date=2012 | last1= Magee | first1= Liam | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy| title= Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/5178539/Measuring_Social_Sustainability_A_Community-Centred_Approach | journal= Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume= 7 | issue= 3 | pages= 239–61 | doi=10.1007/s11482-012-9166-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domain of culture, for example, it includes the following subdomains of quality of life:

* Belief and ideas
* Creativity and recreation
* Enquiry and learning
* Gender and generations
* Identity and engagement
* Memory and projection 
* Wellbeing and health

Also frequently related are concepts such as freedom, [[human rights]], and [[happiness]]. However, since happiness is subjective and difficult to measure, other measures are generally given priority. It has also been shown that happiness, as much as it can be measured, does not necessarily increase correspondingly with the comfort that results from increasing income. As a result, standard of living should not be taken to be a measure of happiness.&lt;ref name="DHG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Richard |last1= Layard |author1-link= Richard Layard, Baron Layard |title=Happiness: Lessons from a New Science |date = 6 April 2006 |publisher= Penguin |location= London |isbn= 978-0-14-101690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sometimes considered related is the concept of [[human security]], though the latter may be considered at a more basic level and for all people.

==Quantitative measurement==
Unlike [[Gross domestic product|''per capita'' GDP]] or [[standard of living]], both of which can be measured in financial terms, it is harder to make objective or long-term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people. Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well-being: ''[[Emotional well-being]]'', in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences—the frequency and intensity of their experiences of, for example, joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection— and ''life evaluation'', in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1011492107|title=High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being|date=2010|last1=Kahneman|first1=D.|last2=Deaton|first2=A.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=107|issue=38|pages=16489–16493|pmid=20823223|pmc=2944762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time. Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, ''The Increasing Importance of Quality of Life'', October 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019030621/http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care, wealth and materialistic goods. However, it is much more difficult to measure [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] expression of one's desires. One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals. Quality of life can simply mean [[happiness]], the subjective state of mind. By using that mentality, citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care, education and child protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|date=2011|title=THE BIG QUESTION: Quality of Life: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

===Human Development Index===
{{Main | Human Development Index}}
Perhaps the most commonly used international measure of development is the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines measures of life expectancy, education, and standard of living, in an attempt to quantify the options available to individuals within a given society.  The HDI is used by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in their [[Human Development Report]].

===World Happiness Report===
{{Main | World Happiness Report}}
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey on the state of global happiness. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, reflecting growing global interest in using happiness and substantial well-being as an indicator of the quality of human development. Its growing purpose has allowed governments, communities and organizations to use appropriate data to record happiness in order to enable policies to provide better lives. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldhappiness.report/|title=World Happiness Report|date=2016|website=Overview|publisher=Helliwell, J., Layard, R., &amp; Sachs, J. (2016). World Happiness Report 2016, Update (Vol. I). New York: Sustainable Development Solutions Network|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also developed by the [[United Nations]] and published recently along with the HDI, this report combines both objective and subjective measures to rank countries by happiness, which is deemed as the ultimate outcome of a high quality of life. It uses surveys from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, and generosity to derive the final score. Happiness is already recognised as an important concept in global public policy. The World Happiness Report indicates that some regions have in recent years been experiencing progressive inequality of happiness. Without life, there is no happiness to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 March 2016|title=Health and Happiness|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Health+and+happiness&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Lancet&amp;rft.au=The+Lancet&amp;rft.date=2016-03-26&amp;rft.pub=Elsevier+Limited&amp;rft.issn=0140-6736&amp;rft.eissn=1474-547X&amp;rft.volume=387&amp;rft.issue=10025&amp;rft.spage=1251&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2FS0140-6736%2816%2930062-9&amp;rft.externalDocID=4004789551&amp;paramdict=en-AU|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30062-9|access-date=13 May 2016|volume=387|pages=1251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measures===
The [[Physical Quality of Life Index]] (PQLI) is a measure developed by sociologist Morris David Morris in the 1970s, based on basic literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy.  Although not as complex as other measures, and now essentially replaced by the Human Development Index, the PQLI is notable for Morris's attempt to show a "less fatalistic pessimistic picture" by focusing on three areas where global quality of life was generally improving at the time and ignoring [[gross national product]] and other possible indicators that were not improving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morris | first = Morris David | title = The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) | journal = Development Digest | volume = 1 | pages = 95–109 | date = January 1980  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Happy Planet Index]], introduced in 2006, is unique among quality of life measures in that, in addition to standard determinants of well-being, it uses each country's [[ecological footprint]] as an indicator.  As a result, European and North American nations do not dominate this measure.  The 2012 list is instead topped by [[Costa Rica]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Happy Planet Index 2.0 | publisher = New Economics Foundation | date = 2012 | url = http://www.happyplanetindex.org/  | accessdate = 2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup research]]ers trying to find the world's [[happiness|happiest]] countries found [[Denmark]] to be at the top of the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html?partner=popstories |title=Table: The World's Happiest Countries |publisher=Forbes |first=Francesca |last=Levy |date=14 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180745/http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html?partner=popstories|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[uSwitch]] publishes an annual quality of life index for European countries. [[France]] has topped the list for the last three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/29/uk-worst-quality-of-life-europe |title=Table: UK has 'worst quality of life in Europe' |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=King |date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by two [[Princeton University]] professors looked at 1,000 randomly selected U.S. residents over an extended period. It concludes that their ''life evaluations'' – that is, their considered evaluations of their life against a stated scale of one to ten – rise steadily with income. On the other hand, their reported quality of ''emotional daily experiences'' (their reported experiences of [[joy]], [[affection]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[sadness]], or [[anger]]) levels off after a certain income level (approximately $75,000 per year); income above $75,000 does not lead to more experiences of happiness nor to further relief of unhappiness or stress. Below this income level, respondents reported decreasing happiness and increasing sadness and stress, implying the pain of life's misfortunes, including [[disease]], [[divorce]], and [[solitude|being alone]], is exacerbated by [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Higher income improves life rating but not emotional well-being|url=http://www.physorg.com/news203060471.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=20 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gross national happiness]] and other subjective measures of happiness are being used by the governments of [[Government of Bhutan|Bhutan]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/interactive/well-being-wheel-of-measures/index.html|title=Measures of National Well-Being}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Happiness report, issued by Columbia University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/Sachs%20Writing/2012/World%20Happiness%20Report.pdf|title=World Happiness Report|editors=John Helliwell, Richard Layard and Jeffrey Sachs|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a meta-analysis of happiness globally and provides an overview of countries and grassroots activists using GNH.

The [[Social Progress Index]] measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-two indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of wellbeing, and opportunity show the relative performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there is sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.

Day-Reconstruction Method was another way of measuring happiness, in which researchers asked their subjects to recall various things they did on the previous day and describe their mood during each activity. Being simple and approachable, this method required memory and the experiments have confirmed that the answers that people give are similar to those who repeatedly recalled each subject. The method eventually declined as it called for more effort and thoughtful responses, which often included interpretations and outcomes that do not occur to people who are asked to record every action in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Happiness : What Government Can Learn from the New Research on Well-Being|last=Derek|first=Boc|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=February 2010|isbn=9781400832194|location=United States|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livability===
The term ''quality of life'' is also used by politicians and economists to measure the livability of a given city or nation.  Two widely known measures of livability are the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Where-to-be-born Index]] and [[world's most livable cities|Mercer's Quality of Living Reports]].  These two measures calculate the livability of countries and cities around the world, respectively, through a combination of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] life-satisfaction surveys and objective determinants of quality of life such as divorce rates, safety, and infrastructure. Such measures relate more broadly to the population of a city, state, or country, not to individual quality of life. Livability has a long history and tradition in [[urban design]], and neighborhoods design standards such as [[LEED-ND]] are often used in an attempt to influence livability.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|display-authors=etal|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crimes====
Some crimes against property (e.g., graffiti and vandalism) and some "[[victimless crimes]]" have been referred to as "quality-of-life crimes." American [[sociologist]] [[James Q. Wilson]] encapsulated this argument as the [[broken windows theory]], which asserts that relatively minor problems left unattended (such as litter, [[graffiti]], or public urination by [[homeless]] individuals) send a [[subliminal message]] that disorder in general is being tolerated, and as a result, more serious crimes will end up being committed (the analogy being that a broken window left broken shows an image of general dilapidation).

Wilson's theories have been used to justify the implementation of [[zero tolerance]] policies by many prominent American [[mayor]]s, most notably [[Oscar Goodman]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Richard Riordan]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in [[New York City]] and [[Gavin Newsom]] in [[San Francisco]]. Such policies refuse to tolerate even minor crimes; proponents argue that this will improve the quality of life of local residents. However, critics of zero tolerance policies believe that such policies neglect investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes.

====Popsicle index====
The '''popsicle index''' is a quality-of-life measurement coined by [[Catherine Austin Fitts]] as the percentage of people in a community who believe that a child in their community can leave their home alone, go to the nearest possible location to buy a [[ice pop|popsicle]] or other snack, and return home safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solari.com/about/popsicle_index.html|title=Understanding the Popsicle Index|last=Fitts|first=Catherine Austin|work=SolariF|access-date=10 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121002723/https://solari.com/about/popsicle_index.html |archivedate=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133984989.html|title=To lick crime, pass the Popsicle test|date=9 July 2005|work=The Virginian-Pilot|access-date=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sentienttimes.com/06/dec_jan_06/popsicle.html|title=Money in a Popsicle-Friendly World|last=Darling|first=John|date=January 2006|work=Sentient Times|access-date=10 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726124705/http://www.sentienttimes.com/06/dec_jan_06/popsicle.html|archivedate=26 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In healthcare==
{{main | Quality of life (healthcare)}}
Within the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how a certain ailment affects a patient on an individual level.  This may be a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening; life-threatening illness that is not terminal; terminal illness; the predictable, natural decline in the health of an elder; an unforeseen mental/physical decline of a loved one; or chronic, end-stage disease processes. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Quality of Life Research Unit define quality of life as "The degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of his or her life" (UofT).  Their Quality of Life Model is based on the categories "being", "belonging", and "becoming"; respectively who one is, how one is not connected to one's environment, and whether one achieves one's personal goals, hopes, and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Quality of Life: How Good is Life for You? | publisher = University of Toronto Quality of Life Research Unit | url = https://www.utoronto.ca/qol/   | accessdate = 14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualityoflifecare.com/?page_id=50 About QLC : Quality of Life Care]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience sampling studies show substantial between-person variability in within-person associations between somatic symptoms and quality of life.&lt;ref name= "Kr2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author= van der Krieke et al. |title = Temporal Dynamics of Health and Well-Being: A Crowdsourcing Approach to Momentary Assessments and Automated Generation of Personalized Feedback (2016) | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | doi= 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 |pmid=27551988 |year=2016 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht and Shiel measure quality of life as “the patient’s ability to enjoy normal life activities” since life quality is strongly related to wellbeing without suffering from sickness and treatment.&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference"/&gt; There are multiple assessments available that measure Health-Related Quality of Life, e.g., [http://www.aqol.com.au AQoL-8D], [https://euroqol.org/ EQ5D - Euroqol], [http://www.15d-instrument.net/15d/ 15D], [https://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form.html SF-36], [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/heds/mvh/sf-6d SF-6D], [http://www.healthutilities.com/hui3.htm HUI].

==In international development==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
Quality of life is an important concept in the field of [[international development]] since it allows development to be analyzed on a measure broader than standard of living. Within [[development theory]], however, there are varying ideas concerning what constitutes desirable change for a particular society, and the different ways that quality of life is defined by institutions therefore shapes how these organizations work for its improvement as a whole.

Organisations such as the [[World Bank]], for example, declare a goal of "working for a world free of poverty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The World Bank | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTABOUTUS/Resources/wbgroupbrochure-en.pdf | accessdate = 2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with poverty defined as a lack of basic human needs, such as food, water, shelter, freedom, access to education, healthcare, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Poverty - Overview | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://go.worldbank.org/RQBDCTUXW0 | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, poverty is defined as a low quality of life. Using this definition, the World Bank works towards improving quality of life through the stated goal of lowering poverty and helping people afford a better quality of life.

Other organizations, however, may also work towards improved global quality of life using a slightly different definition and substantially different methods. Many [[NGO]]s do not focus at all on reducing poverty on a national or international scale, but rather attempt to improve quality of life for individuals or communities. One example would be sponsorship programs that provide material aid for specific individuals. Although many organizations of this type may still talk about fighting poverty, the methods are significantly different.

Improving quality of life involves action not only by NGOs but also by [[government]]s. Global health has the potential to achieve greater political presence if governments were to incorporate aspects of human security into [[foreign policy]]. Stressing individuals’ basic rights to health, food, shelter, and freedom addresses prominent inter-sectoral problems negatively impacting today's society and may lead to greater action and resources. Integration of global health concerns into foreign policy may be hampered by approaches that are shaped by the overarching roles of defense and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel and Huish.

[[File:Queen Mary I curing scrofula Levina Teerlinc 16th C.jpg|thumb|[[Mary I of England]] touching for [[scrofula]], 16th-century illustration by [[Levina Teerlinc]]]]
The '''royal touch''' (also known as the '''king's touch''') was a form of [[laying on of hands]], whereby [[List of French monarchs|French]] and [[English monarchs]] touched their subjects, regardless of [[social class]]es, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal Doctors, 1485–1714: Medical Personnel at the Tudor and Stuart Courts|last=Lane Furdell|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=1580460518|pages=190|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturdy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal Touch in England|work=European Monarchy: Its Evolution and Practice from Roman Antiquity to Modern Times|last=Sturdy|first=David J.|publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag|isbn=3515062335|pages=190|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dolores"&gt;{{cite book|title=Therapeutic Touch as Transpersonal Healing|last=Krieger|first=Dolores|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=1590560108|pages=7–9|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finley"&gt;{{cite book|title=Princes and Princely Culture: 1450–1650|last=Finley-Crosswhite|first=Annette|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004135723|pages=139–144|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[thaumaturgic]] touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from [[tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]] (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into [[remission (medicine)|remission]] on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.

== Origins ==
[[File:Clovis I touching for scrofula.jpg|thumb|left|A 15th-century manuscript depicting the tradition that [[Clovis I]] healed the scrofulous following his coronation.]]
The kings and [[queens regnant]] of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (''divinitus'')&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; to cure by touching or stroking the diseased.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; This special aptitude was thought to be evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, [[Saint Edward the Confessor]] ([[r.]] 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess the healing power of the royal touch.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (r. 1059–1108) or even [[Robert II of France|Robert II]] (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

The physician [[André du Laurens]] (1558–1609) claimed that [[Clovis I]] (r. 481–511) was the first king who touched for scrofula, but the medievalist [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) argued that it was probably Philip I. Modern scholars, most notably [[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] (1911–2009), agree that the French practice most likely originated from [[Saint Louis IX]] (r. 1226–1270).&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; The earliest direct evidence of the royal touch in England are the financial records dating from the reign of [[Edward I]] (r. 1272–1307). The crusading Edward I did not arrive in England until 1274 but the custom of giving one penny to each patient had become well established by 1276, suggesting that the practice dated at least from the reign of his father, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (r. 1216–1272). Henry III, known for insisting on his arbitrary decisions, loved public displays and was as pious as his beloved brother-in-law, Saint Louis IX, all of which makes it likely that he introduced the practice in England.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt;

== England ==
[[File:Henry VI Angel 1470.jpg|thumb|Touch piece of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (r. 1422–1461)]]

Henry I's successors did not consider the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when it suddenly became an object of scrutiny in literature.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

Since the reign of [[Edward IV]] (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs presented the diseased with a gold coin known as an [[Angel (coin)|Angel]] and hung it around the subject's neck. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the coin depicted a ship, while the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] showed the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] [[Archangel Michael in Christian art|slaying a dragon]], which led to the coin being popularly referred to as an Angel. Angels were currency, valued at 6s-8d when introduced, but when used as a [[Touch piece]] they were pierced for hanging round the neck. The diseased were instructed to wear the coin constantly to ensure the success of the treatment. Not all people embraced the notion of the royal touch and miraculous cures; many were simply eager to obtain the valuable gold coin.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; When the Angel went out of production in 1634, a small gold medal was struck for royal touching.

===Procedure ===
[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (r. 1485–1509), the first [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] on the English throne, was preoccupied with legitimizing his reign. It was he who firmly established the procedure, relying heavily on precedent set by his predecessors. It consisted of four distinct elements:
#The monarch touched (or, alternatively, stroked) the face or neck of the infected person.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;
#The monarch hung the coin around the person's neck.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;
#Passages from the [[Gospel of Mark]] (16: 14–20) and the [[Gospel of John]] (1: 1–14) were read.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; [[Mark 16]] contains themes that confirm monarchs' immunity to infectious diseases:&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; "They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." {{bibleref|Mark|16:18|KJV}}
#Prayers were offered. Until the [[English Reformation]], the prayers were addressed not only to God but also to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and the saints.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

The touch was originally meant to cure [[tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis]] (commonly referred to as scrofula or the King's Evil), [[rheumatism]], [[convulsion]]s, fevers, blindness,&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; [[goitre]] and other ailments.&lt;ref name="Dolores"/&gt; Since the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I made the [[sign of the cross]] above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, [[James I]] (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the [[abscess]]es instead of actually touching them.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

=== Frequency ===
[[File:Charles II touching the scrofulous (crop).jpeg|thumb|left|Charles II performing the royal touch; engraving by [[Robert White (engraver)|Robert White]] (1684)]]
The ritual was normally performed between [[Michaelmas]] and Easter, when cold weather made it less likely to contract a disease from the infected subject. It was believed that the treatment was more likely to be successful if performed on a [[Liturgical year#Western liturgical calendar|holy day]]. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did not touch during his [[Edward I of England#Diplomacy and war on the Continent|frequent military campaigns abroad]]. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Norman Conquest and Beyond|first=Frank|last=Barlow|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826443931|pages=9, 44–47|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry VII touched seven or eight infected people annually, and there were intervals lasting several years during which he did not perform the ritual at all. [[Henry VIII]] (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant [[Edward VI]] (r. 1547–1553) apparently did not perform the ritual, but the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant to participate in a ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church [[Regnans in Excelsis|excommunicated]] her and alleged that she had lost her healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; The Elizabethan surgeon [[William Clowes (surgeon)|William Clowes]], who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

Although the strictly Protestant James I wished to end the practice, he found himself having to touch an increasing number of people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the [[Union of the Crowns]]; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at [[Holyrood Palace]].&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

The frequency of the ritual reached its climax during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (r. 1660–1685), the only English monarch who applied royal touch more than French kings. Over 92,000 scrofulous people were touched by him – over 4,500 annually. [[James II]] (r. 1685–1688) was very skeptical about the ritual but nevertheless indulged in it. He was deposed by [[William III of England|William III]] (r. 1689–1702) and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] (r. 1689–1694), who refused to take part in what they considered a superstition.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; When a subject asked him for a touch, William reputedly said: "God grant you better health and better sense."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] (r. 1702–1714) reintroduced the practice almost as soon as she ascended, touching 30 people on 6 October and 20 on 19 December 1702.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; She took it very seriously, even fasting the day before.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; On 30 March 1712, she performed the ritual for the last time; [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) was the last of the 300 scrofulous people Anne touched that day. [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (r. 1714–1727) permanently discontinued the practice, but the exiled James II's [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] heirs claimed the ability until the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

The physician [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] praised William III and George I for abandoning "that superstitious and insignificant ceremony", which he believed was a "[[Popish]]" plot. The [[Glorious Revolution]] and subsequent abandonment of the idea of the [[divine right of kings]] rendered the royal touch unnecessary as means of proving monarch's legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; Reports of Jacobite claimants curing scrofula by touch were rebuffed by a contributor to the ''General Evening Post'': "The illustrious Royal Family now on the Throne despise such childish Delusions, such little pious Frauds, to prove their Divine Right to the Crown. They act upon noble Principles; they want no chicanery to support their Throne." The ceremony finally disappeared from the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1732.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

== France ==
[[File:Francis I touching the scrofulous.jpg|thumb|[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (r. 1515–1547) touching the scrofulous in the presence of the [[Pope Leo X|pope]] in [[Bologna]] in 1515; fresco by [[Carlo Cignani]]]]
By the [[Late Middle Ages]], the royal touch had become an integral part of the [[coronation of the French monarch]] at [[Reims Cathedral]]. The rite included the [[anointing]] of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability to cure. The coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to [[Corbeny]], the site of the shrine of [[Saint Marcouf]] (d. 558), [[patron saint]] of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; On his deathbed, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]] (r. 1328–1350), the first [[House of Valois|Valois]] king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; some of them had come from [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Vivarais]].&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 6, c.&amp;nbsp;1300–c.&amp;nbsp;1415|last=Jones|first=Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521362903|pages=395|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonologist [[Pierre de Lancre]] (1553–1631) boasted that even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still believed in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in [[Poblet Monastery]] in Catalonia.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In order to be touched by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt; The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

=== Wars of Religion ===
[[File:Henri IV touche les escrouelles.jpg|thumb|left|Henry IV touching 575 people in Reims during the [[Holy Week]] of 1606;&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; engraving by [[Pierre Firrens]]]]
The idea of the royal touch promoted the power of the monarchy,&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt; but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt; During the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread more than ever and the interest in the disease steadily increased. The [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] started a propaganda claiming that [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession of the Protestant [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

After converting to Catholicism and establishing his authority, Henry IV was hailed not only as the healer of the scrofulous, but also as the healer of the kingdom. The first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] on the French throne, he decided to take advantage of the ability attributed to his predecessors and use it to confirm the legitimacy of his reign. He was, however, in an inconvenient situation: he was crowned at [[Chartres Cathedral]] rather than Reims, and thus made no visit to the shrine of Saint Marcouf. He maintained that the royal touch was something he was handed down by his predecessors and [[by the Grace of God|by God's grace]], rather than an ability conferred by the rite of coronation. Henry decided not to exhibit his "divine gift" immediately after his coronation at Chartres in February 1594; instead, he decided to save the mystique element of his kingship for his entry in Paris in March. Two weeks after the event, on Easter, Henry exercised his healing power for the first time. He was determined not to show any skepticism about the ritual, fearing that it might cast doubt on the sincerity of his conversion.&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

[[File:Louis XIV touching the scrofulous (crop).jpg|thumb|Louis XIV touching the scrofulous in 1690; painting by [[Jean Jouvenet]]]]
Henry IV's decision to indulge in the practice served as visual evidence to his subjects that God approved of his reign. Royal physicians and others who witnessed these ceremonies insisted that at least half of all the diseased people he touched were healed within days. The ceremonies took place in other cities and at least four times a year: on Easter, on [[Pentecost]], on [[All Saints Day]] and on Christmas. On Easter 1608, Henry IV touched 1,250 scrofulous persons. He complained that the hours-long ceremony exhausted him, but continued the practice and consistently gave the impression that he was doing it only out of concern for the well-being of his subjects. The ceremony was performed in the presence of the [[princes of the blood]], almoners, bodyguards, and physicians. The latter presented Henry with patients, and he proceeded to make the sign of the cross on his scrofulous subject's cheeks, touched the subject's sores, and exclaimed: "The King touches you, God cures you." ({{lang-fr|link=no|"Le Roy te touche et Dieu te guerit."}})&lt;ref name="Finley"/&gt;

=== Decline of practice ===

[[Louis XIII]] (r. 1610–1643) and [[Louis XIV]] (r. 1643–1715) both actively took part in touching ceremonies. The latter touched 1,600 people on Easter 1680.&lt;ref name="Dolores"/&gt; [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) scornfully wrote that he had lost confidence in the royal touch upon hearing that a mistress of Louis XIV died of scrofula "despite being very well touched by the king".&lt;ref name="Hampson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Enlightenment and Revolution: Essays in Honour of Norman Hampson|last1=Hampson|first1=Norman|last2=Crook|first2=Malcolm|last3=Doyle|first3=William|last4=Forrest|first4=Alan I.|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0754606821|pages=60|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1722, the sentence exclaimed by the king upon touching the infected changed to the more hopeful: "The King touches you, may God heal you." ({{lang-fr|link=no|"Le roi te touche, Dieu te guérit."}}) The new formula, rather than implying that God would inevitably grant the monarch's wish, was a prayer that may or may not result in a cure. [[Louis XV]] (r. 1715–1774) was skeptical about the royal touch. He performed it early in his reign, but caused a scandal when he failed to summon the scrofulous at [[Eastertide]] in 1739 and never again touched the diseased.&lt;ref name="Roche"&gt;{{cite book|title=France in the Enlightenment|last=Roche|first=Daniel|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674317475|pages=267|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McManners"&gt;{{cite book|title=Church and Society in Eighteenth-Century France: The Clerical Establishment and Its Social Ramification|last=McManners|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198270038|pages=13–14|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was thus suspended for 36 years, until [[Louis XVI]] (r. 1774–1792) revived it at his coronation on 11 June 1775 by touching 2,400 people. That was probably the only time he touched the scrofulous.&lt;ref name="Hampson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McManners"/&gt; At his coronation on 29 May 1825, [[Charles X]] (r. 1824–1830) touched 121 of his subjects; the royal touch was never again employed.&lt;ref name="Barlow"/&gt;

== Legacy and comparisons ==

The royal touch was not the only "miraculous" healing power attributed to European rulers. Members of the [[House of Habsburg]] were believed to be able to cure [[stuttering]] by a mouth-kiss.&lt;ref name="Dolores"/&gt; The medieval [[monarchs of Castile]] were reputed to possess the ability to [[exorcism in the Catholic Church|exorcise demons]] by making the sign of the cross and calling on God, while their [[List of Hungarian monarchs|Hungarian counterparts]] supposedly cured [[jaundice]]. Similarly, English monarchs distributed [[cramp-rings]], which were said to be a cure for "diabolical" sicknesses such as [[cramps]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe|last=Clark|first=Stuart|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198208081|pages=660–661|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inoculation]], an early form of [[immunization]], was introduced into England during the reign of George I, who had put a definite end to the royal touch in his kingdom. The royal family strongly supported it, but it was controversial medically as well as politically and theologically. The medicine historian Adrian Wilson described it as "the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] equivalent of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] practice of touching for scrofula ... But whereas the Royal Touch mobilised divine powers, based on hereditary right, inoculation deployed natural powers harnessed by man, with the monarch as the benevolent onlooker rather than indispensable participant."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|title=Georgian Monarchy: Politics and Culture, 1714–1760|last=Smith|first=Hannah|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=|page=95|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UNGDIrxy34C&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have held different opinions about the royal touch, ranging from deprecation in the 19th and early 20th century to more sympathetic treatment. The Whig politician [[Lord Macaulay]] (1800–1859) ridiculed it as an "absurd superstition of a pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened age]]". The [[University of London]] medicine professor [[Raymond Crawfurd|Sir Raymund Crawfurd]] published a study in 1911, revealing his fascination with the "dubious if exotic" practice. A study by the French historian [[Marc Bloch]] followed in 1924. Bloch was baffled by the tenacity of the esoteric practice and agreed with Lord Macaulay's assessment that it was grounded in a form of [[mass hysteria]]. Recently, however, historians have avoided attributing the popularity of the royal touch to naivety of the masses. The British historian [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] discussed the royal touch in the context of religion and magic, while his colleague and compatriot [[J. C. D. Clark]] attributes the survival of the practice into the 18th century to the persisting notion of the divine right of kings.&lt;ref name="Sturdy"/&gt;

'''Shovelgloving''' is a form of [[physical exercise]] based around use of a [[sledgehammer]] that has been wrapped in a [[sweater]] or otherwise padded.  The shovelglove is used to perform shoveling, butter churning and wood chopping motions, amongst others. These natural movements are intended to be part of a [[functional training]] program.

Reinhard Engels, the inventor of Shovelgloving, advocates Shovelgloving for 14 minutes per day.

He explains the rationale for 14 minutes as follows:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.shovelglove.com Shovelglove: The Sledgehammer Workout&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"It's one minute less than the smallest unit of schedulistically significant time. No calendar has a finer granularity than 15 minutes. No one ever has a meeting that starts at 5 or 10 or 14 minutes before or after the hour. You have no excuse not to do this. Time-wise, it doesn't even register."''

He recommends beginners start with less than 14 minutes, however.

==Creation==
:''"I didn't want to do sit-ups or pushups. I didn't want to grovel on my stomach on the floor, like some degraded beast. "There must be some kind of movement I can do standing up, with the dignity of a human being," I thought, "some kind of movement that is natural and interesting, that my body would like to do."'' -'''Reinhard Engels''' &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Media coverage==
Reinhard Engels has been interviewed about Shovelgloving by the Healthy Planet Show&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthyplanetradio.com/Archived%20Shows.html&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast on [[WAIF|WAIF 88.3 FM]] in Cincinnati.

A '''"Sub-internship'''" (abbreviated ''sub-I''), a.k.a. "'''Acting Internship''' '''(AI)'''",  is a clinical rotation of a fourth-year medical student in the [[Medical education in the United States|United States medical education system]] which may take place at a different hospital than the student's medical school affiliations. A student will generally select an elective "sub"-internship, where the student will perform the role of an [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] or first year medical graduate, under the supervision of senior house staff and [[attending physician]]s.  The rotation is generally pursued in the field appropriate to career interest.  For example, a sub-I can be taken in [[Internal Medicine]], [[Surgery]], [[Pediatrics]], or [[Obstetrics and Gynecology]].  In this way, the student can experience a glimpse of their future career without the burden of full responsibility. Additionally, many medical students select sub-internships at institutions where they wish to apply for residency; such rotations are "auditions" for the student to demonstrate his or her commitment to the outside program.

== Internal medicine sub-I;  a.k.a. Internal medicine AI ==

At the turn of the 21st century ninety-eight percent of [[Medical school in the United States|US medical schools]] offered an internal medicine sub-I a.k.a. (AI) to medical students.  In general the following responsibilities are given to a sub-I student: accept and give sign-out of all patients on the team, assess assigned patients before morning rounds, write problem oriented notes daily on all patients, admit patients on call days, act as information liaison between the medical team and hospital staff, communicating plan of care to patient.  Responsibilities that are generally limited or withheld include: writing orders or prescriptions, performing major procedures, obtaining consent from patients for procedures or surgeries.

A recent editorial highlighted the changing role of the subinternship (SI) in the medical school curriculum:

It has been argued that the SI should be viewed as the culmination of a coordinated 4-year program of study in clinical care, with an aim to prepare fourth-year students for the demanding experience of internship. Ideally, the educational goals of the SI should complement and expand upon those outlined in the third-year clerkship and ought to uniquely emphasize the knowledge and skills needed to independently treat and manage acutely ill inpatients. To facilitate these goals, it has been recommended that SI programs place fourth-year students in a role that completely replaces the intern, albeit under the supervision of senior house staff. In particular, it has been recommended that subinterns should 
*have a dedicated coordinator of educational activities
*be provided with an explicit set of learning objectives 
*have separate conferences which focus on patient management issues
*be able to write medical orders that are cosigned by a physician
*participate in supervised cross-coverage

Despite the valuable and distinctive experience of the SI, it has been neglected by medical educators and researchers as an area needing development and standardization. At an organizational level, the SI currently lacks the clearly defined curricular goals and rigorous evaluation methodologies found in the third-year clerkship. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent individual medical schools have addressed the unique educational needs of the SI. In an attempt to clarify the structure and requirements of internal medicine SI programs throughout the United States, a survey study was undertaken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">A '''subsurface dyke''' a structure that is built in an aquifer with the intention of obstructing the natural flow of ground water, thereby raising the ground water level and increasing the amount of water stored in the [[aquifer]]. Acting as an underground barrier [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] to water, it controls the [[groundwater]] flow in an [[aquifer]] and raises the [[water table]]. 


==Introduction==
Although the total amount of water on Earth is generally assumed to have remained virtually constant, the rapid growth in population, together with the extension of irrigated agriculture and industrial development, are putting stress on the quality and quantity aspects of natural system. Several institutions have experimented with the use of subsurface dykes to conserve water in water-scarce areas. The ideal location for a dyke is a well defined, wide, greatly sloping valley with a narrow outlet having limited thickness of loose soil or porous rock on the top with massive or impervious rock below. A subsurface dyke has many advantages. It does not require additional surface reservoir, there is no loss of agricultural land, there is minimum evaporation loss since the storage is subsurface, there is no siltation and loss of reservoir capacity, the cost of maintenance is negligible, and it is relatively environment-friendly.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there any empirical data on maintenance or environmental effects?|date=October 2018}}

One such example was a recent sub-surface dyke constructed in India. For more information about this project, see [[Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur#Subsurface Dyke|Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur]].

'''Two-tier healthcare''' is a situation in which a basic government-provided [[healthcare system]] provides basic care, and a secondary tier of care exists for those who can pay for additional, better quality or faster access.
Most countries have both publicly and privately funded healthcare, but the degree to which it creates a quality differential depends on the way the two systems are managed, funded, and regulated.

Some publicly funded universal healthcare systems deliver excellent service and the private system tends to be small and not highly differentiated. In other, typically poorer countries, the public health system is underfunded and overstretched, offering opportunities for private companies to deliver better-quality, albeit more expensive coverage.Chen, Zhang, &amp; Hua. (2015). Analysis of two-tier public service systems under a government subsidy policy. Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering, 90, 146-157.

==Canada==
{{Main|Healthcare in Canada}}
In Canada, there are private and public healthcare providers with complete patient freedom of choice between which doctors and facilities to use.

The public financing system, unofficially known as Medicare, consists of several different systems managed by each province or territory. The federal government distributes funds to the provinces for healthcare providing the provinces design their systems to meet certain criteria which they all do. Most people receiving care in Canada do not pay for their care. The medical provider gets paid a fixed fee for the care provided. The law bans the medical provider from charging patients to supplement their income from Medicare. Medical care providers can set their own fees that are higher than the Medicare reimbursement fee, but the patient must pay all the cost of care, not just the excess.

About 70% of Canada's healthcare funding is via the public system. Another 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, financial disincentives that make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economic.

Six of Canada's ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge is currently underway to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients' right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

Some private hospitals operating while the national healthcare plan was instituted (for example, the [[Shouldice Hernia Centre]] in [[Thornhill, Ontario]]) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. (The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the "upper tier" of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there.)

Clinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners.

==Denmark==
[[Healthcare in Denmark]], although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments.

==France==
[[Healthcare in France]] is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government. There are public as well as private hospitals.

Patients pay a small [[copayment]] for certain aspects of care, but many people choose to cover the costs by taking out supplemental health insurance for which a small premium is payable each year.

Thus, France also has a mixed delivery system with complete patient freedom of supplier choice. There is a two-tier funding arrangement, with compulsory funding of core medical services from taxation, with optional private insurance for the cost of copayments.

==Germany==
[[Healthcare in Germany]] has multiple sickness funds, either publicly owned or not-for-profit mutuals. Membership of a sickness fund is compulsory for everyone except certain people earning an income above a certain level, who opt out of the insurance system altogether. Doctors are usually self-employed, and hospitals may be publicly owned, privately owned or not for profit.

==Ireland==
[[Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland]] is financed mainly by the state. However, all citizens have the option of buying additional private health insurance, provided by four companies. They include [[VHI]], a large publicly owned insurer, operating, like all other insurers, [[community rating]]; people are insured at the same basic rate regardless of health status. The other insurers are [[Glo Healthcare]], [[LAYA]] and [[Avivia]]. Also, much smaller restricted membership companies provide benefits for certain professions, such as police officers.

There are public as well as private hospitals.  Private patients are often treated in public hospitals, as all privately insured patients have an entitlement to use the publicly funded system.

==Netherlands==
[[Healthcare in the Netherlands]] is essentially single tier, with all persons accessing a common system of private and public providers with complete freedom of choice between providers. Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses.

Insurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers.

Thus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled.

==Singapore==
[[Healthcare in Singapore]] uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds. A government-sponsored and subsidized system of hospitals accepts all patients, with a guaranteed list of services. A parallel system of private hospitals provides services not available in public hospitals or available with extra amenities (such as private rooms and other boutique services).

Singapore uses a universal insurance fund in which all citizens are required to participate, as a baseline. Seniors and certain groups are subsidised in their membership in the universal basic insurance fund.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090228210450/http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/hcsystem.aspx?id=102]

Optional additional supplementary insurance funds are available for purchase for elective coverage, such as for plastic surgery or for extra amenities in hospital.

==Spain==
Private insurance, private hospitals and private management of public hospitals exist in Spain, and coexist with hospitals completely run by the government. Public insurance guarantees universal coverage, with no expenditure from patients other than a fraction of prescription drug cost. Some private hospitals are only accessible with private insurance. The system is regularly ranked amongst the world's best [http://www.expatica.com/es/healthcare/Getting-healthcare-in-Spain_101467.html]

==Switzerland==
Private health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in [[Healthcare in Switzerland|Switzerland]].  Insurance companies are required to sell the compulsory basic health insurance at cost, and individuals who cannot afford the premium (based on a premium-to-income ratio) are provided with public cash subsidies.  Public hospitals are subsidised, but there are also private hospitals that provide additional services, such as elective services.

In addition to the compulsory basic health insurance, optional complementary and supplementary private insurance plans are available for purchase.

==United Kingdom==
The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (or NHS) provides universal coverage to all residents of the [[United Kingdom]].

Private healthcare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 8% of the population{{Citation needed|reason=Just updating an older passage to an actual cn tag|date=November 2017}}, generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.

Conversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment ([[cosmetic surgery]] for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for-service alternative.

Historically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business.

Since the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see [[hospital choice in the NHS]]). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS's expense.{{says who?|date=May 2015}}

As a result of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private healthcare sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. [[Dentistry]] is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). [[NHS dentistry]] can then be patchy, and some people may find that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality.

There has always been a degree of private medicine conducted within NHS hospitals, with private work being done in those hospitals and the patient being accommodated in segregated accommodation. Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities.

Whether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts.

==United States==
{{further|Health care in the United States|Obamacare}}
The United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers. Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance.

The debate over [[healthcare reform in the United States]] has included a proposal for a [[public option]] or [[Medicare for all]], a government-run insurance program, available to all US citizens, to compete with or replace private insurance plans.

The purpose of the technique is to recreate the natural transfer of bacteria that the baby gets during a [[Vaginal delivery|vaginal birth]]. It involves placing swabs in the mother’s [[vagina]], and then wiping them into the baby’s face, mouth, eyes and skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/about-us/tommys-midwives-blog/what-vaginal-seeding|title=Tommy's - What is vaginal seeding?|website=Tommy's |access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Infants conceived vaginally are exposed to heaps of gainful [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] knows as [[microbiota]] when they travel down the [[Birth canal|birth cana]] The baby is exposed to the mother’s vaginal microbes that wash over the child in the bath canal, which coves the skin, and enters the baby’s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. These microbes often travel down into the gut after being swallowed. It is said that these microbes are important in the [[postnatal development]] of the immune system of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neu J, Rushing J | title = Cesarean versus vaginal delivery: long-term infant outcomes and the hygiene hypothesis | journal = Clinics in Perinatology | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–31 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21645799 | pmc = 3110651 | doi = 10.1016/j.clp.2011.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 


In the event that a [[C-section]] is done before labour starts or before a woman’s water breaks, the infant won't come into contact with maternal vaginal fluid or bacteria. Instead, they come in contact with skin microbes, a very different set of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/what-vaginal-seeding/|title=What Is Vaginal Seeding?|work=IFLScience|access-date=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences, in turn, have been associated with increased risks of [[asthma]], [[Allergy|allergies]], [[obesity]], and [[Immunodeficiency|immune deficiencies]]. Thus, these differences appear more often in infants after a [[Caesarean section|caesarean delivery]] that after a vaginal delivery, according to certain epidemiological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laubereau B, Filipiak-Pittroff B, von Berg A, Grübl A, Reinhardt D, Wichmann HE, Koletzko S | title = Caesarean section and gastrointestinal symptoms, atopic dermatitis, and sensitisation during the first year of life | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 89 | issue = 11 | pages = 993–7 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15499049 | pmc = 1719727 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2003.043265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose behind the practice of vaginal seeding or micro birthing is that it allows an infant delivered via caesarean section to come in contact with microbes from the birth canal. The expectation is that this may boost their gut bacteria and lessen the danger of health issues normally associated with caesarian infants. It contributes to the seeding of the infant gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez-Bello MG, De Jesus-Laboy KM, Shen N, Cox LM, Amir A, Gonzalez A, Bokulich NA, Song SJ, Hoashi M, Rivera-Vinas JI, Mendez K, Knight R, Clemente JC | title = Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 250–3 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26828196 | pmc = 5062956 | doi = 10.1038/nm.4039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
It is unclear whether vaginal seeding has long term benefit or whether it is safe. In 2016 a small study was published in the Journal Nature Medicine to look into the benefits of vaginal seeding. However, the study authors acknowledged that the consequences of vaginal seeding remain unclear due to limited data. 

In 2017, a subsequent study was published which found that there wasn’t a big difference, after six weeks, between the microbes of infants born vaginally versus those who received vaginal seeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a19848281/vaginal-seeding/|title=Vaginal Seeding: What Is It And Why Is It So Controversial?|date=2018-04-18|work=ELLE|access-date=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which further added to the confusion. Furthermore, certain scholars have pointed out that a baby's exposure to bacteria begins even before birth and more research is required on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thebump.com/a/vaginal-seeding|title=Why Vaginal Seeding May Be a Trend to Avoid|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==
Infants conceived by C-section are really at lower danger of exchange of some conceivably harmful microbes and infections from the birth canal. However, with vaginal seeding, these harmful microorganisms and infections could be exchanged to the infant on a swab and potentially cause an [[infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/what-vaginal-seeding/|title=What Is Vaginal Seeding?|work=IFLScience|access-date=2018-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An editorial written in the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] is advising practitioners and parents to not perform vaginal seeding as there is not enough evidence that it is beneficial for infants and could potentially put babies health at risk.&lt;ref name="pmid26906151"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunnington AJ, Sim K, Deierl A, Kroll JS, Brannigan E, Darby J | title = "Vaginal seeding" of infants born by caesarean section | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 352 | issue = | pages = i227 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26906151 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i227 | url = https://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/february/vaginalseeding.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303030953/https://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/february/vaginalseeding.pdf | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | dead-url = yes | lay-summary = https://www.bellybelly.com.au/birth/is-vaginal-seeding-dangerous/ | lay-source = BellyBelly }}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) also does not encourage or recommend vaginal seeding due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2017/Vaginal-Seeding-Not-Recommended-for-Infants|title=Vaginal Seeding Not Recommended for Infants - ACOG|website=www.acog.org|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the factory, which closed in 2001, it had been estimated by ODHS that up to 25,000 workers may have been exposed to TCE via the factory's drinking water, which was drawn from a well on-site. However,  further investigation showed that the actual number of employees who can be identified from employment records for the site is approximately half that number.  In addition, the number of employees identified as having worked at the site for more than five years is likely to be less than 1,000. The site is now considered safe.

==History==

The [[View-Master]], a device for viewing [[stereoscopy|3-D images]] (also known as stereo images) on a paper disk, was invented in 1939 by William Gruber, a [[Portland, Oregon]], photographer. A business arrangement was made, and the devices came to be manufactured by [[Sawyer's, Inc.]]  In 1951, Sawyer's opened a [[factory]] in [[Progress, Oregon]] (now part of Beaverton), to manufacture the devices. The devices were manufactured at the factory in Beaverton until 2001, when production was shifted elsewhere and portions of the factory sold.&lt;ref name=2003_odhs_report/&gt;

In 1998, a prospective site developer hired an environmental engineering firm to perform an environmental assessment of the site. This assessment discovered [[volatile organic compound]]s well above the levels specified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA). This included levels of TCE which were over 300 times the  [[maximum contaminant level|federal drinking water standard]]. The various concerns who owned the View-Master franchise in the 1950s through the 1970s (Sawyer's and [[GAF Materials Corporation|GAF]]), acknowledged using TCE to clean and de-grease parts and equipment, and disposed of the chemical on-site.&lt;ref name=2003_odhs_report/&gt;  This disposal was legal at the time.

IARC has classified TCE as “probably carcinogenic to humans”.&lt;ref name=2003_odhs_report /&gt; The U.S. EPA is in the process of evaluating the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic human health risks from exposure to TCE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=215006 "EPA External Review Draft:  Toxicological Review of Trichloroethylene.  October 2009."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain uses of TCE were banned in 1977 in the United States.  However, TCE was still used in household products such as spot removers and typewriter correction fluid well into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/index.asp "ATSDR.  Toxicological Profile for Trichloroethylene.  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

==Medical impact==

The ODHS has estimated that up to 25,000 workers may have been exposed to this chemical.  However, based on employment records for the site, subsequent reports estimate the number at approximately 13,700.&lt;ref name=2003_odhs_report/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feasibility"&gt;ODHS.  Feasibility Investigation of Worker Exposure to Trichloroethylene at the View-Master Factory in Beaverton, Oregon.  December 2004.  {{cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/ehap/vmsite.shtml#reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606234638/http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/ehap/vmsite.shtml |archivedate=June 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more recent report which evaluated the completeness of the employment records concluded that the number of employees with over five years of employment is likely to be less than 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Exponent.  ''Technical Memorandum:  Characterization of the Hall Street Workforce, Bellevue, WA.  October 11, 2007.''   Contact the Oregon Department of Human Services through their website at: http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study performed by the ODHS, among former factory workers, the number of deaths from several types of cancer was elevated.  However, for several other types of cancer, the number of deaths was lower than expected.  ODHS concluded that there was no overall increase in cancer mortality among the workers, but that further study was warranted.&lt;ref name="Feasibility"/&gt;

==Conclusion==

By September 2004, surface soil and surface water levels of TCE and other chemicals were within normal levels. As a result, the site has been deemed suitable for commercial re-use, and a [[shopping plaza]] was constructed.  That plaza is now supplied by Portland's [[city water]] and does not use water from the former well.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet:  ''Former View-Master Site Environmental Cleanup Status Update--January 2005.''   Contact the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality through their website at: http://www.deq.state.or.us&lt;/ref&gt;

The ODHS has recommended that the health of the workers at the former factory be evaluated to determine the extent to which this population may have been affected by potential exposure to TCE.&lt;ref name="Feasibility"/&gt;

'''White hunter''' is a literary term used for professional [[big game hunting|big game hunters]] of European or North American backgrounds who plied their trade in Africa, especially during the first half of the 20th century. The activity continues in the dozen African countries which still permit [[Game (food)|big-game]] hunting. White hunters derived their income from organizing and leading [[safari]]s for paying clients, or from the sale of [[ivory]].

The popular term '''Great White Hunter''' emphasizes the racial and [[Colonialism|colonial]] aspects of the profession, as well as its colorful aspects. Depending on the author and intention, the term can be used straightforwardly, in parody, or as a criticism.

==Hunting in Africa==
White men from Western countries had been hunting big game in Africa throughout the 19th century, particularly in the more settled southern portion of the continent. But the region most associated with the term "white hunters" is [[East Africa]]. By the start of the 20th century, as part of the "[[scramble for Africa]]", [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]] had taken colonial possession of territories on the eastern half of the continent&amp;mdash;territories now recognized as the nations of [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]].

There were many factors that led to the spread of big-game hunting in East Africa, but two were foremost among them: first, a romantic European conception of [[hunting]] that combined [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege and [[sportsmanship]], and second, the desire by the colonizing powers to create new agricultural economies, to which unchecked animal populations posed a serious threat.

Although the origins of the phrase cannot be confirmed, the first European to go by the title of "white hunter" is generally considered to have been Alan Black. Black was hired in the 1890s by [[Hugh Cholmondeley, 3rd Baron Delamere]].  Delamere employed both Alan Black and a native [[Somali people|Somali]] hunter to lead [[safari]]s in [[Somaliland]]. As the story goes, in order to avoid confusion, the Somali was referred to as the "black hunter", and Black was called the "white hunter".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Herne, ''White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris'', Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1999, pages 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of the hunting safari==
[[Image:RJCunningham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[R. J. Cunninghame]] in 1909]]
[[File:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|Former U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s 1909 hunting trip helped popularize the African safari]]

Around the start of the 20th century, East African hunting safaris became a fashionable pursuit among members of the privileged classes, particularly in Britain and the United States. The completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] in 1901 provided easier access to the interior highlands of [[British East Africa]] (also known then as the East African Protectorate, and now as [[Kenya]]), where large game, especially [[African Bush Elephant|elephants]], [[lion]]s, [[Cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]es, was plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hathaway Capstick, ''Safari: The Last Adventure'', [[St. Martin's Press]], 1984, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The white hunter served these paying customers as guide, teacher, and protector.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Bodry-Sanders, "Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior" Paragon House, 1990, pp. 216&amp;ndash;217&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the hunter was hired or booked by an outfitting company (the first and most famous of these was Newland, Tarlton &amp; Co. in [[Nairobi]]); the outfitter would make the local arrangements, gathering and packing supplies and hiring the many African workers without whom a safari was impossible. Porters, tent attendants, armed guards (known as ''askaris''), horse-trainers, and gun-bearers, all worked under the supervision of a "headman".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hathaway Capstick, ''Safari: The Last Adventure'', St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp. 11&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the mass importation of motor vehicles, most safaris traveled on foot and horseback and could employ anywhere from 50 to several hundred African workers.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Bodry-Sanders, "Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior" Paragon House, 1990, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

The British colonial government also turned big-game hunting into a source of revenue, charging the tourists and hunters licensing fees for permission to kill the game animals. In 1909, a £50 hunting license in the [[East Africa Protectorate]] entitled its purchaser to kill 2 buffaloes, 2 [[hippopotamus|hippos]], 1 [[Common Eland|eland]], 22 [[zebra]]s, 6 [[oryx]]es, 4 [[waterbuck]]s, 1 [[Greater Kudu]], 4 [[Lesser Kudu]]s, 10 [[topi]]s, 26 [[hartebeest]]s, 229 other antelope, 84 [[Black-and-white colobus|colobus monkeys]], and unlimited [[lion]]s and [[leopard]]s. (lions and leopards killed livestock and were classified as vermin.)&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Bodry-Sanders, "Carl Akeley, Africa's Collector, Africa's Savior" Paragon House, 1990, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

White hunters were colorful and romantic figures, often from privileged English backgrounds, who embraced a life of danger and adventure. The first acclaimed white hunters in East Africa were Alan Black, Bill Judd, [[Frederick Selous]] (remembered as the namesake of the [[Selous Scouts]] and whose real-life adventures inspired Sir [[H. Rider Haggard]] to create the fictional [[Allan Quatermain]]),&lt;ref name="mandiringana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandiringana |first=E.  |authorlink= |author2=T. J. Stapleton  |year=1998 |title=The Literary Legacy of Frederick Courteney Selous |journal=History in Africa |volume=25 |issue= |pages=199–218 |doi=10.2307/3172188|accessdate= |quote= |publisher=African Studies Association|jstor=3172188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=s&amp;p=l&amp;a=c&amp;ID=1144&amp;o= |title=Theodore Roosevelt, Chapter XI: The Lion Hunter  |accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Pearson |first=Edmund Lester |authorlink= |work= |publisher=Humanities Web |pages=  |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and R.J. Cunninghame (sometimes spelled Cuningham), all of whom began their exploits at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Herne, ''White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris," Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1999, pages 7&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909 Cunninghame was selected to lead what was probably the best-publicized African safari, [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition|excursion into British East Africa]]. Roosevelt's fame and popularity, and his gift for generating publicity, prompted a craze for safaris among those who could afford the sizeable price tag.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hathaway Capstick, ''Safari: The Last Adventure'', St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[World War I|First World War]], when Germany's colonial lands in East Africa were ceded to Britain, eager customers poured into Africa, creating a market for the skills of several more decades of hunters.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Adams, "Against Extinction," Earthscan, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the better-known white hunters who succeeded Cunninghame's generation were [[W.D.M. Bell]], later known as "Karamoja" Bell;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/vol49/issue194/pdf_extracts/82.jpeg Oxfordjournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke]], who was, between 1914 and 1926, married to ''Out of Africa'' author [[Karen Blixen]]; [[Denys Finch Hatton|Denys Finch-Hatton]], later her lover;[[Frederick Russell Burnham]], Chief of Scouts in the [[Second Boer War]] to ([[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] and known as "England's American Scout"; [[John A. Hunter]]; and [[Philip Percival]] and [[Bunny Allen|Frank M. "Bunny" Allen]], whose safaris with [[Ernest Hemingway]] led the author to write ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'', ''[[True at First Light]]'', ''[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]'', and ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]''.

==Representations in literature and film==
The exploits of white hunters were subjects first for novels and later for films. They were romanticized in [[adventure novel]]s of the so-called "[[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]]/Lost Race" genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost Civilizations and Great White Hunters - Imperialist Adventure Literature| url=http://silentmoviemonsters.tripod.com/TheLostWorld/LWIMPAD.html| author=Jan Morris| journal= The Spectacle of Empire| accessdate= August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"BY THE IMPERIAL noonday, then, the spectacle of the Empire was flamboyant indeed, coloured as much by Oriental despotism and barbaric gesture as by feudal example from nearer home. If it was modernist in some ways, it was antique in others. It embodied the marvellous energy of steam as well as the immemorial pride of horseflesh. It was queenly, but it was savage. It was partly the consequence of dukes, but partly the beat of jungle drums, and Imperial activists of every kind were recruited willy-nilly into its presentation: bishops beside viceroys, police officers and railwaymen, even sportsmen, foresters, jute merchants, river pilots or colonial accountants - all of whom, by their bearing, their demeanour or their costume, their pose at the wicket, the flutter of their gowns, the gravity of their presence behind the study desk or board-room table, contributed to the Imperial effect."

Perhaps the first fictional [[Victorian literature|Victorian adventure hero]] was [[Allan Quatermain]], a white hunter who appeared in books by [[H. Rider Haggard]], starting with ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885). In 1924, [[Richard Connell]] published his short story "[[The Most Dangerous Game]]", in which an American big-game hunter finds himself being hunted by a Russian aristocrat who has tired of hunting in Africa; the story is still widely read.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} [[Alex Raymond]] created the ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' comic strip in 1934 that later lead to a comic book, film serial, film series, and television show. [[Geoffrey Household]]'s novel ''[[Rogue Male (novel)|Rogue Male]]'' (1939) featured a white hunter going after [[Adolf Hitler]]; it was filmed twice, first as ''[[Man Hunt (1941 film)|Man Hunt]]'' (1941) and, a generation later, [[Rogue Male (film)|under the original title]] (1976). Captain CG Biggar, a supporting character in the [[P. G. Wodehouse]] comic novel ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'' (1953), is another example of the white hunter.

Not surprisingly, actual white hunters were often involved in the filming of the exploits of their fictional counterparts: Bunny Allen led many film companies on safari to enable [[location filming]] for ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', ''[[Mogambo]]'' (1953), and ''[[Nor the Moon by Night]]'' (1958). The white hunter on safari in his [[Safari jacket|khakis]] and [[pith helmet]] became an instantly recognizable [[stock character]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Abbott and Costello]] lampooned the type in ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), which was a parody of a 1930 documentary, ''[[Africa Speaks!]]'' (1930). [[Bob Hope]] parodied the safari genre in ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' (1941) and ''[[Call Me Bwana]]'' (1963).

[[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s safari story, "[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]" (1936), richly addresses the questions of courage, cowardice, racism, and power on safari. The story was made into a film titled ''[[The Macomber Affair]]'' (1947), but it was reissued in the United States under the title, ''The Great White Hunter''.  The title character is an American tourist looking to find his own courage by facing danger on safari. In the story, Hemingway accurately refers to the professional hunter leading the safari, a character named Wilson, as a "white hunter". (Wilson is said to have been based on Hemingway's own guides, [[Philip Percival]] and [[Bror von Blixen-Finecke]]).&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Carlos, ''Ernest Hemingway, A Life Story'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969, pp. 284&amp;ndash;285&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition of "great" in the movie release title may have helped to lodge the ironic use of the phrase in the popular culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{OR|date=August 2013}}

[[Clint Eastwood]]'s film, ''[[White Hunter, Black Heart]]'' (1990) presents clear examples of this type, both in the professional hunters leading John Wilson in to the bush and in the director's passion to be such a hunter.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}{{OR|date=August 2013}}

==The phrase itself==
The phrase "''great'' white hunter" probably has its origins in these popular depictions of safari adventures.  [[Peter Capstick]], a white hunter and an author of books on the subject, suggested that the word "great" may have been added by American popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hathaway Capstick, ''SAFARI: The Last Adventure'', St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp. 132&amp;ndash;133&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not a term employed or embraced by the hunters themselves. Its meaning, like many labels from the colonial era, is now shaded with parody or derision: it came to symbolize a perceived arrogance of western colonial powers toward the less developed parts of the world they controlled before the dismemberment of their empires after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

He was born in [[Redditch]], [[Worcestershire]] to Walter and Elizabeth Mayneord but after the early death of his mother was adopted by an aunt in Evesham. He was educated at [[Prince Henry's High School|Prince Henry's School, Evesham]] and gained a [[Bachelor of Science]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]

He entered the field of medical physics in 1924 at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bart's Hospital]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; In 1927 he moved to the Cancer Hospital, now the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. There he was involved in pioneering work with [[Izrael Hieger]].
During World War II he was seconded by the government to work in Canada on the radiological aspects of atomic energy development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.m-pss.org/file_35448.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that such was his renown, especially for bringing in the use of the radiological unit the [[Rad (unit)|rad]], that the [[SI]] unit may well have been called the Mayneord instead of the [[Gray (unit)|Gray]] (2).  It was during a meeting in 1946 with a young [[Harold E. Johns|Harold Elford Johns]], inventor of the [[cobalt-60]] teletherapy unit, that Johns was prompted to go into medical physics. His department subsequently developed one of the world's first radioisotope scanners.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1965. His candidacy citation read: "''Distinguished for his applications of physics to medical sciences. He was responsible for the use of fluorescence spectroscopy in the collaborative study of carcinogenic agents in coal-tar which led to the discovery of the activity of 3:4 - benzopyrene.&lt;ref&gt;See Kennaway (1955) Br. Med. J. September 24th, pp.749 - 752&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first to measure gamma-radiation in "r" units. His precision measurements have stood the test of time. He is recognised as the leading authority in the United Kingdom on the applications of radiation dosimetry to medical radiology and to the problems of radiation hazards''." &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27mayneord%27%29&lt;/ref&gt;
