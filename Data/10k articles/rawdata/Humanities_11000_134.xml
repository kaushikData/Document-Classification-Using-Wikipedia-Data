'''Actual Art''' is a genre of art that was first named by critic [[Alfred Frankenstein]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' in a review of [[Helene Aylon]]’s work.  The name was chosen because the art was "real", but the term ''[[Realism (arts)|realism]]'' was already in use.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"&gt;[Frankenstein, Alfred. San Francisco Chronicle, "NY, Helene Aylon" September 28, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenstein described Aylon's work as a genre of art that involves “the self-conscious enlistment of the forces of nature, by artists, toward the completion of their art”.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"/&gt; Collaboration with nature necessarily brings the dimension of time into as an integral component of the artworks, with some requiring many thousands of years for their completion. The artists consider the future of the work to be as important as its present, relinquishing control over the work to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Fugate-Wilcox's deliberate yielding to the forces over which he has no control measures his awareness of the power of nature." Jonathon Goodman, ''Art in America'' (Dec. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- [[Image:Redspot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Red Spot" painting of 21st century material; a paint that never dries, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] --&gt;

==History==
In 1982, the Actual Art Foundation formed in the [[Tribeca]] district of New York City to promote exclusively artists working in the Actual Art genre, and in 1985, obtained its 501-C3 not-for-profit tax-exempt status to fund exhibitions of Actual Art and projects proposed by Actual Artists.  The most notable early exhibitions sponsored by the Actual Art Foundation were:

* "It's About Time" at the New York City Gallery in 1983
* "Time Will Tell" at Squibb International, Princeton, NJ in 1984
* "Slow Kinetic Art" at the Wadsworth Athenium, Hartfortd, CT
* "Time Waits..." co-sponsored with [[Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis]] and his wife [[Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis|Gloria]] at [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|Schloss St. Emmeram]] in [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

The "Time Will Tell" exhibit was documented in articles appearing in the ''New York Times'', the ''Bergen County Record'', the ''Princeton Packet'', and the ''Trentonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Cook, "Actual Exhibit at Squibb", ''Trentonian'', June 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of Actual Art Foundation was also used for an episode of Law &amp; Order circa 1990, featuring Actual Art. Actual Art Foundation lost its Tribeca headquarters in the attacks of [[9/11]] and created an Art Center at Candlewood Lake in Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
In Actual Art, what future generations will see is programmed into the work, making time an element of the work, as well as space, form or color. The artists introduce time as a tool in the making of art. Actual Art is about energy; specifically, about the energy and life in the materials. Words like “decay”, “deterioration” or “destruction” are replaced with “change”.&lt;ref&gt;[Weiss, Paulette. "Actual Art at Fulcrum Gallery" '''Where Magazine''', July 1997 illust]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] is quoted as saying, “The work will last forever, as long as you understand it changes.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Lancion, “Contrarian Gallery gains Cultural Leverage”, ''Craine’s Small Business'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Art moves one to think about ways to work with nature instead of fighting it. In place of the constant attempts to inhibit materials’ natural tendency to change (to the detriment of the planet), man might be examining and exploiting the inherent qualities of the materials we work with. Actual Artists have a visionary sense of the natural order of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;[Randell, Susan '''Manhattan Arts International'''  June-Aug, 1994 pg. 6, Illust]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Andy Goldsworthy]]'''
*'''Allen Sonfist'''
*'''Forrest Myers'''

Perhaps the most ambitious work of art envisioned by an Actual artist is the San Andreas Fault Sculpture Project, proposed by Tery Fugate-Wilcox, which Actual Art Foundation has committed to sponsoring.&lt;ref&gt;[Bartelme, Margaret.  "The San Andreas Fault", Art Week, Vol. 6-45, Vol. 7-1, 11/27/'75 &amp; 1/3/’76]&lt;/ref&gt;

This {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}} slab of concrete, {{convert|20|ft|m}} thick is intended to span the San Andreas Fault, which will rip the artwork in half, with the west half traveling north towards Alaska over the next few million years or so.&lt;ref&gt;[Walker, Michael.

'''Airyanem Vaejah''; [[Avestan]]: ''𐬀𐬌𐬭𐬌𐬌𐬀𐬥𐬀 𐬬𐬀𐬉𐬘𐬀𐬵‎'' ''airiiana vaējah'', approximately “expanse of the [[Aryan#Etymology|Aryans]]”, i.e. [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]])&lt;ref&gt;See p. 164 in: P.O. Skjaervo, The Avesta as source for the early history of the Iranians. In: G. Erdosy (ed.), The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia. (Indian Philology and South Asian Studies, A. Wezler and M. Witzel, eds.), vol. 1, Berlin/New York: de Gruyter 1995, pp.155-176.&lt;/ref&gt; is the homeland of the early Iranians and a reference in the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Avesta]]'' (''[[Vendidad]]'', Farg. 1) to one of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s "sixteen perfect lands."&lt;ref&gt;Darmesteter, James. ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'' (1898). Peterson, Joseph H., Avesta - Zoroastrian Archives: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 1. http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd1sbe.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and related words==
The [[Avestan]] term ''airyanəm vaējah'' is formed from the plural [[genitive case]] of ''airya'' and the word ''vaējah'' (whose oft-used [[nominative case]] is ''vaējō''). The meaning of ''vaējah'' is uncertain. It may be related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''vej/vij'', suggesting the region of a fast-flowing river.&lt;ref&gt;See Edwin Bryant, The Quest for the origins of Vedic culture, 2001: 327&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been interpreted by some as "seed". Avestan ''airya'' is etymologically related to the [[Old Persian]] ''ariya''.

The related Old Iranian term ''*aryānām xšaθra-'' is the origin of the modern [[Persian language|Persian]] term "[[Iran]]" via [[Middle Persian]] 𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭𐭱𐭲𐭥𐭩 ''Ērān-shahr'' and ''𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭‎ Ērān'' during the [[Sasanian Empire]].

==Historical concepts==
The historical location of Airyanem Vaejah is still uncertain. In the first chapter of the ''Vendidad'' is a listing of 16 countries, and some scholars believe that Airyanem Vaejah lies to the north of all of these.&lt;ref&gt;Zoroaster’s Time and Homeland: A Study on the Origins of Mazdeism and Related Problems by Gherardo Gnoli, Instituto Universitario Orientale, Seminario di Studi Asiatici, (Series Minor VII), Naples, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[James Darmesteter|Darmesteter]] notes in his translation of the Avesta, [[Bundahishn]] 29:12 directly states that it was beside Azerbaijan,&lt;ref&gt;Darmesteter, James. ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'' (1898). Peterson, Joseph H., Avesta - Zoroastrian Archives: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 1. [http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd1sbe.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; however, most modern scholars favor a more eastern location.

Bahram Farahvashi and [[Nasser Takmil Homayoun]] suggest that Airyanem Vaejah was probably centered on [[Khwarezm]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun]], ''Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?''. 2004. {{ISBN|964-379-023-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a region that is now split between several [[Central Asia]]n republics. The [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] likewise believes Khwarezm to be the “most likely locale” corresponding to the original home of the Avestan-speaking peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Elton L. Daniel, ''The History of Iran''. 2001. {{ISBN|0-313-30731-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] once called Khwarezm “the cradle of the Aryan tribe”.

Conversely, according to [[Michael Witzel]], Airyanem Vaejah lies at the center of the 16 lands mentioned in the ''Vendidad'': an area now in the central [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] highlands&lt;ref name="Witzel"&gt;M. Witzel, "The Vīdēvdað list obviously was composed or redacted by someone who regarded Afghanistan and the lands surrounding it as the home of all Aryans (''airiia''), that is of all (eastern) Iranians, with Airiianem Vaẽjah as their center." p. 48, ''“The Home Of The Aryans”'', Festschrift J. Narten = Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft, Beihefte NF 19, Dettelbach: J.H. Röll 2000, 283-338. Also published online, at [[Harvard University]] ([http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf LINK])&lt;/ref&gt; (around [[Bamyan Province]]).

David Anthony's ''[[The Horse, the Wheel and Language]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W. (2007). The Horse, the Wheel, and Language. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05887-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes no direct reference to Airynem Vaejah. Anthony may, however, provide evidence linking it to four successive Indo-European cultures. 
* On the lower and middle [[Volga River]], 
** the [[Poltavka culture]] of 2700–2100 BCE and
** the [[Abashevo culture]] of 2500–1900 BCE.
* In the area that is now [[Kazakhstan]]:
** the [[Sintashta culture]] of 2200–1600 BCE; and
** the [[Andronovo culture]] of 2000–900 BCE.

Shrikant G. Talageri, in his book ''[[The Rigveda: A Historical Analysis]]'', proposes that Airyam Vaejah was located in [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://voiceofdharma.org/books/rig/ch6.htm voiceofdharma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andijan''' (sometimes spelled '''Andizhan''' in English) ({{lang-uz|Andijon / Андижон}} / ئەندىجان; {{lang-fa|اندیجان}}, ''Andijân/Andīǰān''; {{lang-ru|Андижан}}, ''Andižan'') is a city in [[Uzbekistan]]. It is the administrative, economic, and cultural center of [[Andijan Region]]. Andijan is located in the south-eastern edge of the [[Fergana Valley]] near Uzbekistan's border with [[Kyrgyzstan]].

Andijan is one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries. Historically, Andijan was an important city on the [[Silk Road]]. The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of [[Babur]] who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor.

Andijan is an important industrial city in the country. Manufactured goods produced in the city include [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[Major appliance|domestic appliance]]s, [[electronics]], [[food]]stuffs, [[furniture]], [[Plough|plow]]s, [[pump]]s, [[shoe]]s, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and [[wheelchair]]s.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The origin of the name of the city is uncertain. Arab geographers of the 10th century referred to Andijan as "Hindijaan," "Hindaghan," or "Handigan" meaning - "The city of Hindus or Hindu Temples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pospelov|first=E.

Toponymic Dictionary|year=1998|publisher=Russkie slovari|location=Moscow|isbn=5-89216-029-7|page=36|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional explanation links the name of the city to the Turkic tribal names.&lt;ref name="OʻzME"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2000–2005 | title = Andijon | last = Ziyayev | first = Baxtiyor | encyclopedia = Oʻzbekiston milliy ensiklopediyasi | publisher = Oʻzbekiston milliy ensiklopediyasi | location = Toshkent | language = Uzbek | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of [[Babur]] who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Central Asian Uprisings in the Nineteenth Century: Ferghana under the Russians|journal=[[Russian Review]]|year=1987|volume=46|issue=3|pages=267–281|doi=10.2307/130563|jstor=130563}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], especially Babur, Andijan was a large and important city in the region. During that period, art and culture flourished in the city.

After the formation of the [[Khanate of Kokand]] in the 18th century, the capital was moved from Andijan to [[Kokand]]. In the mid-19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] began occupying the area of present-day [[Central Asia]]. In 1876, the Russians conquered the Khanate of Kokand and the city of Andijan along with it.

Andijan was the center and flashpoint of the [[Andijan Uprising of 1898]] in which the followers of [[Sufi]] leader [[Madali Ishan]] attacked the Russian barracks in the city, killing 22 and injuring 16-20 more. In retaliation, 18 of the participants were hanged and 360 exiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 0-520-21355-6| pages = 59| last = Khalid| first = Adeeb

On 16 December 1902, much of the city was leveled by a severe [[earthquake]] which destroyed up to 30,000 homes in the region and killed as many as 4,500 residents.&lt;ref name="EL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kislov|first=D.|title=Paging through old journals: Evidence of the 1902 Andijan Earthquake|url=http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=5232|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=Ferghana|date=13 July 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule was established in Andijan in 1917, the city quickly became an important industrial city in the [[Uzbek SSR]].

===Modern history===
During the Soviet demarcation of [[Central Asia]], Andijan was separated from its historical [[hinterland]] as the [[Ferghana Valley]] was divided among three separate Soviet republics. Andijan itself became part of the [[Uzbek SSR]].

During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], many Soviet citizens were evacuated to Andijan and the surrounding towns. Of the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] refugees fleeing [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] and banished by the Soviets to [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]], some relocated to Andijan starting in 1941.

In the 1990s, Andijan and the surrounding region became politically unstable. Poverty and an upsurge in [[Islamic fundamentalism]] produced tensions in the region. The town, and the region as a whole, suffered a severe economic decline following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Repeated border closures badly damaged the local economy, worsening the already widespread poverty of Andijan's inhabitants.

==Economy==
Andijan has been an important craft and trade center in the [[Fergana Valley]] since the 15th century. After annexation by the Russians in 1876, the economy of the city started to grow significantly. Several industrial plants were built in Andijan after the city was connected with Russia with a railway line in 1889.&lt;ref name="OʻzSE"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Moʻminov |editor-first=Ibrohim |date=1971 |encyclopedia=Oʻzbek sovet ensiklopediyasi |trans-title=|edition= |title=Andijon |language=Uzbek |publisher= |volume=1 |location=Toshkent |pages=359–360 |quote= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hospitals, pharmacies, banks, and printing houses were established in the city during that period. After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule was established in late December 1917, both [[Light industry|light]] and [[Heavy industry|heavy]] industries developed significantly. Andijan became the first city in Uzbekistan to be fully supplied with [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="OʻzSE"/&gt;

Andijan remains an important industrial city in independent Uzbekistan. There are 48 large industrial plants and about 3,000 [[small and medium enterprises]] in the city.&lt;ref name="OʻzME"/&gt; Manufactured goods produced in the city include [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[Major appliance|domestic appliance]]s, [[electronics]], [[food]]stuffs, [[furniture]], [[Plough|plow]]s, [[pump]]s, [[shoe]]s, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and [[wheelchair]]s. Andijan is also home to over 50 international companies,{{fact|date=September 2017}} five of which produce spare parts for [[GM Uzbekistan]].

== Education ==
There are four higher education institutions in Andijan City. The Andijan Medical Institute is the largest of the four. The city is also home to four colleges, one academic lyceum, 21 vocational schools, 47 secondary schools, three music and art schools, nine sports schools, and 86 kindergartens.&lt;ref name="OʻzSE"/&gt;

The '''Archaeology Data Service''' (ADS) is an open access [[digital archive]] for [[archaeology|archaeological]] research outputs. It is located in [[The King's Manor]], at the [[University of York]]. Originally intended to curate digital outputs from archaeological researchers based in the UK's Higher Education sector, the ADS also holds archive material created under the auspices of national and local government as well as in the [[commercial archaeology]] sector. The ADS carries out research, most of which focuses on resource discovery, cross-searching and [[interoperability]] with other relevant archives in the UK, Europe and the United States of America.

The Archaeology Data Service is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADS Entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100000006|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the late 1990s a consensus developed in the field of archaeology that archaeological data in digital form was highly fragile due to both an inadequate understanding of technical threats to its sustainability and the lack of an infrastructure to preserve it in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Condron ''et al'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a consortium comprising eight Departments of Archaeology from UK Universities joined forces with the [[Council for British Archaeology]] (CBA) to put a proposal to the [[Arts and Humanities Data Service]] Executive to establish an Archaeology Data Service.&lt;ref&gt;http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/annrpts/1997rpt.html#History&lt;/ref&gt; This service was to host a digital archive for archaeologists and to provide advice and guidance to the archaeological community on how to create and manage their digital datasets. As a result, the ADS was established at the [[University of York]] Department of Archaeology in September 1996 with two full-time members of staff and under the directorship of Professor [[Julian D. Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 until 2008 the ADS hosted [[AHDS Archaeology]], a subject centre devoted to archaeology funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] via the AHDS. The AHDS closed in March 2008 as a result of a controversial decision by the AHRC to withdraw funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intute.ac.uk/blog/2007/09/18/report-after-the-ahds-the-end-of-national-support/&lt;/ref&gt; The ADS now receives funding directly from [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]], rather than through the AHDS, it is also funded by other Higher Education and cultural heritage sector organisations including the [[European Union]].

The original consortium members were the archaeology departments of the following Universities:
*[[The University of Birmingham]]
*[[The University of Bradford]]
*The [[University of Glasgow]]
*The [[University of Kent at Canterbury]]
*The [[University of Leicester]]
*[[The University of Oxford]]
*[[Newcastle University|The University of Newcastle]]
*The [[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|University of York]]
and
*The [[Council for British Archaeology]]

The [[University of Southampton]] and [[University College London]] were also involved in early discussions about the formation of a digital archive for archaeological material, and joined the consortium at an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/newsletter/issue19/10yrs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance==
The ADS is run on a day-to-day basis by a director and a deputy director, however it is managed by a committee meeting bi-annually consisting of representatives of funding bodies, representatives of user communities and the ADS internal Management Group, comprising the Director, Deputy Director, European Project Manager, Communications and Access Manager, and the Systems Manager. The current (2012) Chair of the management committee is Professor [[Tim Darvill]] of the [[University of Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/management.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Archive ==

=== Content===
The ADS holds the digital outputs of numerous archaeological excavations or other research activities including some very well known sites such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Sutton Hoo]]. Much of the archive material can be grouped together under 'programme' headings such as the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] (CTRL) which involved over 100 different archaeological interventions. The ADS acts as the mandated digital archive for archaeological research, of any kind, funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/FundingOpportunities/Documents/Research%20Funding%20Guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612055430/http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/FundingOpportunities/Documents/Research%20Funding%20Guide.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for [[English Heritage]] administered funds such as the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/projArch/alsf/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal [[Internet Archaeology]]'s content is archived by the ADS and a number of journal series from learned societies such as the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]], have older digital versions of their [[Academic journal|journals]] made freely available from the ADS site. The ADS is the largest single source of archived [[grey literature]], with over 20,000 examples available in its ''Library of Unpublished Fieldwork''. Access to grey literature in the archaeological context has become a significant concern, especially in academia, in recent years.&lt;ref name=Bradley2006&gt;Bradley(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advice ===
The ADS offer advice to data creators on procedures and formats, including advice on the writing of ''Technical Appendices'' for AHRC applications. The website hosts a series of Guides to Good Practice (G2GP) on the following archaeological topics:
* [[Geographical Information Systems]]
* Archiving [[Aerial Photography]] and [[Remote Sensing]] Data
* Digital Archives from [[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]] and Fieldwork
* [[Archaeological geophysics|Geophysical Data]] in Archaeology
* [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]
* Creating and Using [[Virtual Reality]] a Guide for the Arts and Humanities
All these G2GP were revised in 2012 funded in part by [[English Heritage]] and the US based Digital Antiquity project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalantiquity.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures===
The ADS archive is intended to follow the [[Open Archival Information System]] reference model, which is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] for data archive systems. There are no constraints on access although users must click a web form to accept the ADS Terms and Conditions, in essence these state that the all copyright is retained by the original data depositor, but they permit its reuse for teaching, learning and research purposes, but not commercial purposes. Off site back-up storage for the ADS archive is held both at the [[University of York]]'s computer services and at the [[UK Data Archive]] in Essex.

=== Interface===
Beyond acting as a simple repository for datasets, the ADS has a number of interactive interfaces into complex archives including database search interfaces, Web[[GIS]] and interactive image galleries. The main search mechanism for the ADS catalogue, ArchSearch, contains aggregated resource discovery [[metadata]] for the national monument inventories of England, Scotland and [[Wales]] (hosted by [[English Heritage]], the [[RCAHMS]] and the [[RCAHMW]]) as well as numerous Historic Environment Records [[Historic Environment Record|HERs]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ADS hosts a number of datasets, such as the Excavation Index, that are made available externally as [[web services]] and consumed by [[English Heritage]]'s Heritage Gateway search engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/gateway/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

===UK based projects===
Significant projects undertaken by the ADS in the UK include:
* The OASIS project (Online AccesS to the Index of archaeological investigationS) funded by [[English Heritage]] and [[Historic Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Hardman &amp; Richards(2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; this project is being expanded to include a [[C14 dating|C14]] extension in collaboration with [[Historic Scotland]] and the [[RCAHMS]].
* England's [[Rock Art]] a site for the reporting and exploration of prehistoric rock art in the [[Northumberland]] area of England funded [[English Heritage]] and [[Northumberland County Council]]
*Archaeootools, funded by the [[Jisc]]-[[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]]-[[EPSRC]] [[eScience]] programme, this project looks at the potential for [[Natural Language Processing]] for harvesting resource discovery [[metadata]] from archaeological documentation, and [[faceted classification]] as an interface technology into archaeological catalogues. This project is collaboration with the department of [[Computer Science]] at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey ''et al''(2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===European funded projects===
Significant EU funded projects include:
*Virtual Exploration of Underwater Sites (VENUS), funded by the [[European Union]] [[Sixth Framework Programme]] (FP6) this project looks at the potential for automated [[photogrammetry]] of [[maritime archaeology]] sites including the use of [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]'s and [[AUV]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Alcala ''et al'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The preparing DARIAH project is funded by the [[European Union]] European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures ([[ESFRI]]) Roadmap, [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7). This project is scoping a pan-European digital infrastructure of the Arts and [[Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dariah.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; Under this project the ADS will be extending cross searching of monument inventories in a number of countries, developing an earlier cross-searching project called ARENA.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny &amp; Kilbride  (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Archaeology of Contemporary Europe (ACE) is part of the [[European Commission]]'s Culture Programme, among other functions, under this project the ADS is building and hosting a [[UDDI]] registry for the Historic Environment Information Resources Network (HEIRNET).
*CARARE:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carare.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; A best practice network funded by the [[European Commission]]'s ICT Policy Support Programme. CARARE brings together heritage agencies and organisations, archaeological museums and research institutions and specialist digital archives from all over Europe to establish a service that will make digital content for Europe's unique archaeological monuments and historic sites interoperable with Europeana. It aims to add the 3D and Virtual Reality content to Europeana. The ADS have specific responsibility for investigating the issues surrounding the long-term sustainability of the CARARE aggregation service.
*LoCloud (Local Content in a Europeana Cloud)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.locloud.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; is a best practice network which began in March 2013 and will run for three years. It is coordinated by the Norsk Kulturrad and made up of 33 partners across 25 European countries. LoCloud follows directly on from the aforementioned CARARE project and EuropeanaLocal, another recently completed best practice network project, funded under the e-Contentplus programme. It played an important role in ensuring the digital content provided by Europe’s local and regional cultural institutions were represented in Europeana. The intention of LoCloud is to combine the metadata mapping methodology of CARARE with cloud computing technology, making it easier for small to medium-sized heritage organisations to make their contents accessible via Europeana.
*ARIADNE (Advanced Research Infrastructure for Archaeological Dataset Networking) &lt;ref&gt;http://ariadne-infrastructure.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; brings together and integrates existing archaeological research data infrastructures so that researchers can use the various distributed datasets and new and powerful technologies as an integral component of the archaeological research methodology. There is now a large availability of archaeological digital datasets that all together span different periods, domains and regions; more are continuously created as a result of the increasing use of IT. They are the accumulated outcome of the research of individuals, teams and institutions, but form a vast and fragmented corpus and their potential has been constrained by difficult access and non-homogenous perspectives.

===Other international projects===
*The ADS is a participant in 'Digital Antiquity' a [[Mellon Foundation|Mellon]] funded project as well as the [[Jisc]]/[[NEH|National Endowment for the Humanities]] funded project which is intended to investigate data cross-searching and/or [[interoperability]] between, for example, individual site [[zooarchaeology|zooarchaeological]] databases.

'''Canadian Geospace Monitoring''' (CGSM) is a Canadian space science program that was initiated in 2005. CGSM is funded primarily by the [[Canadian Space Agency]], and consists of networks of imagers, meridian scanning [[photometer]]s, riometers, [[magnetometer]]s, digital [[ionosonde]]s, and [[High Frequency]] [[SuperDARN]] radars. The overarching objective of CGSM is to provide synoptic observations of the spatio-temporal evolution of the [[Ionosphere|ionospheric]] thermodynamics and electrodynamics at [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] and polar latitudes over a large region of [[Canada]].

==Background==

The interaction between the [[solar wind]] and the [[Earth's magnetic field]] has a number of consequences. In brief, these are the formation of the terrestrial [[Magnetosphere]], the provision of energy and matter to the [magnetosphere], and the powering of large-scale electric currents and the closely related phenomenon of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]. Near-Earth [[space physics|space physical]] processes are of interest for [[Space weather|economic reasons]] and for what we can learn about our environment and the cosmos. These processes are connected along the magnetic field to the Earth's [[ionosphere]], where they lead to the aurora, heating, modification of composition, and large-scale [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] motions. All of these [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] processes are interesting in their own right. In addition, there is an increasing understanding of the correspondence between [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] processes and processes going  on further out in near-Earth space. In this way, observations of the [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] processes can be used to in turn remote sense dynamics in near-Earth space.

[[Image:Map auroral oval mostly canada.png|right|thumb|250px|Contours of constant magnetic latitude and longitude. Latitude contours correspond to 65, 70, and 75 degrees. The bulk of the northern hemisphere auroral region that can be remote sensed from the ground is over Canada.]]

The interaction is significant at sub-auroral, auroral, and polar latitudes where large regions of the magnetosphere are mapped along the magnetic field into relatively small regions of the ionosphere, and where the [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] dynamics are controlled primarily by the plasma rather than the magnetic field. This organization is actually by magnetic rather than by geographic latitude (see Baker and Wing,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, K., and S. Wing, A new magnetic coordinate system for conjugate studies at high latitudes, J. Geophys. Res., 94(A7), 9139–9143, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and references therein for a description of magnetic vs. geographic coordinates). The [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], for example, is most frequently observed at magnetic latitudes between roughly 60 and 80 degrees (see Eather&lt;ref&gt;Eather, Robert H., Majestic Lights: The Aurora in Science, History, and The Arts. Washington, DC: American Geophysical Union. {{ISBN|0-87590-215-4}}. (323 pages), 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the northern hemisphere Canada has the largest land mass at the magnetic latitudes. As a consequence of this so-called "Canadian-advantage", Canada has been a world-leader in ground-based auroral and ionospheric research for decades.

CGSM was envisaged as a national program aimed at obtaining world-class [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] observations, and with those in hand directly studying ionospheric dynamics and indirectly the [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] dynamics. It was developed with the guiding principles embodied in five grand challenge science themes (see the [http://cgsm.ca/doc/c_science_factsheet_m.pdf "CGSM Science Factsheet"]). In summary, the science themes are related to the [[magnetic reconnection|reconnection]] and convection cycle, magnetospheric instabilities, the formation of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and the acceleration, transport, and loss of [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric plasma]]. These are science themes that pervade virtually every major space science initiative in the world, and CGSM gives Canada and more importantly Canadian researchers a unique opportunity to contribute new and innovative science.

==Technical Description of the Instrument Network==

[[Image:Canadian Geospace Monitoring.png|right|thumb|250px|CGSM instrument complement after completion of ongoing enhancements to the Canadian ground-based space science instrument network. Note contours of constant magnetic latitude from 60 to 80 degrees, showing the large fraction of the auroral region that is over Canada.]]

The CGSM science objectives dictate the observational requirements. In short, the program is designed to specify particle precipitation (aurora), electric currents, and plasma convection in the ionosphere over a large region of Canada. This requires networks of ground-based [[magnetometer]]s, ionosondes, High-Frequency radars, all-sky imagers, meridian scanning [[photometer]]s, and riometers. Furthermore, these networks must have overlapping Fields-of-View that span latitudes from the polar region, through the [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] zone, to sub-auroral latitudes. The observations must be of sufficient time and spatial resolution, and of sufficient quality (what determines quality depends on the instrument in question) to allow for new science to be derived from the observations.

Anticipated CGSM stakeholders met in [[Edmonton]] in June 2002 to initiate planning for the program. An ambitious plan was settled on, requiring numerous new instruments of various types to be deployed in challenging remote environments. The instruments would need to operate autonomously for long periods, and suffer few breakdowns. Much of the data would need to be recovered in real-time in order for CGSM to develop into an important [[space weather]] program, in addition to its space science objectives. New instruments would need to be acquired, outfitted and fielded at existing and new sites. To accomplish this, the team settled on using [[Telesat|Telesat Canada's]] HSi High Speed [[Satellite Internet]] system, in conjunction with an information technology infrastructure (basically a glorified [[local area network]] with additional capabilities including [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPS]],  [[GPS]], and attached hard-disk storage). Further, members of the team applied to the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] for funds for new instruments, and were successful on all fronts. The resulting funding enabled the deployment (which is still ongoing) of an additional 8 All-Sky Imagers, 14 fluxgate [[magnetometer]]s, 8 induction coil [[magnetometer]]s, and two additional [[SuperDARN]] radars (the new "PolarDARN" radars). In addition to facilities that were already in place in 2002 (from the [[Canadian Space Agency|Canadian Space Agency's]] CANOPUS&lt;ref&gt;Rostoker et al.,  Canopus — A ground-based instrument array for remote sensing the high latitude ionosphere during the ISTP/GGS program, Space Sci. Rev., Volume 71, Numbers 1-4, pages 743-760, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; program, the [[Natural Resources Canada]] CANMOS [[magnetometer]] array, and the [[NSERC]] supported NORSTAR, [[SuperDARN]], and CADI programs), the final array will certainly meet the scientific requirements.

CGSM began formally with the issuing of contracts to teams at the University of Calgary (photometers, riometers, ASIs), the University of Alberta (simulation, data management, fluxgate magnetometers), and the University of Saskatchewan (SuperDARN HF radars with a subcontract to the University of Western Ontario for digital ionosondes), Natural Resources Canada (space weather operations), and the National Research Council (solar monitor). As well, the University of Calgary developed a new system for managing information technology at the remote sites. In 2007, the CSA called for proposals for the second phase of CGSM. More than 20 proposals were submitted in October, 2007, and contracts were awarded in 2008 for continued and enhanced CGSM activities.

==Synergy With Satellite Missions==

In a recent review of major Canadian space science projects, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, W., et al., Solar and Space Physics in the Era of International Living With a Star, Physics in Canada, Volume 61, No. 1., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that CGSM is a unique facility, owing in part to the above-mentioned fact that the bulk of the northern hemisphere auroral region that can be remote sensed from the ground is over Canadian territory, and in part due to a significant investment in new experimental infrastructure that is being and will be realized during the period 2004-2010.

CGSM complements numerous satellite and international ground-based programs. The synergies between CGSM and satellite missions, for example, are very important. Satellites measure the plasma processes at work in the [[magnetosphere]] and [[ionosphere]] directly using [[magnetometer]]s, and electric field, plasma wave, and particle detectors. These processes, however, are truly multi-scale, with important scale sizes ranging from kilometers or less to tens of thousands of kilometers. Satellite observations are essential because they are our only direct look at the processes of interest. At the same time, the satellites are like "needles in a haystack", owing to the enormous scale sizes of the [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] system and the fact that all the scales seem to be important in the overall dynamic.

The [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] dynamics are projected along magnetic field lines into the ionosphere and are visible, for example, in changes in the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and large-scale [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] plasma motions. So we get a two-dimension picture of the [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] dynamics which provides an essential complement to the satellite observations. This synergy and its value in advancing science has been increasingly recognized in recent years. The [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency's]] [[Cluster mission]] included a Ground-Based Working Group that was created with the express purpose of maximizing the impact of coordinated ground-based observations (see Amm et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Amm, O., E. F. Donovan, H. Frey, M. Lester, R. Nakamura, J. A. Wild, A. Aikio, M. Dunlop, K. Kauristie, A. Marchaudon, I. W. McCrea, H. J. Opgenoorth, and A. Strømme, Coordinated studies of the geospace environment using Cluster, satellite and ground-based data: an interim review, Annales Geophysicae, 23:2129-2170, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; for a description of the impact of the Cluster Ground-Based Working Group). The five-satellite NASA [[THEMIS (satellite)|THEMIS mission]] launched on February 17, 2006 includes a ground-based component consisting of 20 ground-based observatories (some of which incorporate CGSM magnetometer data), indicating the recognition of the importance of coordinated ground-based observations.

'''Carole McAlpine Watson''' (born Kansas) is an American academic and leading civil servant. Watson has served twice as acting [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities]], first in 2009 and again in 2013 to 2014. Watson studied African American literature and authored ''Her Prologue'', a scholarly bibliography of novels by African American women published between 1859 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Her Prologue: The Novels of Black American Women | publisher=Greenwood | author=Watson, Carole M. | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson holds a bachelor's degree from Pittsburg State University, a Master's in English and American literature from St. Louis University, and a PhD in American cultural history from the George Washington University and was a Fellow of the Council for Excellence in Government (1991).&lt;ref name="hopkins.2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman |title=Deputy Chair |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927095115/http://www.neh.gov/about/chairman/deputy-chairman |archive-date=27 September 2014 |access-date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Watson began her career as an academic and educator. She directed Inter-cultural Programs at the Lindenwood Colleges in [[Saint Charles, Missouri]] and was the founding chair of the English department at the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity School in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Her academic work investigated the [[African-American literature|history of novels published by Black women]] in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Reflecting on the work, Watson noted that many of the novels reflected the social structure of the era: "I found that most of the novels weren’t any good—they were written to put a positive face on African-American life for white audiences or to serve as exemplars for African-American readers. They were full of principles of behavior."&lt;ref name="hopkins.2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/decision-makers/government-operations/carole-watson-chairwoman-acting-20130714 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140812021227/http://www.nationaljournal.com/decision-makers/government-operations/carole-watson-chairwoman-acting-20130714 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 August 2014 |title=Carole Watson, Chairwoman (acting) of the NEH |publisher=National Journal |date=14 July 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014 |author=Hopkins, Christopher Snow }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a public servant, currently serving as Deputy Chair of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), Watson has exercised leadership in strengthening the role and importance of the humanities. According to the ''National Journal'', Watson has "done her part to obliterate the distinction between hard and soft fields of inquiry" and moved NEH forward through the [[National Digital Newspaper Program]], a humanities "equivalent of the Human Genome Project. In collaboration with the Library of Congress, the agency is digitizing a hundred years of reportage: every article published by an American newspaper between 1836 and 1922."&lt;ref name="hopkins.2013"/&gt;

Watson has twice served as Acting [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|Chair]] of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. She first directed that [[National Endowment for the Humanities|agency]] in 2009, prior to the appointment of [[Jim Leach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alscnews.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/carole-m-watson-appointed-acting-chairman-of-the-neh/ | title=Carole M.

During this time, Watson's leadership guided the NEH through a time of budgetary difficulty and uncertainty during the Federal sequester, for which she was commended in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cossa.org/2014/07/28/national-humanities-council-meets-as-neh-faces-budget-uncertainty-new-chairman/ | title=National Humanities Council Meets as NEH Faces Budget Uncertainty, New Chairman | publisher=Council of Social Science Associations | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Watson brokered a [[Memorandum of Understanding|MOU]] with the [[US Department of State]], which allowed for the distribution of documentaries created with NEH support to be distributed through the State Department's "American Corners" library program around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.state.gov/stories/2013/05/21/new-agreement-underwrites-exhibition-documentaries-us-embassies-abroad | title=New Agreement Underwrites Exhibition of Documentaries at U.S. Embassies Abroad | publisher=US Department of State | date=21 May 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Watson organized ''Standing Together'', an NEH funding initiative that aims to "help Americans understand the experiences of service members as they return to civilian life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalnewsradio.com/394/3655603/Carole-Watson-Acting-Chairman-National-Endowment-for-the-Humanities | title=Carole Watson | publisher=Federal News Radio | date=3 July 2014 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[phonetics]], a '''continuant''' is a [[speech sound]] [[manner of articulation|produced]] without a complete closure in the [[oral cavity]], namely [[fricative]]s, [[approximant]]s and [[vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"continuant" in Bussamann, ''Routledge dictionary of language and linguistics'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Approximants and vowels are sometimes called "frictionless continuants".&lt;ref&gt;"approximant" in Crystal, ''A dictionary of linguistics and phonetics'', 6th ed, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Continuants contrast with [[occlusive]]s, such as [[Stop consonant|stops]], [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] and [[Nasal consonant|nasals]].

Compare [[sonorant]] (resonant), which includes vowels, approximants and [[Nasal consonant|nasals]] but not fricatives, and contrasts with [[obstruent]].

Whether [[Lateral consonant|laterals]], [[Flap consonant|taps/flaps]], or [[Trill consonant|trills]] are continuant is not conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Hayes (linguist)|year=2009|title=Introductory Phonology|publisher=Blackwell|page=78|isbn=978-1-4051-8411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10886">The '''Data Quality Act''' '''(DQA)''' or '''Information Quality Act''' '''(IQA)''',  passed through the [[United States Congress]] in Section 515 of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001]]  ({{USPL|106|554}}). Because the Act was a two-sentence rider in a spending bill, it had no name given in the actual legislation. The [[Government Accountability Office]] calls it the '''Information Quality Act''',&lt;ref name=OMB515&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency Information Quality Guidelines|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_agency_info_quality_links|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others call it the Data Quality Act.

IQA directs the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) to issue government-wide guidelines that "provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies".&lt;ref name=Simpson2011&gt;{{citation|title=Free Course Book for Course 3: Statutory Law and Intelligence|year= 2011|editor-first=David Alan |editor-last=Jordan|chapter=Quality Data Act (Information Quality Act (IQA))|first= Michael |last=Simpson|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal agencies are also required to publish their own guidelines for information quality and peer review agendas.&lt;ref name=OMB515/&gt;

==Text of the IQA==

[[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001]] Sec. 515 reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Quality Act|url=http://www.fws.gov/informationquality/section515.html|publisher=Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=7 January 2013|author=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(a) In General. – The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, by not later than September 30, 2001, and with public and Federal agency involvement, issue guidelines under sections 3504(d)(1) and 3516 of title 44, United States Code, that provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies in fulfillment of the purposes and provisions of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, commonly referred to as the Paperwork Reduction Act.

(b) Content of Guidelines. – The guidelines under subsection (a) shall –

:(1) apply to the sharing by Federal agencies of, and access to, information disseminated by Federal agencies; and
:(2) require that each Federal agency to which the guidelines apply –
::(A) issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by the agency, by not later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines under subsection (a);
::(B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the guidelines issued under subsection (a); and
::(C) report periodically to the Director –
:::(i) the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency; and
:::(ii) how such complaints were handled by the agency.

==Criticism==
The Data Quality Act has been criticized as providing a vehicle for special interest groups to challenge regulations on the grounds of not meeting information quality requirements.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2005&gt;{{citation|series=Interrogations|title=Thanks to a little-known piece of legislation, scientists at the EPA and other agencies find their work questioned not only by industry, but by their own government|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/08/28/interrogations/?page=full|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]|first=Chris |last=Mooney |date=August 28, 2005|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others view unchecked data and lack of peer-review as a tool of political corruption leading to the imposition of [[Standard_of_review#Arbitrary_and_capricious|arbitrary and capricious]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell Meshkin|first=Catherine|title=Unchecked Data: A Tool for Political Corruption?|journal=Engage|date=December 2010|volume=11|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Quality Act as basis for law suits==

The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] filed a lawsuit to prevent dissemination of [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s "Climate Action Report 2002" published May 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/usnc3.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Department of State, U.S. |title=U.S. Climate Action Report – 2002|location=Washington, D.C.|date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the research did not meet requirements of the Federal Data Quality Act (FDQA), which came into effect in October 2002.&lt;ref name=CEI&gt;{{citation|url=http://cei.org/outreach-regulatory-comments-and-testimony/ceis-petition-against-further-dissemination-epas-climate-|publisher=Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)|title=CEI's Petition Against Further Dissemination Of EPA's "Climate Action Report 2002"|first=Christopher C. |last=Horner|date=February 9, 2003|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=United States District Court|title=Agree to dismissal: Competitive Enterprise Institute (plaintiff) v.

In 2004 the Salt Institute, a salt-producers' association and the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] sued the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] in federal court using the Data Quality Act.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2005 /&gt; The suit alleged that federal scientists lacked evidence that salt was harmful to health. Although the case was dismissed, the Salt Institute appealed the decision.&lt;ref name=WSJ2005&gt;{{citation|title=Despite Big Health Concerns, Food Industry Can't Shake Salt: Scientists Struggle to Find An Acceptable Substitute; Diners Are Hooked, Too|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB110928928748463733|publisher=Wall Street Journal|first=Sarah |last=Ellison|date=February 25, 2005|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Journal of the American Dietetic Association]] and the [[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] (NHLBI) which is part of the US [[National Institutes of Health]] claimed that the food industry is adding too much salt to foods.&lt;ref name=WSJ2005/&gt;

The '''Disney Legends''' '''Awards''' is a [[hall of fame]] program that recognizes individuals who have made an extraordinary and integral contribution to [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Established in 1987, the honor was traditionally awarded annually during a special private ceremony; since 2009, it has been awarded biennially during Disney's [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClendon|first1=Lamarco|title=Disney Sets Dates for D23 Expo 2017|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/d23-dates-2017-star-wars-marvel-1201740320/|accessdate=September 20, 2016|work=Variety|date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipients are chosen by a selection committee, formerly appointed and chaired by Disney Legend [[Roy E. Disney]], [[Walt Disney]]'s nephew, former vice chairman and director emeritus of The Walt Disney Company. The committee consists of long-time Disney executives, historians, and other authorities. Besides the award statuette itself, each honoree is represented by a bronze [[commemorative plaque]]; featuring the recipients' handprints and signature if they were living when inducted, or simply an image of the statuette emblem if the induction was posthumous. The plaques are placed on display in [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)#Disney Legends Plaza|Legends Plaza]] at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]], across from the [[Team Disney|Michael D. Eisner Building]]. Legends also receive a Disney [[Golden Pass (Disney)|Golden Pass]], a lifetime pass to all Disney theme parks.

== The Award ==
[[Image:Disneylegendaward.jpg|thumb|right|The Disney Legends Award statuette]]
Imagineer [[Andrea Favilli]] created the Disney Legends award, which is handcrafted from bronze each year. The award depicts the arm of [[Mickey Mouse]] holding a star-tipped wand.

Disney describes the award as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Disney Legends award has three distinct elements that characterize the contributions made by each talented recipient.
'''The Spiral'''&amp;nbsp;... stands for imagination, the power of an idea.
'''The Hand'''&amp;nbsp;... holds the gifts of skill, discipline and craftsmanship.
'''The Wand and the Star''' ... represent magic: the spark that is ignited when imagination and skill combine to create a new dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney Legends - D23|url=https://d23.com/disney-legends/|website=D23|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes known as document bibles or transaction deal bibles, '''e-bibles''' are a means of storing, indexing and comprehensively searching large volumes of [[document]]s related to any corporate transaction. 

They are commonly used by [[Legal firm]]s to collate documents from a certain case in order to store or give to a client at the end of a project. e-bibles are a means of storing complex legal folders which were usually kept in hard copy.

In 2009, Proposals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.litig.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=2&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=33 &lt;/ref&gt; were put in place in order to standardise the creation of e-bibles throughout the [[legal industry]].

There are few suppliers of COTS solutions, however Diskbuilder&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diskbuilder.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  and Ideagen&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ideagenplc.com/&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Capgen) are notable exceptions.

'''Eglinton Castle''' was a large Gothic castellated mansion in [[Kilwinning]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].

==History==

===The castle===
[[Image:Eglintoncastle1876.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Tournament Bridge and castle in 1876&lt;ref name="Dobie"&gt;Dobie, James (1876). ''Pont's Cuninghame'' Pub. John Tweed.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Eglinton castle (old).jpg|thumb|190px|right|Eglintoune castle from the south, prior to the rebuild of 1805]]
The ancient seat of the [[Earl of Eglinton|Earls of Eglinton]], it is located just south of the town of [[Kilwinning]]. The original Eglinton Castle was burnt by the [[Earl of Glencairn]] in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). ''Collins Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia''. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 278 - 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The current castle was built between 1797 and 1802 in Gothic [[castellated]] style dominated by a central {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} large round [[keep]] and four {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} outer towers, it was second only to [[Culzean Castle]] in appearance and grandeur. The foundation stone of the new Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning was laid in 1797, the 12th Earl of Eglinton, was proud to have the ceremony performed by Alexander Hamilton of [[Kerelaw House|Grange]], grandfather of the American Hero [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/450posteric.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/default.htm&amp;usg=__mIQHTNpIt-5W7ywc3whs7VG1lEU=&amp;h=153&amp;w=450&amp;sz=21&amp;hl=en&amp;start=39&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=QO0c96naJtfSFM:&amp;tbnh=43&amp;tbnw=127&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DEarl%2Bof%2BEglinton%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DN%26start%3D20%26um%3D1 Kilwinning Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ainslie's Eglinton in 1790.JPG|thumb|200px|John Ainslie's 1790 map showing formal pleasure or possibly kitchen gardens on the opposite side of the Lugton Water to the castle]]
Eglinton was the most notable post-Adam Georgian castle in Ayrshire.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;Sanderson, Maragaret H. B. (1993), ''Robert Adam in Ayrshire''. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc. Monograph No. 11. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many items of interest, the castle contained a chair built from the oak timbers of [[Alloway]] kirk and the back of the chair was inlaid with a brass plaque which bore the whole of Burns' poem ''Tam o' Shanter''.&lt;ref name ="Alloway"&gt;Aikman, J. &amp; Gordon, W. (1839) An Account of the Tournament at Eglinton. Pub. Hugh Paton, Carver &amp; Gilder. Edinburgh. M.DCCC.XXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; This was sold at an auction in 1925.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"&gt;Dowells Ltd. ''Catalogue of the Superior Furnishings, French Furniture, etc.'' Tuesday, 1 December 1925, and four following days.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Eglington castle (sic) was described circa 1563–1566 as a ''fare castell, but noo strength againsts any power.''&lt;ref name="Arch Ayr Wigton"&gt;''Military Report on the Districts of Carrick, Kyle &amp; Cunningham.'' Archaeological &amp; Historical Collections relating to Ayr &amp; Wigton. 1884. Vol. IV. Pub. Ayr &amp; Wigton Arch Assoc. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; An escape tunnel is said to run from the old castle to the area of the rockery on the castle lawns. The appearance of the old waterfall may have inspired this story as it looks like a sealed doorway.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, Allison (2008), Five Roads / Corsehillhead resident.&lt;/ref&gt; The total acreage of the Earl of Eglinton's holdings was 34,716 Scots Acres (1 Scots acre = 1.5 English Acres) in 1788.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;National Archives of Scotland. RHP35796/1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This included Little Cumbrae, and lands at Southannan and Eaglesham (Polnoon).

The original castle of Eglinton may have been near Kidsneuk, Bogside (NS 309 409) where a substantial earth mound or motte stands and excavated pottery was found tentatively dating the site to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Anne Turner and Stevenson, Sylvia (1980), Historic Irvine the archaeological implications of development. Scottish Burgh Survey. Dept. Archaeology, Univ Glasgow. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montgomerys' first holdings were the Barony of [[Eaglesham]] and its [[Polnoon Castle|Castle of Polnoon]].
[[File:Scotia Depicta - Eglinton Castle -Plate-.jpg|300px|thumb|Etching of Eglinton Castle by [[James Fittler]] in Scotia Depicta published 1804]]
In 1691 the 'Hearth Tax for Ayrshire' records show 25 hearths in use, the highest number for a single dwelling in Ayrshire. It is noted that the earl had not paid the tax. The earl's house in Kilwinning, Easter Chambers or the old abbot's dwelling, had 15 hearths. Thirty-seven other dwellings were listed within the barony of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"&gt;Urquhart, Page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The stables were built from stones taken from the Easter Chambers of Kilwinning Abbey; being the Abbots lodgings and later that of the Earls of Eglinton. In 1784, over a period of four months, the building was demolished and the stones were taken to Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the new castle was not universally accepted as beneficial; Fullarton records that "The hoary grandeur of the old fortalice lay deeply buried amid the dense groves of immemorial growth which closely invested and obscured it; no innovating projects of improvement, nor change of any kind, had ever been permitted to disturb the sanctity of its seclusion, or to ruffle the feelings even of the most fastiduous worshipper of things as they are, or, more properly perhaps, chance to be".&lt;ref&gt;Fullarton, Page 85&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is said to have had a moat.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Covenating times====
In the 1640s [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] had been sent by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Neil Montgomery of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] negotiated a 4,000 merks penalty for the Eglinton Estates; three tenants having already been killed, with some deer and sheep also taken from the park.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior. Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society. {{ISBN|0-85411-059-3}}. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ley tunnels====
Persistent rumours exist of a [[Ley tunnel]] which is said to run from Kilwinning Abbey, under the 'Bean Yaird', below the 'Easter Chaumers' and the 'Leddy firs', and then underneath the Garnock and on to Eglinton Castle. No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries which does exist under the old abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A ley or an escape tunnel is also said to run from the castle to exit at the old waterfall near the rockery. It is reported that a tunnel ran from the castle to near the existing Castle Bridge. This tunnel was stone lined and tall enough for a man to walk through. This is likely to have been the main drain from the castle.

===The Pleasure gardens===

[[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1636 describes the landscape on his journey south from Glasgow as "a barren and poor country", but the earls had clearly enhanced Eglinton for he comments that the land at Irvine was "dainty, pleasant, level, champaign country."&lt;ref&gt;Brereton&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglinton Temple, Kilwinning, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Temple which the Countess of Eglinton had proposed for the Belvidere Hill.]]

The grounds of the castle were described in one record of the 1840s as follows:

''Its princely gates soon presented themselves and we thought we should easily find our way to Irvine through the park. It was a rich treat to wander in these extensive grounds. We soon made way through a handsome avenue to the gardens. The hot-houses for fruits and flowers are on a magnificent scale, and on reaching the parterre we were delighted with the elegance which pervaded it. A glassy river with a silvery cascade came gliding gently through these fairy regions, as though conscious of the luxuriant paradise which it was watering. Nor was the classic taste wanting, nor horticultural skill, to render this a region of enchantment. Two elegant cast-iron bridges, vases, statues, a sun-dial; these pretty combinations from the world of art could not fail to please the beholder. Leaving these luxurious regions we again wandered among thick woods, and occasionally obtained glimpses of the proud castle, peering over the trees. At length we found our way to a seat beneath some noble weepers of the ash tribe, and here we had a fine view of the castle, towering majestically over the dense foliage.''
[[File:Map of Dunduff castle &amp; roads.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Ayrshire by William Aiton, 1811]]
''Among our wanderings we passed an enormous quadrangular building, resembling some of our London hospitals. It forms the stables, and it is quite detached, at some distance from the Castle. We mistook our way, owing to the many devious paths, and wandered deeper and deeper into the recesses of this extensive domain. In passing through one long avenue, which was so dark that we were unable to see our steps; myriads of rooks took flight at our approach, and the air was quite blackened with them. At one time, we found ourselves walking alongside of the preserves, at another we were wandering in the deer park, and startling the early slumbers of these pretty creatures. At length we reached a gate, which we fully expected would lead into the high road to Irvine: but, to our great consternation, we found it was the point from which several roads diverged, each, apparently, leading into a thick forest, and it was evident that we had much space yet to traverse ere we could be clear of the extensive grounds of Eglintoun.''&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pages 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service quotes a verse pertaining to the Eglinton Woods:

The Guid Wee Green Folk

Doon by the Lugton,&lt;br&gt;
In Eglinton Woods,&lt;br&gt;
In blue-bell and foxglove,&lt;br&gt;
In the faulded up buds,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they bide,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they troke,&lt;br&gt;
It's there whaur they hide -&lt;br&gt;
The guid wee green folk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Service, Page 181&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

A mention in Badderley's 'Through Guide' circa 1890 indicates that the Eglinton Castle grounds were open to the public on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter (1989), Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable trees====
The 'Fauna, Flora and Geology of the Clyde Area'&lt;ref&gt;Scott Elliot, G. F., Laurie, M. and Murdoch, J. B. (1901). Glasgow: British Association. pages 131–147.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the notable Clyde Area trees at Eglinton in 1901, showing that the estate at the time had one of the foremost collection of significant trees in southern Scotland. Tree removal for sale as timber was one of the first acts of the new owners of the estate when it was sold in the late 1940s, however many had already been removed in 1925 by Neill of Prestwick and Howie of Dunlop, both being timber merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant trees were:- Holly (6' 10'' girth); Sycamore (13' 2'' girth – Deer Park); Field Maple (6' 5'' girth); Horse Chestnut (11' 4'' girth); Gean (girth 11' girth – Bullock Park); Hawthorn (8' 3'' girth); Fraxinus heterophylla (4' 6'' girth – Lady Jane's Cottage); Elm (12' 7' girth – castle); Hornbeam (14' girth – between Castle &amp; Mains); Holly Oak (5' 2'' girth – gardens); Sweet Chestnut (16' girth – Bullock Park); Beech (18' 3'' girth – Old Wood); Cut-leaved Beech (8' 11'' girth); Larch (8' 9'' girth); Cedar of Lebanon (9' 11'' girth – Bullock Park); Scots Pine (11' girth – between Castle and Mains).

===The Eglinton Tournament===
Eglinton is best remembered for the lavish, if ill-fated [[Eglinton Tournament]], a [[medieval]]-style [[tournament]] organised in 1839 by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl]]. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style torrential rain washed the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as [[jousting]]. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoléon III of France|Napoléon III of the French]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ker, Page 318&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eglintoune castle west view.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Eglintoune castle from the west, prior to the rebuild of 1805.]]

===The demise of the castle===
[[Image:Robertsonscunn2.jpg|thumb|200px|Robertson's map of the 1820s showing a lochan at Eglinton Castle.]]
The immense cost of upkeep, the poor condition of the castle and death duties took their toll on the family finances; the castle was abandoned in 1925. De-roofed in 1926, the lead being removed and sold,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt; after a house contents sale in December 1925, and progressively ruinous, the building finally came to an undignified end during the [[Second World War]] when it was seriously damaged during [[British Army|army]] training held there. The army also partly destroyed the iron bridge running to the old walled gardens.
[[File:Earls of Eglinton and Winton, the Setons.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Stone commemorating the Setons becoming Earls of Eglinton]]
The 1925 house sale by Dowell's Limited, included 1,960 items auctioned, raising £7,004 19s 6d. The auction catalogue provides an interesting insight into the feelings of the family at this sad time, with much of the Montgomerie history sold off, such as the 13th Earl's suit of armour from the tournament, the panel from the door of the murdered 10th Earl's coach and many paintings of the family and the castle, including a portrait of that great beauty, Susanna Kennedy, Countess of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"/&gt; The family moved to [[Skelmorlie Castle]] near [[Largs]] in 1925.

Architects drawings from March 1930 survive for plans to adapt the stable buildings as a residence for the Earl of Eglinton and Winton.&lt;ref name="Eglinton Archive"&gt;Eglinton Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial remains of the castle survived WW2, however the buildings were rationalised in 1973 and only one main tower was kept, together with some outer wall, foundations and parts of the castle wings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Page 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Eglinton Castle is said by one of the gardeners to have had a room which was never opened. In about 1925 a young man from Kilwinning decided to take some of the panelling from a room in the castle as it was all being allowed to rot in the rain anyway, the roof had been removed. He went the castle to take away as much as he could carry, however one of the last pieces he selected left exposed the skeletal hand of a woman. The whole skeleton was later removed by a student doctor, but for fear of prosecution the matter was never reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomeries of Eglinton, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eglinton family micro-history==
[[File:Sophia, Countess of Eglinton, Memorial.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Memorial to Lady Sophia Montgomerie, wife of the 14th Earl]]

In 1583 Lady Anne Montgomerie brought her husband, Lord Semple, a dowry of 6000 [[merks]], a considerable sum.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Frances Montgomerie was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in Edinburgh on 11 May 1797. She was the daughter of Archibald, 12th Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="DanielA"&gt;Daniel, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the coronation of [[Charles I of Great Britain|Charles I]] at Holyrood, the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of bearing the king's spurs.&lt;ref name="DanielB"&gt;Daniel, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glasgow University]]'s Eglinton Arts Fellowship was established in 1862 by subscription to commemorate the public services of Archibald William, 13th Earl of Eglinton, Rector of the University 1852–54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf Glasgow University Art's Fellowship.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011075845/http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the christening of King James IV the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of carrying the salt.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potato was first heard of in Scotland in 1701; it was not popular at first. In 1733 it is however recorded as being eaten at supper by the Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huchoun]] ("little Hugh") or Huchown is a poet conjectured to have been writing sometime in the 14th century. Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858–1923), have identified him with Hugh of Eglington, and advanced his authorship of several other significant pieces of verse.

[[Viva Seton Montgomerie]] records that a gipsy put a curse on the Montgomerie family that for three generations the property would not go from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the family crest is unclear, however a link may exist with the popular biblical story of an [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general of Nebuchadnezzar. The general laid siege to Bethulia, and the city almost surrendered. It was saved by Judith, a beautiful Hebrew widow who entered Holofernes's camp, seduced, and then beheaded Holofernes while he was drunk. She returned to Bethulia with Holofernes head, and the Hebrews subsequently defeated the enemy. Judith is considered as a symbol of liberty, virtue, and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause.

===Eglinton Country Park===

{{main|Eglinton Country Park}}

In the 1970s plans were made to open the extensive grounds (988 acres) around the ruins to the public, and to that end what remained of the structure was made safe by demolishing all but a wing facade and a single tower. Eglinton Country Park is now fully established with free entry and is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Ayrshire.

Eglinton Estate was in disrepair until Robert Clement Wilson purchased the grounds and built a meat canning factory in what was the old stable block. He also restored the grounds to their former splendour at his own expense. The canning factory, which supplied all the major multiples{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, closed following the BSE crises in 1996.

In 1963 [[Ian Anstruther]] wrote an entertaining account of the 1839 tournament entitled ''The Knight and the Umbrella''.

===Estate features===

====Lady Susanna's Cottage====
[[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna Montgomerie]], wife of the 9th Earl of Eglinton, was a renowned society beauty and her husband built for her at Kidsneuk a copy of the [[Hameau de la Reine]] 'cottage orné' that [[Marie Antoinette]] had famously possessed at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]]. This building, now a golf clubhouse, was thatched until the 1920s and is built of whin with steeply pitched roof sections and many gables.&lt;ref&gt;Close (2012), Page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dower houses====
The tradition was that a dowager countess would move out of the Earl's ancestral seat and move to a lesser dwelling. The [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna]], wife of the 9th Earl, moved to Kilmaurs House and then to Auchans Castle for instance. Over the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"&gt;Fullarton, Page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilmaurs Place|Kilmaurs House]], [[Auchans Castle, Ayrshire|Auchans Castle]] and Redburn House were some of the dower houses used.

====The Rackets Hall====
[[File:Rackets Hall, Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Rackets Hall built by the 13th Earl.]]
Eglinton has a 'Racket Hall' which was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The court floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racquet court, built before the court size was standardised and is now the oldest surviving court in the World, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;Eglinton Country Park archive&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 the earl employed a rackets professional, John Mitchell and Patrick Devitt replaced him. Mitchell owned a pub in Bristol with its own rackets court and this was named the "Eglinton Arms", having been the "Sea Horse" previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ashford, P. K. (1994). Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt;

====Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet====
A croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between the castle and the Lugton Water, also the old site of the marquee for the tournament banquet. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the hoops 'to ring the changes' and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist. It is not known why the earl named it thus.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park - falconer&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

====Lady Ha'====
The Montgomerie family are said to have had a pre-reformation chapel in the Weirston - Lady Ha' area dedicated to Saint Issyn. A 'Ladiehall' dwelling still existed in 1691, occupied by John and James Weir. Two other 'Weir' families also lived on the estate.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

==Estate microhistory==

===Lady Egidia===
The "Egidia" was one of the largest, if not the largest wooden vessels ever built in Scotland. She measured 219 feet long, extreme breadth 37 feet, depth 22 feet, registered tonnage 1,235, builders measurements 1,461 tons. Lady Egidia was the daughter of the Earl of Eglinton. The Earl launched her at Ardrossan in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html The Ships List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930053937/http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html |date=2011-09-30 }} Retrieved: 2011-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pavilion===
In the early 1900s, the Earl of Eglinton and Winton had a summer residence called the Pavilion at 1 South Crescent Road, Ardrossan. It was built at the beginning of the previous century. In the 1920s the Pavilion, two lodges, stables and walled garden in 3.4 acres of ground were sold to the Roman Catholic Church on 30 January 1924 for £4500. The pavilion was demolished and the present day church and manse built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpeterinchains.net/ St Peter in Chains] Retrieved: 2010-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===White or Chillingham Cattle===
In 1759 the Earl of Eglinton formed a herd of the ancient breed of White or [[Chillingham Cattle]] at [[Ardrossan]], probably using stock from the [[Cadzow Castle|Cadzow herd]]. The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in this herd were hornless.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garden or Easter Chambers===
After the destruction of the main buildings at [[Kilwinning Abbey]] the Garden or Easter Chambers within the boundary walls of the old abbey, previously the dwelling of the abbot were used by the new owners, the Earls of Eglinton, as a dower house and family dwelling. Lady Mary Montgomerie lived here after the death of her husband in the 17th century and her son may have remained here until he succeeded to the Earldom. The building, which stood to the south of the abbey, was eventually demolished in 1784 and the stones used in building projects at the castle, particularly the stable offices.&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"/&gt; The 1691 Hearth Tax records show that this substantial building had 15 hearths.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

===Daft Will Speirs===
A well known Ayrshire eccentric, Will had been a high spirited youth, punished by being hung over the edge of a bridge over the River Garnock whilst it was in flood, resulting in a form of nervous breakdown which left him as a likeable character, accepted by most and a regular visitor to many a laird or earl's estates. Will died at Corsehillmuir whilst going from Bannoch to Moncur, falling into an old mine shaft whilst trying to rescue a collie dog.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Pages 42 - 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Buffalo Park===
An area below the old Mains Farm was known as the 'Buffalo Park' and this may relate to the 11th Earl having been involved in the British army's subdugation of the [[Cherokee]] Indians in North America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Irish Giant===
John Service relates an Ayrshire legend that an Irish Giant came to mock the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith who lived near [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]] and the laird chased him across to Eglinton where the giant went to crush him with a great beech tree. The laird pierced him through the arm bones with his sword and the giants hand remained attached to the tree for centuries. It could be seen from a distance of about a mile - from Kilwinning, between Dykehead and the Redburn.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vagrants and the unemployed===
In 1662 the Earl was given the rights to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to [[Montgomerieston]] at the Citadel of Ayr where the Earl had a wool factory. The parishes had to support them whilst there and the Earl only had to provide food and clothing. The rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauchland, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Covenant===
A painting by W. Hole RSA of the 1638 ''Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Churchyard'' features the Earl of Eglinton in the crowd, just prior to his putting his signature to the document.

===Lady Jane's Cottage===
A similar style of cottage existed at Kidsneuk and on the [[Crosbie Castle and the Fullarton estate|Fullarton estate]] in [[Troon]] as a lodge house near the Crosbie Kirk ruins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-115-409-C Heather House, Troon. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; Lilliput Lane has produced a model of Lady Jane's cottage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrsaville.co.uk/ll_Scotland_NV.htm Lilliput Lane - Scottish models. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; An ash of the species Fraxinus heterophylla of 4' 6'' girth – once grew at Lady Jane's Cottage.

===Cigarette Cards===
The castle and bridge were featured in the series on castles, abbeys and houses by Salmon &amp; Gluckstein Ltd.

===Annick School===
The Earl of Eglinton built a large schoolroom and a house for the teacher at Annick near [[Lands of Doura|Doura]]; he also provided a garden and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The building ceased to be a school and was used as a cafe for a few years before being adapted to become private accommodation.

===Hare Coursing===
The Ardrossan Hare Coursing Club used to pursue hares on Ardrossan Hill in the 1840s and would then return to Eglinton Castle for refreshments provided by the 13th Earl. This bloodsport finally became illegal in Scotland in 2002. A famous greyhound owned by Lord Eglinton was named 'Heather Jock' after a colourful local character of that name.

===Religion===
In the 1622 persecution the minister of Irvine, Mr David Duckson, was banished, however the earl had him returned to his charge. [[Anne Livingstone|Anne, Countess of Eglinton]], daughter of [[Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow]], was very religious, and Eglinton was a safe haven for persecuted ministers. She took an interest in the [[Stewarton|Stewarton Revival]] and invited some of the adherents to meet the earl and the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century the Montgomerie's of Eglinton were supporters of the Scottish Episcopalian church and the Rev W. S. Wilson travelled to the castle on Sunday afternoons to conduct services. The earl granted a piece of land in Ardrossan with a nominal feu duty to the church and his countess laid the church foundation stone on 30 November 1874; it opened in 1875 and consecrated in 1882 by Bishop Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farms===
Aiton in 1811 records that nearly all the farms on the extensive estates of the 10th Earl of Eglinton were ''elegant, commodious, and substantial.''&lt;ref&gt;Aiton, Page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montgomerystown===
Ayr citadel, later called the Fort, was constructed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 with stones taken from the Earl's castle at Ardrossan. It occupied an area of about 12 acres, on a hexagonal ground plan, with bastions at the angles, and enclosed the church of St John the Baptist, converted by Cromwell into an armoury and guard-room. After Cromwell's time it was dismantled and the ground it occupied, together with its buildings, presented to the Earl of Eglinton as compensation for losses sustained during the Great Rebellion. Renamed [[Montgomerieston|Montgomerystown]], it was created a burgh of regality, and became the seat of a considerable trade, including a family owned brewery. In 1726 it was purchased by four merchants from the town, and circa 1870, most of it covered with high quality housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory478.html Gazetteer for Scotland] Retrieved: 2011-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early automobile accident===
In 1911, a motor van belonging to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out and two of them were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the injured parties taken to Beith in his car. The injured parties were treated for head and body injuries after which they were driven to Lugton and entrained for Kilmarnock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ Early automobile accident] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705134715/http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ |date=2010-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rozelle===
Archibald Hamilton, a younger son of John Hamilton of Sundrum, married Lady Jane Montgomerie of Coilsfield (his cousin), daughter of the 12th Earl of Eglinton and doting aunt to the 13th Earl of Eglinton. The 13th earl gave the couple a life-rent interest in the mansion house of Rozelle. The estate of Rozelle (formerly Rosel) had been part of the lands of the Barony of Alloway. The future estate was purchased by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, his uncle, a former Jamaica merchant who named it after a Jamaican property and also built the mansion house (1760). Archibald Hamilton rebuilt the house in the 1830s to designs by the architect David Bryce and in 1837 he purchased the Rozelle estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; SCRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224917/http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; |date=2011-10-03 }} Retrieved: 2011-08-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cerrito''' is an archaeological zone  in [[Queretaro State]].&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=El Cerrito, página oficial |trans-title=Official Web Page – El Cerrito |journal=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/cerrito/cerrito.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910144807/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/cerrito/cerrito.html |archivedate=2010-09-10 |df= }}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a place of worship, was venerated by local cultures (Chupícuaro) as well as Teotihuacan’s, Toltec, Chichimeca, [[Otomi people|Otomi]] and [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], as late as 1632.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;&lt;ref name= "  Turi" &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Querétaro, Sitios Arqueológicos |url=http://www.turimexico.com/queretaro/queretaroarqueologia.php  |publisher=   Turimexico |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Queretaro, Archaeological Sites  |year= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "  Santuario" &gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= El Santuario Prehispánico del Cerrito |trans-title=The Prehispanic sanctuary of El Cerrito  |journal=  El Oficio de Historiar |location=  |url=http://eloficiodehistoriar.com.mx/2008/06/02/cinco-anos-de-investigacion-arqueologica-en-el-pueblito/ |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Querétaro human settlements are related to the Chupícuaro culture, which originated in the margins of the Lerma River, in the current Acámbaro, Guanajuato. This presence is more noticeable and early in San Juan del Río and Querétaro. Chupícuaro culture had a simple low platform architecture, very elaborated funeral rites, and very elaborated pottery decoration. Material evidence of this culture has been registered on sites located in the skirts of the Cimatario Hill on the banks of the Pueblito River.&lt;ref name="  Promo"&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=Santuario prehispánico del Valle de Querétaro |url=http://www.promoturqueretaro.com.mx/detalles-de-noticias.php?id=97 |publisher=Promoción Turística de Querétaro |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Prehispanic sanctuary of the Valley of Querétaro |year= |accessdate=Nov 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020120435/http://www.promoturqueretaro.com.mx/detalles-de-noticias.php?id=97 |archivedate=2010-10-20 |df= }}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magdalena to the west and La Griega, to the east are further evidence of this culture in the Valley of Querétaro. The earliest settlements in Querétaro were related and contemporary to the Chupícuaro culture in the mesoamerican preclassical period.  From the social, political and territorial structure of Chupícuaro, inhabitants of the Querétaro region developed their own cultural expressions within the context of the Mesoamerican civilization.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

* A map is prepared, some sampling, and exploration wells, determining extent of the archaeological site. Archaeologist Ana Ma. Crespo (1984)&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;
*Land recucperation and some excavations at the ceremonial center. (1995)&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;
* The site El Cerrito is declared archaeological monument. (November 9, 2000)&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

==History==
Since 300 BCE, The Chupicuaro culture settled in the region, followed by the Teotihuacan and Toltec, and then the chichimeca and Otomi, immediately prior to Spaniards arrival at the valley of Queretaro.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

Towards 400 CE, the Altépetl, the ceremonial center and its pre-Hispanic urban zone, becomes the polítical and religious capital of several peripheric settlements.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

El Cerrito had a long history as a regional political and religious center, and was contemporary of [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]]. As a regional capital, it had a series of urban religious and residential complexes in Cerro Gordo, Balvanera, La Magdalena, Santa Barbara, La Negreta and the banks of the River El Pueblito.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

El Cerrito functioned as a regional political and religious center of regional importance from 400 to 1500 CE. Its apogee occurred in the postclassical period, from 450 to 850 CE, during the Toltec culture influence of the center.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

Over time, El Cerrito became a sacred space or sanctuary. The buildings and altars around the pyramid are expressions of religious activities around the worship of a female deity, probably the old mother or mother of the gods.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

During the Spaniards arrival, it was populated by [[Chichimeca]]s, a sedentary and semi-nomadic culture, with the addition of Otomi and Purépecha.

===Apogee===
The most intense occupation period is associated with the Toltec culture in the early postclassical (900-1200 CE). El Cerrito is one of the most important sites of the Toltec world, a Tollan or site where the power of the great lords and warriors region was legitimized. It is possible that through these rituals it maintained the Toltec cosmogony.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

During that period, it went from being a local ceremonial center to a regional shrine. Ceramic pieces found (vases, figurines and malacates) provide evidence of trade networks with remote regions, as far as [[Tajumulco (municipio)|Tajumulco]] in [[Guatemala]], the [[Huasteca]] Mexico and Los Altos de Jalisco to the north.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

===Fall===
Around 1,200 CE, the Toltec groups left the Valley with the consequential decline of ceremonial center functions. During the late postclassical various ethnic groups continued to live in the Valley, and used partially site for their ceremonies, essentially the pyramid. El Cerrito would not regain the splendor reached with the Toltec, but its recognition as a sacred space open to prehispanic deities continued well into the 17TH century.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

According to Franciscan records (1632), [[Chichimeca people|Chichimeca]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]] and [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] natives continued to make offerings at the altar. The religious order, placed an image of Mary at the site, to transform the prehispanic cult held onsite for over 1000 years.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

==The site ==
El Cerrito archaeological site, also known as "El Pueblito pyramid", is a magnificent example of the influence that the Toltec culture reached in the area.&lt;ref name=Turi  /&gt;

El Cerrito Toltec monumental architecture integrated two architectural types of constructions, the sunken patios and palaces or rooms with columns.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

===Constructive stages ===
Per recent excavations, the pyramid has three different constructive stages:
*First Stage. At the ceremonial center and pyramid, engraved stones were found, forming a vertical wall, with an 80 metros per side basement, it is dated in the epiclassical.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;
*Second Stage. It is part of the ceremonial center, with limestone walls forming panels and slopes, probably with bas-relief sculptures and battlements, during the early postclassical.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;
*Third Stage. It has large sloped walls made with basalt stone, covered with stucco, altar type structures, embedded in walls, during the late postclassical and the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

==Structures==
Used stone plates for construction, with decoration engravings in walls, altars and sidewalks. The motifs include representations of historical and mythical characters, war markers, calendar glyphs, symbols, and numerous attributes terrestrial, aquatic and astral of the Quetzalcoatl deity. The material used includes bas-relief engraved slabs, for finishing they were painted with mineral pigments of colors blue, red, yellow, white and black.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

===Large pyramid===
It is a large elongated platform, partially destroyed and cut in the middle by the access road. As part of the main structure, [[Chac Mool]] sculptures, atlantes or columns walls were found. The Platform is 130 meters long, 30 meters wide, the height is not known, from its deterioration.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

Was built on a leveled platform 118 m per side. On this platform the pyramid was built, it is 30 meters high. It consists of thirteen small bodies slope-staggered, for construction basalt stone and red sandstone were used, the structure was stuccoed and painted in red and ochre colors. Each of its facades had large stairways delimited by “alfardas” (intermediate side walls).&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

===Palace===
Between the Sculpture Plaza and La Danza, as palace was built, where small altars were found, with abundant offerings associated; clay braziers almost a meter in height. This Palace, in addition to  dividing the site, provided privacy in the squares, necessary for ritual functions. The façade towards each of the squares was formed by a portico, this is a roofed area supported by wooden columns decorated with stone and stucco painted in red and blue crowning.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

=== Cuadrangular Plaza===
It is enclosed by a stone wall that reaches up to six meters in height, the South side is 290 meters long and the west side is 225 meters long.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

===Plaza La Danza===
Located northeast of the platform is built by a system of stone boxes, the west facade of the square is sloped and is covered with stuccoed basalt stones and red paint.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

===Sculptures Plaza ===
It is of the sunken patio type.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt; Is located at the southeast corner of the pyramid basement, the best preserved, it is 72 metres long by 60 wide, altars were built at the ends eastern and western ends, with a sloped wall. At this place two offerings were found, consisting of skulls and smokers, it is referred to as the skulls altar or [[Tzompantli]].&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

==Sculptures==
All El Cerrito and ceremonial center structures, contained sculptures fragments, indicating their importance and of the sculpted architectural elements, part of the construction and decoration of the site.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

The sculptures have traces of having been painted in colors red, yellow and blue, sometimes covered with stucco.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

The facades and cornices of the building and the walls of the structures were decorated.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

Battlements have been found in the form of snails and crossed arrows with floral motifs and chalchihuites drums, all forming friezes and frames.&lt;ref name=Santuario /&gt;

==Ceramic==
Ceramic found include shapes and decoration of pots, boxes and jugs. Most articles are for ceremonial rituals, as smokers, braziers, ollas, Tlaloc, pipes vases, Mazapa figurines and clay malacates.&lt;ref name=Promo /&gt;

'''El Fin del Mundo''' (Spanish: 'End of the World') is an ancient [[Pleistocene]] site in northwestern [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. It features [[Clovis culture]] period occupation dating around 13,390 calibrated years BP. It was discovered during a 2007 survey.

This is the oldest Clovis site in North America. There's also the Aubrey site in [[Denton County, Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferring, C. Reid (2001) ''The Archaeology and Paleoecology of the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479) Denton County, Texas''. (Center for Environmental Archaeology, Dept. of Geography, Univ. of North Texas, Denton&lt;/ref&gt; which produced a radiocarbon date that is almost identical.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, Guadalupe, Vance T.

==Clovis hunters==
In 2011, remains of [[Gomphothere]] dating around 13,390 calibrated years BP were found here. This was the first time such an association was found in a northern part of the continent where gomphotheres had been thought to have gone extinct 30,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inah.gob.mx/component/content/article/59-findings/4836-finding-would-reveal-contact-between-humans-and-gomphotheres-in-north-america "Finding would reveal contact between humans and gomphotheres in North America"], [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]], 24 January 2011. Retrieved 26 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, it was announced that the "position and proximity of Clovis weapon fragments relative to the gomphothere bones at the site suggest that humans did in fact kill the two animals there.

Of the seven Clovis points found at the site, four were in place among the bones, including one with bone and teeth fragments above and below. The other three points had clearly eroded away from the bone bed and were found scattered nearby." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140714152431.htm "Bones of elephant ancestor unearthed: Meet the gomphothere"] [[Science Daily]], 14 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Bones of horse and bison, as well as horse teeth were also found at the site.

'''Empik''' (stylised as '''empík''') is a [[Poland|Polish]] commercial chain selling [[book]]s, international [[Print media|press]] and media products (including film, music, and software). The chain also owns a photo company, Empik Foto, as well as a foreign language school, Empik School.

==History ==
EMPiK chain began during Poland's communist period as KMPiK ({{lang-pl|Klub Międzynarodowej Prasy i Książki}}, the International Press and Book Club) owned by the [[Prasa-Książka-Ruch]] monopoly which financed the [[PZPR]] Party from its revenue. In 1991 it was acquired by businessmen Jacek Dębski, Janusz Romanowski (a former reserve police officer) and [[Yaron Bruckner]], and given its current name. While initially it was partially owned by the Polish state,  in 1994 it was sold completely by the [[State Treasury]] to Bruckner's [[Eastbridge N.V.]]. In May 2009 EMPiK had 134 stores in Poland and 23 stores in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;From Polish Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound change}}
In [[phonology]], '''epenthesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|θ|ᵻ|s|ᵻ|s}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|ἐπένθεσις}}) means the addition of one or more sounds to a word, especially to the interior of a word (at the beginning ''[[prothesis (linguistics)|prothesis]]'' and at the end ''[[paragoge]]'' are commonly used). The word ''epenthesis'' comes from {{wikt-lang|en|epi-}} "in addition to" and ''en'' "in" and ''thesis'' "putting". Epenthesis may be divided into two types: '''excrescence''', for the addition of a [[consonant]], and '''anaptyxis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|p|ˈ|t|ɪ|k|s|ᵻ|s}}) for the addition of a [[vowel]]. The opposite process where one or more sounds are removed is referred to as [[elision]].

==Uses==
Epenthesis arises for a variety of reasons. The [[phonotactics]] of a given language may discourage vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] or [[consonant cluster]]s, and a consonant or vowel may be added to make pronunciation easier. Epenthesis may be represented in writing or be a feature only of the spoken language.

===Separating vowels===
A consonant may be added to separate vowels in hiatus. This is the case with [[linking and intrusive R]].
*''drawing'' →  ''draw'''r'''ing''

===Bridging consonant clusters===
A consonant may be placed between consonants in a consonant cluster where the [[place of articulation]] is different (e.g.,  where one consonant is [[labial consonant|labial]] and the other is [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]). 
* ''something'' → ''some'''p'''thing''
* ''*a-mrotos'' → ''am'''b'''rotos'' (see [[#amrotos|below]])

===Breaking consonant clusters===
A vowel may be placed between consonants to separate them.
*''[[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]]''  →  ''Hamtram'''i'''ck''

Regular examples in English are {{wikt-lang|en|-i-}}, used in forming Latinate words such as {{wikt-lang|en|equ'''i'''distant}}, and {{wikt-lang|en|-o-}}, used in forming words on Greek roots or general compounds, as in {{wikt-lang|en|speed'''o'''meter}}.

===Other contexts===
While epenthesis most often occurs between two vowels or two consonants, it can also occur between a vowel and a consonant, or at the ends of words. For example, the Japanese prefix {{Nihongo||真〜（ま〜）|ma-|pure …, complete …}} transforms regularly to {{Nihongo||真っ〜（まっ〜）|ma'-|(gemination of following consonant)}} when followed by a consonant, as in {{Nihongo||真っ白（まっしろ）|masshiro|pure white}}. The English suffix {{wikt-lang|en|-t}}, often found in the form {{wikt-lang|en|-st}}, as in {{wikt-lang|en|amongst}} (from {{wikt-lang|en|among}} + {{wikt-lang|en|-st}}), is an example of terminal excrescence.

==Excrescence==
{{See also|Sandhi|Linking and intrusive R|Liaison (French)}}'''Excrescence''', also known as '''vyanjanabhakti''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˌvjɑːndʒənəˈbɑːkti/]]; from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: व्यञ्जनभक्ति /ʋjənd͡ʑənəbʱəkt̪i/) is the epenthesis of a consonant.

===Synchronic rule===
In [[French language|French]], {{IPA|/t/}} is inserted in inverted interrogative phrases between a verb ending in a vowel and a pronoun beginning with a vowel: {{lang|fr|il a}} ('he has') &gt; {{lang|fr|a-t-il}} ('has he?'). There is no epenthesis from a historical perspective since the {{lang|fr|a-t}} is derived from Latin {{lang|la|habet}} ('he has'), and so the {{lang|fr|t}} is the original third-person verb inflection. However it is correct to call it epenthesis when viewed [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronically]] since the modern basic form of the verb is {{lang|fr|a}} and so the [[psycholinguistic]] process is therefore the addition of {{lang|fr|t}} to the base form.

A similar example is the [[English language|English]] [[indefinite article]] ''a'', which becomes ''an'' before a vowel. It originated from [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|ān}} ("one, a, an"), which retained an ''n'' in all positions, so a [[diachrony|diachronic]] analysis would see the original ''n'' disappearing except if a following vowel required its retention: ''an'' &gt; ''a''. However, a synchronic analysis, in keeping with the perception of most native speakers, would (equally correctly) see it as epenthesis: ''a'' &gt; ''an''.

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], whenever the suffix {{wikt-lang|nl|-er}} (which has several meanings) is attached to a word already ending in ''-r'', an additional {{lang|nl|-d-}} is inserted in between. For example, the comparative form of the adjective {{wikt-lang|nl|zoet}} ("sweet") is {{wikt-lang|nl|zoeter}}, but the comparative of {{wikt-lang|nl|zuur}} ("sour") is {{wikt-lang|nl|zuur'''d'''er}} and not the expected *{{lang|nl|zurer}}. Similarly, the agent noun of {{wikt-lang|nl|verkopen}} ("to sell") is {{wikt-lang|nl|verkoper}} ("salesperson"), but the agent noun of {{wikt-lang|nl|uitvoeren}} ("to perform") is {{wikt-lang|nl|uitvoer'''d'''er}} ("performer").

===Variable rule===
{{further|Prince–prints merger}}
In English, a [[stop consonant]] is often added as a transitional sound between the parts of a nasal + fricative sequence:
*English ''hamster'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|s|t|ər}} often pronounced with an added ''p'' sound, [[General American|GA]]: {{IPA|[ˈhɛəmpstɚ]}} or [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]: {{IPA|[ˈhampstə]}}
*English ''warmth'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɔr|m|θ}} often pronounced with an added ''p'' sound, GA: {{IPA|[ˈwɔɹmpθ]}} or RP: {{IPA|[ˈwoːmpθ]}}
*English ''fence'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|n|s}} often pronounced {{IPA|[ˈfɛnts]}}
*{{citation needed span|English ''else'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|s}} by some speakers pronounced {{IPA|[ˈɛɫts]}}|date=July 2018}}

===Poetic device===
*Latin {{lang|la|reliquiās}} "remnants, survivors" (accusative plural) &gt; poetic {{lang|la|relliquiās}}
The three short syllables in {{lang|la|reliquiās}} do not fit into [[dactylic hexameter]] because of the [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]'s limit of two short syllables so the first syllable is lengthened by adding another ''l''. However, the pronunciation was often not written with double ''ll'', and may have been the normal way of pronouncing a word starting in ''rel-'' rather than a poetic modification.

===In Japanese===
A limited number of words in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] use epenthetic consonants to separate vowels. An example is the word {{Nihongo||[[wikt:春雨|春雨]]（はるさめ）|harusame|spring rain}}, a compound of ''haru'' and ''ame'' in which an {{IPA|/s/}} is added to separate the final {{IPA|/u/}} of ''haru'' and the initial {{IPA|/a/}} of ''ame''. That is a ''synchronic'' analysis. As for a diachronic (historical) analysis, since epenthetic consonants are not used regularly in modern Japanese, the epenthetic {{IPA|/s/}} could be from [[Old Japanese]]. It is also possible that Old Japanese /ame&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ was once pronounced */same&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/; the {{IPA|/s/}} would then be not epenthetic but simply an archaic pronunciation. Another example is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:小雨|小雨]]（こさめ）|kosame|"light rain"}}.

A complex example of epenthesis is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:真っ青|真っ青]]（まっさお）|massao|deep blue, ghastly pale}}, from {{Nihongo||[[wikt:真|真]]〜（ま〜）|ma-|pure, complete}} + {{Nihongo||[[wikt:青|青]]（あお）|ao|blue}}. It exhibits epenthesis on both morphemes: {{Nihongo||真〜（ま〜）|ma-}} → {{Nihongo||真っ〜（まっ〜）|ma'-|(gemination of following consonant)}} is common (occurring before a consonant), and {{Nihongo||青（あお）|ao}} → {{Nihongo||青（さお）|sao}} occurs only in the example; it can be analyzed as ''maao'' → ''masao'' (intervocalic) → ''massao''; akin to {{Nihongo||[[wikt:霧雨|霧雨]]（きりさめ）|kirisame|drizzle, light rain}} from {{Nihongo||[[wikt:霧|霧]]（きり）|kiri|fog, mist}} + {{Nihongo||[[wikt:雨|雨]]（あめ）|ame|rain}}.

One [[hypothesis]] argues that Japanese {{IPA|/r/}} developed "as a default, epenthetic consonant in the intervocalic position".{{sfn|Labrune|2012|loc=3.13 /r/, pp. 92–95, citing unpublished "The phonology of Japanese /r/: a panchronic account" by same author, originally from Ph.D. thesis 1993 « Le statut phonologique de /r/ en japonais et en coréen : histoire, typologie, structure interne des segments », université Paris 7, "The phonological status of /r/ in Japanese and in Korean: history, typology, internal structure of segments", Paris 7 University}}

==Anaptyxis==
Epenthesis of a vowel is known as '''anaptyxis''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνάπτυξις}}, "unfolding" in Greek, anaptyctic), or by the Sanskrit term '''svarabhakti''' (/ˌsvɑːrəˈbɑːkti/; from Sanskrit: स्वरभक्ति /sʋəɾəbʱəkt̪i/). Some accounts distinguish between "intrusive vowels", vowel-like releases of consonants as phonetic detail, and true epenthetic vowels, which are required by the phonotactics of the language and [[acoustics|acoustically]] identical with [[phoneme|phonemic]] vowels.

===Historical sound change===
====End of word====
Many languages insert a so-called ''prop vowel'' at the end of a word to avoid the loss of a non-permitted cluster. The cluster can come about by a change in the [[phonotactics]] of the language that no longer permits final clusters. Something similar happened in [[Sanskrit]], with the result that a new vowel ''-i'' or ''-a'' was added to many words.

Another possibility is a sound change deleting vowels at the end of a word, which is a very common sound change. That may well produce impermissible final clusters. In some cases, the problem was resolved by allowing a resonant to become syllabic or inserting a vowel in the middle of a cluster: [[Proto-Germanic]] {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*akraz}} "field, acre" &gt; [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{wikt-lang|got-Latn|akrs}} (syllabic {{IPA|/r/}}) but [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|æcer}} (insertion of vowel). In the [[Gallo-Romance languages]], however, a prop vowel was added: MONSTRU &gt; {{IPA|/monstr/}} &gt; {{IPA|/monstrə/}} ([[French language|French]] {{wikt-lang|fr|montre}} "watch" (clock)).

====Middle of word====
Examples are common in many [[Slavic languages]], which had a preference for vowel-final syllables in earlier times. An example of this is the [[Proto-Slavic]] form {{lang|sla-x-proto|*gordŭ}} ("town") in which the [[East Slavic languages]] inserted an epenthetic vowel to break the cluster ''-rd-'', resulting in {{lang|orv|городъ}} ({{transl|orv|gorodŭ}}), which became {{wikt-lang|ru|город}} ({{transl|ru|gorod}}) in modern Russian and Ukrainian. The other Slavic languages instead [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesised]] the vowel and the consonant: Polish {{lang|pl|gród}}, Czech {{lang|cs|hrad}}, Serbo-Croatian {{lang|sh|grad}}.

Other examples exist in Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] in which former word-initial consonant clusters, which were still extant in [[Middle Persian]], are regularly broken up: Middle Persian ''brādar'' &gt; Modern Persian {{transl|fa|barādar}} "brother" (''a'' is pronounced {{IPA|[æ]}}), Middle Persian ''stūn'' &gt; [[Early New Persian]] {{transl|fa|sutūn}} &gt; Modern [[Iranian Persian]] {{transl|fa|sotūn}} "column"; modern borrowings are also affected.

===Beginning of word===
In the [[Western Romance languages]], a prothetic vowel was inserted at the beginning of any word that began with {{IPA|/s/}} and another consonant: Latin {{lang|la|spatha}} "sword" &gt; Spanish/Portuguese {{lang|es|espada}}, Catalan {{lang|ca|espasa}}, Old French {{lang|fro|espede}} &gt; modern {{lang|fr|épée}} (see also {{wikt-lang|fr|espadon}}, the [[swordfish]]).

French has a three level use of initial epenthesis depending on the time of incorporation:
* developing {{IPA|/e/}} and dropping {{IPA|/s/}} for the earliest: {{lang|fr|être}} &lt; {{lang|la|stare}}; {{lang|fr|école}} &lt; {{lang|la|schola}}
* developing {{IPA|/e/}} and keeping {{IPA|/s/}}: {{lang|fr|espèce}} &lt; {{lang|la|species}}; {{lang|fr|espace}} &lt; {{lang|la|spatium}}
* not developing {{IPA|/e/}} for the latest: {{lang|fr|spécial}} &lt; {{lang|la|species}}; {{lang|fr|scolaire}} &lt; {{lang|la|schola}}; {{lang|fr|spatial}} &lt; {{lang|la|spatium}}

===Poetic device===
{{cn span|An example in an English song is "[[The Umbrella Man (song)|The Umbrella Man]]" whose [[meter (poetry)|meter]] requires "umbrella" to be pronounced with four syllables, ''um-buh-rel-là'' so "any umbrellas" has the meter ''ány úmberéllas''. The same occurs in the song "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]".|date=April 2018}}

===Grammatical rule===
Epenthesis often breaks up a [[consonant cluster]] or vowel sequence that is not permitted by the [[phonotactics]] of a language. Regular or semi-regular epenthesis commonly occurs in languages with [[affix]]es. For example, a [[reduced vowel]] {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/ə/}} (here abbreviated as {{IPA|/ᵻ/}}) is inserted before the English plural suffix {{IPA|-/z/}} and the past tense suffix {{IPA|-/d/}} when the root ends in a similar consonant: ''glass'' → ''glasses'' {{IPA|/ˈɡlæsᵻz/}} or {{IPA|/ˈɡlɑːsᵻz/}}; ''bat'' → ''batted'' {{IPA|/ˈbætᵻd/}}. That is again a synchronic analysis, as the form with the vowel is the original form and the vowel was later often lost.

===Borrowed words===
Vocalic epenthesis typically occurs when words are borrowed from a language that has consonant clusters or [[syllable coda]]s that are not permitted in the borrowing language.

Languages use various vowels, but schwa is quite common when it is available:
* [[Hebrew]] uses a single vowel, the [[schwa]] (pronounced {{IPA|/ɛ/}} in [[Israeli Hebrew]]).
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] generally uses {{IPA|/u/}} except after {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, when it uses {{IPA|/o/}}, and after {{IPA|/h/}}, when it uses an [[echo vowel]]. For example, the English word ''street'' becomes {{lang|ja|ストリート}} {{IPA|/sutoɾiːto/}} in Japanese; the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name {{lang|nl|Gogh}} becomes {{lang|ja|ゴッホ}} {{IPA|/ɡohho/}}, and the [[German language|German]] name {{lang|de|Bach}}, {{lang|ja|バッハ}} {{IPA|/bahha/}}.
* [[Korean language|Korean]] uses {{IPA|[ɯ]}} except after borrowed {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, which takes a following {{IPA|/i/}} at the end of the word or {{IPA|/ju/}} otherwise.  For example, English ''strike'' becomes {{lang|ko|스트라이크}} {{IPA|/sɯtʰɯɾaikɯ/}}, with three epenthetic vowels and a split of English diphthong {{IPAc-en|ai}} into two syllables.
* [[Brazilian Portuguese]] uses {{IPA|/i/}}, which, in most dialects, triggers [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of a preceding {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}: ''bullying'' &gt; {{IPA|[ˈbulĩ ~ bulẽj]}}; ''nerd'' &gt; {{IPA|/nɛʁdʒi/}}; ''stress'' &gt; {{IPA|/istɾɛsi/}} (which became ''[[:pt:Estresse|estresse]]''); ''McDonald's'' &gt; {{IPA|/makidonaudʒis/ ~ [mɛkiˈdõnəwdʑis]}} with normal [[l-vocalization|vocalization]] of {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/u/}}. Most speakers pronounce borrowings with [[spelling pronunciation]]s, and others try to approximate the nearest equivalents in Portuguese of the phonemes in the original language. Compare ''anime'' {{IPA|/a'nimi/}} with ''[[:pt:Animê|animê]]'' {{IPA|/ani'me/}} (but the word may also be pronounced {{IPA|/a'nimi/}} and written ''anime'').
* [[Classical Arabic]] does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word, and typically uses {{IPA|/i/}} to break up such clusters in borrowings: {{wikt-lang|ar|صِرَاط}} {{IPA|/siraːtˤ/}} "street" &lt; Latin {{wikt-lang|la|strāta}}.
*[[Persian language|Persian]] also does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word and typically uses {{IPA|/æ/}} to break up such clusters in borrowings except between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/t/}}, when  {{IPA|/o/}} is added.
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] does not allow clusters at the beginning of a word with an {{IPA|/s/}} in them and adds ''e-'' to such words: {{lang|es|especie}} &lt; {{lang|la|species}}, {{lang|es|estándar}} &lt; ''standard'', {{lang|es|estrés}} &lt; ''stress''.
* [[Turkish language|Turkish]] prefixes [[close vowel]]s to loanwords with [[initial (linguistics)|initial]] [[consonant cluster|cluster]]s of [[alveolar fricative]]s followed by another consonant: {{lang|tr|Isparta}} &lt; Greek {{wikt-lang|grc|Σπάρτη}} ({{transl|el|Sparti}}), {{lang|tr|setuskur}} &lt; ''set screw'', {{lang|tr|uskumru}} &lt; Greek {{wikt-lang|el|σκουμπρί}} ({{transl|el|skoúmbri}}), {{lang|tr|Üsküdar}} &lt; Byzantine Greek {{lang|grc|Σκουτάριον}} ({{transl|el|Skoutárion}}), {{lang|tr|istimbot}} &lt; ''steamboat'', {{lang|tr|İskoçya}} &lt; ''Scotland'', {{lang|tr|istavrit}} &lt; Greek {{lang|el|σταυροειδής}} ({{transl|el|stavridís}}),  {{lang|tr|İzmir}} &lt; Greek {{lang|el|Σμύρνη}} ({{transl|el|Smírni}}). The practice is no longer productive as of late 20th century and a few such words have changed back: {{lang|tr|spor}} &lt; {{lang|tr|ıspor}} &lt; French {{wikt-lang|fr|sport}}.

===Informal speech===
Epenthesis most often occurs within unfamiliar or complex consonant clusters. For example, the name ''Dwight'' is commonly pronounced with an epenthetic [[schwa]] between the {{IPA|/d/}} and the {{IPA|/w/}}, and many speakers insert a schwa between the {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} of ''realtor''. [[Irish English]] and [[Scottish English]] are some of the dialects that may insert a schwa between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} in words like ''film'', under the influence of [[Celtic languages]].

Epenthesis is sometimes used for humorous or childlike effect. For example, the cartoon character [[Yogi Bear]] says "pic-a-nic basket" for "picnic basket." Another example is found in the chants of [[England]] football fans in which England is usually rendered as {{IPA|[ˈɪŋɡələnd]}}
or the pronunciation of "athlete" as "ath-e-lete". Some apparent occurrences of epenthesis, however, have a separate cause: the pronunciation of ''nuclear'' as ''{{Sic|nucular|hide=yes}}'' arises out of analogy with other -''cular'' words (''binocular'', ''particular'', etc.) rather than from epenthesis.

Certain registers of colloquial Brazilian Portuguese sometimes have {{IPA|[i]}} between consonant clusters except those with {{IPA|/l/}} ({{lang|pl|atleta}}), {{IPA|/ɾ/}} ({{lang|pl|prato}}) or syllable-ending {{IPA|/s/}} (produced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} in a number of dialects, always [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] in {{lang|pl|[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|fluminense]]}} and {{lang|pl|[[florianopolitan dialect|florianopolitano]]}} and before voiceless consonants that are not in the end of the word in {{lang|pl|[[Northeast Region, Brazil|nordestino]]}}, a rare feature in a few others) ({{lang|pl|pasta}}) and so words like {{lang|pl|tsunami}}, {{lang|pl|advogado}} and {{lang|pl|abdômen}} are pronounced {{IPA|/tisuˈnami/}}, {{IPA|/adivoˈɡadu/}} and {{IPA|[abiˈdomẽj]}}. Some dialects also use {{IPA|[e]}} for voiced consonant clusters, which is [[accent (dialect)#Social factors|deemed as stereotypical]] of the lower classes: people who arrived from [[rural flight]] or internal migrations in cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasília]] and [[São Paulo]].

In Spanish, it is usual to find epenthetic vowels in sequences of plosive, flap, and vowel or labiodental fricative, flap, and vowel, normally in a non-emphatic pronunciation. For instance, {{lang|es|vinagre}} has the usual {{IPA|[biˈnaɣɾe]}} being replaced by {{IPA|[biˈnaɣ(ə)ɾe]}}.

===In Finnish===
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], there are two epenthetic vowels and two nativization vowels. One epenthetic vowel is the [[echo vowel|preceding vowel]], found in the [[illative case]] ending {{lang|fi|-(h)*n}}: {{lang|fi|maa}} → {{lang|fi|maahan}}, {{lang|fi|talo}} → {{lang|fi|taloon}}. The second is {{IPA|[e]}}, connecting stems that have historically been consonant stems to their case endings: {{lang|fi|nim+n}} → {{lang|fi|nimen}}.

In Standard Finnish, consonant clusters may not be broken by epenthetic vowels; foreign words undergo consonant deletion rather than addition of vowels: {{lang|fi|ranta}} ("shore") from Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*strandō}}. However, modern loans may not end in consonants. Even if the word, such as a personal name, is native, a [[paragoge|paragogic vowel]] is needed to connect a consonantal case ending to the word. The vowel is {{IPA|/i/}}: {{lang|fi|(Inter)net}} → {{lang|fi|netti}}, or in the case of personal name, {{lang|fi|Bush}} + {{lang|fi|-sta}} → {{lang|fi|Bushista}} "about Bush" ([[elative case]]).

Finnish has [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]ic consonants: {{lang|fi|l}}, {{lang|fi|h}} and {{lang|fi|n}} are of interest. In Standard Finnish, they are slightly intensified before a consonant in a medial cluster: {{lang|fi|-'''h'''j-}}. Some dialects, like [[Savonian dialects|Savo]] and [[Finnish language#Western dialects|Ostrobothnia]]n, have epenthesis instead and use the preceding vowel in clusters of type {{lang|fi|-l[[Consonant|C]]-}} and {{lang|fi|-h[[Consonant|C]]-}}, in Savo also {{lang|fi|-nh-}}. (In Finnish linguistics, the phenomenon is often referred to as {{lang|fi|švaa}}; the same word can also mean schwa, but it is not a [[phoneme]] in Finnish so there is usually no danger of confusion.)

For example, {{lang|fi|Pohjanmaa}} "Ostrobothnia" → {{lang|fi|Pohojammaa}}, {{lang|fi|ryhmä}} → {{lang|fi|ryhymä}}, and Savo {{lang|fi|vanha}} → {{lang|fi|vanaha}}. Ambiguities may result: {{lang|fi|salmi}} "strait" vs. {{lang|fi|[[salami]]}}. (An exception is that in Pohjanmaa, {{lang|fi|-lj-}} and {{lang|fi|-rj-}} become {{lang|fi|-li-}} and {{lang|fi|-ri-}}, respectively: {{lang|fi|kirja}} → {{lang|fi|kiria}}. Also, in a small region in Savo, {{IPA|/e/}} is used instead.)&lt;ref name="Savolainen" /&gt;

===In Lojban===
[[Lojban]] is a [[constructed language]] that seeks [[logic|logically-oriented]] grammatical and phonological structures. It uses a number of consonant clusters in its words, and since it is designed to be as universal as possible, it allows a type of anaptyxis called "buffering" to be used if a speaker finds a cluster difficult or impossible to pronounce. A vowel sound that is nonexistent in Lojban is added between two consonants to make the word easier to pronounce. Despite altering the phonetics of a word, the use of buffering is completely ignored by grammar. Also, the vowel sound used must not be confused with any existing Lojban vowel.

An example of buffering in Lojban: if a speaker finds the cluster {{IPA|[ml]}} in the word {{wikt-lang|jbo|mlatu}} ("cat") (pronounced {{IPA|['mlatu]}}) hard or impossible to pronounce, the vowel {{IPA|[ɐ]}} can be pronounced between the two consonants, resulting in the form {{IPA|[mɐ'latu]}}. Nothing changes grammatically, including the spelling and the [[syllabication]] of the word.

==In sign language==
A type of epenthesis in [[sign language]] is known as "movement epenthesis" and occurs, most commonly, during the boundary between signs while the hands move from the posture required by the first sign to that required by the next.&lt;ref name="Valli"&gt;{{citation|title=Linguistics of American Sign Language|year=2011|first1=Scott|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Johnson|editor1-first=Clayton|editor1-last=Valli|editor2-first=Ceil|editor2-last=Lucas|editor-link1=Clayton Valli|editorlink2=Ceil Lucas|editor3-first=Kristin|editor3-last=Mulrooney|editor4-first=Miako|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Villanueva|publisher=Gallaudet University Press|location=Washington, DC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3j26MwEACAAJ&amp;dq=editions:Hv6NxJ0MotIC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VKq_UdPxLYqY0QH-z4GoCw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ|pages=315–316|chapter=American Sign Language: The Phonological Base|edition=5|isbn=9781563685071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Felix Faust first appears in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #10 and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
The first recorded whereabouts of the mighty sorcerer now known as Felix Faust is from c. [[5th millennium BC|5,000 BC]], at which time he appeared in the legendary African empire of Kor. The king of Kor was [[Doctor Mist|Nommo]], the prime wizard of his time and the guardian of the mystic power called the Flame of Life. The evil sorcerer battled Nommo, attempting to use the Flame's power to his own corrupt ends. Nommo then called the Flame of Life into himself, defeating the sorcerer by banishing him to another dimension.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

In the mid-1920s, a madman and aspiring magician named Dekan Drache stumbled upon the dimension and managed to open a portal to it. Released, the sorcerer destroyed Drache’s soul and entered his body. However, though alive on Earth once more, the sorcerer found his powers drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

Obsessed with restoring his mystic might, the sorcerer read the story of how the man called [[Faust]] had sold his soul to the devil for supernatural powers, and decided to do the same. Inspired by the story's main character, the sorcerer now called himself '''Felix Faust''' and began a never-ending quest for mystical knowledge.

Felix Faust first appeared in ''Justice League of America'', vol. 1, #10 (March 1962), when he tried to gain some of his lost magical abilities by contacting the [[Demons Three]], three fictional demons in the DC Universe. These three demons were brothers who ruled the galaxy a billion years ago before being banished by beings known as the Timeless Ones. The Demons Three have tried to return time and again, summoned by Felix Faust and others, their attempts always foiled by the Justice League. Felix Faust tried to summon the power of the Demons Three by possessing three artifacts: the Green Bell of Uthool, the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath, and the Red Jar of Calythos, that had been created by the Demons, and which the Timeless Ones could not destroy or move from Earth. Pre-''Crisis'', they claimed a spell using the artifacts would free them in 100 years, but in that time the caster of the spell would be able to command them. To do this he takes control of the JLA with the Demons' help, who find and defeat the artifact's guardians and bring them to Faust who begins the spell, but Aquaman is able to break the spell by distracting him using his control of fish. The sorcerer is then taken to prison, and the JLA soon after find out about the Demons' escape and re-imprison them.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Pre-''Crisis'', he was a member of the Crime Champions, a trio of Earth-1 criminals who teamed up with a trio of Earth-2 villains to commit crimes, then escape to the other world using a vibratory device accidentally discovered by the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]]. Felix Faust robbed $1,000,000 from a sunken ship and escaped [[Aquaman]], the [[Martian Manhunter]] and the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]]. Later, the Earth-2 Crime Champions impersonated the Earth-1 Crime Champions using the Wizard's magic, in an attempt to trap the JLA. The Fiddler impersonated Felix Faust. They robbed [[Casino]] Town (evidently based on [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]), and 'Felix Faust' contacted the JLA. The Fiddler was, oddly enough, able to cast spells like Faust and battled Aquaman, the Martian Manhunter, and the Atom. The real Felix Faust, while robbing a fair on Earth-2, was confronted by [[Green Arrow]], the Martian Manhunter, and the Atom but, despite casting a spell that made them spin in midair, he was knocked out by the Atom. When the Crime Champions were fully defeated, [[Doctor Fate]], [[Batman]], and the Earth-1 Flash defeated Faust.

Over the years, Faust's hunger for magical power proved very costly to him.  He had bargained his soul for knowledge away on many occasions, only to buy it back later when his acquisitions failed to help him meet his goals; every time, he would end up worse than before. Eventually, he found it difficult to find any mystics willing to purchase his tarnished soul. Finally, he tried to trick [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] into giving him power by offering the pure soul of an innocent girl he murdered in lieu of his own. Unfortunately for him, Neron saw through the ruse and punished Faust by setting the girl's [[vengeful spirit]] upon him. For a time, Faust's damned soul languished in a [[Hell (DC Comics)|hellish]] plane for magicians who had abused or ignored the laws of magic.

===Activities during ''52''===
{{main|52 (comics)}}
During the event known as ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a voice from within the helm of [[Doctor Fate]] speaks to [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Dibny journeys with the helm through the [[afterlife|afterlives]] of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic and sees Felix Faust. He is told about their deals by the voice. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] promises to resurrect his late wife Sue in exchange for Dibny's taking vengeance on her murderer, [[Jean Loring]], but Dibny is unable to do so.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

At [[Nanda Parbat]], Rama Kushna tells Dibny, "The end is already written." In [[Doctor Fate]]'s tower, Dibny begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing Felix Faust, who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny's soul to Neron in exchange for his own freedom.

Ralph reveals that he was aware of Faust's identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell. Neron  appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny's commands: through his death Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower.

===One Year Later===
One year after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', with Neron having already escaped, Faust escapes from the Tower of Fate with the help of [[Black Adam]] through the aid of a revived [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and contacted [[Red Tornado]]'s soul which was still adrift after fighting [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] alongside [[Donna Troy]], the [[Green Lantern Corps]], and their allies. Working with [[Dr. Impossible]], [[Professor Ivo]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], Faust posed as [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and offered the android his heart's desire: a human body. The Tornado accepted, and Faust bound his soul into his new body. Faust and his allies then stole the Red Tornado's original android body for their own purposes.

After lending his concealment spells to [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], Faust joined with [[Talia al Ghul]] in order to corrupt yet another hero: [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]]. Faust offered Alice power, wealth, a place in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and the resurrection of her mother, but Alice refused, sent Faust out of town, and tapped into his powers so she could perform the resurrection herself. After this, Faust seemed to rejoin the Society.

On the cover of ''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Felix Faust as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Injustice League]].

===Post-''Final Crisis''===
As a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], Felix Faust played a part in the creation of [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] when he used his magic to animate the collected soil samples.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further appearances===
Felix Faust has been shown retaining his control over Isis even after he used her powers to free himself from Fate Towers by creating a doorway. Forced to keep Isis under a powerful sedation spell at all times, he's implied to regularly sexually abuse the young goddess. Still unable to communicate, Isis manages to signal her husband Black Adam to her aid via a trail of Isis flowers. Once Black Adam discovers Isis he forces Faust to free his wife, who in retaliation castrates Faust with her bare hands before leaving, sparing his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' #23 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The New 52''===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Felix Faust is sporting a more macabre, emaciated appearance. He captures [[Doctor Mist]] after the hero attempts to infiltrate his cult, leading to the [[Justice League Dark]] being sent in to rescue him. After Faust is knocked out by [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], the heroes find a map leading to the [[Books of Magic]] in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Dark'' #9 (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Felix Faust is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 3) #6&lt;/ref&gt; In the pages of ''[[Forever Evil: Blight]]'', Felix Faust and Nick Necro are seen torturing Mindwarp for [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]], eventually killing him, in an attempt to create rechargeable specimens, having previously done so with [[Sargon the Sorcerer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity of Sin: Phantom Stranger'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; When [[John Constantine]]'s group arrives in the Nanda Parbat temple, they eventually come across the project that Nick Necro and Felix Faust has been working on. They see [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], [[Cassandra Craft]], [[Shade, the Changing Man]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Blackbriar Thorn]], [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], [[List of Hellblazer characters#Papa Midnite|Papa Midnite]], Sargon the Sorcerer, and Zatanna being held for the use in the Crime Syndicate's weapons program to use against the [[Anti-Monitor|entity that destroyed their world]]. Constantine realizes that Nightmare Nurse is not herself, actually Necro in disguise. The two fight and Constantine is able to stop Necro in order to try and free Zatanna. Before he is able to, his is captured by Felix Faust. Constantine senses his team getting closer and hopes they will help him, not realizing that they have been captured too in order to be used for the project.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===''DC Rebirth''===
The character appears as one of the villains refusing to be hired by [[Henry Bendix]] in order to kill [[Midnighter]] and [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Midnighter and Apollo'' #1 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Felix Faust is unschooled in physical battle, and a sub-par [[hand-to-hand]] combatant. He is, however, a master sorcerer able to control vast magical power to affect reality itself. When he first appeared, Faust was unique amongst magicians of his caliber, requiring books or scrolls of spells to focus his powers. However, in recent appearances he seems to have overcome this disadvantage.

When Felix Faust first appeared in ''Justice League of America'' #10, he was using the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', the occult book from the stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], to summon the Demons Three. In a later appearance, the title of the work was changed.

==Legacy==
Felix Faust has two children:

* Fauna Faust
* [[Sebastian Faust]]

Of the two, Sebastian's soul was bartered to the demon [[Nebiros]], but the power Felix asked for was granted to Sebastian instead. As a result, the father-son relationship has been adversarial. Sebastian has generally acted as a hero, working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], Justice League, and [[Sentinels of Magic]].

==Other versions==

It has a heroic [[Just'a Lotta Animals]] (which parallels Earth-One's Pre-''Crisis'' [[Justice League of America]]) as well as "funny animal" supervillains like "Feline Faust", an evil cat sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #14, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Feline Faust later reappeared in the 2007 miniseries ''Captain Carrot and the Final Ark'', where it was disclosed that he had created Dark Alley, an evil counterpart of the Zoo Crew's resident mage, [[Alley-Kat-Abra]], and framed the original for the murder of her teammate [[Little Cheese]].
* Felix Faust made additional (albeit out of continuity) appearances in ''Justice League Adventures'' #32 attempting to control various League members. He would then appear in ''Justice League Unlimited'' #26, helping [[Black Manta]] to conquer Atlantis.

* Felix Faust appears in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode "The Case of the Stolen Powers" voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]. He was shown in a prison with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] as his cellmate. Faust was about to cast a spell to escape by transferring [[Superman]]'s powers into himself, but Penguin seized the opportunity, stole the Superman powers, and broke out easily, leaving Faust behind. Faust later stripped Penguin of Superman's powers, and gained them himself after he had his spirits apprehend Penguin. He also proved vulnerable to [[Kryptonite]] when [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] changed part of his burnoose into it. [[Wonder Woman]] used her lasso to force Felix Faust into relinquishing Superman's powers. The two were again jailed in the same cell much to the dismay of both.

* Felix Faust later appears in the 2000s [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' voiced by [[Robert Englund]] (notable for playing [[Freddy Krueger]]). Originally a professor of archaeology with a heretic interest in magic and the dark arts, he becomes a sorcerer prior to being expelled from the university where he taught, using his sorcery to exact his revenge on those who scorned him. In "Paradise Lost", Faust transforms the resident [[Amazons]] of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] into stone with a Gorgon talisman to force Wonder Woman to gather the parts of a key to open the gate to Tartarus, domain of [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]], making a pact with the god for "ultimate knowledge" in return. Wonder Woman manages to get the help of her friends from the Justice League in her quest for the key. Once Batman discovers Faust's intentions, the League decide not to give Faust the key without a fight. However, Faust gets the key and escapes. Faust manages to free Hades and even provides him with [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] as an offering. Hades, however, betrays Faust and causes him to begin aging rapidly, turning Faust into a withered old man on the spot and claiming to him that "''Ultimately, pain and suffering are all mankind will ever know''". Faust recovers enough to attempt to attack Hades, who was busy fighting Hippolyta and her allies, from behind with a spell, but rather than weaken Hades, it transforms him to his more powerful state. Soon after Wonder Woman destroys the key and sends Hades back to Tartarus, Faust ages into dust and is sucked into the underworld.
* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Balance", [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] manages to recover Felix's soul and contain it in a mirror. He tricks Tala into chanting a spell, freeing Faust and trapping Tala in the mirror. Faust then takes control of the Annihilator, an extremely powerful magical automaton forged by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], taken by the Justice League and then stolen by Cadmus, and uses it to take over Tartarus, overthrowing Hades, but at the same time, creating a terrible unbalance between the realms of the living and the dead. Eventually, Wonder Woman and [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Shayera]] free Hades, and together they destroy the Annihilator and defeat Faust once and for all, leaving Hades to content himself torturing Faust's soul forever.

Felix Faust later returns in "The Criss Cross Conspiracy!" as a paroled ex-convict, opening a magic shop. He is seduced by, and helps the vengeful [[Batwoman]] in swapping bodies with Batman so she can have her revenge on the [[Riddler]]. Batman, in Batwoman's body, later returns to Faust's store, and convinces him to escape the police and help him switch back bodies. After Faust, the Riddler, and Batwoman are all arrested, he continues to be smitten by her, despite Batman reminding him that for most of the time it was him in her body, and therefore, she has no feelings for him, but Faust disregards this and says: "''[[Some Like It Hot|Well, nobody's perfect!]]''" In "Triumvirate of Terror", Felix Faust is seen as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] when it came to a baseball game against the [[Justice League International]].

While Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to stop Ghast before he reaches the mainlands, Zatanna uses her magic to fight Felix Faust which ends with her using the chains she conjured to bind him. After Zatanna uses her hat to make Ghast disappear back to his dimension, a bound Felix Faust tries to flee only to trip on the rabbits that emerged from the hat prior to Ghast's summoning. He then quotes "Why did it have to be rabbits?"

During its zenith, Tucci was a supporter of [[Italian Fascism]], and he used idealized portrayals of Asian traditions to support Italian ideological campaigns. Tucci was fluent in several European languages, [[Sanskrit]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Pāli|Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and he taught at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] until his death. He is considered one of the founders of the field of [[Buddhist Studies]].

==Life and work==

He taught himself [[Hebrew]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Sanskrit]] before even going to university and in 1911, aged only 18, he published a collection of [[Latin]] epigraphs in the prestigious ''[[Review of the Germanic Archaeological Institute]]''. He completed his studies  at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] in 1919, where his studies were repeatedly interrupted as a result of [[World War I]].

After graduating, he traveled to [[India]] and settled down at the [[Visva-Bharati University]], founded by the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet and [[Nobel Laureate]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. There he studied [[Buddhism]], Tibetan and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and also taught Italian and Chinese. He also studied and taught at [[Dhaka University]], the [[University of Benares]] and [[Calcutta University]]. He remained in India until 1931, when he returned to [[Italy]].

===Scholarship and reputation===

He was Italy's foremost scholar of the East, with such diverse research interests ranging from [[Iranian religions|ancient Iranian religion]] to [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]]. He taught primarily at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] but was a visiting scholar at institutions throughout Europe and Asia. In 1931, the [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"|University of Naples "L'Orientale"]] made him its first Chair of Chinese Language and Literature. In 1933 he promoted the foundation the {{illm|Italian Institute for the Middle and Far East|it|Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente}} - IsMEO (Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente), based in Rome.

During the course of his life, he wrote over 360 books and articles.

===Politics===
Tucci was a supporter of [[Italian Fascism]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="maraini"/&gt; His activity under Il Duce started with [[Giovanni Gentile]], at the time Professor of the History of Philosophy at the University of Rome and already close friend and collaborator of Mussolini,  when Tucci was studying at the university of Rome, and went on until Gentile killing, and the compulsory administration of IsMEO for over two years until 1947.&lt;ref&gt;See Enrica Garzilli, ''L'esploratore del Duce.

'''Habitus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|b|ɪ|t|ə|s}}) is ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions.  It is the way that individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it. These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as [[social class]], religion, nationality, ethnicity, education, profession etc.). The habitus is acquired through imitation (''[[Mimesis|mimesis]]'') and is the reality that individuals are socialized, which includes their individual experience and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind, and as a result, shape present social actions of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Lizardo, O. 2004, "The cognitive origins of Bourdieu's Habitus", Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, vol. 34, no. 4, pp. 375-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] suggested that the habitus consists of both the ''[[hexis]]'' (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Pascalian Meditations|newspaper=Stanford University Press.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schemes are not mere [[habit]]s: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions to new situations without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which Bourdieu believed were collective and socially shaped. These attitudes, mannerisms, tastes, moral intuitions and habits have influence on the individual's life chances, so the habitus not only is structured by an individual's objective past position in the [[social structure]] but also structures the individual's future life path. Pierre Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals (Bourdieu, 1987).

The notion of habitus is extremely influential (with 400,000 Google Scholar publications using it), yet it also evoked criticism for its alleged determinism, as Bourdieu compared social actors to ''automata'' (while relying on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of [[Monadology|Monads]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Origins ==
The concept of habitus has been used as early as [[Aristotle]] but in contemporary usage was introduced by [[Marcel Mauss]] and later [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. However, it was [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who turned it into a cornerstone of his sociology, and used it to address the sociological problem of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and structure: the habitus is shaped by structural position and generates action, thus when people act and demonstrate agency they simultaneously reflect and reproduce social structure. Bourdieu elaborated his theory of the habitus while borrowing ideas on cognitive and generative schemes from [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jean Piaget]] dependency on history and human memory. For instance, a certain behaviour or belief becomes part of a society's structure when the original purpose of that behaviour or belief can no longer be recalled and becomes socialized into individuals of that culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community and society|last=Tönnies|first=Ferdinand|publisher=Harper and Row.|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loïc Wacquant]] wrote that habitus is an old philosophical notion, originating in the thought of [[Aristotle]], whose notion of ''[[hexis]]'' ("state") was translated into ''habitus'' by the Medieval [[Scholastics]].  Bourdieu first adapted the term in his 1967 postface to [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm Review] of Holsinger, ''The Premodern Condition'', in ''Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature'' 6:1 (Winter 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was earlier used in sociology by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939) and in [[Marcel Mauss]]'s account of "body techniques" (techniques du corps).  The concept is also present in the work of [[Max Weber]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Edmund Husserl]].

Mauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations.  It includes the totality of learned [[Habit (psychology)|habits]], bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to "go without saying" for a specific group (Bourdieu 1990:66-67)—in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational [[ideology]].

According to Bourdieu, habitus is composed of:

{{quote|[s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=The Logic of Practice|newspaper=Polity Press.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Non-sociological uses==

=== Literary criticism ===
The term has also been adopted in literary criticism, adapting from Bourdieu's usage of the term. For example, Joe Moran's examination of authorial identities in ''Star Authors: Literary Celebrity in America'' uses the term in discussion of how authors develop a habitus formed around their own celebrity and status as authors, which manifests in their writing.

=== Use in literary theory ===
Bourdieu's principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, "in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them" (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus "are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices – what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.

=== Body habitus ===
Body habitus (or "bodily habitus") is the medical term for physique, and is categorized as either endomorphic (relatively short and stout), ectomorphic (relatively long and thin) or mesomorphic (average dimensions).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13738">The Indian community in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] is made up of '''Indo-Kittitians''', '''Indo-Nevisians''', [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians and persons of Indian origin]]. Indo-Kittitians and Indo-Nevisians are nationals of Saint Kitts and Nevis whose ancestry lies within the country of India. The community originated from the [[Indian indenture system|Indian indentured workers]] brought to [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]] by the British in 1861 and 1874 respectively. By 1884, most of the community had emigrated to Caribbean nations with larger Indian populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname.

In recent years, the Indian population of Saint Kitts and Nevis has witnessed a gradual increase, as a result of immigration by [[Indo-Caribbeans]] particularly [[Indo-Guyanese]]. Some [[Sindhis|Indian Sindhi]] businessmen have also moved to the country recently. According to the 2001 Census of Saint Kitts and Nevis, the population of [[East Indians|East Indian]] people in the country rose from 0.7% in 1991 to 1.5% in 2001. They were the third largest ethnic group in country, after Africans (92.4%) and people of mixed race (3%). The 2001 Census recorded 443 East Indian males and 266 East Indian females in the country.

==Indenture==
Following the abolition of slavery in British colonies in the West Indies on 1 August 1838, plantation owners in the region sought to find an alternative to African slave labour. The British began transporting indentured workers from India to work on plantation estates in Saint Kitts and Nevis, which had become British colony in 1713. Saint Kitts and Nevis were the last among British and French colonies to introduce Indian indentured labour. Nevis received 315 Indian indentured workers, the smallest among all the colonies that employed indentured labour. Saint Kitts received the third smallest number (337 workers), after the Dutch colony of St. Croix which received 321 Indian workers. Limited information exists on indentured workers in Saint Kitts. A register that kept records of indentured workers was lost in a fire at the Court House in Saint Kitts in 1982. Some documents related to indentured workers are held at the National Archives in Saint Kitts.&lt;ref name="Mahabir"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5506761/St_Kitts_Conference_Paper|title=Legacy of Slavery and Indentured Labour: Conference on Bonded Labour, Migration, Diaspora and Identity Formation in Historical and Contemporary Context|date=June 2013|website=academia.edu|language=en|last1=Mahabir|first1=Kumar|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saint Kitts ===
The only ship that carried indentured workers from India to Saint Kitts, the ''Dartmouth'', departed from Calcutta on 26 February 1861 and arrived in Saint Kitts on 3 June 1861. The details of the passengers on the ship at the time of departure were recorded in an entry made in the report by Captain Eales, the Protector of Emigrants in the Protector's Office at Fort William in India. The entry, dated 28 May 1861, records that the ship had departed with 361 Indians on board - 192 men, 113 women, 17 boys, 24 girls and 13 infants under the age of two. The report also notes that four Indians died of cholera around the time of departure. However, it does not account for two passengers. The ''St. Christopher Advertiser and Weekly Intelligencer'' reported that the ''Dartmouth'' docked at St. Kitts on 3 June 1861 with 337 Indians on board - 186 men, 103 women, 13 boys, 10 girls and 10 male and 15 female infants. The difference between the figures indicates that 20 Indians died during the voyage.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hassankhan|first1=Maurits S.|last2=Roopnarine|first2=Lomarsh|last3=Ramsoedh|first3=Hans|title=The Legacy of Indian Indenture: Historical and Contemporary Aspects of Migration and Diaspora|date=10 November 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351986830|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ERR6DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 April 2017|language=en|chapter=Searching for the Lost Indentured of St. Kitts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roopnarine"/&gt;

Eales' report provides information about the origin and age of the passengers. According to the report, the passengers came from the areas of Sahebgunge or Gya (85 immigrants), Ranchi (84), Pooroolea (40), Hazareebaugh (33), Arrah or Shahabad (25), and Patna, Azimabad, Jellasore or Monghyr (22). The report records that 139 passenger were aged between 20–30 years, 71 were aged between 30–40 years, and the remaining 151 immigrants were either below the age of 20 or above the age of 40.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Upon arriving in Saint Kitts, the indentured workers were assigned to estates except for six who were directly admitted at the Colonial Hospital. Five of the admitted workers died at the hospital. The largest group of workers, around 29, were sent to Dewar Estate, and the smallest group of four workers was assigned to Mansion Estate. The West Farm, Dupuys, and Golden Rock estates received more female Indian workers than males. West Farm received 10 females and 8 males, Dupuys got 6 females and 5 males, and Golden Rock received 4 females and 3 males. On average, the 25 estates received an average of 13 indentured Indian labourers each.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roopnarine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roopnarine|first1=Lomarsh|title=Indian Indenture in the Danish West Indies, 1863-1873|date=24 August 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319307107|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bLrmDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the assignments, around 7 Indian workers died - 2 adults from Con Phipps estate, 1 person from Stone Castle estate, 1 child from Needsmust estate, and 1 child and 1 infant from Dewar. An infant that had been born during the voyage, and assigned to Helden estate, also died. During the same period, four Indian children were born on the island.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;

There were some reported instances of Indian indentured labourers refusing to work. The Masters and Servants Act of 1849 mandated that indentured labourers were required work from the moment they agreed to work for a plantation owner, but did not require the agreement to be in writing. An article in the ''St. Christopher Advertiser and Weekly Intelligencer'' published on 5 November 1861 states, "Bramandat (a coolie) was charged by Mr Dolomon Shelford with breach of his contract as a labourer. It appeared from the evidence that the defendant refused to do the work ordered, had not worked for a week. Defendant said that he would not do the work ordered (weed canes) but would do other work. He was committed to goal there to be kept to hard labour for 30 days." On 12 November 1861, the same newspaper reported that two workers named Dheajan and Shampod were charged with breach of contract by S.H. Richardson for refusing to work and were ordered to pay a fine of 5 shillings each.

Within four years of arriving in Saint Kitts, most of the workers converted from Hinduism and Islam to Christianity. They also began adopting Christian names. The ''Colonial Report, St. Kitts, 1868, FCOL'' states that only a “handful” of Indians were indentured in St. Kitts in 1868. The estimated 10 Indians who were still indentured are presumed to have re-indentured, as the original indenture period was five years. The report also emphasizes the "great exodus" of Indians from Saint Kitts to Guyana and Trinidad.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt; Twenty-two Indians died during their indenture period in Saint Kitts. Sixty-three Indians emigrated to Trinidad and Guyana after completing their indenture periods.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;

In the 1860s, the decade that Indians arrived in Saint Kitts, they accounted for about 5% of the island's total population. By 1887, the Indian population in Saint Kitts had declined by 82% and there were only 61 Indians still residing in Saint Kitts, or 0.2% of the island's total population. According to the 1921 Census of Saint Kitts, there were 21 India-born Indians in the country indicating that most of the Indian immigrants had left Saint Kitts. The Census did not provide figures for ethnic makeup of the population, but only noted the birth place of respondents. Therefore, it provides no information on the total Indian population of Saint Kitts in 1921, which would include Indians born on the island.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt;

=== Nevis ===
The only ship that carried indentured workers from India to Nevis, the ''[[Syria (ship)|Syria]]'', departed from Calcutta and arrived in Nevis on 30 March 1874 with 315 Indians on board. The Government of Nevis enacted Acts on 24 March and 9 April 1874 to raise funds to import the workers. In 1874, GBP4,993 of the government's total annual expenditure of GBP11,149 was allocated for facilitating the immigration of Indian labour. Upon arriving, Indian indentured labourers were assigned to estates across Nevis. According to a written reply to an enquiry from the Guiana Emigration Agency at 8 Garden Reach, Calcutta, which was responsible for emigration of Indians to Nevis, acting President Spencer Churchill declared that all Indian immigrants were freed from indentureship in April 1879. Some Indian labourers broke their contracts before the five-year indenture period ended so that they could migrate to Trinidad. Others emigrated after completing their contracts. No Indian workers in Nevis chose to re-indenture after completing their initial five-year contract, however, many chose to remain in Nevis as free workers.&lt;ref name="UWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.uwc.ac.za/users/DMS/Delete/M4ry-J4n3%27S%20d0cS/my%20e-books/history/indo%20caribbean%20genealogy.pdf|title=Indo-Caribbean Genealogy|website=University of Western Cape|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indians faced many legal issues in Nevis in the years following their arrival. Court records from 1874 and 1875 show that over 120 Indians were convicted of various offences, most often for breaching their contract. However, convictions of Indians reduced to 27 in 1880 suggesting that they had begun to assimilate and integrate with Nevisian society.&lt;ref name="UWC" /&gt;

Around 20% of Indian immigrants to Nevis returned to India by 1890.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt;

== Present day ==
Historians regard the Indians of Saint Kitts and Nevis as a "lost" population, as little is known about the descendants of the Indian indentured workers who arrived in the country. This can be attributed to the small number of Indians brought to Saint Kitts and Nevis as compared to other colonies in the Caribbean. Historian Kumar Mahabir states, "The small number of Indians in St. Kitts was a major contributor to their disappearance, physiologically and culturally." This is a common phenomenon among Indo-Caribbeans in nations with small Indian populations. Indo-Caribbeans in countries with larger populations such as Trinidad, Guyana and Suriname maintain Indian cultural and religious practices even today.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desk|first1=NewsGram|title=Indo-Caribbean history: An analysis of the lost Indians in St. Kitts|url=http://www.newsgram.com/indo-caribbean-history-an-analysis-of-the-lost-indians-in-st-kitts/|website=NewsGram|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small number of immigrants, inter-marriages, mass exodus of Indians from Saint Kitts and Nevis to other Caribbean nations, and subsequent integration with the Indian community in those nations resulted in the "disappearance" of the Indo-Kittitian and Indo-Nevisian communities. Although Nevis received slightly less Indian immigrants than Saint Kitts, the former bears comparatively more traces of Indian heritage. Historian Bonham C. Richardson wrote in 1983, "Today in the late 20th century, the only noticeable vestige of this immigration on the two islands [Saint Kitts and Nevis] is a few Indian families in the Cotton Ground village area of Nevis north of Charlestown."&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Bonham C.|title=Caribbean Migrants: Environment and Human Survival on St. Kitts and Nevis|date=1983|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|isbn=9780870493614|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yxWKVa66Vt0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWC" /&gt;

In recent years, the Indian population of Saint Kitts and Nevis has witnessed a gradual increase, as a result of immigration by Indo-Caribbeans to the country particularly Indo-Guyanese. Some Indian Sindhi businessmen have also moved to the country recently.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt; According to the 2001 Census of Saint Kitts and Nevis, the population of East Indian people in the country rose from 0.7% in 1991 to 1.5% in 2001. They were the third largest ethnic group in country, after Africans (92.4%) and people of mixed race (3%). The 2001 Census recorded 443 East Indian males and 266 East Indian females in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/Kitts.pdf|title=2000 ROUND OF POPULATION  AND HOUSING CENSUS SUB-PROJECT  NATIONAL CENSUS REPORT  ST. KITTS AND NEVIS|website=CARICOM|page=23|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian cuisine has had a significant influence on Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Indian food such roti, goat curry, pork curry, mutton curry and vegetable curries are a common part of Kittitian and Nevisian cuisines.&lt;ref name="Mahabir" /&gt;

{{Rquote|right| ''Kesavananda Bharathi'' is the case which saved Indian democracy; thanks to Shri [[Kesavananda Bharati]], eminent jurist [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala]] and the seven judges who were in the majority. |[[The Hindu]] - in April 2013, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the judgement.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The case that saved Indian democracy|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-case-that-saved-indian-democracy/article4647800.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=12 August 2013|location=Chennai, India|first=Arvind P.|last=Datar|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The '''Kesavananda Bharati''' judgement or ''''' His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Anr.''''' ([[case citation]]: (1973) 4 SCC 225) is a [[landmark decision]] of the [[Supreme Court of India]] that outlined the [[Basic structure doctrine (Constitution of India)|basic structure doctrine]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]].&lt;ref name=ik-257876&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Kesavananda Bharati ... vs State Of Kerala And Anr on 24 April, 1973|publisher=Indian Kanoon|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Supreme Court of India|Justice]] [[Hans Raj Khanna]] asserted through this doctrine that the constitution possesses a basic structure of constitutional principles and values. The Court partially cemented the prior precedent ''[[I.C. Golaknath and Ors. vs State of Punjab and Anrs.|Golaknath v. State of Punjab]]'', which held that constitutional amendments pursuant to Article 368 were subject to fundamental rights review, by asserting that only those amendments which tend to affect the 'basic structure of the Constitution' are subject to judicial review. At the same time, the Court also upheld the constitutionality of first provision of Article 31(c), which implied that any constitutional amendment seeking to implement the Directive Principles, which does not affect the 'Basic Structure', shall not be subjected to judicial review.

The basic structure doctrine forms the basis of power of the [[India]]n [[judiciary]] to review, and strike down, [[amendment of the Constitution of India|amendments to the Constitution of India]] enacted by the [[Parliament of India|Indian parliament]] which conflict with or seek to alter this [[basic structure]] of the Constitution.

The 13-judge [[Constitution Bench (India)|Constitutional bench]] of the Supreme Court deliberated on the limitations, if any, of the powers of the elected representatives of the people and the nature of fundamental rights of an individual. In a sharply divided verdict, by a margin of 7-6, the court held that while the Parliament has "wide" powers, it did not have the power to destroy or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the constitution.&lt;ref name=ik-257876-787&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Kesavananda Bharati ... vs State Of Kerala And Anr on 24 April, 1973|at=para. 787|publisher=Indian Kanoon|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the court upheld the basic structure doctrine by only the narrowest of margins, it has since gained widespread acceptance and legitimacy due to subsequent cases and judgments. Primary among these was the imposition of the [[state of Emergency in India|state of emergency]] by [[Indira Gandhi]] in [[The Emergency (India)|1975]], and the subsequent attempt to suppress her prosecution through the [[Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution of India|39th Amendment]]. When the Kesavananda case was decided, the underlying apprehension of the majority bench that elected representatives could not be trusted to act responsibly was perceived to be unprecedented. However, the passage of the 39th Amendment proved that in fact this apprehension was well-founded. In ''Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain'', a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court used the basic structure doctrine to strike down the 39th amendment and paved the way for restoration of Indian democracy.&lt;ref name=hindu-revisiting&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2901/stories/20120127290107100.htm |title=Revisiting a verdict |publisher=Frontline |date=Jan 14–27, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063934/http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2901/stories/20120127290107100.htm |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kesavananda judgment also defined the extent to which Parliament could restrict [[property rights]], in pursuit of land reform and the redistribution of large landholdings to cultivators, overruling previous decisions that suggested that the [[right to property]] could not be restricted. The case was a culmination of a series of cases relating to limitations to the power to amend the Indian constitution.

==Facts==
In February 1970 [[Swami]] [[Sri Kesavananda Bharati|Kesavananda Bharati]], senior plaintiff and head of "Edneer Mutt" - a [[Hindu]] [[Matha|Mutt]] situated in [[Edneer]], a village in [[Kasaragod District|Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]], challenged the [[Kerala]] government's attempts, under two state land reform acts, to impose restrictions on the management of its property.  Although the state invoked its authority under Article 21, a noted Indian jurist, [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala]], convinced Swami into filing his petition under Article 26, concerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference. Even though the hearings consumed five months, the outcome would profoundly affect India's democratic processes. The case had been heard for 68 days, the arguments commencing on October 31, 1972, and ending on March 23, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-case-that-saved-indian-democracy/article4647800.ece|title=The case that saved Indian democracy|last=Datar|first=Arvind P.|date=2013-04-24|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Austin  | first = Granville  | authorlink =   | title = Working a Democratic Constitution - A History of the Indian Experience  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 1999  | location = New Delhi  | pages =258 | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 0-19-565610-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-case-that-saved-indian-democracy/article4647800.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Arvind P. | last=Datar | title=The case that saved Indian democracy | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawexams.in/legalarticles/category/kesavananda-bharati-case/ KESAVANANDA BHARATI CASE | Legal Articles and Essays&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?233587 Kesavananda Bharati's Case | Arijit Pasayat, Ashok Bhan, Y.K.

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court reviewed the decision in ''Golaknath v. State of Punjab'', and considered the validity of the 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th amendments. The case was heard by the largest ever Constitution Bench of 13 Judges. The bench gave eleven separate judgements, which agreed on some points and differed on others.&lt;ref name="Lok Sabha Secretariat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=16–17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala]], assisted by [[Fali Nariman]], presented the case against the government in both cases.&lt;ref name=nujs-todays-promise&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nujslawreview.org/articles2008vol1no3/satya_prateek.pdf |title=Today's Promise, Tomorrow's Constitution: 'Basic Structure', Constitutional Transformations And The Future Of Political Progress In India |author=Satya Prateek |journal=NUJS Law Review |publisher=[[West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2008 |accessdate=2012-07-17 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority judgment===

Upholding the validity of clause (4) of article 13  and a corresponding provision in article 368(3), inserted by the 24th Amendment, the Court settled in favour of the view that Parliament has the power to amend the fundamental rights also. However, the Court affirmed another proposition also asserted in the Golaknath case, by ruling that the expression "amendment" of this Constitution in article 368 means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the Preamble and the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the Directive Principles. Applied to fundamental rights, it would be that while fundamental rights cannot be abrogated, reasonable abridgement of fundamental rights could be effected in the public interest. The true position is that every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same.&lt;ref name = "Lok Sabha Secretariat"/&gt;

The nine signatories to the statement were Chief Justice [[S M Sikri]], and Justices [[Jaishanker Manilal Shelat|J. M. Shelat]], [[K.S. Hegde]], A.N. Grover, B. Jaganmohan Reddy, D.G. Palekar, [[H R Khanna]], A.K. Mukherjee and [[Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud]]. Four judges did not sign: A.N. Ray, K.K. Mathew, M.H. Beg and S.N. Dwivedi.&lt;ref name = "Subverting the Constitution"&gt;{{cite book|title=Subverting the Constitution|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=39–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xzx0miLvzfsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=G.

===S.M. Sikri, Chief Justice===
[[S M Sikri]], Chief Justice held that the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual has to be preserved for all times to come and that it could not be amended out of existence. According to the Hon'ble Chief Justice, fundamental rights conferred by [[Fundamental Rights in India|Part III]] of the [[Constitution of India]] cannot be abrogated, though a reasonable abridgement of those rights could be effected in public interest. There is a limitation on the power of amendment by necessary implication which was apparent from a reading of the preamble and therefore, according to the learned Chief Justice, the expression "amendment of this Constitution", in [[amendment of the Constitution of India|Article 368]] means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the preamble, made in order to carry out the basic objectives of the Constitution. Accordingly, every provision of the Constitution was open to amendment provided the basic foundation or structure of the Constitution was not damaged or destroyed.

===Shelat and Grover, JJ===
Held that the preamble to the Constitution contains the clue to the fundamentals of the Constitution. According to the learned Judges, Parts III and IV of the Constitution which respectively embody the fundamental rights and the directive principles have to be balanced and harmonised. This balance &amp; harmony between two integral parts of the Constitution forms a basic element of the Constitution which cannot be altered. The word 'amendment' occurring in [[amendment of the Constitution of India|Article 368]] must therefore be construed in such a manner as to preserve the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, but not so as to result in damaging or destroying the structure and identity of the Constitution. There was thus an implied limitation on the amending power which prevented the Parliament from abolishing or changing the identity of the Constitution or any of its Basic Structure.

=== Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ===
Held that the Constitution of India which is essentially a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is the ultimate goal of every Government but that does not mean that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.

===Jaganmohan Reddy, J===
Held that the word 'amendment' was used in the sense of permitting a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they '''hen''', conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did not comprehend the power to totally abrogate or emasculate or damage any of the fundamental rights or the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution.

===H R Khanna J.===
[[H R Khanna]] has given in his judgment that the Parliament had full power to amend the Constitution, however, since it is only a "power to amend", the basic structure or framework of the structure should remain intact. While as per the aforesaid views of the six learned Judges, certain "essential elements" ( which included fundamental rights) of the judgment cannot be amended as there are certain implied restrictions on the powers of the parliament.

According to the Hon'ble Judge, although it was permissible to the Parliament, in exercise of its amending power, to effect changes so as to meet the requirements of changing conditions, it was not permissible to touch the foundation or to alter the basic institutional pattern. Therefore, the words "amendment of the Constitution" in spite of the width of their sweep and in spite of their amplitude, could not have the effect of empowering the Parliament to destroy or abrogate the basic structure or framework of the Constitution.

This gave birth to the [[basic structure doctrine]], which has been considered as the cornerstone of the Constitutional law in India.&lt;ref name="hindu-revisiting"/&gt;

==Significance==

This judgement ruled that Article 368 does not enable Parliament in its constituent capacity to delegate its function of amending the Constitution to another legislature or to itself in its ordinary legislative capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/|title=Para 506e of Kesavananda Bharati v.

These are  articles 4 (2), 169 (3)-1962, 239A2-1962, 244A4-1969, 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.&lt;ref name="ftext"&gt;{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |accessdate=11 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate= 9 September 2014 |df= }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also articles 239AA(7)b-1991, 243M(4)b-1992, 243ZC3-1992 and 312(4)-1977 which are inserted by later constitutional amendments and envisaging deemed constitutional amendments under legislative powers of the parliament, should be invalid. The Supreme Court declared in the case ‘A. K. Roy, Etc vs Union Of India And Anr on 28 December 1981’ that the article 368(1) clearly defines constituent power as 'the power to amend any provision of the constitution by way of an addition, variation or repeal'. it reiterated that constituent power must be exercised by the parliament itself in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 368.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/875590/|title= Pages 311 &amp; 312 of A.

The government of [[Indira Gandhi]] did not take kindly to this implied restriction on its powers by the court. On 26 April 1973, Justice [[Ajit Nath Ray]], who was among the dissenters, was promoted to [[Chief Justice of India]] superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde, which was unprecedented in Indian legal history. Advocate C.K. Daphtary termed the incident as "the blackest day in the history of democracy". Justice [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]] (previous Chief Justice of India) remarked that "this was an attempt of not creating 'forward looking judges' but 'judges looking forward' to the office of Chief Justice".&lt;ref name=scba&gt;[http://www.lexsite.com/services/network/scba/history.shtml Supreme Court Bar Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004035407/http://www.lexsite.com/services/network/scba/history.shtml |date=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Forty-second amendment of the Indian Constitution|42nd Amendment]], enacted in 1976, is considered to be the immediate and most direct fall out of the judgement. Apart from it, the judgement cleared the deck for complete legislative authority to amend any part of the Constitution except when the amendments are not in consonance with the basic features of the Constitution.

The basic structure doctrine was adopted by the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] in 1989, by expressly relying on the reasoning in the Kesavananda case, in its ruling on ''Anwar Hossain Chowdhary v. Bangladesh'' (41 DLR 1989 App. Div. 165, 1989 BLD (Spl.) 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090950.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220120644/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090950.htm |archivedate=2010-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4711">'''Mauro Cristofani''' (1941 in [[Rome]], Italy – 1997) was a [[linguistics|linguist]] and researcher in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] studies.

Cristofani was a student of [[Massimo Pallottino]] and would himself teach at the [[University of Pisa]], [[University of Siena]] and, his final post, at the [[University of Naples Federico II]]. He was a member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] and was held in high regard as Pallottino's scholarly heir.  During his thirty-year career he dominated the fields of Etruscan archaeology and, especially, epigraphy.  He directed the Istituto per l'Archeologia Etrusco-Italica of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] and was president of the Istituto degli Studi Etruschi ed Italici in Florence.

His fieldwork included investigations at [[Volterra]], [[Populonia]], and [[Cerveteri]].  In Italy the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche established the “Centro per l'archeologia etrusco-italica” in 1978, under the direction of [[Massimo Pallottino]].  In 1982, Cristofani (a student of Pallottino) became the director of the Center, which in 1990 became the Institute for Etruscan-Italic Archaeology.

In 2001 Cristofani's career was honored by the presentation of 3 volumes that compiled articles he published between 1966 and 1997 under the title ''Scripta Selecta: trenta anni di studi archeologici sull'Italia preromana'', edited by [[Antonio Giuliano]], [[Salvatore Settis]], and [[Fausto Zevi]].

{{Maya civilization}}
The '''Maya civilization''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|ə}}) was a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[civilization]] developed by the [[Maya peoples]], and noted for its [[Maya script|hieroglyphic script]]—the only known fully developed [[writing system]] of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]]—as well as for its [[Maya art|art]], [[Maya architecture|architecture]], [[Maya numerals|mathematics]], [[Maya calendar|calendar]], and [[Maya astronomy|astronomical]] system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern [[Mexico]], all of [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]], and the western portions of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], and the highlands of the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]], running from the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], across southern [[Guatemala]] and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.

The [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic period]], prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Preclassic period ({{circa|2000 BC to 250 AD}}) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]], including [[maize]], [[Phaseolus vulgaris|beans]], [[Cucurbita|squashes]], and [[chili pepper]]s. The first [[Maya city|Maya cities]] developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate [[stucco]] façades. Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the [[Petén Basin]], and the city of [[Kaminaljuyu]] rose to prominence in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count dates]]. This period saw the Maya civilization develop a large number of [[city-state]]s linked by a complex [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade network]]. In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]], became powerful. The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of [[Teotihuacan]] in Maya dynastic politics. In the 9th century, there was a widespread [[Classic Maya collapse|political collapse]] in the central Maya region, resulting in [[internecine war]]fare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of [[Chichen Itza]] in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive [[K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' kingdom]] in the Guatemalan Highlands. In the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] colonized the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of [[Nojpetén]], the last Maya city, in 1697.

Classic period rule was centred on the concept of the "divine king", who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was [[patrilineal]], and power would normally [[primogeniture|pass to the eldest son]]. A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader. Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king. The Maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms, and the Maya created art using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[Maya ceramics|ceramics]], sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.

Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly, and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by [[sacbe|causeways]]. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temples]], [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ceremonial ballcourts]], and structures aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and ceramics. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the [[0 (number)|explicit zero]] in the world. As a part of their religion, the Maya practised [[human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]].

[[File:Mayamap.png|thumb|right|The Maya area within [[Mesoamerica]]]]
The Maya civilization developed within the Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers a region that spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica was one of six [[cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwig 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included [[complex society|complex societies]], [[agriculture in Mesoamerica|agriculture]], cities, [[Mesoamerican architecture|monumental architecture]], [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing]], and [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendrical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included [[Mesoamerican astronomy|astronomical knowledge]], [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood]] and [[human sacrifice]], and a [[Mesoamerican mythology|cosmovision]] that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the [[cardinal direction]]s, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 6000 BC, the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, a process that eventually led to the establishment of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[agrarian society|agricultural societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanton et al. 1993, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; All Mesoamerican cultures used [[Prehistoric technology|Stone Age technology]]; after c. 1000 AD [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|copper, silver and gold]] were worked. Mesoamerica lacked [[draft animals]], did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities. The [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ritual Mesoamerican ballgame]] was widely played.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most [[Mesoamerican languages|languages]] falling within a small number of [[language family|language families]] – the major families are [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoquean]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Otomanguean]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]; there are also a number of smaller families and [[language isolate|isolates]]. The Mesoamerican [[language area]] shares a number of important features, including widespread [[loanword]]s, and use of a [[vigesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;Witschey and Brown 2012, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica,&lt;ref name="Foster02p5"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the [[Olmec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, Teotihuacan, the [[Aztec]]s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 29. Foster 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004b, pp. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 2004, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at [[Cacaxtla]], another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style.&lt;ref&gt;McVicker 1985, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands,&lt;ref&gt;Brittenham 2009, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo 1989, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant [[Toltec]] capital of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] had an especially [[Maya-Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza|close relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristan-Graham and Kowalski 2007, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Maya civilization location map - geography.svg|thumb|Maximum extent of the Maya civilization]]
The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America. This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p26"/&gt; Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1966, p. 25"&gt;Thompson 1966, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petén region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain;&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize, most of [[Quintana Roo]], southern [[Campeche]], and a portion of the south of [[Yucatán]] state. Farther north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.&lt;ref&gt;Quezada 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[littoral zone]] of [[Soconusco]] lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas,&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2000, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre.&lt;ref&gt;Viqueira 2004, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]]. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the [[Valley of Guatemala]] and the [[Quetzaltenango]] Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into [[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]], and gradually descend to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of the Maya civilization}}
The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 98. Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preclassic period (c. 2000 BC – 250 AD)===
{{Main article|Preclassic Maya}}
{{Multiple image| image1 = Kaminaljuyu 7.jpg| width1 = 200| image2 = El Mirador 5.jpg| width2 = 222| footer = [[Kaminaljuyu]], in the highlands, and [[El Mirador]], in the lowlands, were both important cities in the Late Preclassic.}}
The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at [[Cuello]] (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond et al. 1976, pp. 579–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper.&lt;ref name="Drew99p6"&gt;Drew 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterized by [[sedentism|sedentary]] communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic Period]], small villages began to grow to form cities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nakbe]] in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands,&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p214"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"/&gt; The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; By approximately 400&amp;nbsp;BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 182, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="Saturno2006"&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, pp. 1281–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of [[El Mirador]] grew to cover approximately {{convert|16|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p28"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p25-26"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the highlands, [[Kaminaljuyu]] emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2007, pp. 293, 297. Popenoe de Hatch and Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p. 991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takalik Abaj]] and [[Chocolá]] were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Komchen]] grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p8"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic period (c. 250–900 AD)===
[[File:QuiriguaStela1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stela D from [[Quiriguá]], representing king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]]&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, pp. 179, 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p. 81"&gt;Coe 1999, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and [[urbanism]], the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p. 81"/&gt; The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] or [[Classical Greece]], with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"/&gt;

During the Early Classic, cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 218. Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 123–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention was led by [[Siyaj K'ak']] ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, [[Chak Tok Ich'aak I]], died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 322. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Siyaj K'ak' oversaw the installation of a new king, [[Yax Nuun Ahiin I]].&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324"/&gt;

Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 224–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calakmul - Structure I.jpg|thumb|left|[[Calakmul]] was one of the most important Classic period cities.]]

In 629, [[B'alaj Chan K'awiil]], a son of the Tikal king [[K'inich Muwaan Jol II]], was sent to found a new city at [[Dos Pilas]], in the [[Petexbatún Lake|Petexbatún]] region, apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal's power beyond the reach of Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 383, 387.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king [[Yuknoom Ch'een II|Yuknoom Ch'een&amp;nbsp;II]] of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan K'awiil. Yuknoom Ch'een&amp;nbsp;II then reinstated Balaj Chan K'awiil upon the throne of Dos&amp;nbsp;Pilas as his vassal.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Koumenalis &amp; Barbara Moffett 2002. Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p. 108. Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southeast, [[Copán]] was the most important city.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"/&gt; Its Classic-period dynasty was founded in 426 by [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']]. The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 192–93. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]], who ruled from 695 to 738.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 200, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quiriguá]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 203, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 134–35. Looper 2003, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 1999, pp. 81, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palenque]] and [[Yaxchilan]] were the most powerful cities in the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] region.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"/&gt; In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north of the Maya area, [[Coba]] was the most important capital.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p554"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classic Maya collapse====
{{Main article|Classic Maya collapse}}
[[File:Chichen Itza ruins in Mexico -- by John Romkey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chichen Itza]] was the most important city in the northern Maya region.]]
During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe [[land degradation|environmental degradation]], and [[drought]].&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;Coe 1999, pp. 151–55.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and [[Uxmal]] showed increased activity.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Becker 2004, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classic Maya social organization was based on the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by [[Traditional society|tradition]] to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate [[systemic problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"&gt;Masson 2012, p. 18237.&lt;/ref&gt; One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at [[Toniná]] in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic period (c. 950–1539 AD)===
[[File:Zacuelu2.jpg|thumb|[[Zaculeu]] was capital of the Postclassic [[Mam people|Mam]] kingdom in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 613, 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"/&gt; Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Chichen Itza and its [[Puuc]] neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of [[Mayapan]] in the 12th century. New cities arose near the [[Caribbean]] and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coasts, and new trade networks were formed.&lt;ref name="Masson2012p18238"/&gt;

The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"&gt;Arroyo 2001, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of [[Maya warfare|warfare]]. Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"/&gt; One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was [[Q'umarkaj]], the capital of the aggressive [[K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"/&gt; The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organized as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, pp. 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayapan chac.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mayapan]] was an important Postclassic city in the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]].]]

Mayapan was abandoned around 1448, after a period of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the [[Southern Maya area|southern Maya region]]. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511.&lt;ref&gt;Masson and Peraza Lope 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces.&lt;ref name="Masson2012p18238"&gt;Masson 2012, p. 18238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1984, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 717.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the [[Kaqchikel kingdom]] had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.&lt;ref&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1511, a Spanish [[caravel]] was wrecked in the Caribbean, and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatán. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]], although two managed to escape. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 759–60.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] fell to the Spanish in 1521, [[Hernán Cortés]] despatched [[Pedro de Alvarado]] to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche' capital, Q'umarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 764–65. Recinos 1986, pp. 68, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into [[Iximche]], the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillemín 1965, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the fall of [[Zaculeu]], the Mam Maya capital, in 1525.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 110. del Águila Flores 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco de Montejo]] and his son, [[Francisco de Montejo the Younger]], launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 766–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 772–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1697, [[Martín de Ursúa]] launched an assault on the [[Itza people|Itza]] capital [[Nojpetén]] and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence of Maya culture===
{{main article|Maya peoples}}
The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas,&lt;ref&gt;Zorich 2012, p. 29. Thompson 1932, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation of Maya civilization===
[[File:Uxmal nunnery by Catherwood 02.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing by [[Frederick Catherwood]] of the Nunnery complex at [[Uxmal]]]]
The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p31"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, American traveller and writer [[John Lloyd Stephens]] set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman [[Frederick Catherwood]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch 2013, pp. 1, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to the attention of the world.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p31"/&gt; The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Castillo Maler.jpg|thumb|left|1892 photograph of the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Castillo]] at [[Chichen Itza]], by [[Teoberto Maler]]]]
The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of [[Alfred Maudslay]] and [[Teoberto Maler]].&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 38"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the distinguished Mayanist [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 44"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by [[Heinrich Berlin]], [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], and [[Yuri Knorozov]].&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and the view of the Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Unlike the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both [[State (polity)|states]] and [[chiefdom]]s. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, [[Caracol]], Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi-Revilla and Landman 1999, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Preclassic, the Maya political system coalesced into a [[theocracy|theopolitical]] form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley and Rubin 2012, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley and Rubin 2012, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Classic, some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over [[Naranjo]] for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres.&lt;ref name="Foias14p161"/&gt; Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
{{main article|Maya society}}
{{see also|Women in Maya society}}
From the Early Preclassic, Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners. As population increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking [[Maya priesthood|priests]] and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or [[clan]]s. Such clans held that the land was the property of the clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 2000, pp. 470, 473–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===King and court===
[[File:Toniná Stela 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maya stelae|Stela]] from [[Toniná]], representing the 6th-century king [[Bahlam Yaxuun Tihl]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 178. Witschey and Brown 2012, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art. The king was the supreme ruler and held a semi-divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods. From very early times, kings were specifically identified with the [[Maya maize god|young maize god]], whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization. Maya royal succession was [[patrilineality|patrilineal]], and royal power only passed to [[Women rulers in Maya society|queens]] when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty. Typically, power was passed to the eldest son. A young prince was called a ''ch'ok'' ("youth"), although this word later came to refer to nobility in general. The royal heir was called ''b'aah ch'ok'' ("head youth"). Various points in the young prince's [[Childhood in Maya society|childhood]] were marked by ritual; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years. Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, the heir also had to be a successful war leader, as demonstrated by taking of captives. The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony, involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a [[jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar-skin]] cushion, human sacrifice, and receiving the symbols of royal power, such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the so-called "[[Maya jester god|jester god]]", an elaborate headdress adorned with [[quetzal]] feathers, and a sceptre representing the god [[K'awiil]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya political administration, based around the royal court, was not bureaucratic in nature. Government was hierarchical, and official posts were sponsored by higher-ranking members of the aristocracy; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office during the course of their lives. Officials are referred to as being "owned" by their sponsor, and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 142, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court, instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by [[epigrapher]]s translating Classic Maya inscriptions. ''[[Ajaw]]'' is usually translated as "lord" or "king". In the Early Classic, an ''ajaw'' was the ruler of a city. Later, with increasing social complexity, the ''ajaw'' was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one, each ruling over different districts.&lt;ref name="D'ArcyHarrison03p114"&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word ''k'uhul'' to their ''ajaw'' title. A ''k'uhul ajaw'' was "divine lord", originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kalomte'' was a royal title, whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered, but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties. It indicated an overlord, or [[high king]], and the title was only in use during the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, p. 114. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Late Classic, the absolute power of the ''k'uhul ajaw'' had weakened, and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy, that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maya Presentation of Captives Kimbell.jpg|thumb|Classic period sculpture showing ''sajal'' Aj Chak Maax presenting captives before ruler [[Itzamnaaj B'alam III]] of [[Yaxchilan]]&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell Art Museum 2015. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A ''sajal'' was ranked below the ''ajaw'', and indicated a subservient lord. A ''sajal'' would be lord of a second- or third-tier site, answering to an ''ajaw'', who may himself have been subservient to a ''kalomte''.&lt;ref name="D'ArcyHarrison03p114"/&gt; A ''sajal'' would often be a war captain or regional governor, and inscriptions often link the ''sajal'' title to warfare; they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sajal'' meant "feared one".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of ''ah tz'ihb'' and ''ah ch'ul hun'' are both related to scribes. The ''ah tz'ihb'' was a royal scribe, usually a member of the royal family; the ''ah ch'ul hun'' was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the ''ajaw'' title, indicating that an ''ajaw'' always held the ''ah ch'ul hun'' title simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were ''yajaw k'ahk''' ("Lord of Fire"), ''ti'huun'' and ''ti'sakhuun''. These last two may be variations on the same title,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lakam'' was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"/&gt; The ''lakam'' was only found in larger sites, and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"/&gt;

Different factions may have existed in the royal court. The ''k'uhul ahaw'' and his household would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included [[Maya dance|ritual dances]], presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commoners===
Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively little is known about them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote-sensing]] surveys of apparently empty terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004a, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as [[cotton]] and [[cocoa bean|cacao]], as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;Masson and Peraza Lope 2004, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt; Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game.&lt;ref name="Foias14p161"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004a, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare==
{{main article|Maya warfare}}
{{double image|right|Maya standing male warrior, Jaina, c. 550-950 C.E., long-term loan to the Dayton Art Institute.JPG|144|Takalik Abaj obsidian spearpoints.jpg|200|[[Jaina Island]] figurine representing a Classic period [[Maya warfare|warrior]]|[[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|Obsidian]] spearheads with a [[lithic core]], [[Takalik Abaj]]}}
Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Foster02p143"/&gt; Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"/&gt; In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid abandonment of [[Aguateca]] by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p292"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p293"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|trophy heads]] hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives.&lt;ref name="Foster02p143"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Right up to the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.&lt;ref name="Webster00p66"&gt;Webster 2000, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, pp. 167–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.&lt;ref name="FOias14p168"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warriors===
During the Contact period, it is known that certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt; Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Wise and McBride 2008, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare.&lt;ref name="Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34"&gt;Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2007, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war, but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens.&lt;ref name="Foster02p145"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt;

===Weapons===
[[File:British Museum Mesoamerica 004.jpg|thumb|Lintel 16 from [[Yaxchilán]], depicting king [[Yaxun B'alam IV|Yaxun B'alam]] in warrior garb&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, 128, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''[[atlatl]]'' (spear-thrower) was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a {{convert|0.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} stick with a notched end to hold a [[dart (missile)|dart]] or [[javelin]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p294"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners used [[blowgun]]s in war, which also served as their hunting weapon.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; The [[bow and arrow]] is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"/&gt; Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured;&lt;ref&gt;Aoyama 2005, pp. 294, 301&lt;/ref&gt; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian,&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Rice, Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2009, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Aztec ''[[macuahuitl]]''. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2007, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.&lt;ref name="Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34"/&gt;

==Trade==
{{main article|Trade in Maya civilization}}
Trade was a key component of Maya society, and in the development of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and [[Tazumal|Chalchuapa]] in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|slave trade]] with wider Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="Foias14p18"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya engaged in long distance trade across the Maya region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. As an illustration, an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="Foster02p322"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]], and [[turquoise]] from [[Los Cerrillos, New Mexico]]. Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; 

Trade routes not only supplied physical goods, they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity;&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Contact period [[Manche Ch'ol]] traded the prestige crops of cacao, [[annatto]] and [[vanilla]] into colonial Verapaz.&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera and Aliphat Fernández 2006, pp. 31, 36. Caso Barrera and Aliphat Fernández 2007, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchants===
Little is known of Maya merchants, although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, it is known that at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 319–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the [[Xibalba|underworld]]; the patron deities of merchants were two [[Maya death gods|underworld gods]] carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.&lt;ref name="Foster02p322"/&gt;

The Maya had no pack animals, so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland; if the trade route followed a river or the coast, then goods were transported in canoes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p323"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial Maya trading canoe was encountered off Honduras on [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[Fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus|fourth voyage]]. It was made from a large hollowed-out tree trunk and had a palm-covered canopy. The canoe was {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} broad and was powered by 25 rowers. Trade goods carried included cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, food and drink for the crew, and copper bells and axes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p324"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Cacao was used as currency (although not exclusively), and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod, and stuffing it with dirt or [[avocado]] rind.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketplaces===
Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Spanish reported a thriving [[market economy]] when they arrived in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at [[Chunchucmil]]. Unusually high levels of [[zinc]] and [[phosphorus]] at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, pp. 363, 369, 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 14. Sharer and Traxler 2006, 659.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art has many regional [[Style (visual arts)|styles]], and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or blue-green, and used the same word for the colours blue and green. Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstones]], associating them with the sun-god [[Kinich Ahau|K'inich Ajau]]. They sculpted artefacts that included fine [[tessera]]e and beads, to carved heads weighing {{Convert|4.42|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya nobility practised [[Human tooth sharpening|dental modification]], and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth. Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, such as that of [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]], king of Palenque.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|WLA metmuseum Maya Wood Mirror Bearer 6th century.jpg|150|Maya eccentric.jpg|150|Early Classic wooden figurine, it may once have supported a [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirror]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|Eccentric flint]] in the [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Musées Royaux d'art et d'Histoire]], Brussels}}
Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition, suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood.&lt;ref name="Miller99p78"/&gt; Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone [[Maya stelae]] are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 9, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone [[relief]] panels at Palenque and [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 80–81. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli pp. 44, 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, 1281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, [[Río Azul]], and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at [[Bonampak]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|DSC03332TikalUnderjordiskSteinansikt.JPG|235|Bonampak, Chiapas. 13.JPG|280|[[Stucco]] mask adorning the Early Classic substructure of [[Tikal Temple 33]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;|Late Classic painted mural at [[Bonampak]]}}
[[Flint]], [[chert]], and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture, but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|Eccentric flints]] are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p45"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; They were technically very challenging to produce,&lt;ref name="SFU"/&gt; requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan. Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over {{convert|12|in|cm|order=flip}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with [[Maya religion]].&lt;ref name="SFU"&gt;SFU Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads, with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the [[Andean civilizations|Andean region]], it is likely that they were high-value items.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but [[North American jaguar|jaguar]] pelts and deer hides are also shown.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Sacul vase.jpg|147|Jaina Island type figure, Art Institute.jpg|200|Painted [[Maya ceramics|ceramic vessel]] from [[Sacul, El Petén|Sacul]]|Ceramic figurine from [[Jaina Island]], AD 650–800}}
Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art. The Maya had no knowledge of the [[potter's wheel]], and Maya vessels were built up by [[Coiling (pottery)|coiling rolled strips]] of clay into the desired form. Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing. Maya ceramics were painted with clay [[slip (ceramics)|slips]] blended with minerals and coloured clays. Ancient Maya [[Pottery#firing|firing techniques]] have yet to be replicated.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on [[Jaina Island]], in northern Yucatán. They stand from {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in}} high and were hand modelled, with exquisite detail.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ik-style ceramics|''Ik''-style]] polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José. It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic meetings, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al. 2007, pp. 1417–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone, both human and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors.&lt;ref name="Miller99p78"&gt;Miller 1999, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya valued [[Spondylus]] shells, and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to [[casting|cast]] small metal pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One poorly studied area of Maya [[folk art]] is [[Ancient Maya graffiti|graffiti]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutson 2011, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional graffiti, not part of the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the [[Chenes (Maya architecture)|Chenes]] region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson 2011, pp. 405–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{Main article|Maya architecture}}
[[File:Tikal-Reconstruction4.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the [[Maya city|urban core]] of [[Tikal]] in the 8th century AD]]
The Maya produced a vast array of structures, and have left an extensive architectural legacy. Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralized organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 [[man-hour|man-days]] to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 215. Abrams 1994, pp. 60, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over {{convert|20|km2|sqmi}}, with an urban core covering {{convert|6|km2|sqmi}}. The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days.&lt;ref name="Foster02p216"/&gt; The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects.&lt;ref name="Foster02p216"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban design===
{{main article|Maya city}}
Maya cities were not formally planned, and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"/&gt; Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt;

The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p35"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building materials and methods===
[[File:Comalcalco Museo de Sitio 5.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brick#Fired brick|Fired bricks]] with animal designs from [[Comalcalco]]]]
The Maya built their cities with [[Neolithic]] technology;&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available.&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"/&gt; The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety in the quality of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality.&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"/&gt; Volcanic [[tuff]] was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"&gt;Hohmann-Vogrin 2011, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Comalcalco]], where suitable stone was not available locally,&lt;ref name="Foster02p239"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brick#Fired brick|fired bricks]] were employed.&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"/&gt; Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco.&lt;ref name="Foster02p239" /&gt; Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"/&gt;

Wood was used for beams, and for [[lintel]]s, even in masonry structures.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch. [[Adobe]] was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.&lt;ref name="Foster02p239"/&gt;

===Principal construction types===
The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples, palaces, ballcourts, ''[[sacbe]]ob'' (causeways), patios and plazas. Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls. The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either in one or multiple colours, or with imagery. Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.&lt;ref name="fuente&amp;c99p142"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palaces and acropoleis====
[[File:Sayil1.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal Classic palace complex at [[Sayil]], in northern [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
These complexes were usually located in the site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term ''[[acropolis]]'', in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported [[roof comb]]s. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex.&lt;ref name="Foster02p232"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 2003, pp. 315–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 2003, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.&lt;ref name="Christie03p315"&gt;Christie 2003, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pyramids and temples====
[[File:Guatemala 074.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tikal Temple I|Temple I]], at [[Tikal]], was a funerary temple in honour of king [[Jasaw Chan K'awiil I]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 395, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as ''k'uh nah'', meaning "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, and the development of the [[corbel arch]] allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity might be one of the [[Tutelary deity|patron gods]] of the city, or a [[Veneration of the dead|deified ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====E-Groups and observatories====
The Maya were keen observers of the sun, stars, and planets.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt; [[E-Group]]s were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region;&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"/&gt; they take their names from Group E at [[Uaxactun]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 2012, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mundo Perdido, Tikal|Lost World]] complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 186. Laporte and Fialko 1994, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 235–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt; Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet [[Venus]], and various constellations.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"/&gt; The [[El Caracol, Chichen Itza|Caracol]] structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt;

====Triadic pyramids====
[[File:Triadic pyramid model, Caracol.png|thumb|right|Model of a [[triadic pyramid]] at [[Caracol]], [[Belize]]]]
[[Triadic pyramid]]s first appeared in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes.&lt;ref name="Hansen 1998, p. 78"&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 1993, p. 113. Szymanski 2013, pp. 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés 1994, p. 101. Szymanski 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1991, p. 166. Hansen 1998, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the triadic form are even known from [[Dzibilchaltun]] in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Q'umarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 80. Szymanski 2013, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built;&lt;ref name="Hansen 1998, p. 78"/&gt; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, [[Seibal]], [[Nakum]], Tikal and Palenque.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Q'umarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to [[Maya mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1991, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ballcourts====
{{double image|right|Zaculeu5A.jpg|200|Chichén Itzá - Juego de Pelota.jpg|230|Postclassic [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] at [[Zaculeu]], in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]|The [[Great Ballcourt]] of [[Chichen Itza]]}}
The [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] is a distinctive pan-Mesoamerican form of architecture. Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period,&lt;ref name="ColasVoß11p186"&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán, during the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Spanish contact, ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands, at cities such as Q'umarkaj and Iximche.&lt;ref name="ColasVoß11p186"/&gt; Throughout Maya history, ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape, with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The central playing area usually measures between {{convert|20|and|30|m|ft}} long, and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to {{convert|3|or|4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 189. Taladoire and Colsenet 1991, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica, measuring {{Convert|272|ft|m|order=flip}} long by {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide, with walls standing {{Convert|27|ft|m|order=flip}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional architectural styles===
Although Maya cities shared many common features, there was considerable variation in architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Petén====
The central Petén style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt; One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I.&lt;ref&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include [[Altun Ha]], Calakmul, [[Holmul]], [[Ixkun]], Nakum, Naranjo, and [[Yaxhá]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p146"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puuc====
The exemplar of Puuc-style architecture is Uxmal. The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt; Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches;&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god [[Chaac]] and the [[Principal Bird Deity]]. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland [[Oaxaca]], outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.&lt;ref name="Foster02p225"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chenes====
{{double image|right|Hochob II 2.jpg|250|Rio Bec B.jpg|250|Elaborate Chenes-style façade at [[Hochob]] |False pyramids adorn the façade of a [[Río Bec]] palace.}}
The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels.&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p150"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Chenes sites include [[Dzibilnocac]], [[Hochob]], [[Xtampak|Santa Rosa Xtampak]], and [[Tabasqueño]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p150"/&gt;

====Río Bec====
The [[Río Bec]] style forms a sub-region of the Chenes style,&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; and also features elements of the Central Petén style, such as prominent roof combs.&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p149"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 226. Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; Río Bec sites include [[Chicanná]], [[Hormiguero, Mexico|Hormiguero]], and [[Xpuhil]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p149"/&gt;

====Usumacinta====
The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than [[Corbel arch|corbel vaulting]]. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Mayan languages}}
[[File:Mayan Language Migration Map.svg|thumb|Map of [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] migration routes]]

Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke a single language, dubbed [[Proto-Mayan language|proto-Mayan]] by linguists.&lt;ref name="Foster02p274"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28"/&gt; Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family, including [[Huastecan languages|Huastecan]], [[Quichean languages|Greater K'iche'an]], [[Q'anjobalan languages|Greater Q'anjobalan]], [[Mamean languages|Mamean]], Tz'eltalan-Ch'olan, and [[Yucatecan languages|Yucatecan]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p26"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 274. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as [[Classic Maya language|Ch'olan]];&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Ch'olan.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Ch'olan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to [[Medieval Latin]] as a [[sacred language|ritual]] or [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Robertson and Stuart 2000, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic Ch'olan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Robertson and Stuart 2000, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic period, [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] was also being written in Maya codices alongside Ch'olan.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker 2007, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and literacy==

The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2004, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, p. 1282.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is preceded by several other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]], such as the [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec]] and [[Zapotec writing|Zapotec scripts]]. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2007, p. 293. Schieber Laverreda and Orrego Corzo 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p225"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized and consistent writing system.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p10"&gt;Kettunen and Helmke 2008, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] and colonial officials, notably [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]], destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them, and with them the knowledge of Maya writing, but by chance three uncontested [[Maya codices|pre-Columbian books]] dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved. These are known as the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'' and the ''[[Paris Codex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 126. Foster 2002, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; A few pages survive from a fourth, the ''[[Grolier Codex]]'', whose authenticity is disputed. Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p129"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the few extant Maya writings, [[Michael D. Coe]] stated:

{{Quote|text=[O]ur knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and 'Pilgrim's Progress').|sign=Michael D. Coe|source=''The Maya'', London: Thames and Hudson, 6th ed., 1999, pp. 199–200.}}

Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels. Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden lintels, cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;

===Writing system===
{{Main article|Maya script}}
{{double image|right|Balam_1.svg|200|Balam_2.svg|200|The Maya word ''B'alam'' ("[[jaguar]]") written twice in the Maya script. The first glyph writes the word logographicaly with the jaguar head standing for the entire word. The second glyph block writes the word phonetically using the three syllable signs ''BA'', ''LA'' and ''MA''.}}
The Maya writing system (often called ''[[Maya hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]'' from a superficial resemblance to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian writing)&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth Hamann 2008, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[logosyllabic]] writing system, combining a [[syllabary]] of [[phonetic]] signs representing syllables with [[logogram]] representing entire words.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka 2008, pp. 30, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Macri and Looper 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;

The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 120, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In excess of 10,000 individual texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"&gt;Kettunen and Helmke 2008, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name ''[[amatl]]'' used to produce [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin01"&gt;Tobin 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1994, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with [[Maya numerals|numbers]], the Maya calendar, and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 271–72.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.&lt;ref&gt;Macri and Looper 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hieroglyphic script===
[[File:Maya script reading direction.png|thumb|right|Reading order of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic text]]]]
The basic unit of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes a word or phrase. The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified. C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16"&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hieroglyphic text may be laid out in varying manners, generally text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16"/&gt;

Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements. These consist of the main sign, and any affixes. Main signs represent the major element of the block, and may be a [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adverb]], [[adjective]], or [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic sign]]. Some main signs are abstract, some are pictures of the object they represent, and others are "head variants", personifications of the word they represent. Affixes are smaller rectangular elements, usually attached to a main sign, although a block may be composed entirely of affixes. Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements, including nouns, verbs, verbal suffixes, prepositions, pronouns, and more. Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign, and Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements.&lt;ref&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing tools===
{{double image|right|Pauah Tun scribe figure, Copán, Honduras.jpg|150|Maya Codex-Style Vessel with two scenes 3 Kimbell.jpg|225|Sculpture of a scribe from [[Copán]], [[Honduras]]&lt;ref name="Webster89p55"/&gt;|Illustration of a Maya scribe on a Classic period vessel. [[Kimbell Art Museum]], [[Fort Worth]].}}
Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair.&lt;ref name="Tobin01"/&gt; A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell.&lt;ref name="Webster89p55"&gt;Webster et al. 1989, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and [[mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]].&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p293"/&gt;

===Scribes and literacy===
Commoners were illiterate; scribes were drawn from the elite. It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write, although at least some [[Women in Maya society|women]] could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya scribes were called ''aj tz'ib'', meaning "one who writes or paints".&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot. Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements. A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not much is known about Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on ceramics and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
{{main article|Maya numerals}}
{{double image|right|Maya Hieroglyphs Plate 32.jpg|120|maya.svg|207|[[Maya numerals]] on a page of the Postclassic ''[[Dresden Codex]]''|Maya numerals}}
In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 249"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The bar-and-dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC;&lt;ref&gt;Blume 2011, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero.&lt;ref&gt;Blume 2011, p. 53. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101. Justeson 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; although it may have been predated by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian system]].&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest uses, the zero served as a [[Positional notation|place holder]], indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation,&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until its use was extinguished by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five.&lt;ref name="Foster02p248"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 248. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 using a combination of these symbols.&lt;ref name="Foster02p248"/&gt; The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 249"/&gt; Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar==
{{Main article|Maya calendar | Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}
The Maya calendrical system, in common with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the [[Old World]]; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the [[Julian calendar|Julian year]]. The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar combined a non-repeating [[Maya Long Count Calendar|Long Count]] with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day ''tzolk'in'',&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; the 365-day ''[[haab']]'',&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 52-year [[Calendar Round]], resulting from the combination of the ''tzolk'in'' with the ''haab'''.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 253"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god K'awiil.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p104"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic unit in the Maya calendar was one day, or ''[[k'in]]'', and 20 ''k'in'' grouped to form a ''[[winal]]''. The next unit, instead of being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a ''[[Tun (Maya calendar)|tun]]''. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p102"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 260-day ''tzolk'in'' provided the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and the foundations of Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, and it may be that the 260-day count is based on the [[pregnancy|human gestation period]]. This is reinforced by the use of the ''tzolk'in'' to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p104"/&gt;

The 365-day ''haab'' was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day ''winal''s, completed by the addition of a 5-day period called the ''wayeb''.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p107"/&gt; The ''wayeb'' was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 253"/&gt; In a similar way to the ''tz'olkin'', the named ''winal'' would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), in the case of the shorter ''wayeb'' period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the ''tz'olkin'' had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the ''haab'', producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by [[Mayanist]]s as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p107"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any non-repeating calendar, the Maya measured time from a fixed start point. The Maya set the beginning of their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of ''bak'tun''s, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great ''Piktun'' cycle consisting of either 20 ''bak'tun''s. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the ''piktun'' cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 ''bak'tun''s, but others used a cycle of 13 + 20 ''bak'tun'' in the current ''piktun''.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 2014 "A single passage on a Late Classic hieroglyphic panel at Palenque makes two further points clear; first, that the count of bak'tuns will accumulate to 19, as before the present era, before the number in the piktuns place will change; and second, that that number will change to 1, not to 14, just as the bak'tuns did in 2720 BC. In other words, all piktuns except the present one contained 20 bak'tuns, but the current one contains 33; all previous kalabtuns, the next place up, contained 20 piktuns, but the current kalabtun contains 33 of those. Presumably the same pattern obtains for the rest of the higher places. This staggered resetting of the higher-order cycles, so jarringly unexpected from a contemporary, Western perspective, suggests an attitude towards time more numerological than mathematical. 13 and 20, after all, are the key numbers of the tzolk'in, so it is fitting that they should be incorporated into the Long Count at enormous temporal scales."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stone 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off the number of ''bak'tun''s, ''kat'un''s, ''tun''s, ''winal''s, and ''k'in''s since the start of the current creation. This would be followed by the ''tz'olkin'' portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the ''Haab'' portion of the Calendar Round date.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p110"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correlation of the Long Count calendar===
{{main article|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count}}
Although the [[Maya calendar#Calendar Round|Calendar Round]] is still in use today,&lt;ref&gt;Tedlock 1992, p. 1. Miles 1952, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya started using an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]] during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 k'atuns. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel Ralph L. Roys, Washington D.C.; Carnegie Institution 1933, pp. 79, 83&lt;/ref&gt; contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] date of 12 November 1539.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphers [[Simon Martin (Mayanist)|Simon Martin]] and [[Nikolai Grube]] argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems with the rest of the Maya region.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt; The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt;

==Astronomy==
{{main article|Maya astronomy}}
{{See also|Archaeoastronomy}}
{{Quote|The famous astrologer [[John Dee]] used an Aztec obsidian mirror to see into the future. We may look down our noses at his ideas, but one may be sure that in outlook he was far closer to a Maya priest astronomer than is an astronomer of our century.|J. Eric S. Thompson|Maya Astronomy: ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', 1974&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1974, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Madrid Codex astronomer.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Maya astronomy|astronomer]] from the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]''&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 1999, pp. 252–53.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical data on the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for [[divination]], so Maya astronomy was essentially for [[astrology|astrological]] purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. It was rather used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy. The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya measured the 584-day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours. Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365-day ''haab'' calendrical cycles, and this period was recorded in the codices. The Maya also followed the movements of [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this was associated with the rebirth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Maya, the [[heliacal rising]] of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"/&gt; Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning "war" incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Sight-lines through the windows of the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"/&gt; Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the [[heliacal rising|heliacal]] or cosmical rising of Venus, and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"/&gt;

Solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the ''Dresden Codex'', a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the ''k'in'' ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"/&gt;

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main article|Maya religion|Maya mythology}}
In common with the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p91"/&gt; At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p176"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p93"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya ritual included the use of [[hallucinogens]] for ''[[Maya priesthood#Offices|chilan]]'', oracular priests. Visions for the ''chilan'' were likely facilitated by consumption of [[Nymphaea|water lilies]], which are hallucinogenic in high doses.&lt;ref&gt;Emboden 1979, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into [[Imperial cult|religious cults]] that justified their right to rule.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p91"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Preclassic,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt; this process culminated in the institution of the  divine king, the ''k'uhul ajaw,'' endowed with ultimate political and religious power.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p93"/&gt; 

The Maya viewed the cosmos as highly structured. There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld, with the mortal world in between. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"/&gt;

Maya households interred their dead underneath the floors, with offerings appropriate to the social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p176"/&gt;

Belief in supernatural forces pervaded Maya life and influenced every aspect of it, from the simplest day-to-day activities such as food preparation, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p92"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, [[Maya music|music]], ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p722"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques. One important, though incomplete, resource is physical evidence, such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials with their associated [[Maya death rituals|funerary offerings]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art, architecture, and writing are another resource, and these can be combined with [[ethnography|ethnographic]] sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p92" /&gt;

=== Human sacrifice ===
{{main article|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}
[[File:Ballgame sacrifice relief, Chichen Itza.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Relief sculpture of a decapitated [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayer]], adorning the [[Great Ballcourt]] at [[Chichen Itza]]]]
Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; In AD 738, the vassal king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil of Copán and a few days later ritually decapitated him.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 134–35. Looper 2003, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p96"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'': playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld, the heroes achieved victory, but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751" /&gt; 

During the Postclassic period, the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.&lt;ref name="TieslerCucina06p493"&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deities===

The Maya world was populated by a great variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p177"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 177, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Itzamna]] was the creator god, but he also embodied the cosmos, and was simultaneously a [[solar deity|sun god]];&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"/&gt; K'inich Ahau, the day sun, was one of his aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with K'inich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the [[Maya jaguar gods|Night Jaguar]], representing the sun in its journey through the underworld.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p181"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The four [[Pawatun]]s supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the [[Bacab]]s performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p182"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The four Chaacs were [[Weather god|storm gods]], controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p182"/&gt; Other important deities included the [[Maya moon goddess|moon goddess]], the maize god, and the Hero Twins.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' was written in the Latin script in early colonial times, and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown K'iche' Maya nobleman.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p134"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123"/&gt; The ''Popul Vuh'' recounts the [[Mesoamerican creation myths|mythical creation]] of the world, the legend of the Hero Twins, and the history of the Postclassic K'iche' kingdom.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p134"/&gt; Deities recorded in the ''Popul Vuh'' include [[Hun Hunahpu]], the K'iche' maize god,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt; and a triad of deities led by the K'iche' patron [[Tohil]], and also including the moon goddess [[Awilix]], and the mountain god [[Jacawitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2007, pp. 61n65, 228n646. Miller and Taube 1993, p. 170. Carmack 2001, pp. 275, 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped [[Feathered Serpent|feathered serpent deities]]. Such worship was rare during the Classic period,&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was [[Kukulkan]],&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; among the K'iche' it was [[Q'uq'umatz]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2007, pp. 52–53n20.&lt;/ref&gt; Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period [[Maya War Serpent|War Serpent]], ''Waxaklahun Ubah Kan'', and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the [[Vision Serpent]] of Classic Maya art.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, Schele and Parker 1993, pp. 289, 325, 441n26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the [[Quetzalcoatl]] cult of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 582–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Q'uq'umatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2008, pp. 60, 121, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
{{Main article|Maya cuisine}}
{{See also|Agriculture in Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Día Internacional de los Pueblos Indígenas (7852553230).jpg|thumb|right|[[Maize]] was a [[staple food|staple]] of the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]].]]
The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production. It was believed that [[shifting cultivation]] (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2014, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now thought that permanent [[raised field]]s, [[terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 81–82. Demarest 2004, pp. 130–38. Ross 2011, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Brown and Culbert 1981, p. 1460.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 2011, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, [[manioc]], [[sunflower seed]]s, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Colunga-García Marín and Zizumbo-Villarreal 2004, pp. S102–S103&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At [[Joya de Cerén]], a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and [[tomato]]es. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed [[History of chocolate|chocolate beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 310–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya had few domestic animals; [[Dogs in Mesoamerica|dogs]] were domesticated by 3000 BC, and the [[Muscovy duck]] by the Late Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocellated turkey]]s were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya sites==
{{See also|List of Maya sites}}
There are hundreds of Maya sites spread across five countries: Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal sites in the Puuc region, after Uxmal, are [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], [[Labna]], and Sayil. In the east of the Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include [[Becan]], Chicanná, [[Kohunlich]], and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu, [[Mixco Viejo]], and Q'umarkaj (also known as Utatlán).&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, Caracol, and [[Xunantunich]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medical Expenditure Panel Survey''' (MEPS) is a family of surveys intended to provide nationally-representative estimates of health expenditure, utilization, payment sources, health status, and health insurance coverage among the noninstitutionalized, nonmilitary population of the [[United States]].  This series of government-produced data sets can be used to examine how individuals interact with the medical care system in the United States.

MEPS is administered by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) in three components: the core Household Component, the Insurance/Employer Component, and the Medical Provider Component.  Only the Household Component is available for download on the Internet.  These components provide comprehensive national estimates of health care use and payment by individuals, families, and any other demographic group of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/06/catalog-ai-an-na/MEPS.htm |title=Data on Health and Well-being of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Other Native Americans &amp;#124; ASPE |website=Aspe.hhs.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MEPS was modeled after the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) and the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES), which were conducted in 1977 (NMES-1), 1980 (NMCUES), and 1987 (NMES-2).  Each of these surveys was tasked with the goal of providing data on a representative sample of Americans' every interaction with the medical care system.  Although the NMES and NMCUES were sampled independently from the U.S. population, each new MEPS sample is drawn from the outgoing [[National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|National Health Interview Survey]] panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cloud9.norc.uchicago.edu/faqs/meps.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20011122091419/http://cloud9.norc.uchicago.edu/faqs/meps.htm |archivedate=2001-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/elec_prods/subject/nmcues.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200542/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/elec_prods/subject/nmcues.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; MEPS is generally considered the direct descendent of these surveys, and prestigious peer-reviewed journals commonly publish articles that examine trends calculated between MEPS and its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Druss | first1 = B.

==Research topics==
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey can be used for a wide range of topics related to the U.S. healthcare system, including Access to Care, Children's Health, Chronic Conditions, [[Health Insurance]], Health Disparities, [[Women's Health]], Prescription Drugs, Individuals with [[Disabilities]], and the [[Elderly]].  AHRQ continually produces chartbooks, statistical briefs, and fact sheets using MEPS data which shed light on these various facets of how the American healthcare system functions, what patients experience, how they behave, and who pays for the cost of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/MEPS_topics.jsp |title=Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Topics |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data accessibility==
The MEPSnet Query Tools interactive table builder allows non-statisticians to select a data year and medical variable(s) of interest, and produce descriptive statistics and crosstabulations of Household Component and Insurance Component data from the AHRQ website.

==Data available==
The current{{when|date=July 2017}} publicly available Medical Expenditure Panel Survey – Household Component data set consists of six files which describe the demographics and characteristics of the survey population and eight event-level files which capture all interactions with the U.S. medical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp |title=Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Download Data Files |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2017-05-31 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household Component Full-Year Files===
The six full-year files include:

* The Full-Year Consolidated Data files (released annually in November) – The main person-level file of the Household Component data set, which includes all demographic and medical characteristics, as well as patient-reported responses to the main survey questions.  Since the survey involves five interview rounds over the two-year panel, data from interview rounds 1, 2, and 3 are included for individuals in their first of two years, and data from interview rounds 3, 4, and 5 are included for individuals in their second of two years.  These single-year consolidated datafiles can be thought of as the first half of one two-year panel survey stacked on top of the second half of another two-year panel survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-113 |title=Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Public Use File Details |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2006-01-08 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Full-Year Population Characteristics files (released annually in May) – A skeleton version of the person-level consolidated file, which gets released six months before the Consolidated file of the same year but does not include any income or medical expenditure variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-107 |title=Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Public Use File Details |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2006-01-08 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Medical Conditions files (released annually in November) – The medical condition-level file, which can be linked to both the person-level files and the event-level files.  Unlike the medical event-level files, which describe a solitary encounter with the U.S. healthcare system, records within the Medical Conditions files contain a distinct [[ICD-9]] code, Clinical Classification Code, and describe only one ailment (illness or injury).  In order to view all medical events during the calendar year associated with a particular condition, a many-to-one join can be executed between this file and zero, one, or more of the event-level files' records (on CONDIDX).  The medical condition records in this file can also be merged with a many-to-one join to the person-level files (on DUPERSID), where each person may have zero, one, or multiple matching condition records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h112/h112doc.shtml |title=MEPS HC-112: 2007 Medical Conditions |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Jobs files (released annually in May) – The jobs-level data file contains information about each job that each MEPS-HC survey respondent held over the course of the calendar year, including wages, hours, industry, and occupation, as well as various healthcare-related survey questions (such as offers of employer-sponsored insurance, sick day availability, etc.).  This file can be merged with the full-year *person-level file (on DUPERSID), with one match per unique job an individual held during the calendar year.  It can also be merged with the Person Round Plan file, matching (on JOBSIDX) wherever a private health insurance plan was obtained through a place of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h108/h108doc.shtml |title=HC-108: MEPS 2007 Jobs File |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2007-12-31 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Person Round Plan (PRPL) files (released annually in October) – This health insurance plan by interview date file contains information about each private insurance plan covering each individual surveyed, with one record per interview date (three annually).  Private health insurance plans include [[physician]]/[[hospital]], [[Dental insurance|dental]], [[Vision insurance|vision]], [[medigap]], and [[prescription drug]]s.  This file contains health insurance-specific information, such as an edited monthly [[out-of-pocket]] [[insurance premium]], source of coverage and premium payment, as well as some questions about the planholder's satisfaction with the plan.  Although this file can be merged with both person-level files (on DUPERSID) and the Jobs files (on JOBSIDX), this file contains one record per person, per plan, per interview and therefore does not easily condense into one-to-one merges.  As an analytic shortcut, data users might simply limit this data set to each unique person-plan's first interview record of the year; the first interview number (RN) available for each distinct establishment identifier and policyholder identifier combination (ESTBIDX + PHLDRIDX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h111/h111doc.shtml |title=MEPS HC-111: 2007 Person Round Plan Public Use File |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Longitudinal Weight files (released annually in December) – This person-level file mirrors the main Consolidated files in terms of contents, except that it contains survey responses for all five rounds and therefore contains half as many observations.  The two-year, five-interview survey data aggregated into this file is designed to be representative of two years' worth of medical behavior of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population over the period specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h114/h114doc.shtml |title=MEPS HC-114: MEPS Panel 11 Longitudinal Data File |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household Component Event Files===
The eight event-level files generally contain one record per event, and contain various information pertaining to the specific type of event.  Each record contains one or more [[ICD-9]] codes to describe and categorize the type of medical encounter experienced by the surveyed individual.  The event-level files also contain the breakdown of spending by payor associated with the event and a date (or start and end dates) that the event took place.  Each of these event files can be joined with the person-level files in a many-to-one match (on DUPERSID), where an individual with zero medical events during the calendar year would generate zero matches, but an individual with two doctor visits and a dental visit would generate three matches across all of the event files.  The event-level files can also be joined with the condition files (on CONDIDX) to determine what medical expenditure can be associated with particular conditions.  The eight files include:

* The Prescribed Medicines files (released annually in October) – This file contains one household-reported prescribed medicine purchase during the calendar year.  Prescription purchases are then verified by the prescribing pharmacy.  In addition to the expenditure information, this file contains characteristics of the medication, such as the [[National Drug Code]] (NDC) identifier, the drug name, and the Multum Lexicon category.  Prescribed medical events may be more difficult to analyze, since the strength of the drug and quantity purchased may vary, despite two separate prescription-events being the same chemical substance.  Prescribed medical events may also be more difficult to analyze, since, unlike other recorded medical events, a pharmacy encounter does not guarantee that the medication has been administered (i.e. that the patient stuck to his or her drug regiment).  This file should be thought of as containing one record per [[pharmacy]] encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h110a/h110adoc.shtml |title=MEPS HC-110A: 2007 Prescribed Medicines |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date=2007-12-31 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Dental Visits files (released annually in August) – The file contains one record for each [[Dentistry|dental]] visit during the calendar year.  It includes dental-specific information such as the type of provider seen, if the visit was due to an accident, reason for the dental event, and any medication was prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h110b/h110bdoc.shtml |title=MEPS HC-110B: 2007 Dental Visits |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is commonly the subject of analysis in articles on health policy and health services in research journals such as [[Health Affairs]], [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]], Health Services Research, and the [[New England Journal of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Medical+Expenditure+Panel+Survey%22+AND+(JAMA+OR+%22Health+Affairs%22+OR+NEJM+OR+%22Health+Services+Research%22)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart|title="Medical Expenditure Panel Survey" AND (JAMA OR "Health Affairs" OR NEJM OR "Health Services Research") – Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Noninstitutionalized civilian Americans (both citizens and non-citizens) are sampled at the household, allowing for analyses of medical behavior at the family-level as well as the individual-level.  Each year, households containing a total of approximately 15,000 individuals are sub-sampled from the [[National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|National Health Interview Survey]]'s two year panel.  These individuals are then followed with five in-person interviews (rounds) over the course of two years during which a complete demographic profile is collected, all medical encounters are documented, and patient-reported subjective questions regarding topics like satisfaction with care are obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/publications/mr1/mr1.shtml |title=Methodology Report #1: Design and Methods of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component |website=Meps.ahrq.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEPS employs a complex survey sample design in order to oversample certain population groups of interest; this survey design must be accounted for (using either the Taylor Series Linearization method or the [[Balanced repeated replication]] method) to appropriately calculate the standard errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/survey_comp/standard_errors.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813000433/http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/survey_comp/standard_errors.jsp |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10183">The '''Movable Book Society''' (MBS) is a nonprofit organization which provides a forum for artists, book sellers, book producers, collectors, curators, and others to share enthusiasm and exchange information about [[Pop-up_book|pop-up and movable books]]. The Society has nearly 450 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Movable Book Society|url=http://www.movablebooksociety.org|website=www.movablebooksociety.org|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1993, Rutgers University librarian Ann R. Montanaro  published ''Pop-up and Movable Books: A Bibliography''. The volume of correspondences from collectors who purchased the book convinced Montanaro that there was abundant interest in movable books to form an organization of collectors, and thus she founded The Movable Book Society later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montanaro|first1=Ann R.|title=Pop-up and movable books : a bibliography|date=1993|publisher=Scarecrow|location=Metuchen, N.J.|isbn=081082650X|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hiebert|first1=Helen|title=Playing with pop-ups : the art of dimensional, moving paper designs|date=2014|publisher=Quarry Books|isbn=1592539084|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBS hosts opportunities for members to meet in person and publishes a quarterly newsletter.

==Publications==
'''''Movable Stationery''''':
Movable Stationery is a quarterly publication featuring articles about movable and pop-up book history and collecting, surveys and reviews of new titles, information about exhibits, workshops and profiles of collectors and paper engineers. Digitized back issues (1993 – 2013) are available from the Smithsonian Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movable Stationery Newsletter|url=http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/movable-stationery|website=Smithonsonian Libraries|publisher=The Movable Book Society|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brooklyn Pops Up''''':
In 2000, the MBS and the Brooklyn Public Library created an exhibit called “Brooklyn Pops Up! The History and Art of the Movable Book” and published ''Brooklyn Pops Up'', a pop-up book featuring eight Brooklyn landmarks designed by paper engineers such as [[David A. Carter]], Carla Dijs, [[Bruce Foster]], Kees Moerbeek, Robert Sabuda, Ken Wilson-Max and others. Maurice Sendak did the cover art which was made movable by Matthew Reinhart. Brooklyn Pops Up is in its 5th printing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brooklyn pops up|date=2000|publisher=Little Simon|location=New York|isbn=0689840195|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Consueta 1709.JPG|thumb|280px|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of the 1709 ''Consueta'', or manuscript of the ''Misteri'' that contains the dialogue and score.]]

The '''''Misterio de Elche'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=es&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00018 El misterio de Elche] - ''UNESCO''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-es|misˈteɾjo ˈðe ˈeltʃe|es}}), in English the '''''Mystery Play of Elche'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00018 Mystery play of Elche] - ''UNESCO''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Elche Mystery Play''''' and in Catalan '''''Misteri d'Elx''''' ({{IPA-ca|misˈtɛɾi ˈðɛʎtʃ|va}}), is a [[liturgical drama]] from the [[Middle Ages]] that reenacts  the [[Dormition]] and [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. 

The two-act [[mystery play]] is performed annually on 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elche]]. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] declared it one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].

==Origins==
Two stories exist regarding the date of creation of the ''Misteri d'Elx''. The older account, which placed its origin in the 13th century, was put forth by Cristobal Sanz in his history of the city written at the beginning of the 17th century. After confessing that he was unable to prove his history, he proposed that the earliest inhabitants of the city had celebrated it in 1276. He also adds another older story: after the conquest of the city by [[James I of Aragon|James I the Conqueror]] in 1265, the inhabitants of the city conceived the idea of a [[mystery play]] on the day the city was retaken from the [[Moors]]. 

In 1717, José Antón, Attorney General of the Marquisate of Elche, also supported the theory and added a miraculous element: the arrival on the beaches of Elche of a mysterious ark in May 1266. The box contained the image of the Virgin of the Assumption that is today enshrined in the basilica and the ''Consueta'', a document containing the script and occasionally the music of the play. This story was maintained in part to excuse a possible mistake of the composer, [[Óscar Esplá]] (1886–1976), who asserted that in 1924, he had been shown a letter of 1266 authorizing the play. This letter was allegedly preserved in the Municipal Archives of Elche, despite the fact that it has never been seen since or even cited. The work carried out by Esplá, and his importance as a composer, revived the theory of the play's origin in the 13th century.

Since the end of the 19th century when historians first arrived at Elche and studied the play, the date of its composition was given a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' sometime around the turn of 15th century. At present, most scholars from  multiple disciplines (literary, theatrical, musical, linguistics, iconographic, etc.) agree to it composition in the latter half of the 15th century, without emphasizing any precedents in existence in the city.

==Scene==
The play is performed within the Basilica, and the stage comprises several areas and devices:

===The Heaven===
The great linen, located at the height of the ring of the basilica's dome, fulfills the double function of representing the sky and concealing mechanisms that permit the ascent and descent of aerial stage devices. It is possibly as old as the current play, since older stage directions from as early as 1530 already seem to indicate its presence.

The linen acts as a divider between celestial and earthly actions, and possesses a peephole towards the choir called the "Door to Heaven". The Door is a square aperture that is opened and closed three times during the play in order to admit aerial stage devices.

===''La Magrana''===
[[Image:Misterio de Elche, La Mangrana.JPG|thumb|300px|''La Magrana'' partway through the Door to Heaven during ''La Vespra''.]]
This aerial device, called ''la magrana'' ("the [[pomegranate]]"), transports the first Angel who delivers the golden palm frond to Mary, and shows her the way to heaven. In its current form, the device dates the second half of the 16th century. Both its structure and its name are reminiscent of period mechanisms commonly used in Spain, such as [[Decorative boxes|boxes]], [[globe]]s, and [[armillary sphere]]s.

Until recently, the term “pomegranate” was thought to be quite modern, with the term “cloud” considered to be more ancient and correct. This was thought to have been the result of the device's supposedly having changed in colour from an older blue to red. Modern research, however, suggests that the name was already used in the 16th century, possibly because the current, more compact and sturdy device replaced a less substantial structure made of cotton, paper, and fabric.

===The Araceli===
The Araceli is the second aerial device to appear, and enters the scene on two occasions. It is first used by five angels who fetch Mary’s soul (in the form of a statuette) to Heaven; four of the angels sing as the central angel (often a priest) bears the Virgin’s spirit. They appear to the Apostles, who organize a procession to bury her body. Its second appearance is in the great finale, where the fifth angel with Mary's soul is replaced by the full image of Mary. This image is taken into the ceiling and is crowned by the [[Holy Trinity]] at the halfway point of its ascension.

The Araceli is not a statue unique to the mystery play. It is similar to sculptures made at the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th.

===''Cadafal''=== 
This is the platform on which much of the drama takes place. Roughly square in shape and covered in wood, it is raised to conceal the hollow that it contains. There is where some aerial devices descend, where actors change costumes, or disappear into. It is located under the dome and the Heaven, but extends in part into the choir to connect the Sepulchre with the shaft of the Door of Heaven. 

In [[Elche]], the ''Cadafal'' is, in words of Quirante Santacruz, "Mary's area, which contains the places that are hers exclusively, her house and her tomb. Here, the Virgin experiences all the process of sacralization and glorification that contains the work, it is the only place where celestial personages and earthly people live together".

The term "''cadafal''" appears early on in the first reports of mystery plays staged within of churches with an invariable meaning: dais or platform where the dramatic action takes place.

===The Corridor===
This is the great ramp built on top of the Basilica’s main aisle. It rises from the principal door to the ''Cadafal''; two small bays to the each side at the point where it joins the latter provide seating for three [[laity|lay]] organisers and the priest overseeing the play.

Its importance is largely symbolic, primarily because it is the only physical element that converts the entire church into a framework for dramatic actions. Secondarily, the walkway is the road that permits communication between the earthly and the divine, and represents the spiritual road that everyone travels.

During the play, the actor playing Mary also travels this path, from the door to the ''Cadafal'', symbolising her total achievement of the Christian ideal of uniting with the Christ through his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].

==Music==
The music for the play is contained in the '''''Consueta''''', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''Consuetudine'' and ''Ordinatio''. These manuscripts of the liturgical ceremonies, which contain precious annotations on stage directions, musical score, and stage devices, date from as early as 1625.

==Performances==
===Normal===
August 14 is when the first act, known as ''La Vesprà'' ("The Vigil") is performed. As it is the eve of the Feast of the Assumption, it recounts the final hours and [[Death of the Virgin]], when her soul is brought to Heaven leaving her corpse surrounded by the grieving Apostles. 

August 15 is when the second act, known as ''La Festa'' ("The Feast") is staged. It focuses on the burial, Assumption and [[Coronation of Mary|Coronation]] of the Virgin. It begins at 10 o'clock with "''El Soterrar''" ("The Interment"): this portion takes place in the streets outside the basilica, with a procession of the image of the dead Virgin, the actors, and bands playing songs of ''La Festa''.

====Preparations====
In the weeks leading to the staging of the ''Misteri'', several preparatory events occur.

On August 6, in the Room of the Council, "''la prova de veus''" ("the test of voices") takes place, to select those who will sing in the ''Misteri''. This shows that Elche’s City Council, and not the Church, financially supports the play.

At 6 o'clock in the evening of August 10, "''La prova de l'àngel''" ("the test of the angel") is conducted inside the basilica. This is when organizers identify children resistant to dizziness and are thus fit to descend and ascend on the aerial stage devices.

===Extraordinary===
On the 11th, 12th and 13th of August, the so-called "''Assajos generals''" or extraordinary representations, take place.

'''Natural Justice: Lawyers for Communities and the Environment''' is a non-profit organisation based in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], with additional offices in Malaysia, India, and New York City. It takes its name from the legal principle of [[natural justice]] and it works at the local level to legally empower communities to pursue social and [[environmental justice]]. It also works at the national and international levels to promote the full and effective implementation of [[environmental law]]s and policies such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int |title=CBD Home |publisher=Cbd.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural Justice has been developing a process and tool known as community protocols&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturaljustice.org.za/images/stories/natural_justice/nj-a4bcp-book-pdf%5B1%5Dfinal%20for%20circulation.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enable communities to understand the laws and policies that affect them, particularly those developed by government and industry without consultation. Protocols help communities illustrate their biological, cultural and spiritual resources, norms and values and assert their existing rights under local [[customary law|customary]], domestic and international laws. Such protocols have been developed with several indigenous and local communities in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] in order to ensure the continued practise of their customary ways of life that contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of [[biodiversity]], in line with the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.

Community protocols are gaining recognition in international negotiations on access and benefit-sharing of genetic resources &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/abs/ |title=The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing |publisher=Cbd.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ([[REDD]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/blog/2009/12/16/the-pitfalls-of-saving-the-rainforest/ |title=The Pitfalls of ‘Saving’ the Rainforest – State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; endogenous development practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compasnet.org/discussion_1.html |title=COMPAS network for Endogenous Development - motion for debate |publisher=Compasnet.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[traditional medicine|traditional health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-30/bangalore/28102844_1_traditional-medicine-traditional-healers-ayush |title=Traditional healing gets a big boost |publisher=The Times of India |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28072">'''Panopticism''' is a [[social theory]] named after the [[Panopticon]], originally developed by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] in his book ''[[Discipline and Punish]].'' The "panopticon" refers to an experimental laboratory of power in which behaviour could be modified, and Foucault viewed the panopticon as a symbol of the disciplinary society of surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

[[Jeremy Bentham]] proposed the [[panopticon]] as a circular building with an observation tower in the centre of an open space surrounded by an outer wall.  This wall would contain cells for occupants.  This design would increase security by facilitating more effective [[surveillance]].  Residing within cells flooded with light, occupants would be readily distinguishable and visible to an official invisibly positioned in the central tower.  Conversely, occupants would be invisible to each other, with concrete walls dividing their cells. Due to the bright lighting emitted from the watch tower, occupants would not be able to tell if and when they are being watched, making discipline a passive rather than an active action. Strangely, the cell-mates act in matters as if they are being watched, though they cannot be certain eyes are actually on them. There is a type of invisible discipline that reigns through the prison, for each prisoner self-regulates, in fear that someone is watching their every move. Although usually associated with [[prison]]s, the panoptic style of architecture might be used in other institutions with surveillance needs, such as schools, factories, or hospitals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Foucault's ''Discipline and Punish'' ==

In ''Discipline and Punish'', Michel Foucault builds on Bentham's conceptualization of the panopticon as he elaborates upon the function of disciplinary mechanisms in such a prison and illustrates the function of discipline as an apparatus of power.  The ever-visible inmate, Foucault suggests, is always "the object of information, never a subject in communication".&lt;ref name = cartome&gt;{{cite web |title = Part Three: Discipline 3. Panopticism |publisher= Cartome |url= http://www.cartome.org/foucault.htm |accessdate= 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection" (202-203).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault offers still another explanation for the type of "anonymous power" held by the operator of the central tower, suggesting that, "We have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the central tower the functions of surveillance, and that this being the case, he can gain a clear idea of the way the surveillance is practiced".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. Discipline and Punishment. Vintage Books, New York: 1995., p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  By including the anonymous "public servant," as part of the built-in "architecture" of surveillance, the disciplinary mechanism of observation is decentered and its efficacy improved.

As hinted at by the architecture, this panoptic design can be used for any "population" that needs to be kept under observation or control, such as: prisoners, schoolchildren, medical patients, or workers: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If the inmates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of contagion; if they are madmen there is no risk of their committing violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those distractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or cause accidents".&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By individualizing the subjects and placing them in a state of constant visibility, the efficiency of the institution is maximized. Furthermore, it guarantees the function of power, even when there is no one actually asserting it. It is in this respect that the Panopticon functions automatically. Foucault goes on to explain that this design is also applicable for a laboratory. Its mechanisms of individualization and observation give it the capacity to run many experiments simultaneously. These qualities also give an authoritative figure the "ability to penetrate men’s behavior" without difficulty.&lt;ref name = cartome/&gt; This is all made possible through the ingenuity of the geometric architecture.  In light of this fact Foucault compares jails, schools, and factories in their structural similarities.

== Examples in the late 20th and early 21st centuries ==

A central idea of Foucault’s panopticism concerns the systematic ordering and controlling of human populations through subtle and often unseen forces.  Such ordering is apparent in many parts of the modernized and now, increasingly digitalized, world of information.  Contemporary advancements in technology and surveillance techniques have perhaps made Foucault’s theories more pertinent to any scrutiny of the relationship between the state and its population.

However, while on one hand, new technologies, such as CCTV or other surveillance cameras, have shown the continued utility of panoptic mechanisms in liberal democracies, it could also be argued that electronic surveillance technologies are unnecessary in the original "organic" or "geometric" disciplinary mechanisms as illustrated by Foucault.  Foucault argues, for instance, that [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s Panopticon provides us with a model in which a self-disciplined society has been able to develop. These apparatuses of behavior control are essential if we are to govern ourselves, without the constant surveillance and intervention by an "agency" in every aspect of our lives. The Canadian historian [[Robert Gellately]] has observed, for instance, that because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the [[Gestapo]] that Germany between 1933-45 was a prime example of Panopticism.&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert ''The Gestapo and German Society'', Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1990 pages 11-12 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Panoptic theory has other wide-ranging impacts for surveillance in the digital era as well.  Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson, for instance, have hinted that technological surveillance "solutions" have a particularly "strong cultural allure" in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly visible data, made accessible to organizations and individuals from new [[Data mining|data-mining]] technologies, has led to the proliferation of “[[dataveillance]],” which may be described as a mode of surveillance that aims to single out particular transactions through routine [[algorithm]]ic production.  In some cases, however, particularly in the case of mined credit card information, dataveillance has been documented to have led to a greater incidence of errors than past surveillance techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Richard V. Ericson and Kevin D. Haggerty, "The new politics of surveillance and visibility," University of Toronto Press, 2006., p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tenets of Foucault's panopticism, if discursive mechanisms can be effectively employed to control and/or modify the body of discussion within a particular space (usually to the benefit of a particular governing class or organization), then there is no longer any need for an "active agent" to display a more overtly coercive power (i.e., the threat of violence).  Since the beginning of the [[Information Age]], there exists a debate over whether these mechanisms are being refined or accelerated, or on the other hand, becoming increasingly redundant, due to new and rapid technological advancements.

== Panopticism and capitalism ==

Foucault also relates panopticism to capitalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The] peculiarity of the disciplines [elements of Panopticism] is that they try to define in relation to the multiplicities a tactics of power that fulfils three criteria: firstly, to obtain the exercise of power at the lowest possible cost (economically, by the low expenditure it involves; politically, by its discretion, its low exteriorization, its relative invisibility, the little resistance it arouses); secondly, to bring the effects of this social power to their maximum intensity and to extend them as far as possible, without either failure or interval; thirdly, to link this 'economic' growth of power with the output of the apparatuses (educational, military, industrial or medical) within which it is exercised; in short, to increase both the docility and the utility of all elements of the system" (218).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the economic take-off of the West began with the techniques that made possible the accumulation of capital, it might perhaps be said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men made possible a political take-off in relation to the traditional, ritual, costly, violent forms of power [i.e. torture, public executions, corporal punishment, etc. of the middle ages], which soon fell into disuse and were superseded by a subtle, calculated technology of subjection. In fact, the two processes - the accumulation of men and the accumulation of capital - cannot be separated; it would not be possible to solve the problem of the accumulation of men without the growth of an apparatus of production capable of both sustaining them and using them; conversely, the techniques that made the cumulative multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital ... The growth of the capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of disciplinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting forces and bodies, in short, 'political anatomy', could be operated in the most diverse political régimes, apparatuses or institutions" (220-221).&lt;ref name="Foucault, Michel 1995"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Panopticism and information technology ==

Building onto Foucault's Panopticism and Bentham's original Panopticon, [[Shoshana Zuboff]] applies the Panoptical theory in a technological context in her book, "In the Age of the Smart Machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=315–361|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter nine, Zuboff provides a very vivid portrayal of the Information Panopticon as a means of surveillance, discipline and, in some cases, punishment in a work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=326|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Information Panopticon embodies Bentham's idea in a very different way. Information Panopticons do not rely on physical arrangements, such as building structures and direct human supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=322|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a computer keeps track of a worker’s every move by assigning him or her specific tasks to perform during their shift. Everything, from the time a task is started to the time it is completed, is recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=331|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are given a certain amount of time to complete the task based on its complexity. All this is monitored by supervision from a computer. Based on the data, the supervisor can monitor a worker’s performance and take any necessary action when needed.

The Information Panopticon can be defined as a form of centralized power that uses information and communication technology as observational tools and control mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolar|first=Jeff|title=Business as Usual: The Information Panopticon and the Workplace|url=http://www.hastac.org/blogs/jeffkolar/business-usual-information-panopticon-and-workplace|work=Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Panopticon envisioned by Bentham and Foucault, in which those under surveillance were unwilling subjects, Zuboff’s work suggests that the Information Panopticon is facilitated by the benefits it offers to willing participants.

In chapter ten of “In the Age of the Smart Machine,” Zuboff provides the example of DIALOG, a computer conferencing system used at a pharmaceutical corporation in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=364|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferencing system, originally intended to facilitate communication among the corporation’s many branches, quickly became popular with employees. Users of DIALOG found that the system facilitated not only innovation and collaboration, but also relaxation, as many employees began to use the system to joke with one another and discuss non-work related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=377|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees widely reported that using the system was a positive experience because it created a culture of shared information and discussion, which transcended the corporation’s norms of formality and hierarchy that limited the spread of information between divisions and employees of different ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=368|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positive culture was enabled by the privacy seemingly offered by the conferencing system, as discussion boards could be made to allow access only to those who were invited to participate.&lt;ref name="Zuboff 1988 364"/&gt; The Panoptic function of the conferencing system was revealed, however, when managers were able to gain access to the informal discussion boards where employees posted off-color jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=378|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messages from the discussion were posted around the office to shame contributors, and many of DIALOG’s users, now knowing there was a possibility that their contributions could be read by managers and fearing they would face disciplinary action, stopped using the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=380|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, however, kept using the system, raising the question of whether remaining users modified their behavior under the threat of surveillance, as prisoners in Bentham’s Panopticon would, or whether they believed that the benefits offered by the system outweighed the possibility of punishment.

Zuboff’s work shows the dual nature of the Information Panopticon – participants may be under surveillance, but they may also use the system to conduct surveillance of others by monitoring or reporting other users’ contributions. This is true of many other information and communication technologies with Panoptic functions – cellphone owners may be tracked without their knowledge through the phones’ GPS capabilities, but they may also use the device to conduct surveillance of others. Thus, compared to Bentham’s Panopticon, the Information Panopticon is one in which everyone has the potential to be both a prisoner and a guard.

It is argued by Foucault that [[industrial management]] has paved the way for a very disciplinary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=319|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A society that values objectivity over everything else. The point of this is to get as much productivity from the workers as possible. Contrasting with Bentham's model prison, workers within the Information Panopticon know they are being monitored at all times. Even if a supervisor is not physically there, the computer records their every move and all this data is at the supervisor's finger tips at all times. The system's objectivity can have a psychological impact on the workers. Workers feel the need to conform and satisfy the system rather than doing their best work or expressing concerns they might have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=342|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Information Panopticon diverts from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s model prison by adding more levels of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=337–341|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Bentham's model prison system is made up of inmates at the lowest level monitored by a guard, the Information Panopticon can have various levels. A company or firm can have various satellite locations, each monitored by a supervisor, and then a regional supervisor monitoring the supervisors below him or her. Depending on the structure and size of a firm, information Panopticons can have several levels, each monitoring all the levels beneath it.

Now, the efficiency of the Information Panopticon is in question. Does it really lead to a better work place and higher productivity, or does it simply put unnecessary stress on the people being monitored? A major criticism of the system is its objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|page=360|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is solely based on numbers, therefore not allowing for human error. According to Zuboff, some people find the system to be highly advantageous, while others think it is very flawed because it does not account for the effort a worker puts into a task or things outside of a worker's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=In the age of the smart machine: the future of work and power|date=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465032112|pages=351–353|url=http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/books/in-the-age-of-the-smart-machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the lack of direct supervision only adds to a potentially precarious situation.

== Post-panopticism ==

Theoretical arguments in favor of rejecting the Foucauldian model of Panopticism may be considered under five general headings:&lt;ref name=Boyne&gt;Boyne, Roy (2000). Post-Panopticism, Economy and Society, 29:2, 285-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Displacement of the Panoptical ideal by mechanisms of seduction,
# Redundancy of the Panoptical impulse brought about by the evident durability of the self-surveillance functions which partly constitute the normal, socialized, ‘Western’ subject,
# Reduction in the number of occasions of any conceivable need for Panoptical surveillance on account of simulation, prediction and action before the fact,
# Supplementation of the Panopticon by the Synopticon,
# Failure of Panoptical control to produce reliably docile subjects.

The first point concerns [[Zygmunt Bauman]]’s argument that the leading principle of social order has moved from Panopticism to seduction.  This argument is elaborated in his 1998 essay ‘On postmodern uses of sex’.&lt;ref name= Bauman&gt;Bauman, Z. (1998) Globalization: The Human Consequences, Cambridge: Polity.—— 1999 ‘On postmodern uses of sex’, in Mike Featherstone (ed.) Love and Eroticism, London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second argument concerns surveillance redundance, and it is increasingly relevant in the age of [[Facebook]] and online self-disclosure.  Is the metaphor of a panopticon appropriate for voluntary surrender of privacy?{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The third argument for post-Panopticism, concerning action before the fact, is articulated by William Bogard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The figure of the Panopticon is already haunted by a parallel figure of simulation.  Surveillance, we are told, is discreet, unobtrusive, camouflaged, unverifiable – all elements of artifice designed into an architectural arrangement of spaces to produce real effects of discipline. Eventually this will lead, by its means of perfection, to the elimination of the Panopticon itself . . . surveillance as its own simulation. Now it is no longer a matter of the speed at which information is gained to defeat an enemy. . . . Now, one can simulate a space of control, project an indefinite number of courses of action, train for each possibility, and react immediately with pre-programmed responses to the actual course of events . . . with simulation, sight and foresight, actual and virtual begin to merge. . . . Increasingly the technological enlargement of the field of perceptual control, the erasure of distance in the speed of electronic information has pushed surveillance beyond the very limits of speed toward the purest forms of anticipation.&lt;ref name=Bogard&gt;Bogard, W. (1996). The Simulation of Surveillance, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This kind of anticipation is particularly evident in emergent surveillance technologies such as [[social network analysis]].

The ‘Synopticon’ concerns the surveillance of the few by the many.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen&gt;Mathiesen, T. (1997) ‘The viewer society’, Theoretical Criminology 1(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this kind of surveillance may include the theatre, the Coliseum, and celebrity tabloid reporting.  This “reversal of the Panoptical polarity may have become so marked that it finally deconstructs the Panoptical metaphor altogether”.&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

Finally, the fifth point concerns the self-defeating nature of Panoptical regimes.  The failure of surveillance states is illustrated by examples such as “prison riots, asylum sub-cultures, ego survival in Gulag or concentration camp, [and] retribalization in the Balkans.”&lt;ref name=Boyne /&gt;

In their 2007 article, Dobson and Fisher&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher&gt;Dobson, J. E., and P. F. Fisher. 2007. The Panopticon's changing geography. Geographical Review 97 (3): 307-323.&lt;/ref&gt; lay out an alternative model of post-panopticism as they identify three panoptic models.  Panopticism I refers to [[Jeremy Bentham]]’s original conceptualization of the panopticon, and is it the model of panopticism that Foucault responds to in his 1975 [[Discipline and Punish]].  Panopticism II refers to an [[Orwellian]] ‘Big Brother’ ideal of surveillance.  Panopticism III, the final model of panopticism, refers to the high-technology human tracking systems that are emergent in this 21st century.  These [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) include technologies such as cellphone GPS, [[RFID]]s (radio-frequency identification tags), and [[geo-fence]]s.  Panopticism III is also distinguished by its costs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Panopticon III is affordable, effective, and available to anyone who wants to use it. Initial purchase prices and monthly service fees are equivalent to cell-phone costs. In less than five years, the cost of continuous surveillance of a single individual has dropped from several hundred thousand dollars per year to less than $500 per year. Surveillance formerly justified solely for national security and high-stakes commerce is readily available to track a spouse, child, parent, employee, neighbor, or stranger.&lt;ref name=Dobson_Fisher /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Cornell University]] professor and information theorist Branden Hookway introduced the concept of a Panspectrons in 2000: an evolution of the panopticon to the effect that it does not define an object of surveillance more, but everyone and everything is monitored. The object is defined only in relation to a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1363/1282 | title=Tactical memory: The politics of openness in the construction of memory| journal=First Monday| volume=11| issue=7| date=2006-07-03| last1=Braman| first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paris School (Security Studies)|Paris School]] academic [[Didier Bigo]] coined the term [[Banopticon|'Banopticon']] to describe a situation where profiling technologies are used to determine who to place under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Bigo, Didier (2006), "Security, Exception, Ban and Surveillance.", in Lyon, David, ''Theorizing Surveillance.

[[File:Tie-dye.png|thumb|right200px|A swirling psychedelic pattern]]
'''Psychedelic art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of psychoactive drugs such as [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[psilocybin]]. The word "psychedelic" (coined by British psychologist [[Humphry Osmond]]) means "mind manifesting".  By that definition, all artistic efforts to depict the inner world of the psyche may be considered "psychedelic".  In common parlance "psychedelic art" refers above all to the art movement of the late [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].  Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock music]].  Concert posters, album covers, [[liquid light shows]], liquid light art, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected not only the kaleidoscopically swirling colour patterns of LSD hallucinations,  but also revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by insights derived from these psychedelic states of consciousness.

==Origins==
Psychedelic art is informed by the notion that altered states of consciousness produced by psychedelic drugs are a source of artistic inspiration.  The psychedelic art movement is similar to the surrealist movement in that it prescribes a mechanism for obtaining inspiration.  Whereas the mechanism for surrealism is the observance of dreams, a psychedelic artist turns to drug induced hallucinations.  Both movements have strong ties to important developments in science.  Whereas the surrealist was fascinated by Freud's theory of the unconscious, the psychedelic artist has been literally "turned on" by [[Albert Hofmann]]'s discovery of LSD.

The early examples of "psychedelic art" are literary rather than visual, although there are some examples in the [[Surrealist art]] movement, such as [[Remedios Varo]] and [[André Masson]]. It should also be noted that these came from writers involved in the Surrealist movement.  [[Antonin Artaud]] writes of his peyote experience in ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara'' (1937).  [[Henri Michaux]] wrote ''[[Misérable Miracle]]'' (1956), to describe his experiments with [[mescaline]] and also [[hashish]].

[[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (1954) and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1956) remain definitive statements on the psychedelic experience.

Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD.  For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research.  Hofmann saw the drug's potential for  poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer [[Ernst Jünger]]'s psychedelic experiments.

Early artistic experimentation with LSD was conducted in a clinical context by Los Angeles–based psychiatrist [[Oscar Janiger]].  Janiger asked a group of 50 different artists to each do a painting from life of a subject of the artist's choosing. They were subsequently asked to do the same painting while under the influence of LSD.  The two paintings were compared by Janiger and also the artist.  The artists almost unanimously reported LSD to be an enhancement to their creativity.

Ultimately it seems that psychedelics would be most warmly embraced by the American counterculture.  Beatnik poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] became fascinated by psychedelic drugs as early as the 1950s as evidenced by ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' (1963). The Beatniks recognized the role of psychedelics as sacred inebriants in Native American religious ritual, and also had an understanding of the philosophy of the surrealist and symbolist poets who called for a "complete disorientation of the senses" (to paraphrase [[Arthur Rimbaud]]).  They knew that altered states of consciousness played a role in Eastern Mysticism. They were hip to psychedelics as psychiatric medicine.  LSD was the perfect catalyst to electrify the eclectic mix of ideas assembled by the Beats into a cathartic, mass-distributed panacea for the soul of the succeeding generation.

==In 1960s counterculture==
[[File:San Francisco Oracle Cover Vol.1 No.5, January 1967.jpg|thumb|Cover of the San Francisco Oracle, Volume 1 No.5, January 1967.]]
Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as: [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their psychedelic rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The "Fillmore Posters" were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to vinyl record album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers.

Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally: British artist [[Bridget Riley]] became famous for her op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns creating optical illusions. [[Mati Klarwein]] created psychedelic masterpieces for [[Miles Davis|Miles Davis']] Jazz-Rock fusion albums, and also for [[Carlos Santana]] Latin Rock.  [[Pink Floyd]] worked extensively with London-based designers, [[Hipgnosis]] to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums. Willem de Ridder created cover art for Van Morrison. Los Angeles area artists such as [[John Van Hamersveld]], [[Warren Dayton]] and Art Bevacqua and New York artists [[Peter Max]] and [[Milton Glaser]] all produced posters for concerts or social commentary (such as the anti-war movement) that were highly collected during this time. Life Magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the [[Summer of Love]] focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the [[hippie]] counterculture community.

Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion  that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely "trippy" atmosphere for the audience.  The Brotherhood of Light were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.

Out of the psychedelic counterculture also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  "Zap Comix" was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], Victor Moscoso, [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.  [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, "The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]", whose drugged out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

Psychedelic art was also applied to the LSD itself.  LSD began to be put on blotter paper in the early 1970s and this gave rise to a specialized art form of decorating the blotter paper.  Often the blotter paper was decorated with tiny insignia on each perforated square tab, but by the 1990s this had progressed to complete four color designs often involving an entire page of 900 or more tabs.  Mark McCloud is a recognized authority on the history of LSD blotter art.

==In corporate advertising==
By the late 1960s, the commercial potential of psychedelic art had become hard to ignore. General Electric, for instance, promoted clocks with designs by New York artist Peter Max.  A caption explains that each of Max's clocks "transposes time into multi-fantasy colors."&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; In this and many other corporate advertisements of the late 1960s featuring psychedelic themes, the psychedelic product was often kept at arm's length from the corporate image: while advertisements may have reflected the swirls and colors of an LSD trip, the black-and-white company logo maintained a healthy visual distance. Several companies, however, more explicitly associated themselves with psychedelica: CBS, Neiman Marcus, and NBC all featured thoroughly psychedelic advertisements between 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''68/69 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1968. pgs. 45, 75, 248&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, Campbell's soup ran a poster promotion that promised to "Turn your wall souper-delic!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''60s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2002. pg. 798&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The art of peter max.jpg|thumb|The Art Of Peter Max]]

The early years of the 1970s saw advertisers using psychedelic art to sell a limitless array of consumer goods. Hair products, cars, cigarettes, and even pantyhose became colorful acts of pseudo-rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pgs. 443, 102, 76, 85, 484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chelsea National Bank commissioned a psychedelic landscape by Peter Max, and neon green, pink, and blue monkeys inhabited advertisements for a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pgs. 39, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A fantasy land of colorful, swirling, psychedelic bubbles provided the perfect backdrop for a Clearasil ad.&lt;ref&gt;Herdeg, Walter. ''71/72 Graphics Annual''. Zürich: The Graphics Press, 1971. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Brian Wells explains, "The psychedelic movement has, through the work of artists, designers, and writers, achieved an astonishing degree of cultural diffusion… but, though a great deal of diffusion has taken place, so, too, has a great deal of dilution and distortion."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Even the term "psychedelic" itself underwent a semantic shift, and soon came to mean "anything in youth culture which is colorful, or unusual, or fashionable."&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Brian. ''Psychedelic Drugs''. New York: Jason Aronson, 1974. pgs. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; Puns using the concept of "tripping" abounded: as an advertisement for London Britches declared, their product was "great on trips!"&lt;ref&gt;Heimann, Jim. ''70s All-American Ads''. Cologne: Taschen, 2004. pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the psychedelic art movement had been largely co-opted by mainstream commercial forces, incorporated into the very system of capitalism that the hippies had struggled so hard to change.

[[File:Juliasetsdkpictfield3.jpg|thumb|Fractal artwork created using the [[Julia set]]]]
[[Computer art]] has allowed for an even greater and more profuse expression of psychedelic vision.  [[Fractal]] generating software gives an accurate depiction of psychedelic hallucinatory patterns, but even more importantly 2D and 3D graphics software allow for unparalleled freedom of image manipulation.  Much of the graphics software seems to permit a direct translation of the psychedelic vision. The "digital revolution" was indeed heralded early on as the "New LSD" by none other than [[Timothy Leary]].&lt;ref name="Leary, Horowitz &amp; Marshall 1994"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Timothy Leary|Leary, Timothy]]; Horowitz, Michael; Marshall, Vicky| title = Chaos and Cyber Culture| publisher = Ronin Publishing| year = 1994| isbn = 0-914171-77-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruthofer 1997"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Ruthofer, Arno|title = Think for Yourself; Question Authority|    year = 1997 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html  | accessdate=2007-02-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225454/http://www.geocities.com/arno_3/menu.html |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Deep Dream Toast Sandwich.jpg|thumb|350px|[[DeepDream]] modified toast sandwich]]
The rave movement of the 1990s was a psychedelic renaissance fueled by the advent of newly available digital technologies.  The rave movement developed a new graphic art style partially influenced by 1960s psychedelic [[poster art]], but also strongly influenced by graffiti art, and by 1970s advertising art, yet clearly defined by what [[digital art]] and [[computer graphics]] software and home computers had to offer at the time of creation. Conversely, the [[convolutional neural network]] [[DeepDream]] finds and enhance patterns in images purely via algorithmic [[pareidolia]].

Concurrent to the rave movement, and in key respects integral to it, are the development of new mind-altering drugs, most notably, [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy).  Ecstasy, like LSD, has had a tangible influence on culture and [[aesthetics]], particularly the aesthetics of [[Rave|rave culture]].  But MDMA is (arguably) not a real psychedelic, but is described by psychologists as an [[entactogen]].  Development of new psychedelics such as [[2C-B]] and related compounds (developed primarily by chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]]) are truly psychedelic, and these novel psychedelics are fertile ground for artistic exploration since many of the new psychedelics possess their own unique properties that will affect the artist's vision accordingly.

Even as fashions have changed, and art and culture movements have come and gone, certain artists have steadfastly devoted themselves to psychedelia.  Well-known examples are [[Amanda Sage]], [[Alex Grey]], and [[Robert Venosa]].  These artists have developed unique and distinct styles that while containing elements that are "psychedelic", are clearly artistic expressions that transcend simple categorization.  While it is not necessary to use psychedelics to arrive at such a stage of artistic development, serious psychedelic artists are demonstrating that there is tangible technique to obtaining visions, and that technique is the creative use of psychedelic drugs.

The '''''Risen Christ''''', ''Cristo della Minerva'' in Italian, also known as ''Christ the Redeemer'' or ''[[Christ Carrying the Cross]]'', is a marble sculpture by the Italy [[High Renaissance]] master [[Michelangelo]], finished in 1521. It is in the church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in [[Rome]], to the left of the main altar.

The work was commissioned in June 1514, by the Roman patrician Metello Vari, who stipulated only that the nude standing figure would have the Cross in his arms, but left the composition entirely to Michelangelo.{{sfn|Baldriga|2000|p=740|ps=: ''"in quell' attitudine che parrà al detto Michelagnolo"'', }} Michelangelo was working on a first version of this statue in his studio in Macello dei Corvi around 1515, but abandoned it in roughed-out condition when he discovered a black vein in the white marble, remarked upon by Vari in a letter, and later by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]].{{sfn|Baldriga|2000|pp=740-745}} A new version was hurriedly substituted in 1519-1520 to fulfil the terms of the contract. Michelangelo worked on it in [[Florence]], and the move to Rome and final touches were entrusted to an apprentice, [[Pietro Urbano]]; the latter, however, damaged the work and had to be quickly replaced by Federico Frizzi at the suggestion of [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].&lt;ref name="WGA" /&gt;

[[File:Cristo portacroce michelangelo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first version, finished by a later artist.]]
The first version, rough as it was, was asked for by Metello Vari, and given him in January 1522, for the little garden courtyard of his palazzetto near Santa Maria sopra Minerva, ''{{lang|it|come suo grandissimo onore, come fosse d'oro}}'' translated as "As his greatest honor, as if it were of gold", a mark of the esteem in which Michelangelo was held". There it remained, described by Aldrovandi in 1556,{{efn|''in una corticella ovvero un orticello'', "in a little courtyard, or little garden": Aldrovandi, ''Delle Statue antiche, che per tutta Roma, in diversi luoghi, &amp; case si veggono'' (Venice 1556)}} and noted in some contemporary letters as apparently for sale in 1607, following which it was utterly lost to sight. In 2000 Irene Baldriga recognized the lost first version, finished in the early seventeenth century, in the sacristy of the church of San Vincenzo Martire, at [[Bassano Romano]] near [[Viterbo]]; the black vein is clearly distinguishable on Christ's left cheek.{{sfn|Baldriga|2000|pp=740-745}}  It is now often called the '''Giustiniani Christ'''.  The parts finished later are the "right hand, parts of the face and the back".&lt;ref name="M&amp;S" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

Despite all these problems, the second version impressed the contemporaries. [[Sebastiano del Piombo]] declared that the knees alone were worthy of more than the whole Rome, which William Wallace has called "one of the most curious praises ever sung about a work of art"{{sfn |Wallace|1997|p=1251|ps=: "''Perché val più e' zenocchii de quella figura che non val tutta Roma''" quoting Sebastiano}} Christ is shown by Michelangelo unclothed in a standing pose. Christ's sexual organs are exposed in order to show that his sexuality is uncorrupted by lust and completely controlled by his will, so that in his resurrected body he shows his triumph over both sin and death.{{sfn|Steinberg|2014|p=146}} During the [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]] period a bronze floating loincloth was added.

A leg is flexed and the head turned back, according to the principle of ''[[contrapposto]]''.  Compared to the first version, the more active pose allows more varied impressions when the statue is seen from different angles, "not only activating the space around him, but also suggesting an unfolding story".  The first version was exhibited in the [[National Gallery]], London in 2017, in the same room as a cast of the second version, drawings for it, and letter relating to it.&lt;ref name="M&amp;S" /&gt;{{rp|49–55}}

The '''Spur Posse''' was a group of high school boys from [[Lakewood, California]], who used a point system to keep track of and compare their sexual attacks and [[statutory rape]]s, some with girls as young as ten. 

The founder of the group chose the name "Spur Posse" when a favorite basketball player of theirs, [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], signed with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. 

The group came to national attention on March 18, 1993, when the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] arrested a number of the members for various sexual crimes. Prosecutors later dropped all but one of the charges after being unable to prove most of the encounters were nonconsensual, although many were with underage girls, some as young as ten. 

One girl who was later interrogated by police said she had been in bed late one night when a teenager appeared at her window and demanded sex from her. She complied because of rumors that the Spurs would harm women who resisted. {{fact|date=May 2018}}

Police had the opportunity to prosecute the considerably older boys for [[statutory rape]], but declined to do so.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Members of the Spur Posse proceeded to make the rounds on the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]]-TV [[Talk show|talk-show]] circuit.

==In popular culture==
The main villains in the 1999 [[Horror film|horror]] film ''[[The Rage: Carrie 2]]'' were based on the Spur Posse.

They are mentioned in the [[Bratmobile]] song "Brat Girl."

They are mentioned in [[Joan Didion]]'s ''[[Where I Was From]]''.

They are the subject of [[Joan Didion]]'s ''Trouble in Lakewood'', "Letter from California" July 26, 1993 Issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/07/26/trouble-in-lakewood | title=Trouble in Lakewood?| journal=The New Yorker| date=1993-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' based an episode, "[[List of Law &amp; Order episodes (season 5)|Performance]]", on the case.
{{Portal|1990s}}

''[[The X Files]]'' mentions them in an episode, "[[Red Museum]]" with the throw away line "I think the Spur Posse just rode into town."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3037">A '''student managed investment fund''' is a pool of [[money]] which [[business student]]s [[Investment|invest]] as a learning experience.  As of 2008, more than 200 [[universities]] have student-run [[Funding|fund]]s, which vary in size from several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Trejos, Nancy, "U-Md. Students Bring their Real-Money Fund Home to a Surprising Finish, " Washington Post 2008-05-11 Page F1 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/10/AR2008051000197.html?hpid=sec-business&lt;/ref&gt;

The funds to be managed come from various sources, such as gifts from private individuals and corporations, gifts from foundations, and from university endowment or foundation assets. Some student managed [[investment fund]]s such as the [[University of Texas at Austin]] manage funds for private clients, who are [[accredited investor]]s under U.S. securities laws. Another special case is the [[loan]] that proves the funds at [[Cameron University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neely|first1=Walter P.|last2=Cooley|first2=Philip L.|title=A Survey of Student Managed Funds|publisher=ResearchGate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228594658_A_Survey_of_Student_Managed_Funds|date=2003|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some student managed investment funds are organized by function (accounting, public relations, etc.), while others such as the [[Lemma Senbet Fund]] are organized by economic sectors ([[Consumer Products]], [[Energy Industry]], [[Information technology]], etc.).

The business students managing the fund typically take a for-credit course in conjunction with their management duties.  Many of these programs belong to the Association of Student Managed Investment Programs.

In addition to managing a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]], these classes provide related experiences relevant to being a professional [[Asset management|fund manager]].  For example, the CFA Society of Orange County Foundation (CFAOCF) conducts an annual request for proposals competition which allows student teams from local universities to experience first-hand the process that fund managers must go through in order to be allowed to [[Investment management|manage institutional fund]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~smif/SMIF_Home/SMIF_Funding.html|title=CSULB SMIF Funding|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a contrast in vowels|other uses|Tension (disambiguation)}}

In [[phonology]], '''tenseness''' or '''tensing''' is, most broadly, the pronunciation of a sound with greater muscular effort or constriction than is typical.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Peter Hugoe (2014). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics''. Oxford University PRess. p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, tenseness is the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] with narrower mouth width (often, with the tongue being [[raising (phonology)|raised]]) and usually with less [[centralization (phonetics)|centralization]] and longer [[Vowel length|duration]] compared with another vowel,&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Morris (1977). "Tenseness, Vowel Shift, and the Phonology of the Back Vowels in Modern English." ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 8.4. p. 611.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps even causing a [[phonemic contrast]] between the two vowels. The opposite quality of tenseness, in which a vowel is produced as relatively more widened (often lowered), centralized, and shortened is called '''laxness''' or '''laxing'''.

Contrast between vowels on the basis of tenseness is common in many languages, including [[English language|English]]. For example, in most English dialects, ''beet'' and ''bit'' are contrasted by the vowel sound being tense in the first word but not the second; i.e., {{IPAc-en|iː}} (as in ''beet'') is the tense counterpart to the lax {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} (as in ''bit''); the same is true of {{IPAc-en|uː}} (as in ''kook'') versus {{IPAc-en|ʊ}} (as in ''cook''). Unlike most [[distinctive features]], the feature [tense] can be interpreted only relatively, often with a perception of greater tension or pressure in the mouth, which, in a language like English, contrasts between two corresponding vowel types: a '''tense vowel''' and a '''lax vowel'''. An example in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is the letters ''ă'' and ''â'' representing lax vowels, and the letters ''a'' and ''ơ'' representing the corresponding tense vowels. Some languages like Spanish are often considered as having only tense vowels, but since the quality of tenseness is not a phonemic feature in this language, it cannot be applied to describe its vowels in any meaningful way. The term has also occasionally been used to describe contrasts in [[consonant]]s.

==Vowels==
In general, tense vowels are more close (and correspondingly have lower first [[formants]]) than their lax counterparts. Tense vowels are sometimes claimed to be articulated with a more [[advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]] than lax vowels, but this varies, and in some languages, it is the lax vowels that are more advanced, or a single language may be inconsistent between front and back or high and mid vowels (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996, 302–4). The traditional definition, that tense vowels are produced with more "muscular tension" than lax vowels, has not been confirmed by phonetic experiments. Another hypothesis is that lax vowels are more centralized than tense vowels. There are also linguists (Lass 1976, 1-39) who believe that there is no phonetic correlation to the tense–lax opposition.

In many [[Germanic language]]s, such as [[Received Pronunciation|RP English]], [[Standard German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], tense vowels are longer in duration than lax vowels, but in [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Scottish English]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], there is no such correlation.

Germanic languages have lax vowels generally only in closed [[syllable]]s and so they are also called ''[[checked vowel|checked vowels]]''. The tense vowels are called ''[[free vowel|free vowels]]'', as they often occur the end of a syllable.

==Consonants==
Occasionally, tenseness has been used to distinguish pairs of contrasting consonants in languages. [[Korean language|Korean]], for example, has a three-way contrast among stops and affricates; the three series are often transcribed as {{IPA|[p t tɕ k]}} - {{IPA|[pʰ tʰ tɕʰ kʰ]}} - {{IPA|[p͈ t͈ t͈ɕ k͈]}}. The contrast between the {{IPA|[p]}} series and the {{IPA|[p͈]}} series is sometimes said to be a function of tenseness: the former are lax and the latter tense. In this case the definition of "tense" would have to include greater glottal tension; see [[Korean phonology]].

In [[Ewe language|Ewe]], {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are articulated with a strong articulation, {{IPA|[f͈]}} and {{IPA|[v͈]}}, to better distinguish them from weaker {{IPA|/ɸ/}} and {{IPA|/β/}}.

In some dialects of [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], there is a contrast between {{IPA|[l, lʲ, n, nʲ]}} and {{IPA|[ɫˑ, ʎˑ, nˠˑ, ɲˑ]}}. Again, the former set have sometimes been described as lax and the latter set as tense. It is not clear what phonetic characteristics other than greater duration would then be associated with tenseness.

Some researchers have argued that the contrast in [[German language|German]], traditionally described as [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] ({{IPA|[p t k]}} vs. {{IPA|[b d ɡ]}}), is in fact better analyzed as tenseness since the latter set is voiceless in Southern German. German linguists call the distinction [[fortis and lenis]] rather than tense and lax. Tenseness is especially used to explain [[stop consonant]]s of the [[Alemannic German]] dialects because they have two series of them that are identically voiceless and unaspirated. However, it is debated whether the distinction is really a result of different muscular tension and not of [[gemination]].

'''The Economic Survey of the Book Industry''', known informally as '''The Cheney Report''', was a paper written by retired New York banker O.H. Cheney, between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfEsX04jKuUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=ted+striphas+late+age+of+print&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_rft_YvLAhVGeSYKHW9jAzYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Late Age of Print|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned by the [[National Association of Book Publishers]], and later published in 1932. The purpose of the report was to analyze the overall structure of the book publishing industry and to find ways to improve the system as a whole. The report advocated for several revisions to the book publishing industry including standardization of the physical size of books, increasing the number of children reading books in the education system, and constructing more bookstores in more parts of the country in the United States. Cheney also correctly anticipated the increasing demand for more books at the end of the [[Second World War]], and sought to find ways to better distribute them.

The most important contribution of The Cheney Report to the market of American book publishing, and to American culture as a whole, was his insistence on the implementation of a standardized form of communication within the book publishing world. Cheney was the first person to suggest some kind of machine based coding system for the organization of books. While he did not present a specific plan for this machine based coding system in his report, Cheney’s revolutionary ideas helped spur the creation and implementation, several decades later, of the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) that the United States adopted to categorize books.

On the 60th anniversary of The Cheney Report in 1992, Publishers Weekly reprinted the report in full and began to revisit some of the ideas the report originally proposed.

==Reception==
While the ideas presented in the report later helped establish a system as effective as the ISBN, The Cheney Report was not well received at the time of publication. Cheney claimed to have written the report “in the spirit of objective sympathy”, but the report was mostly met with harsh criticism and considered wildly ineffective by most book industry insiders at the time. Many people felt the ideas he proposed were farfetched, while today the idea of a book coding system, like the ISBN, seems completely logical. One of The Cheney Report supporters did give an alternative reading of The Cheney Report in a 1932 edition of [[Publishers Weekly]]:

{{Quote|text="Mr. Cheney was not hired to tell us what fine fellows and wonderful men we are. We must have known something was wrong with us or we wouldn't have ordered any survey...Why spend valuable time now looking at what may be wrong with Mr. Cheney? It would be more profitable for each of us to dig out of the report the mass of useful and interesting information, new information, and the many useful and definite suggestions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxODZ0Q8-HcC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=whats+changed+since+cheney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oWoduyhc01&amp;sig=TV9Xmw7YxNN1tvpT-RBui8vJ06o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtzb_L84vLAhXLQCYKHZmvAEsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Rise of Corporate Publishing and Its Effects on Authorship in Early ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]]|author=[[Publishers Weekly]]|source=January 16th, 1932}}

Almost none of the ideas presented in the report were taken seriously, and it was not until much later in American history that the machine based coding system was invented and implemented. Cheney did not gain much notoriety from this report and the report has largely gone unnoticed in current American culture. Cheney died in 1939 and never got to see his ideas and concepts implemented.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7204">A '''theatrical séance''' is an aspect of [[mentalism]] that purports to give its audiences the feeling of contacting the spirits of the dead, as might be experienced in a successful [[seance|Spiritualist séance]].

Theatrical séances are usually performed in either total or partial darkness to replicate the atmosphere of a traditional [[seance]], to set the mood for the performance, and to hide the methods of the performer. Performance-goers may be treated to a variety of [[mentalism]] demonstrations during a theatrical séance include examples of [[clairvoyance]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], [[precognition]] and [[telekinesis]], in addition to or in preparation of apparent [[mediumship]].

== Popular examples of theatrical séances ==

Theatrical séances are very popular at [[Halloween|Hallowe'en]] and are often offered for fright value. Private magic cabarets may offer this type of performance, including:

The [[Dorothy Dietrich]] and [[Dick Brooks (magician)|Dick Brooks]] Psychic Theater in [[Scranton]] [[Poconos]] offers theatrical séances year round. Its production of "Haunted! Mysteries of THE Beyond!" is one of the longest running performances of its type having started in 2003.  The Fall 2008 issue of the Pennsylvania Pursuits Magazine &lt;ref name="Pennsylvania Pursuits"&gt;{{cite book
  | author = Christen Gruebel
  | title = Pursuits Magazine, Top 10 most Haunted Places
  | year = 2008
  | publisher = Pennsylvania Tourism Office, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
  | issue = Vol 5, Issue 3 
  | pages = 56, 57, 58, 59, 60
}}&lt;/ref&gt; put out by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania picked the location of Psychic Theater at 1433 N. Main Avenue in Scranton, Pennsylvania as one of the 10 most haunted places in Pennsylvania, placing it at number 9.

The [[Houdini Museum]] offers yearly Houdini séances geared specifically toward "contacting [[Houdini]]." The original Houdini séances were done by Houdini's wife Beatrice (Bess) for ten years after Houdini died.  She found doing the Houdini séance each year very stressful, possibly hoping against hope that if anyone could escape from the other side and return in a séance, it would be Houdini. At the end of ten years she passed the honor, legacy and tradition of doing the Houdini seances to friend, confidant and Houdini ghost writer, [[Walter B. Gibson]].  She announced "ten years is long enough to wait for any man!'  Gibson was also writer of The Shadow series that became a series of pulp novels, comic books, a radio show, a TV show and a movie that starred Alec Baldwin.  From the 1970's on Gibson would attend the Houdini seances at New York's Magic Towne House, run by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz. Before Walter died he passed on the tradition to magician, escape artist and co founder with Dick Brookz of The [[Houdini Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania, [[Dorothy Dietrich]].  [[Dorothy Dietrich]] continues to do the Houdini Séance each year.

A [[Houdini]] seance has been presented by [[Neil Tobin]], [[Necromancer]] at [[Excalibur (nightclub)|Excalibur nightclub]] annually since October 2001. This event is presented on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the [[Society of American Magicians]] during the last week of October to commemorate the late magician's death; [[Houdini]] helped found the Chicago Assembly in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1 Houdini's Halloween] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310222125/http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1 |date=2007-03-10 }} from [[WGN-TV]] and Red Eye, October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A short theatrical seance also concludes [[Supernatural Chicago]], a popular [[interactive theater]] show by [[Neil Tobin]]. It is currently in its seventh straight year of performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.metromix.com/theater/review/haunting-tales-fill-late/183843/content Haunting Tales Fill Late-Night Haunt] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110922022624/http://chicago.metromix.com/theater/review/haunting-tales-fill-late/183843/content |date=2011-09-22 }} from the [[Chicago Tribune]], October 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles]]' [[Magic Castle]] has a separate room dedicated to theatrical séances. [http://www.magiccastle.com/visiting/seance.cfm] Their evening séance program entitled, "Demons" is a recreation of a Victorian-era séance replete with mediumistic staples such as [[table-rapping]], [[slate (writing)]], [[spirit photography]], eerie inexplicable sounds and many other "psychic" experiments.

Another popular Theatrical Séance, this one touring theatrical stages and smaller venues, entitled Phantoms, was presented by mentalist Gregory Bishop (Edmonds), Phantoms employed items associated with, and actually belonging to, Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and magician [[Harry Houdini]].  Phantoms, first presented in 1995, was designed for presentation in two versions.  The larger, and more family-friendly stage version, and the smaller (somewhat "scarier" version), presented in private homes and in club settings.  The larger, stage version of the show included the [[spirit cabinet]] illusion, along with a [[spirit trumpet]], [[floating table]] and various other mainstays of the Victorian séance scene.

== Ethics and legality==

Theatrical séances are not intended to be "real" séances and should only be seen as entertainment; hence the adjective, ''theatrical.'' According to Houdini, if the séance leader is honest and admits his trickery, he is a theatrical performer; if not, he is a charlatan and a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intervalmagic.com/houdinimuseum.org/articles/1926_05.19.html Houdini in The New York Times, Hints of Seances at White House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ethically, a paying audience should be notified beforehand that they will be experiencing a work of interactive theater rather than an actual Spiritualist seance. Once the audience is inside the performance space, however, the performer's primary responsibility is to create a convincingly realistic theatrical experience, just as in other forms of theater. Additionally, the ambiguity of whether every manifestation is the result of deception or not may be part of the enjoyment that a theatrical seance provides.

== Spiritualistic and mediumistic performers ==

*[[Eugene Burger]] ''(creator and performer of "Hauntings")
*[[Dorothy Dietrich]] &amp; [[Dick Brooks (entertainer)]] ''(co-creator and performer/Psychic Theater)''
*[[Harry Houdini]] ''(prior to becoming a debunker of Spiritualist frauds)''
*[[Harry Kellar]] ''(With the [[Davenport Brothers]] and later in his own illusion shows)
*[[Matt the Knife]] ''(creator and Medium of the seance "Epitaph")
*[[Neil Tobin]], [[Necromancer]] ''(creator of [[Supernatural Chicago]] and Medium for The [[Houdini]] Seance at [[Excalibur (nightclub)]]
*[[Paul W. Draper]] ''(creator and performer of "Seance") at historic theaters and haunted houses seasonally

'''''Time Slave''''' is a 1975 hybrid of [[historical fiction]] and [[soft science fiction|science fiction]] by [[John Norman]]. In this book, Norman presents his personal theories of human [[evolution]], exemplified by the case of a modern woman sent back in time twenty thousand years or more; he mourns the loss of human evolutionary fitness and distortion of "[[nature|natural]]" [[society|social relations]] which in his view occurred when [[farming]] spread and farmers squeezed hunter/gatherers to the ecological margins. ''Time Slave'' features Norman's social philosophy of male-dominance (as also in his ''[[Gor]]'' series), and expresses an unexplained connection between female sexual subordination and the speeding up of the development of space travel.

[[File:great train robbery still.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Justus D. Barnes]] in Western apparel, as "Bronco Billy Anderson", from the [[silent film]] ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), the first Western film]]

The '''Western''' is a [[genre]] of various arts which tell stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the [[American frontier|American Old West]], often centering on the life of a nomadic [[cowboy]] or [[gunfighter]]&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; armed with a [[revolver]] and a [[rifle]] who rides a horse. Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s and [[buckskins]]. Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk). The ambience is usually punctuated with a [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] [[Film score|score]], including [[American folk music|American]] and [[Music of Mexico|Mexican folk music]] such as [[country music|country]], [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], [[New Mexico music]], and [[ranchera]]s.

Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a "...mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowie | first=Peter | title= John Ford and the American West | publisher=Harry Abrams Inc. | location= New York | year=2004 | isbn= 0-8109-4976-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways and isolated military forts of the [[Wild West]]. 

Common plots include:
* The construction of a railroad or a telegraph line on the wild frontier.
* Ranchers protecting their family ranch from [[rustler]]s or large landowners or who build a ranch empire.
* Revenge stories, which hinge on the chase and pursuit by someone who has been wronged.
* Stories about cavalry fighting Native Americans.
* Outlaw gang plots.
* Stories about a lawman or bounty hunter tracking down his quarry.
Many Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a [[shootout]] or [[Fast draw|quick-draw]] duel.&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;Agnew, Jeremy.

The Western was the most popular [[Hollywood]] genre from the early 20th century to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' became one of the biggest hits in 1939 and it made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star. Westerns were very popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the most acclaimed Westerns were released during this time, including ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). Classic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.

[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, "Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious."]]
The Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.&lt;ref name="kimnewman"&gt;{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice–"frontier justice"–dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt;  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.

In some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[knight errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures but only to his own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.

The Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Often times, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, "where life has no value".

The [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those "set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival–and as a means to settle disputes using "frontier justice". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Western films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html], ''New York Times Magazine'' (November 10, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a "pulp" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2 McFarland, Aug 27, 2008. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Western films often depict conflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the "Injuns" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. Or revisionist westerns like ''[[I Walk the Line (film)|I Walk the Line]]'' (1970) depict sheriffs dueling.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Western Set Universal Studio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Western set at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]]]]
Early Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, just like other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Often, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) "present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"/&gt;

Author and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgw199010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Union Pacific story''. The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology or transportation. Wagon train stories fall into this category.
# ''Ranch story''. The plot concerns threats to the ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
# ''Empire story''. The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot.
# ''Revenge story''. The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
# ''Cavalry and Indian story''. The plot revolves around "taming" the wilderness for white settlers.
# ''Outlaw story''. The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
# ''Marshal story''. The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.

Gruber said that good writers used dialogue and plot development to develop these basic plots into believable stories.{{r|cgw199010}} Other subgenres include:
* The [[Spaghetti Western]].
* The [[epic (genre)|epic]] western
* [[singing cowboy]] westerns
* a few [[:Category:Western (genre) comedy films|comedy westerns]] such as:
** ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945), in which [[Gary Cooper]] spoofed his western persona
** ''[[The Sheepman]]'' (1958), with [[Glenn Ford]] poking fun at himself
** ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), with a drunk [[Lee Marvin]] atop a drunk horse. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the [[revisionist Western]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandy|first=Mary Lea|title=Ride, Boldly Ride: The Evolution of the American Western|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley/Los Angeles/London|isbn=978-0-520-25866-2|page=234|author2=Kevin Stoehr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical Western====
[[File:John Wayne - 1961.JPG|right|thumb|[[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'' (1961)]]
''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s film starring [[Broncho Billy Anderson]], is often cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the "Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to ''The Great Train Robbery''. " Nonetheless, they concur that Porter's film "set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenin|first=George N.|title=The Western: From Silents to Cinerama|year=1962|publisher=Bonanza Books|location=New York|page=47|author2=William K. Everson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen's first cowboy star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from [[Tom Mix]] and [[William S. Hart]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Golden Age of the Western is epitomized by the work of several directors, most prominent among them, [[John Ford]] (''[[My Darling Clementine]]'', ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]''). Others include: [[Howard Hawks]] ([[Red River (1948 film)|''Red River'']], [[Rio Bravo (film)|''Rio Bravo'']]), [[Anthony Mann]] (''[[Man of the West]]'', ''[[The Man from Laramie]]''), [[Budd Boetticher]] (''[[Seven Men from Now]]''), [[Delmer Daves]] (''[[The Hanging Tree]]'', [[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|''3:10 to Yuma'']]), [[John Sturges]] (''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', ''[[Last Train from Gun Hill]]''), and [[Robert Aldrich]] ([[Vera Cruz (film)|''Vera Cruz'']], ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oncamera.net.au/genres/drama/western-film/classical-western/|title=Classical Western {{!}}  OnCamera Studio|last=battam@icloud.com|first=Robbie Battam,|website=oncamera.net.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acid Western====
Film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the [[Acid Western]],&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite web|website=Jonathanrosenbaum.net|url=https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2013/04/responding-to-some-questions-about-acid-westerns-and-dead-man/|author=Rosenbaum, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|title=Responding to some questions about “Acid Westerns” and DEAD MAN|date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Jim McBride]], and [[Rudy Wurlitzer]], as well as films like [[Monte Hellman]]'s ''[[The Shooting]]'' (1966), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s bizarre experimental film ''[[El Topo (1970 film)|El Topo (The Mole)]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=J/&gt; and [[Robert Downey Sr.]]'s ''[[Greaser's Palace]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name=J/&gt; The 1970 film ''El Topo'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[cult movie|cult]] Western and [[underground film]] about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad [[gunfighter]], and his quest for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and [[dwarfism|dwarf]] performers, and heavy doses of [[Christian symbolism]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Some Spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the Acid Western genre, such as [[Enzo G. Castellari]]'s mystical ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976), a Western reworking of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s metaphysical ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957).

More recent Acid Westerns include [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'' (1987) and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). Rosenbaum describes the Acid Western as "formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda"; ultimately, he says, the Acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.&lt;ref name="Chicago Reader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |title=''Acid Western: Dead Man'' |publisher="Chicago Reader" |date=June 26, 1996 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104355/http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---We need a section here on Westerns in the 80s, 90s and 2000s---&gt;

====Charro, Cabrito or Chili Westerns====
[[Charro#In cinema|Charro Westerns]], often featuring musical stars as well as action, have been a standard feature of [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood meta-narrative, but the overlap between 'charro' movies and westerns became more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Rashotte, Ryan ''Narco Cinema: Sex, Drugs, and Banda Music in Mexico's B-Filmography'' Palgrave Macmillan, 23 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 Figueredo, Danilo H. ''Revolvers and Pistolas, Vaqueros and Caballeros: Debunking the Old West'' ABC-CLIO, 9 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comedy Western====
This subgenre is imitative in style in order to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre's established traits, subjects, auteurs' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. A prime example of Comedy Western includes ''[[The Paleface]]'' (1948), which makes a satirical effort to "send-up Owen Wister's novel The Virginian and all the cliches of the Western from the fearless hero to the final shootout on main street. The result was The Paleface (1948) which features a cowardly hero known as "Painless" Peter Potter (Bob Hope), an inept dentist who often entertains the notion that he's a crack sharpshooter and accomplished Indian fighter". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stafford |first1=Jeff |title=The Paleface (1948) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/88935%7C0/The-Paleface.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary Western====
Also known as Neo-Westerns, these films have contemporary U.S. settings, and they utilize Old West themes and motifs (a rebellious anti-hero, open plains and desert landscapes, and gunfights). For the most part, they still take place in the [[Western United States|American West]] and reveal the progression of the [[Old West]] mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a "civilized" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.

Examples include [[John Sturges]]'s ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955); ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'', screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] (1962), ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]] (1963); [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971); ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972); ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972); ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974); ''[[Hearts of the West (1975 film)|Hearts of the West]]'' starring [[Jeff Bridges]] (1975); [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s ''[[Comes a Horseman]]'' (1978); ''[[J. W. Coop]]'', directed/co-written by and starring [[Cliff Robertson]]; [[Robert Rodríguez]]'s ''[[El Mariachi]]'' (1992) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' (2003); [[John Sayles]]'s ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996); [[Tommy Lee Jones]]'s ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005); [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005); [[Wim Wenders]]'s ''[[Don't Come Knocking]]'' (2005); [[Joel and Ethan Coen]]'s ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007); the television show ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' (2010–2015); ''[[Hell or High Water (film)|Hell or High Water]]'' (2016) and ''[[Wind River (film)|Wind River]]'' (2017), both written by [[Taylor Sheridan]]; and the superhero film ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' (2017). ''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'' is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator [[Vince Gilligan]], "After the first ''Breaking Bad'' episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]—we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950–1952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.

====Electric Western====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] --&gt;
The 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the "first electric Western."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epic Western====
The epic western is a subgenre of the western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).

====Euro-Western====
Euro Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]).  Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher &amp; British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. In the 2010s some new euro-westerns emerged like [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']] and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.

====Fantasy Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
Fantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include Fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower series]]'' of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].

====Florida Western====
[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].

====Horror Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
A developing subgenre,{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} with roots in films such as ''[[Curse of the Undead]]'' (1959) and ''[[Billy the Kid vs. Dracula]]'' (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw [[Billy the Kid]] fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.

====Curry Westerns and Indo Westerns====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The first Western films made in India - ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], is perhaps the most resemblant of the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular "zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil.

====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====
While many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].

====Meat pie Western====
The [[Meat pie Western]] (also ''Kangaroo Western'')(a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker "[[Spaghetti Western]]") is an American Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].&lt;ref name=AusF&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0195507843|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[Kangaroo (1952 film)|Kangaroo]]'' (1952), the television series [[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]] (1961), ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]'' (1976), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982), ''[[Five Mile Creek]]'' (1983–85), ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre. The term is used to differentiate more Americanized Australian films from those with a more historical basis, such as those about [[bushrangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=HOLLYWOOD|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northwestern====
The [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].

====Ostern====
{{main|Ostern}}
[[Ostern]]s, also known as "Red Western"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;nowiki&gt;￼￼ and usually portrayed the &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.

[[Gojko Mitić]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.

====Pornographic Western====
The most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].

====Revisionist Western====
After the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as "savages" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]] (1962),''[[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.

====Science fiction Western====
The [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965),''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s "Six Gun Planet" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.co.il/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&amp;redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].

====Space Western====
The [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[Brave Starr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''[[Firefly (television show)|Firefly]]'' TV series). The classic western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a ''Wagon Train to the stars.''

====Spaghetti Western====
{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}
During the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the "[[Spaghetti Westerns]]" also known as "Italo-Westerns". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almería|region of Almería]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical westerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.

The Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]]. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''.&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Forget the Spaghetti Western – try a Curry Western or a Sauerkraut one|author=Billson, Anne|date=September 15, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11096814/Forget-the-Spaghetti-Western-try-a-Curry-Western-or-a-Sauerkraut-one.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weird Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
The [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with western.

===Genre studies===
[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]

In the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.

One of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that "Westerns" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered "Westerns."

===Influences===
Being period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: ‘Films of Kenneth Anger’ and ‘Samurai Classics’|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=''Far Cry from the Original Site'' |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 |df= }} December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called "[[Red Western]]" or "Ostern". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

An offshoot of the Western genre is the "post-apocalyptic" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as "''Wagon Train'' to the stars" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

More recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}
[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[John Wayne]] (1948)&lt;/center&gt;]]

The character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''—an individual bound only by his own private code of honor—has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western, has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet "New Canaan", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse—with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the "[[Man with No Name]]" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Meanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

==Literature==
{{Main|Western fiction}}
[[Western fiction]] is a genre of literature set in the [[American Old West]], most commonly between the years of 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].

[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.&lt;ref&gt;Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland &amp; Company, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).   ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' was the first Western [[television series]] written for adults,&lt;ref name="The Eastern Earps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burris|first1=Joe|title=The Eastern Earps|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-05-10/features/0505100100_1_wyatt-earp-genealogy-indentured|accessdate=October 20, 2014 |date=May 10, 2005|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiering four days before ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' on September 6, 1955.&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047750"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047736"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The peak year for television Westerns was 1959, with 26 such shows airing during primetime. At least six of them were connected in some extent to [[Wyatt Earp]]: ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', and ''Gunsmoke''.&lt;ref name="guinn"&gt;[Guinn, Jeff. ''The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral and How it Changed the American West'' (First hardcover ed.). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-5424-3}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing costs of [[American television]] production weeded out most action half hour series in the early 1960s, and their replacement by hour-long television shows, increasingly in color.&lt;ref&gt;Kisseloff, J. (editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', and ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]''. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006.

==Visual art==
{{Main|Artists of the American West}}
A number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as "Western Art" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the "Wild West" on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.

===Anime and manga===
With [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[Kōya no Shōnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[shōnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the "Steel Ball Run" race.

===Comics===
[[Western comics]] have included serious entries (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (such as ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]''), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').

===Games===
Western [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (first released in 2009)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).

===Radio dramas===
Western [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun–Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web series===
Westerns have been showcased in short episodic web series. Examples include ''[[League of STEAM]]'', ''[[Red Bird (web series)|Red Bird]]'' and [[Arkansas Traveler (web series)|''Arkansas Traveler'']].

'''William Wotton''' (13 August 1666 – 13 February 1727) was an English theologian, classical scholar and linguist. He is chiefly remembered for his remarkable abilities in learning languages and for his involvement in the [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. In [[Wales]] he is remembered as the collector and first translator of the [[Welsh law|ancient Welsh laws]].

==Early years==
William Wotton was the second son of the Rev. Henry Wotton, rector of [[Wrentham, Suffolk]]. He was a child prodigy who could read verses from the Bible in English, [[Latin]], [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] before he was six. In April 1676, when he was not yet ten years old, he was sent to [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|Catharine Hall, Cambridge]], and graduated in 1679.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WTN676W|name=Wotton, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time Wotton had acquired [[Arabic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Chaldee]], as well as a knowledge of [[logic]], philosophy, [[mathematics]], [[geography]], [[chronology]], and history. His parents died whilst he was still at [[Cambridge]], and as a teenager he was taken into the household of [[Gilbert Burnet]], later [[bishop of Salisbury]]. He was awarded a fellowship at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], from where he obtained an M.A. in 1683 and a B.D. in 1691. In 1686 he was appointed curate of [[Brimpton]] in Berkshire and the following year he was also elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. In January 1689 he was appointed vicar of [[Lacock]] in Wiltshire, which he held until his resignation in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCEd |type=person |id=22903 |name=Wotton, William |yob=1686 |yod=1727 |accessed=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ordination he was also appointed chaplain to [[Daniel Finch, 7th Earl of Winchilsea|Daniel Finch]] [[Earl of Nottingham]], and tutor to his family. Finch presented him with the rectory of [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire, in 1693.

==Ancients and Moderns==
Wotton began his scholarly career as the translator of [[Louis Ellies du Pin|Louis Dupin's]] ''A new history of ecclesiastical writers'', (13 vols. 1692–99). However, he is chiefly remembered for his share in the controversy about the respective merits of ancient and modern learning. In his ''Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning'' (1694, and again 1697) he took the part of the moderns, although in a fair and judicial spirit. According to Joseph Levine, 'of all the works in the controversy that had yet appeared in English or French his was easily the most judicious.'&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle of the Books'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He was attacked for pedantry by [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]] in ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'' and ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle of the Books'', pp. 112–122.&lt;/ref&gt; but his book proved that 'Wotton was no mere pedant, but a wide-ranging intellect with a thorough command of learning, both ancient and modern.'&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle of the Books'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Wotton responded calling Swift's ''A Tale'' "one of the profanest banters upon the religion of Jesus Christ, as such, that ever yet appeared."&lt;ref&gt;Warren Montag ''The Unthinkable Swift'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MQSLif85zecC&amp;pg=PA113 p.113]&lt;/ref&gt; He also began to write a biography of the chemist Sir [[Robert Boyle]], but his notes were lost and the work was never completed.

Wotton wrote a ''History of Rome'' in (1701) at the request of Bishop Burnet, which was later used by the historian [[Edward Gibbon]]. In recognition, Burnet appointed him as a [[prebendary|prebend]] of [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]] from 1705. In 1707 Wotton was awarded a "[[Lambeth degree]]" of [[Doctor of Divinity]] by Archbishop [[Thomas Tenison]] in recognition of his writings in support of the established [[Church of England]] against the [[Deists]]. Around 1713 Wotton also developed ideas concerning the relationship between languages introducing the concept of an early proto-language by relating Icelandic, the Romance languages and Greek. This pre-dated [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]]' famous lecture comparing Sanskrit with the Classical languages, by more than seventy years.&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology and Language'' (1999). Vol. 3, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt; These theories were later published after Wotton's death, as ''A discourse concerning the confusion of languages at Babel'' (1730).

==Events at Milton Keynes==
Throughout his adult life, Wotton was known to be "a most excellent preacher, but a drunken whoring soul".&lt;ref&gt;De la Pryme (1870), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also very extravagant, transforming his rectory into a 32-roomed mansion. He was, however, able to borrow money against future expectations of ecclesiastical preferment as a result of his close friendship with [[William Wake]], then bishop of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2006) pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the summer of 1711 and the Spring of 1712, Wotton appears to have experienced a [[mid-life crisis]], and he scandalised the neighbourhood on many occasions by being found drunk in public, or else was known to have spent prolonged periods in local [[brothel]]s. As a result, he was initially warned about his behaviour by Wake, who later broke off their friendship and rescinded his promise of providing an additional living in Buckinghamshire. As soon as it became known that the rector's expectations had been dashed, local tradesmen began to press for the payment of their debts. In May 1714, Wotton was forced to abandon his rectory at Milton Keynes to avoid his creditors, and for seven years he lived at [[Carmarthen]] in south-west [[Wales]] under the assumed name of Dr. William Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2006) pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies in Wales==
Whilst at Carmarthen, Wotton reformed his character and returned to his studies. He was also able to re-establish his friendship with Wake, who had become [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in December 1715.

Wotton began to study [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and produced an important bilingual parallel text edition of the Welsh and Latin texts of the [[Welsh law|medieval Welsh laws]] traditionally attributed to [[Hywel Dda]] at the request of his friend. To do this he had first to identify and obtain transcripts of a fifteen or so known manuscripts in either Latin or Mediaeval Welsh, and establish a text, and then begin the difficult task of translating the Mediaeval Welsh terminology which appeared in both the Latin and Welsh versions, but the meaning of which had been lost by the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2006) p.48-50.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1721 Wotton was assisted by the Welsh scholar [[Moses Williams (antiquarian)|Moses Williams]]. Wotton lived to complete the translation but was working on an accompanying glossary when he died. This was completed by Williams, and the whole work was published in 1730 by his son-in-law [[William Clarke (antiquary)|William Clarke]] in a large [[Folio (printing)|folio]] edition under the title ''Leges Wallicae''.

Whilst at Carmarthen he also conducted surveys of the cathedrals of [[St David's]] and [[Llandaff]] which were published by his friend [[Browne Willis]] in 1717 and 1718. He published ''Miscellaneous Discourses relating to the Traditions and Usages of the Scribes and Pharisees'' which included a translation of part of the ''[[Mishnah]]'' in (1718).

==Epilogue==
Wotton had repaid his creditors and was able to return to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in October 1721 and London in June 1722 but was in very poor health. He was still working on his ''Leges Wallicae'', when he died of [[oedema|dropsy]] at [[Buxted]], Sussex, on 13 February 1727.
