'''Alba gu bràth''' ({{IPA-gd|ˈal̪ˠapə kə ˈpɾaːx|pron|Albagubrath.ogg}}) is a [[Scottish Gaelic]] phrase used to express allegiance to [[Scotland]]. Idiomatically it translates into English as "Scotland forever" though the literal meaning of ''gu bràth'' in Gaelic is 'until [[Last Judgment|Judgment]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=bràth Am Faclair Beag]&lt;/ref&gt;
The phrase is often used as a political slogan in the campaign for [[Scottish independence]].

The phrase is parallel to the [[Welsh language]] slogan "[[Cymru am byth]]" ("Wales forever") or the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[Erin go bragh|Éirinn go Brách]]'' ("Ireland Forever").

==Derivative spellings==
Various (mis-)spellings are sometimes seen, for example: ''Alba go bragh, Alba gu bra, Alba go breá''.

==Popular culture==
In the 1995 film ''[[Braveheart]]'', Scottish patriot and national hero [[William Wallace]] (portrayed by [[Mel Gibson]]) shouts, "Alba gu bràth" as he gallops across the front of his assembled Scottish troops just prior to the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">'''Alexander Hare''' (1775&amp;ndash;1834) was an English merchant, infamous for establishing a [[harem]] and following the local custom of trading slaves in his personal state of [[Maluka]], southeast Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;''De man die vrouwen verzamelde; Een koloniale geschiedenis van de Kokos-eilanden'' by Joop van den Berg (‘s-Gravenhage 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofcoins.eu/forum/index.php?topic=2460.15 Maluka? on World Coins forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of a London watchmaker of the same name and his wife Janet,&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/J3M2-KGD Familysearch]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander joined a trading company in [[Portugal]] around 1800, moved to [[Calcutta]], and settled as a merchant in [[Malacca]] in 1807. Here he met [[Stamford Raffles]], who appointed him Resident of [[Banjarmasin]] and Commissioner of the Island of [[Borneo]] when Dutch control briefly passed to Britain (1811–16). He acquired 1,400 square miles of land from the Sultan of Banjarmassen and established it as an independent state, Maluka, which issued its own coinage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/68463/coin-doit-maluka-indonesia-1813 Duit coin from 1813]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.londoh.com/?itemid=1334 Alexander Hare and Maluka (Dutch numismatic blog)]&lt;/ref&gt; An inquiry carried out by William Boggie, the British Resident in [[Samarang]] in 1837, uncovered how he had operated what became known as "the Banjermassen ([[sic]]) Outrage".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=caHQiqLUknAC&amp;dq=molukko&amp;pg=PA16 English appendix to 1860 article in Dutch]&lt;/ref&gt; He had to leave when the Dutch returned and he took his harem, and others, first to [[Jakarta|Batavia]] until declared undesirable in 1819, and then to South Africa until forced to leave in 1826, whence he went to settle the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Far East and Australasia 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22alexander+hare%22+cocos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5c1eTa6xCIW6cZLL_JIK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alexander%20hare%22%20cocos&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-85743-133-2|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict with a disapproving [[John Clunies-Ross]] led to him leaving the Cocos Islands in 1831, some say for [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1229016.htm|title=John Clunies Ross (1786-1854)|date=16 November 2004|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; others say Batavia, but Hare died in [[Bengkulu (city)|Bencoolen]] (modern day Bengkulu on the southwest coast of Sumatra) on 2 November 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Morning Post (London) 20/3/1835&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander had three brothers: David (b.1777), became a jeweller in Batavia, while John (b.1782) and Joseph (b.1784) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/search/records/index#count=20&amp;query=%2Bsurname%3Ahare~%20%2Bfather_givenname%3Aalexander~%20%2Bfather_surname%3Ahare~%20%2Bmother_givenname%3Ajanet~ Familysearch]&lt;/ref&gt; were traders in colonial goods in [[London]].  The English censuses of 1851 and 1861 show Fatimah, Joseph's niece born in the East Indies, living in his London house: as she appears to have been born in 1837 she was presumably David's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.familysearch.org/search/records/index#count=20&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3Afatima~%20%2Bsurname%3Ahare~ Census via Familysearch]&lt;/ref&gt; She married James Graham at St Peter's, Pimlico 22 May 1862 and died at London 1874.

[[File:Arcosanti_Cliff_View.png|thumb|View of Arcosanti from the southeast, showing buildings from Crafts III on the far left to the guestrooms in the right foreground.]]
'''Arcosanti''' is a projected [[new town|experimental town]] with a molten bronze [[Bellfounding|bell casting]] business in [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]], central [[Arizona]], 70&amp;nbsp;mi (110&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], at an elevation of 3,732 feet (1,130 meters). Its [[arcology]] concept was posited by the Italian-American architect, [[Paolo Soleri]] (1919&amp;ndash;2013). He began construction in 1970, to demonstrate how urban conditions could be improved while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth. He taught and influenced generations of architects and urban designers who studied and worked with him there to build the proposed 'town.'

== Overview ==
The goal of Arcosanti is to explore the concept of [[arcology]], which combines [[architecture]] and [[ecology]]. The project has the goals of combining the social interaction and accessibility of an urban environment with sound environmental principles, such as minimal resource use and access to the natural environment.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/project/background/soleri/main.html Paolo Soleri Biography], Arcosanti.org&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been building an experimental town on 25 acres (10 ha) of a 4,060-acre (1,640 ha) land preserve.

[[File:Arcosanti apse.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Arcosanti apse]]
Ground was broken in 1970 to begin construction on the site, and has continued at a varying pace through the present. The most recently completed building was finished in 1989.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcosanti.org/project/background/history/arcosantiTimeline.html|title=Page not found - Arcosanti|website=www.arcosanti.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has tended to vary between 50 and 150 people, many of them students and volunteers. Ultimately, the goal has been for Arcosanti to house a population of 5,000 people.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/project/background/history/main.html Arcosanti Project Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228020910/http://www.arcosanti.org/project/background/history/main.html |date=2010-02-28 }}, Arcosanti&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen major structures have been built on the site to date, some several stories tall. One master plan, designed in 2001, envisions a massive complex, called "Arcosanti 5000", that would dwarf the current buildings.

Many features are particular to the design and construction of Arcosanti. For example, tilt-up concrete panels are cast in a bed of [[silt]] acquired from the surrounding area, giving the concrete a unique texture and color that helps it blend with the landscape. Many panels were cast with embedded art. Most buildings are oriented southward to capture the sun's light and heat&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; roof designs admit the maximum amount of sunlight in the winter and a minimal amount during the summer. The structure built to shelter bronze-casting is built in the form of an apse, a quarter-sphere or [[semi-dome]]. The layout of all the buildings is intricate and organic, rather than the grid typical of most US cities, with the goals of maximum accessibility to all elements, a combination of increased social interaction and bonds, together with privacy for the residents.

Existing structures at Arcosanti are meant to begin to provide for the complete needs of a community. They include: a five-story visitors' center/cafe/gift shop; a [[bronze]]-[[casting (metalworking)|casting]] [[apse]]; a ceramics apse; two large [[barrel vault]]s; a ring of apartment residences and quasi-public spaces around an outdoor [[amphitheater]]; a community [[swimming pool]]; an office complex, above which is an apartment that was originally Soleri's suite. A two-bedroom "Sky Suite" occupies the highest point in the complex; it, as well as a set of rooms below the pool, is available for overnight guests. Most of the buildings have accessible roofs.

[[File:Arcosanti tower.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Visitors' center and residence]]
Arcosanti has a Camp area, built by and for the original construction crew. It is used today as housing for people most interested in development of the agricultural department. Camp has a small [[greenhouse]], with easy access to gardens and large agricultural fields that as of March 2017 were not being cultivated. Terraced greenhouses are planned along the slope of the main building site for winter plant and garden space, and to collect heat to distribute through the buildings.

Arcosanti was conceived of and remains primarily an education center, with students from around the world visiting to attend workshops, classes, and to assist with the continuing construction. 40,000 tourists visit yearly.&lt;ref name="urban design"&gt;''Urban design'' by Jon T. Lang, page 126, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sc-fL5Lt720C&amp;pg=PA126 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists can take a guided tour of the site or make reservations to stay overnight in guest accommodations.&lt;ref name="Arcosanti Guestrooms"&gt;[https://www.arcosanti.org/expArcosanti/visit/overnight/main.html Guest Accommodations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720111450/https://www.arcosanti.org/expArcosanti/visit/overnight/main.html |date=July 20, 2012 }} Arcosanti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Arcosanti funding comes from selling the bells made and cast from clay and bronze on site. Additional funding comes from donations, and fees for workshops that last up to five weeks. Much of the present construction at Arcosanti has been done by workshop participants and volunteers.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The average salary at Arcosanti is minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Early Eco-City Faces the Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/garden/an-early-eco-city-faces-the-future.html?scp=1&amp;sq=arcosanti&amp;st=cse|publisher=New York Times | first=Michael|last=Tortorello|date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workshops ==
Since 1970, participants have come to help build Arcosanti by enrolling in workshops. During a standard five-week workshop, they attend lectures about Paolo Soleri and the principles of Arcology design while gaining hands-on learning experience by aiding construction. Although the program attracts many who are interested in art, crafts, architecture and urban planning, it is also pertinent to those interested in philosophy, sociology, science, and agriculture.

== History ==

'''1956''' – Paolo and Colly Soleri purchased the land in Paradise Valley, Arizona, upon which the [[Cosanti]] studios were built. Their first official activities began there in 1959.

'''1969: Arcosanti''' – Soleri coined the term "Arcology" to describe his designs for ecologically sound human habitats, as elaborated in  ''The City in the Image of Man,'' published by MIT Press to accompany a so-titled 1970 exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC. The book develops the concept of Arcology and its design variations for different settings. Arcosanti, introduced as the last (30th) example of this exercise, was originally planned to house a relatively small population of 1,500 people. The physical construction of Arcosanti began in 1970.

'''1975-1977: Two Suns Arcosanti''' – The [[Xerox Corporation]] sponsored a major Soleri exhibition, featuring a series of new arcology designs that suggested a sustainable urban habitat employing alternative energy sources. The project was called ''Two Suns Arcology: The Cities Energized by the Sun.'' The Arcosanti master plan went through a major overhaul reflecting this methodology. In the following year, Plant Show venues gave Soleri additional funding to update the Arcosanti design. The projected population was increased to 5,000.

'''1978''': During a festival held at the site, a grass fire ignited in the area being used as a parking lot and over 180 cars were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref name="ArcosantiFestival"&gt;[http://theazedge.com/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=701&amp;SectionID=14&amp;SubSectionID=13&amp;S=1 "Arcosanti '78: Music Under Fire"], ''The AZEdge'', 20 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carfire"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19790912&amp;id=AhwLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KFADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3072,3173274 Google News Archive] ''The Prescott Courier'', 12 September 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carfireimage"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/schwartzalot/2685163140/ "Arcosanti car fire photograph"], Flickr&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arcosanti vaults.jpg|thumb]]

'''1980: Critical Mass''' – Ten years into the construction of the first prototype arcology, a developmental adjustment was made to gain momentum for the project. The Critical Mass concept was introduced as an incremental phase to house 10 percent of the projected population of 5,000. A series of small-scale structures, providing various amenities, were designed to support a viable community. This was intended to support the next major step, the completion of Arcosanti.

''' 2001: Arcosanti 5000''' – Developed from the Super Critical Mass in "Arcosanti 2000", with the design elements of "Nudging Space Arcology" added, Arcosanti 5000 features seven phases of truncated super-apse structures. It re-establishes the macro nature of this prototype arcology for 5,000 people. This design is in development, awaiting architectural and structural resolutions.

'''2009: Paolo Soleri's 90th Birthday Celebration and Alumni Reunion''' – Paolo Soleri celebrated his 90th birthday at Arcosanti, joined by 300 alumni and guests for the occasion. The official schedule started on June 19; this first day was devoted to alumni. Ongoing events included Kundalini yoga, a morning bell-carving workshop, a silent auction, and an exhibition with the newest renderings of Critical Mass. The festivities continued into the night with a bronze pour in the Foundry, followed by a techno party in the Vaults, and performances on a stage in the Ceramics Apse.&lt;ref name="Paolo's 90th Bronze Pour"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/today/2009/07/06/1246910825496.html "Paolo's 90th Bronze Pour"] ''Arcosanti Daily Progress Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

The birthday celebration for Soleri resumed on Saturday with attendees partaking in a gargantuan "frugal soup" gathering in the Vaults.&lt;ref name="Paolo's 90th Frugal Soup"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/today/2009/06/24.html Paolo's 90th Frugal Soup] Arcosanti Daily Progress Report&lt;/ref&gt; Documentary film maker [[Geoffrey Madeja]] presented a short video. [[Tomiaki Tamura]] followed with a visual presentation of Paolo's life and work and a pictograph especially choreographed for Paolo. The final performance of the night was hosted by [[Flam Chen]], in a series of acrobatics involving dazzling fire, lights, and extreme heights.&lt;ref name="Paolo's 90th Flam Chen Performance"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/today/2009/06/26/1246036293261.html Paolo's 90th Flam Chen Performance] Arcosanti Daily Progress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paolo's 90th Flam Chen Performance pt2"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/today/2009/06/25/1245954556314.html Paolo's 90th Flam Chen Performance pt2] Arcosanti Daily Progress&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2011:''' On July 14, 2011, the Cosanti Foundation announced that its founder Soleri had retired as its President and CEO.  "There are other things that I want to accomplish," said the 92-year-old Soleri. "I am ready to leave the management of the Foundation and its primary project – the urban laboratory Arcosanti – to the next generation." That generation was to be led by Boston architect [[Jeff Stein (architect)|Jeff Stein]], [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]]. Stein's proposals for Arcosanti began with: a half-dozen new apartment buildings; a canopy for the amphitheater; a renovated commercial bakery; and a storage unit for Paolo Soleri's collection of architectural models.
[[File:Arcosanti apse (1).jpg|thumb]]

Arcosanti operates under aegis of the Cosanti Foundation, a non-profit 501(c) 3 organization. The Foundation runs workshops to teach Paolo Soleri's ideas. As of 2012, more than 7,000 participants had aided in the construction through participation in five-week workshops.&lt;ref name="Arcosanti Workshop"&gt;[http://www.arcosanti.org/expArcosanti/workshops/Programs/fiveweek/main.html "5 week workshop"], Arcosanti.org&lt;/ref&gt; Each workshop includes a Seminar Week, which covers Soleri's background and history, as well as his concepts about arcology design. They hear lectures from different departments at Arcosanti to see how Arcosanti operates, and then spend the following weeks working at the priority project of the site.

Arcosanti is the home of the bell-making enterprise of Cosanti Originals, which sells Soleri's sculptural wind bells to support the greater architectural project.

== Documentary ==
Over six years in the making, the (2013) feature-length documentary film on the life of Paolo Soleri and the birth of Arcosanti, ''The Vision of Paolo Soleri:  Prophet in the Desert'' (2012) features on-camera interviews with journalist [[Morley Safer]], [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], architectural critic [[Paul Goldberger]], [[Catherine Hardwicke]], [[Will Bruder]], [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]], architect [[Steven Holl]], and [[Eric Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250180/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2578">The '''Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia''' ({{lang-sl|Združenje borcev Jugoslavije}}), known as '''Boj''' (an abbreviation, also meaning "battle"; members were known as {{lang-sh|Bojovnici}}), was a [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslav nationalist]] organization in the [[Drava Banovina]] (Slovenia) of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], active between 1930 and 1935. It was established in 1929 as the '''Union of Slovene Soldiers''' (''Zveza slovenskih vojakov''), then renamed in 1930 to '''Union of Fighters''' (''Zveza bojevnikov'').{{sfn|Cohen|Riesman|1996|p=12}} The movement supported [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]]'s royal [[dictatorship]] (declared in 1929).{{sfn|Cohen|Riesman|1996|p=12}} It was approved by the [[Drava Banovina]] administration in 1931.{{sfn|Cohen|Riesman|1996|p=12}} In late 1933, the organization was renamed as the "Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia" (Združenje borcev Jugoslavije).&lt;ref name="TitoDamjanović1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Josip Broz Tito|author2=Pero Damjanović|author3=Ubavka Vujošević|author4=Institut za savremenu istoriju (Belgrade, Serbia)|title=Sabrana djela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_W0AAAAIAAJ|year=1982|publisher=Komunist|quote=Združenje borcev Jugoslavije — Boj}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was merged along with other organizations, such as [[Yugoslav Action]] that was based mainly in Croatia, and groups surrounding the magazines of ''Zbor'' ("Council") and ''Otadžbina'' ("Homeland") based in Belgrade, and ''Budjenje'' ("Awakening") in [[Zrenjanin]], to form the [[Yugoslav National Movement]] led by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]] in early 1935.{{sfn|Kardelj|1981|p=52}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">The '''Bannu Resolution''' ({{lang-ps|د بنو قرارداد}}), or the '''Pashtunistan Resolution''' ({{lang-ps|د پښتونستان قرارداد}}), was a formal political statement adopted by Pashtun nationalists in [[Bannu]] that demanded the British offer the option of independence, rather than choosing between the independent [[dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. The British refused the request, and the region voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining Pakistan in a July 1947 referendum.

== History ==
The resolution was adopted on June 21, 1947, seven weeks before the [[Partition of British India]], by [[Bacha Khan]], [[Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai]], the [[Khudai Khidmatgars]], members of the Provincial Assembly, [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs at a [[loya jirga]] held at [[Bannu]], in [[British India]]’s [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North-West Frontier Province]].

The resolution demanded that [[Pashtuns]] be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]], composing all Pashtun territories of British India - an exemption from the British plan to award territories in British India to either Pakistan or India. 

== British refusal ==
The [[British Raj]] refused to consider the resolution's demands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  because in July 1947, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] declaring that by 15 August 1947 it would divide [[British India]] into the two new independent [[dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] - with no option for further independent states.

The act also declared that the fate of the North West Frontier Province would be subject to the result of [[referendum]]. This was in accord with the June 3rd Plan proposal to have a referendum to decide the future of the Northwest Frontier Province—to be voted on by the same electoral college as for the Provincial Legislative Assembly in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Pearson|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wahrdigarr.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[Epenwöhrden]] reciting the battlecry: "Wahr di, Garr, de Buer de kumt" (Beware, Guard, of the farmer[, who is] coming)]]
The '''Battle of Hemmingstedt''' took place on February 17, 1500 south of the village of [[Hemmingstedt]], near the present village of [[Epenwöhrden]], in the western part of present-day [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. It was an attempt by King [[John of Denmark]] and his brother [[Frederick I of Denmark|Duke Frederick]], who were co-dukes of Schleswig and Holstein, to subdue the [[peasant]]ry of [[Dithmarschen]], who had established a peasants' [[republic]] on the coast of the [[North Sea]]. John was at the time also king of the [[Kalmar Union]].

==Forces==
The ducal army consisted of the "Great Guard", 4,000 [[Landsknechte|Landsknechts]], commanded by a petty noble ([[Junker]]) named Thomas Slentz, 2,000 armoured cavaliers, about 1,000 artillery-men and 5,000 commoners. The defenders were about 1,000 men, all peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, J.H.S., ''Denmark in History'', London: John Murray, 1938, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; These men were a well-armed and well-organized [[militia]], not the desperate, badly armed rabble associated with the term "peasant army".

==Use of terrain==
After seizing the village of Meldorf, the ducal army advanced, but was stopped at a barricade equipped with guns ({{ill|Geschütz|de}}). The defenders opened at least one [[dike (construction)|dike]] sluice in order to flood the land, which quickly turned into morass and shallow lakes. Crammed together on a narrow road with no solid ground on which to deploy, the ducal army was unable to make use of its numerical superiority. The lightly equipped peasants were familiar with the land and used poles to leap over the ditches. Most of the ducal soldiers were not killed by enemy arms, but drowned. The conquest attempt was thus repelled.&lt;ref&gt;Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, „Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der frühen Neuzeit", in: ''Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser'': 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.), Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden, 1995 and 2008, vol. I 'Vor- und Frühgeschichte' (1995; {{ISBN|978-3-9801919-7-5}}), vol. II 'Mittelalter (einschl. Kunstgeschichte)' (1995; {{ISBN|978-3-9801919-8-2}}), vol. III 'Neuzeit' (2008; {{ISBN|978-3-9801919-9-9}}), (=Schriftenreihe des Landschaftsverbandes der ehem. Herzogtümer Bremen und Verden; vols. 7–9), vol. II: pp. 321–388, here p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; The casualties among the Dithmarsians are not known, but the Danish and the Dutch lost together more than half of their army, making about 7,000 men killed and 1,500 men wounded.

==Personalities; real and imagined==
[[File:Max Koch Schlacht bei Hemmingstedt.jpg|thumb|right|360px|The Battle of Hemmingstedt in a [[history painting]] of 1910 by Max Friedrich Koch, assembly hall of the former District Building in [[Meldorf]]. The legendary virgin Telse waving the banner of the then Ditmarsian [[patron saint]] [[Mary of Nazareth]].]] The farmer '''{{ill|Wulf Isebrand|de}}''' (died 1506) was the leader and organiser of the peasants' defence. While he was a real person, the existence of other participants of the battle is not proven. For instance, the legendary '''Reimer von Wiemerstedt''' is said to have killed '''Junker Slentz''', the chief of the "Great Guard"; another doubtful participant was the "virgin" Telse.

==Propaganda use==
Many details about the battle were made up later in order to heroize the defenders. In 1900 a monument to the defenders was raised. The cult reached its peak in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, when local party members used the names of the battle participants for their propaganda. Today there is a more neutral museum at the site commemorating the battle.

==Legacy==
The Battle of Hemmingstedt is a prime example of the use of terrain in military tactics. The Ditmarsians had taken a vow to donate a monastery in honour of the then national [[patron saint]] [[Mary of Nazareth]] if they could repel the invasion. In 1513 the Ditmarsians founded a [[Franciscan]] [[Friary]] in [[Lunden]] fulfilling their vow.&lt;ref&gt;Thies Völker, [http://www.suite101.de/content/die-dithmarscher-landeskirche-15231559-a58840 ''Die Dithmarscher Landeskirche 1523–1559: Selbständige bauernstaatliche Kirchenorganisation in der Frühneuzeit''], section 'Konfliktauslöser: Besetzung der Pfarrstellen und Klosterprojekt', posted on 16 July 2009 on: [http://www.suite101.de ''suite101.de: Das Netzwerk der Autoren''].&lt;/ref&gt; The Ditmarsians also captured diverse banners and standards of the defeated enemies, among them the [[Flag of Denmark#Continuation of the romantic legend|Danebrog]]. They were presented in St. Nicholas Church in [[Wöhrden]] until [[Frederick II of Denmark]], victorious in the [[Last Feud]] against Dithmarschen in 1559, forced the Ditmarsians to return them.

On 29 April 2017, Turkish authorities blocked online access to all language editions of the online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] throughout [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="tb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://turkeyblocks.org/2017/04/29/wikipedia-blocked-turkey/|title=Wikipedia blocked in Turkey|date=29 April 2017|website=Turkey Blocks|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39754909|title=Turkish authorities block Wikipedia without giving reason|date=29 April 2017|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=29 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions were imposed by [[Internet regulation in Turkey#Internet law|Turkish Law No. 5651]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İNTERNET ORTAMINDA YAPILAN YAYINLARIN DÜZENLENMESİ VE BU YAYINLAR YOLUYLA İŞLENEN SUÇLARLA MÜCADELE EDİLMESİ HAKKINDA KANUN |language=Turkish |trans-title=Turkish law based ban of Wikipedia |url=http://www.mevzuat.gov.tr/MevzuatMetin/1.5.5651.pdf |website=mevzuat.gov.tr |access-date=2 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the [[English Wikipedia|English version]]'s article on [[state-sponsored terrorism]], where Turkey was described as a sponsor country for [[ISIS]] and [[Al-Qaeda]], which Turkish courts viewed as a public [[Media manipulation|manipulation]] of [[mass media]]. Requests by the [[Information and Communication Technologies Authority|Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority]] to edit several articles to comply with Turkish law were not adhered to.

As of January 2018, Wikipedia was still banned in Turkey and Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director [[Katherine Maher]] did not know why.&lt;ref name=hurriyet&gt;{{cite news |date=January 17, 2018 |title=Wikipedia ‘still not sure’ why it is still banned in Turkey |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/wikipedia-still-not-sure-why-it-is-still-banned-in-turkey-125858 |work=Hurriyet |location=Istanbul |access-date=January 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 5 March 2018, Wikipedia's Facebook page started the "We Miss Turkey" ({{lang-tr|Özledik}}) campaign and replaced the black censor bar over the Wikipedia logo with a red one. It also had an accompanying [[hashtag]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ntv.com.tr/teknoloji/wikipediadan-kampanya-turkiyeyi-ozledik,aXy82ZZgb0eO3Nx34ehB7w|title=Wikipedia’dan kampanya: Türkiye’yi özledik|work=NTV.com.tr|date=6 March 2018|access-date=11 April 2018|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Some countries have faulted Turkey for [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War#Turkey|funding Islamist rebel groups]] in [[Syria]], including [[al-Qaeda]]'s affiliate in Syria, the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="biden"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/12392.aspx|title=Gulf allies and 'Army of Conquest'|newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-crisis-turkey-and-saudi-arabia-shock-western-countries-by-supporting-antiassad-jihadists-10242747.html|title=Turkey and Saudi Arabia alarm the West by backing Islamist extremists the Americans had bombed in Syria|author=Kim Sengupta|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] said that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had "poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against [[Bashar al-Assad|Al-Assad]]".&lt;ref name="biden"/&gt;

The block occurred on 30 April 2017, two weeks after the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkish constitutional referendum]], which was held on 16 April.

On 25 April, Turkey [[April 2017 Turkish airstrikes in Syria and Iraq|conducted several airstrikes]] on [[YPG]], [[YPJ]], and [[PKK]] facilities in both Syria and Iraq (Sinjar). 40 militants, including five [[Peshmerga]] soldiers, were killed at Iraq's [[Sinjar Mountains]], and more than 20 YPG and YPJ fighters were killed on Syria's [[Mount Karakoc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-may-hit-ypg-in-syria-all-of-a-sudden-president-erdogan.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=112570|title=Turkey may hit YPG in Syria 'all of a sudden': President Erdoğan|newspaper=Hürriyet Daily News|date=30 April 2017|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) threatened to withdraw from the [[Raqqa campaign (2016–2017)|operation to capture Raqqa]] if the United States did not take measures to stop Turkey's airstrikes against the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrttv.com/en/Details.aspx?Jimare=14156|title=YPG threatens to withdraw from Raqqa ops amid Turkish attacks|date=28 April 2017|publisher=NRT TV|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the US began to patrol the border alongside SDF troops in order to force a ceasefire between its two allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cp24.com/world/turkey-u-s-move-armored-vehicles-onto-either-side-of-syrian-border-1.3390978|title=Turkey, U.S. move armored vehicles onto either side of Syrian border|first=Zeynep1|last1=Bilginsoy|first2=Sarah El|last2=Deeb|work=CP24|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aranews.net/2017/04/turkey-attacks-rojava-to-impede-anti-isis-operations-in-raqqa-western-sdf-volunteer/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429050834/http://www.aranews.net/2017/04/turkey-attacks-rojava-to-impede-anti-isis-operations-in-raqqa-western-sdf-volunteer/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 April 2017|title=Turkey attacks Rojava to impede anti-ISIS operations in Raqqa: Western SDF volunteer - ARA News|date=30 April 2017|work=ARA News|access-date=30 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal context==
[[Internet regulation in Turkey#Internet law|Law No. 5651]], known as the Internet Act (IA), was enacted on 4 May 2007.&lt;ref name="WIPO LAW 5651"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11035|title=Turkey: Law No. 5651 on Regulating Broadcasting in the Internet and Fighting Against Crimes Committed through Internet Broadcasting|publisher=WIPO|language=en|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this law was described by the now-defunct [[Presidency of Telecommunication and Communication]] as follows: "There are two reasons for the law to be brought. The first reason: to determine the liability and the responsibility of collective use providers, access providers, location providers, and content providers, which are the main actors of the Internet. The other reason is to determine the procedures and fundamentals related to the specific crimes committed over the Internet and fighting these through content, location and access providers."&lt;ref name="PTC REGULATIONS INTERNET"&gt;{{cite web|last=Presidency of Telecommunication, communication|first=PTC|title=Information about the regulations of the content of the Internet|url=http://m.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html|publisher=PTC|access-date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140322223329/http://m.tib.gov.tr/en/en-menu-47-information_about_the_regulations_of_the_content_of_the_internet.html#|archive-date=22 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the law has been used to censor individuals, journalists and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cyber-rights.org/reports/internet_restricted_bw.pdf|title=Internet : restricted access : a critical assessment of Internet content regulation and censorship in Turkey|last=Yaman|first=Akdeniz|last2=Kerem|first2=Altiparmak|date=November 2008|publisher=Imaj Kitabevi &amp; Imaj Yayinevi|isbn=9789758752652|oclc=488655521}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 127,000 websites are estimated to have been blocked in Turkey, along with another 95,000 individual web pages.&lt;ref name="Turks Click"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/world/europe/turkey-wikipedia-ban-recep-tayyip-erdogan.html|title=Turks Click Away, but Wikipedia Is Gone|last=Kingsley|first=Patrick|work=The New York Times|date=June 10, 2017|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Block==
On the morning of 29 April 2017, following news from [[Turkey Blocks]] that all language editions of Wikipedia had been blocked in Turkey,&lt;ref name="tb"/&gt; several websites published articles about the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-blocks-wikipedia-as-threat-to-national-security.php|title=Turkey blocks Wikipedia as threat to national security|work=Jurist|language=en|date=29 April 2017|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuters]] and the [[BBC]] reported that the Turkish authorities had blocked all access to Wikipedia in the country beginning at 5:00 AM GMT. Turkey's [[Information and Communication Technologies Authority]] simply stated: "After technical analysis and legal consideration based on the Law Nr. [sic] 5651 [governing the internet], an administrative measure has been taken for this website."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-internet-wikipedia-idUSKBN17V06Q|title=Turkey blocks access to Wikipedia|date=29 April 2017|publisher=Reuters|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; 
Users reported that they could only access Wikipedia using tools such as private [[VPN]]s.&lt;ref name="dw1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/t%C3%BCrkei-blockiert-wikipedia-zugang/a-38637209|title=Türkei blockiert Wikipedia-Zugang|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=de|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/internet-zensur-unter-erdogan-tuerkische-regierung-blockiert-wikipedia_id_7051698.html|title=Internet-Zensur unter Erdogan: Türkei blockiert Wikipedia|work=FOCUS Online|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale and demands==
[[Voice of America]] reported that Turkish media had explained the block was a result of "terror-related content".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/monitors-turkey-blocks-access-to-wikipedia/3830869.html|title=Monitors: Turkey Blocks Access to Wikipedia|publisher=VOA|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to an email statement made by the Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications Ministry, Turkish News source Anadolu Agency reported that the block was due to its articles and comments describing Turkey's [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War|alleged involvement with terror groups]]. The ministry said, "Instead of coordinating against terrorism, it has become part of an information source which is running a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena."&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/science-technology/turkey-wikipedia-blocked-for-disregarding-the-law/808072|title=Turkey: Wikipedia blocked for disregarding the law|website=Anadolu Agency|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After court objection by [[Bilgi University]] professor Yaman Akdeniz, the Ankara 2nd Civil Court of Peace said that the causes of the block were the following articles on the English Wikipedia:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/wikipedia-turkiye-icin-sansur-uygulayacak-mi/3836245.html|title=Wikipedia Türkiye İçin 'Sansür' Uygulayacak mı?|last=Yazıcıoğlu|first=Yıldız|work=Amerikanın Sesi|date=3 May 2017|language=tr|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{sectionlink|State-sponsored terrorism|Turkey}}
*{{sectionlink|Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War|Turkey}}

On 11 May 2017, Turkish Transport Minister [[Ahmet Arslan (politician)|Ahmet Arslan]] cited Wikipedia's featuring "content creating a perception that Turkey is supporting terrorist organizations" as a reason for the block.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey warned Wikipedia over content, demands it open office: minister|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-internet-wikipedia-idUSKBN1870RB|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=14 May 2017|date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a BBC report, the ''[[Hürriyet|Hurriyet]]'' daily newspaper said that Ankara had asked Wikipedia to remove the offending content, adding that the access ban would be lifted if Wikipedia met Turkey's demands.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Later in the day, the provisional "administrative measure" was replaced by a court order, issued by the Ankara 1st Criminal Court of Peace, blocking Wikipedia as a "protective measure".&lt;ref name="tb"/&gt;

According to a report by the Anadolu Agency, the country "has a history of demanding that international websites take such steps as having a representative office in the country, complying with principles of international law, implementing court rulings, and not being part of any smear campaign or operation in Turkey".&lt;ref name="aa" /&gt;

On 3 May 2017, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] submitted an objection to the block to Ankara's 1st Penal Court of Peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/wikipedia-takes-the-first-legal-step-against-turkey-s-ban-157904.html |title=Wikipedia takes the first legal step against Turkey's ban |website=[[Birgün]] Daily|date=3 May 2017|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was rejected by the court on 5 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/wikipedia-itirazi-reddedildi.html|title=Wikipedia itirazı reddedildi|website=Ensonhaber|language=tr|date=5 May 2017|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling stated that the country-wide block would continue as the "offending" pages had not been removed. The head of Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority, Omer Fatih Sayan, explained: "It is not possible to open access to Wikipedia so long as the decisions are not implemented."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/05/turkey-wikipedia-censorship/|title=Turkish court backs censorship of Wikipedia|author=LeFebvre, Rob|publisher=engadget|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) published the following official statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=BTK|user=BTKbasin|number=858628447278694401|date=5 May 2017|title=BTK official statement on twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Despite all the efforts, the content that falsely claims Turkey's support for terrorist organizations was not removed from Wikipedia.
*This content was not allowed to be edited with accurate information.
*Since Wikipedia broadcasts in [[HTTPS]] protocol, it is technically impossible to filter by individual URLs to block only relevant content.
*Therefore, the entire Wikipedia content had to be filtered.
*Wikipedia editors must do what is necessary for this and similar content.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Withdrawal of Jimmy Wales' invitation==
On 2 May 2017, [[Istanbul|Istanbul Municipality]] removed [[Jimmy Wales]], the founder of Wikipedia, from the guest list at the World Cities Expo event on [[smart cities]] to be held in the city from 15 to 18 May 2017, making the following announcement: "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was disinvited [sic] from the 'World Cities Expo Event' and the decision has been communicated to him.

==Reactions==
[[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) parliamentarians criticized the block, with [[Eren Erdem]] stating that the ban puts "Turkey in line with North Korea" and [[Barış Yarkadaş]] calling it "censorship and a violation of the right to access information".&lt;ref name="abc1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-turkey-wikipedia-20170429-story.html|title=Access to Wikipedia blocked by government in Turkey|last=Bilginsoy|first=Zeynep|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=29 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Twitter|tweet]] made on the first day of the block, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for those criticizing the decision as censorship, saying "Access to information is a fundamental human right.

[[File:Italian Wikipedia against Turkey's censorship (Screenshot 2017-05-08).jpg|thumb|[[Italian Wikipedia]] against Turkey's censorship]]
On 9 January 2018, Republican People's Party deputy [[Sezgin Tanrıkulu]] submitted a written parliamentary question regarding the block of Wikipedia, saying that it is against the Turkish constitution and European Convention on Human Right, and that "the block should be partial according to Turkish laws". Minister of transport, maritime and communication [[Ahmet Arslan (politician)|Ahmet Arslan]] denied that Wikipedia is blocked completely and he stated that the Wikipedia block is just partial due to Article 22 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]] and [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/bakan-arslandan-flas-wikipedia-aciklamasi-411883.html|title=Bakan Arslan'dan flaş Wikipedia açıklaması|website=yeniakit|language=tr|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[NDTV]] said that the move caused strong reactions on [[social media]] against the decision to deny access to "one of the world's most popular websites".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/turkish-authorities-block-access-to-wikipedia-monitor-1687466|title=Turkish Authorities Block Access To Wikipedia: Monitor|publisher=NDTV|date=29 April 2017|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months into the block, Wikimedia Foundation Communication Director Juliet Barbara published an article about the efforts to remove the access ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Six months later: People of Turkey still denied access to Wikipedia | url = https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/11/01/turkey-wikipedia-block/ | last = Barbara | first = Juliet | website = Wikimedia Vakfı | accessdate = 7 Nov 2017 | language=en-EN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year and a day into the block, on 30 April 2018, [[İYİ Party]] in a reference to the [[Turkish general election, 2018]], vowed to host the "reopening of Wikipedia" with "all of Turkey's citizens" on the day after snap elections on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/iyi-party-vows-to-reopen-access-to-wikipedia-if-elected-131103|title=İYİ Party vows to reopen access to Wikipedia if elected|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muharrem İnce]], [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]]'s presidential candidate for the [[Turkish presidential election, 2018|2018 Turkish presidential election]], also vowed to reopen Wikipedia during one of his campaign speeches on 22 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/you-will-tweet-freely-if-i-am-elected-chp-candidate-ince-132220|title=You will tweet freely if I am elected: CHP candidate İnce|website=Hürriyet Daily News|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the election was won by the incumbent, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].

==Alternative access methods==
Activists have created a [[website mirror|copy]] of Turkish Wikipedia on the [[InterPlanetary File System]] (IPFS)—a way of addressing web content which the Turkish government cannot block due to its usage of [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]] [[open-source software|open-source]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey Can’t Block This Copy of Wikipedia|url=http://observer.com/2017/05/turkey-wikipedia-ipfs/|publisher=Observer|accessdate=14 May 2017|date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia’nın Engellenemeyen Türkçe Sürümü Yayına Girdi!|url=http://www.webtekno.com/wikipedia-nin-engellenemeyen-turkce-surumu-yayina-girdi-h28961.html|website=Webtekno|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=tr-TR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia’nın ‘Engellenemeyen Türkçe Sürümünü’ Çıkardılar!|url=https://www.entertusu.net/wikipedianin-engellenemeyen-turkce-surumunu-cikardilar-h2813|website=www.entertusu.net|accessdate=14 May 2017|language=tr-TR}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish- and English-language mirror website TurkceWiki.org, which is unaffiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation, is among several [[Wikipedia mirrors]] available to Turkish users unable to access Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pirate-wikipedia-launched-in-turkey-after-access-ban.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=117695&amp;NewsCatID=374 |title=‘Pirate’ Wikipedia launched in Turkey after access ban - SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror site, nevertheless, omitted the "offending" sections that the Turkish authorities wanted removed from Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://en.turkcewiki.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War] and [http://en.turkcewiki.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlestar.net/2017/06/mirror-websites-are-helping-turkish-users-reconnect-to-wikipedia/|title=Mirror Websites Are Helping Turkish Users Reconnect to Wikipedia|last=Geybullayeva|first=Arzu|date=29 June 2017|work=The Seattle Star|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To access the “mirrored” version, users type a “0” (zero) before “wikipedia” in the URL to access all Wikipedia content.&lt;ref name=hurriyet/&gt;

BASIC currently has projects related to the [[Trident nuclear programme#Trident renewal|UK Trident nuclear weapons debate]], non-proliferation in the Middle East, and reframing the nuclear weapons debate. BASIC is also linked with the UK [[all-party parliamentary group]] on Global Security and Non-Proliferation. BASIC published the final report of the [http://www.basicint.org/tridentcommission Trident Commission] in July 2014, an independent and cross-party commission, co-chaired by [[Des Browne|Lord Browne of Ladyton]], [[Malcolm Rifkind|Sir Malcolm Rifkind]], and [[Menzies Campbell|Sir Menzies Campbell]], examining the complexity of issues and options facing the UK government in the decision on its nuclear deterrent and its non-proliferation policy. The report recommended the continuation of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|British nuclear program]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|title=Trident gets thumbs up in report that will dismay anti-nuclear campaigners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/01/trident-nuclear-missile-renewal-study|accessdate=2014-01-07|work=The Guardian|date=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; conditional upon a number of actions needed to mitigate the negative impacts. 

==British-American composition==

The '''Bulavin Rebellion''' '''([[Astrakhan]] Revolt)''' is the name given to a war 
of [[Don Cossacks]] against [[Imperial Russia]] between the years 1707 and 1708. The war was led by [[Kondraty Bulavin]], a democratically elected [[Ataman]] of [[Don Cossacks]]. The war was triggered by a number of underlying tensions between the Imperial government under [[Peter I of Russia]], the [[Cossacks]], and Russian peasants fleeing from [[serfdom]] in Russia to gain freedom in the autonomous Don area. It started with the assassination of Prince Yury [[Dolgorukov]], the leader of Imperial army's [[punitive expedition]] to the Don area, by Don Cossacks under Bulavin's command. The end of the rebellion is associated with Bulavin's death in 1708.

==Underlying causes==
A number of social grievances were prevalent in the [[peasant]] population of [[Russia]] in the years leading up to the Bulavin Rebellion.  [[Peter the Great]]'s radical reforms designed to "Westernize" old [[Muscovy]] in the 18th century were met with widespread discontent.  The pious, deeply [[conservative]] masses saw his reforms as an affront to their traditional way of life and to their [[Eastern Orthodox]] faith.  Peter was even equated to the [[Anti-Christ]] and assumed to be an impostor posing as the true [[Tsar]].  On top of this, Peter's newly formed [[police state]] was expanding territorially, and by this expansion was encroaching upon salt resource sites coveted by the Cossacks for preservation of their foods.  This dispute over land was in one sense an economic issue, but the [[Cossacks]] also regarded this as an intrusion upon their semi-autonomous political state.  In general, the entire rural Russian atmosphere was in an agitated state, waiting for a catalyst of some kind.

==Immediate catalyst==
In response to the constraints and fears of living in Peter's [[police state]], large numbers of [[serf]]s absconded, abandoning the major [[urban area|urban]] areas, especially [[Moscow]] and the new capital at [[St. Petersburg]].  While some groups emigrated to [[Poland]] or [[Austria]], many chose to avoid the border patrols and instead fled to the rural periphery and the river regions already inhabited by the Cossacks.  It was Peter's policy to hunt down and arrest absconders and return them to their lords where they could be counted for taxes, a policy which, by this time, had no statute of limitations.  In accordance with this policy, Peter deployed a group of [[bounty hunter]]s under Yuri Dolgoruki&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Vladimirovich Dolgoruki, a nonnotable ''[[knyaz]]'', not to be confused with [[Yuri Dolgoruki]]&lt;/ref&gt; to scout the Cossack regions for fugitive peasants.  Despite the fact that the Cossacks harbored some resentment towards the peasants (for overpopulating their region and generally competing for local resources), more deplorable to them was the idea of Petrine agents roaming freely through their territory.  They not only refused to give up the fugitive peasants, but on 8 October 1707 a small band of local ''[[ataman]]s'' headed by Kondraty Bulavin ambushed and murdered Dolgoruki and his men in the village of Shulgin on the [[Aidar River]], opening the door to violence and beginning the Bulavin Rebellion.

==Bulavin the Man==
[[File:Starocherkassk bulavin.jpg|right|thumb|Kondraty Bulavin house, Starocherkassk]]
Little is known about Bulavin personally, but he was born into a Cossack family and would have been old enough to remember [[Stenka Razin]] and the revolt of the late 17th century.  He developed some combat experience fighting the [[Kuban]] and [[Crimean Tatars]] in his youth.  However, he was never a particularly great military commander, and throughout the rebellion that bears his name, he would forever fall short of becoming an undisputed leader.  By 1704, he had risen to the status of [[ataman]] of [[Bakhmut]], a position he held until 1706.  It was during this stint that he orchestrated and participated in the destruction of the salt works on the [[Severski Donets]], an act of retaliation for having been evicted by the government as [[squatter]]s.  This conflict was never entirely resolved and was ultimately absorbed into the greater rebellion as it gained momentum.  Bulavin was most likely illiterate, but like his contemporary revolutionaries, he possessed a talent for appealing to the people and inciting them to action.

==General details==
Bulavin's rally cries were simple: the goal was to move against Moscow and destroy the evil influences on the [[Tsar]].  It is important to note that the rebellion was not against the institution of Tsardom but against the figures in power at the time.  It was generally believed that Peter was either not who he claimed (i.e. the [[Antichrist]] sitting in place of the true Tsar who was hidden away), or that he was indeed the rightful Tsar but was under the control of evil advisers whose destruction would liberate him, and that if given the freedom to act, he would repudiate all of his wicked reforms.

The rebellion suffered from a number of weaknesses.  For one, despite all of his rallying, Bulavin never offered a [[pretender]] to the throne or suggested a ''just tsar'' to replace Peter.  This blunder would condemn the rebellion's end goals to ambiguity and would let slip an immeasurable amount of support he might have mustered.  Second, Bulavin did not coordinate his efforts with any other pre-existing Muscovite enemies, so [[Great Northern War|despite being heavily engaged in war]] with [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the  military apparatus under Peter was not as divided as it could have been and found the rebellion to be more of a nuisance than a major conflict.  By means of its vastly superior size and efficiency, the regular army was ultimately capable of stamping out the rebellion at all levels.  In the end, angered by devastating reversals and Bulavin's tiring claims, factions of his own Cossack followers turned against him.  He was found dead on 7 July 1708, having been shot in the head.  It is not known whether the wound was self-inflicted or an act of treachery.  Following Bulavin's death, the rebellion petered out, with pockets of resistance persisting through 1709, but for all intents and purposes, the conflict was over.

==Political and social aftermath==
As mentioned, the Bulavin Rebellion bore striking similarities to [[Razin]]'s Revolt a generation earlier.  Both were Cossack rebellions in part, aimed against an imposing governmental institution and driven by animosity for the miserable state of peasant life.  They effectively set the stage for the [[Pugachev Uprising]] under [[Catherine the Great]].

In response to the uprising, Peter tightened his grip on the Cossack states, causing some 2000 under [[Ignat Nekrasov]] to flee to the protection of the [[Crimean Khanate]].  Descendants of these [[Nekrasovites]] would relocate to [[Anatolia]] during the [[Pugachev Uprising]] and settle near [[Constantinople]], where their traditional [[culture]] would continue to the present day.

'''Clouding agents''' or '''Cloudy Agent'''/'''Cloudifier''' are a type of [[food additive]] used to make beverages such as fruit juices to look more cloudy, and thus more natural-looking and visually appealing, typically by creating an [[emulsion]] of oil droplets. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hj-rise.com/emulsified.html#cloudifier|title= Cloudifier introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural fruit juices are often opalescent. Its turbidity is caused by the protein, oil or pectin particles from plant cell fragments. And consumers would expect the appearance of fruit flavored beverages to have similar color performance as natural fruit juice. To mimic the visual effect, low-juice content soft drinks would add clouding agent in it.

Common clouding agents include [[palm oil]], [[Arabic gum]] and extracts of [[citrus fruits]], and some would use [[Titanium Dioxide]] to enhance their color strength. Recent studies showed Titanium Dioxide might have risk when in nano-particles size.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27680428|title= Risk assessment of titanium dioxide nanoparticles via oral exposure, including toxicokinetic considerations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/03/29/EFSA-to-evaluate-titanium-dioxide-safety-studies|title= EFSA to evaluate titanium dioxide safety studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The illegal use of the [[plasticizer]] [[DEHP]] in clouding agents has been reported in Taiwan on [[2011_Taiwan_food_scandal|2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/05/29/2003504450|title=FOOD SCARE WIDENS:Tainted additives used for two decades: manufacturer|author=Juan Yi-yu |author2=Wei Yi-chia |author3=Hung Su-ching|date=May 29, 2011|publisher=The Taipei Times.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is pervasive at all levels of government in [[Iraq]]. Public survey from [[Transparency International]] indicates that a majority of general public is not satisfied with the government's current efforts in fighting corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 169th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
Political parties and public servants are considered corrupt, and petty corruption is highly institutionalized in [[Iraq]]i society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption is considered an obstacle for doing business in [[Iraq]], and red tape and inefficiency continue to persist. Government contracting is an area reported to be affected by high-levels of illicit activity, and public contracts are often awarded to companies connected to political leaders. Investors may come under pressure to take on well-connected local partners to avoid [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/iraq/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate= 14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Policy Debate}}
A '''counterplan''' is a component of debate theory commonly employed in the activity of parliamentary and policy debate. While some conceptions of debate theory require the negative position in a [[debate]] to defend the [[status quo]] against an [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative]] position or plan, a counterplan allows the negative to defend a separate plan or an advocacy. It also allows the aff to run [[Disadvantage|disadvantages]] against the neg.

The modern counterplan was invented by Jishnu Guha-Majumdar while debating at the [[University of Texas]].

==Topicality==

Most forms of debate begin from some [[Resolution (debate)|resolution]] or statement of advocacy. As the affirmative plan affirms the [[Resolution (debate)|resolution]] in theory or at least within the sphere of its distinct existence, it is reasonable to assume that the negative team must advocate the negation of the resolution, usually either through the defense of the [[status quo]] or a counterplan distinct from the resolutional advocacy. However, in many circles, the affirmative ability to select their specific plan gives the negative justification to select another topical plan, so long it is 'competitive' with the plan. Advocates of this view, which has become increasingly popular in national circuit high school debate, believe that once the affirmative selects its specific plan so long as it is topical, it abandons any further tie to the resolution and cedes the remaining ground of advocacy to the negative. Moreover, they argue that if topical ground is exclusively affirmative, then the negative could be allowed to attack other potential examples of the resolution that might not be as advantageous as the affirmative plan.  This conception is related to the debate paradigm and [[argumentation theory]] concept of [[hypothesis testing]].

There is also a small subset of debate theory that asserts that ''only'' topical counterplans should be allowed.  This theory is often called ''Plan-Plan'' and argues that the affirmative should have the burden to prove that its policy is the best example of the resolution.  The negative should be restricted to offering ''topical'' counterplans that provide greater benefits than the plan.  This theory rejects traditional formulations of ''competition'' and argues that the affirmative should be prepared to attack the counterplan alone in comparison to the plan because it falls within the accepted and predictable wording of the resolution. While this view has some aggressive adherents, it has not been exceptionally popular in most circles.

==Competition==
A counterplan must 'compete' with the affirmative plan in order to be considered a reason to reject the affirmative. Although competition is a difficult and controversial theoretical concept, it is most often defined as the following: The counterplan must be superior (and not equal) to both the plan and any possible combination of the plan and counterplan.  A plan and counterplan that are labelled [[mutually exclusive]] are structurally competitive in totality, meaning that the two plan actions are contradictory and could not logically coexist.  Tests of competition in terms of potential combinations of plan and counterplan are called ''permutations'', or ''perm''s in debate slang. The most common form of permutation and the immediate test of competition is the "Do Both" permutation, testing the total combination of the plan and counterplan in comparison to the counterplan alone.

There are two types of permutation that are especially controversial:
*'''Severance permutations'''&amp;mdash;Severance permutations attempt to do ''part of the plan and all or part of the counterplan'' and thus "sever" out of part of the plan.
*'''Intrinsicness permutations'''&amp;mdash;Intrinsicness permutations attempt to do ''all of the plan, all or part of the counterplan, and something in neither the plan nor the counterplan.''  Their rationale is that the counterplan is not intrinsically competitive with the plan because the added actions make it possible to achieve the benefits of both the plan and the counterplan.

However, there are two different theories to evaluate what constitutes severance and intrinsicness&amp;mdash;textual competition and functional competition, also sometimes called mechanical competition. Textual competition theory states that the counterplan may not textually be plan plus; put another way: a legitimate permutation may combine the texts of the plan and the counterplan.  For example if the plan text was "''Pass the farm bill''" and the counterplan text was "''Don't pass the farm bill''" the affirmative would be permitted to say: "permutation: do the counterplan" on the grounds that it was textually plan plus.  The fact that "ban the plan" is not on face competitive is one of the main arguments against textual competition, although its proponents claim that such counterplans could be rephrased to be textually competitive.

Functional competition evaluates the ''function'' of the plan and counterplan rather than their ''text''.  For example, perming the "ban the plan" counterplan would constitute functional severance even though it does not constitute textual severance.

Functional and textual competition govern how severance and intrinsicness are determined. For example, a '''logical permutation''' is ''textually but not functionally intrinsic'' because it includes something which is logically but not textually included in the counterplan.  Additionally, there are also permutations which are ''functionally but not textually intrinsic''.  For example, textually permutating an [[agent counterplan]] may functionally include an element of cooperation functionally in neither the plan nor the counterplan without being textually intrinsic.

Likewise, permuting the "ban the plan" counterplan is ''functionally but not textually severance'' because the plan does not happen in the world of the permutation even though the permutation includes both the plan and the counterplan text. Permutations which are ''textually but not functionally'' severance are rare, but possible. For example, one type of counterplan is 'The' Word PIC, which advocates doing the affirmative plan without the word 'the' before the phrase 'United States Federal Government.' Such a plan is textually but not functionally competitive; if the Affirmative team wins that counterplans must be both textually and functionally competitive, then they can permute this counterplan. Such a permutation would be textual but not functional severance.

==Counterplan Status==
As the negative gains a substantial power by having the ability to run counterplans, the affirmative naturally insists on some limitations to their use.  Should the negative be able to run multiple counterplans that they can jettison at any time?  Should there be any limitations on the ability of the negative to shift from advocating a counter-plan back to the ''status-quo'' or to another counter-plan or advocacy stance such as a kritik? The counter-plan ''status'' is a set of conditions, albeit often vaguely defined in practice, that the negative grants will define its ability to advocate one or more counterplans. The affirmative will usually inquire about the counter-plan during the Cross-Examination after the 1NC or after whatever speech the counter-plan was run.

===Conditional===
A conditional counterplan status means that negative accepts little or no limitation on its ability to advocate counterplans.  Although this usually does ''not'' mean that the negative can change the text of a counterplan, it does mean that the negative believes it has the theoretical justification to abandon the advocacy of a counterplan at any point during the debate round.  Many debates are won and lost on "theory" arguments, about the legitimacy of conditional counterplans or kritiks. Conditionality is now commonly accepted as legitimate in the policy debate community, but in the 1970s it was not.

====Conditionality Bad Arguments====
Conditionality bad is always argued by the affirmative team.  If the affirmative wins conditionality is illegitimate it will usually win the entire debate round.  Common arguments include claim that being able to choose which arguments to ignore and which to continue wastes their time and creates a "moving target".  Simply put, the affirmative cannot know what the negative will choose to argue at the end of the round, and therefore some of the arguments they answer probably will not continue to the end of the round.  These argument falls under a "fairness" claim.  Most arguments will actually be under "education" claims.  Affirmatives will claim conditionality is noneducational because it allows negative teams to make bad or inconsistent arguments and then ignore them later.  More importantly, it can put the affirmative in a position where certain arguments they make can be turned against them.  For instance if the negative runs an [[Disadvantage#Other types of D/As|economy disadvantage]] and a kritik of capitalism.  The affirmative cannot say they actually help the economy because this would link them to the kritik of capitalism.  They also cannot say they decrease capitalism because they would then link to the economy disadvantage.

====Conditionality Good Arguments====
Conditionality good is always argued by the negative team.  If the negative wins conditionality is legitimate it usually means that they are allowed to advocate their conditional counterplans and/or kritiks.  Common arguments will say that the affirmative has an infinite amount of time to prepare for the debate round, while the negative does not know what affirmative will be defended until the round.  Negatives also make the claim that fairness arguments cannot be evaluated because there will always be some amount of unfairness in debate.  To answer education arguments, negative teams will claim that conditionality is real world, because policy makers often decide between more than two options.  They may also argue that all the negative has to do is prove the affirmative's plan is a bad idea, and it does not matter how they do this.  Finally, negative will often argue that even if the affirmative is correct about conditionality being bad, it is not a reason for them to lose the entire round, it is only a reason that their conditional arguments should not be voted for.

===Unconditional===
An unconditional counterplan status represents a commitment by the negative to advocate the counterplan at the end of the round.  Negatives often run unconditional counterplans when they want to emphasize their confidence in their arguments or want to avoid debating theory arguments (especially on otherwise particularly abusive counterplans).  There is some dispute about whether the negative can ultimately advocate the alternative vision of a kritik if it has already run an unconditional counterplan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}  Also if negative chooses to argue that the affirmative is not topical in the final speech, it is rarely considered a violation of its commitment to defend the counterplan.

===Dispositional===
Originally offered as a milder form of conditionality that ruled out multiple counterplans and locked the affirmative and negative into two policy options each: the counterplan and/or the status quo for the negative; the plan and/or the permutation for the affirmative.  This formulation has the benefit of avoiding the irrational decisionmaker problem of ''unconditionality'', which would require the judge to vote for a plan that is a bad idea to avoid a counterplan that is a worse idea.

More recently, "dispositionality" has become an umbrella term for an express contract between the teams, generally clarified in 1NC cross-examination.  The agreement usually entails a negative commitment to the counterplan provided that the affirmative is willing to compare it to the affirmative without making any conditional statements. The negative can be conditional if the affirmative begins it (i.e. making a permutation, thus making it conditional in that the affirmative can defend either the plan or permutation). A new form of dispositionality has also been that the negative can kick the counterplan if the affirmative straight turns the counterplan.

In practice, there is a great deal of vagueness about dispositionality (for example, what exactly constitutes a permutation?), and therefore it is important for the affirmative to clarify this as best they can.  If the negative refuses to clarify, the affirmative can simply use this to indict the negative claim that it has run the counterplan fairly, perhaps on some other theory argument in the debate or on the counterplan.

==Types==

===Plan Inclusive===
[[Plan inclusive counterplan]]s (PICs) enact some or all parts of the Affirmative plan.  Counterplans that are 100% plan-inclusive have only shaky competition claims, usually resting on dense theory.

===Delay===
A delay counterplan passes the plan on a specified future date or contingent on a specified future event, claiming net benefits from short-term disadvantages (typically [[disadvantage#The Politics Disadvantage|politics]], and especially the Elections variant).

===Consult===
A consult counterplan has another entity (other governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, etc.) overview, and possibly make revisions to the Affirmative plan. If the entity approves the plan, it is passed by the original [[actor (Policy Debate)|actor]]. If it is rejected, the actor does not pass the plan.  Consult counterplans generally have a net benefit of improved relations with the consulted actor or body. An example would be for the [[European Union]] to review the plan, make revisions, and have the actor follow the EU's suggestions.

===Exclusionary===
An exclusionary counterplan only enacts certain parts of the Affirmative plan.  The Net Benefits are based on the parts excluded. There is some dispute as to the legitimacy of Exclusion PICs - supporters say the affirmative should be prepared to defend their advocacy, while opponents say negative teams can find ''something'' wrong with any plan and that exclusion PICs are abusive.

===Agent===
An [[agent counterplan]] has the affirmative plan be enacted by a different actor (other governments, [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, the [[U.S. state|fifty states]], etc.), or through cooperation with other actors (such as the [[European Union]], or [[India]]).  Net benefits are usually solvency boosts, which can include better execution, increased effectiveness, shorter timeframe, less corruption, and in the case of cooperation counterplans, increased relations with participating actors.  An example would be for the fifty states to enact the plan, with the benefit being a rebalancing of [[federalism]].  Some (beginning with the 1975 Lichtman and Rohrer "A general theory of the counterplan" through Michael Korcok and Paul Strait with Brett Wallance most recently) have argued the kind of fiat involved with these counterplans is inconsistent with the logic of decision making.

===Plan Exclusive===
A plan exclusive counterplan (PEC) does not use the affirmative plan, but still is competitive to the plan.  If the affirmative plan uses the [[United States]] as an actor, an example of a PEC would be to disband the U.S. Government.  This type of counterplan provides very clear competition with the affirmative plan simply because the two are mutually exclusive.  The judge must choose either plan or counterplan. This kind of counterplan is favored by debaters who combine counterplans with kritiks such that the alternative of the criticism is a counterplan (e.g., countering an affirmative that increases the number of members of the United States Armed Forces with a kritik of militarism and a counterplan to disband the United States Armed Forces).

===Advantage===
An advantage counterplan is a counterplan that only solves for one of the affirmative's advantages. The negative either has to then turn the other advantage's solvency or impact or run a disadvantage or kritik that doesn't link to the counterplan, which is the net benefit to the counterplan.

Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==
[[File:The Railway Museum 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A railway museum in Japan displays antique locomotives.]]
Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

The '''economic policy''' of [[government]]s covers the systems for setting levels of [[taxation]], [[government budgets]], the [[money supply]] and [[interest rates]] as well as the [[labour market]], [[nationalization|national ownership]], and many other areas of government interventions into the economy.

Most factors of economic policy can be divided into either [[fiscal policy]], which deals with government actions regarding taxation and spending, or [[monetary policy]], which deals with central banking actions regarding the money supply and interest rates.

Such policies are often influenced by [[International organization|international institutions]] like the [[International Monetary Fund]] or [[World Bank]] as well as [[political]] beliefs and the consequent [[policy|policies]] of [[Political party|parties]].

==Types of economic policy==
Almost every aspect of government has an important economic component. A few examples of the kinds of economic policies that exist include:&lt;ref&gt;Walter Plosila, "State Science- and Technology-Based Economic Development Policy: History, Trends and Developments, and Future Directions," Economic Development Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 2, May 2004, pp. 113-126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Macroeconomic stabilization policy, which attempts to keep the [[money supply]] growing at a rate that does not result in excessive inflation, and attempts to smooth out the [[business cycle]].
*[[Trade|Trade policy]], which refers to [[tariffs]], [[trade agreement]]s and the international institutions that govern them.
*Policies designed to create [[economic growth]]
**Policies related to [[development economics]]
*Policies dealing with the [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution]] of income, property and/or wealth
*As well as: [[regulatory]] policy, [[anti-trust]] policy, [[industrial policy]] and technology-based economic development policy

==Macroeconomic stabilization policy==
[[Stabilization policy]] attempts to stimulate an economy out of recession or constrain the [[money supply]] to prevent excessive inflation.
*[[Fiscal policy]], often tied to [[Keynesian economics]], uses government spending and taxes to guide the economy.
**Fiscal stance: The size of the deficit or surplus
**[[Tax|Tax policy]]: The taxes used to collect government income.
**[[Government spending]] on just about any area of government
*[[Monetary policy]] controls the value of currency by lowering the supply of money to control inflation and raising it to stimulate economic growth. It is concerned with the amount of [[money]] in circulation and, consequently, [[interest rate]]s and [[inflation]].
**[[Interest rate]]s, if set by the Government
**[[Incomes policies]] and [[price controls]] that aim at imposing non-monetary controls on inflation
**[[Reserve requirements]] which affect the [[money multiplier]]

==Tools and goals==
Policy is generally directed to achieve particular objectives, like targets for [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], or [[economic growth]]. Sometimes other objectives, like [[military spending]] or [[nationalization]] are important.

These are referred to as the '''policy goals''': the outcomes which the economic policy aims to achieve.

To achieve these goals, governments use '''policy tools''' which are under the control of the government. These generally include the [[interest rate]] and [[money supply]], [[tax]] and government spending, tariffs, exchange rates, [[labor market]] regulations, and many other aspects of government.

===Selecting tools and goals===

Government and central banks are limited in the number of goals they can achieve in the short term. For instance, there may be pressure on the government to reduce inflation, reduce unemployment, and reduce interest rates while maintaining currency stability. If all of these are selected as goals for the short term, then policy is likely to be incoherent, because a normal consequence of reducing inflation and maintaining currency stability is increasing unemployment and increasing interest rates.

===Demand-side vs. supply-side tools===

This dilemma can in part be resolved by using microeconomic [[supply-side]] policy to help adjust markets. For instance, unemployment could potentially be reduced by altering laws relating to [[trade unions]] or [[unemployment insurance]], as well as by macroeconomic ([[Aggregate demand|demand-side]]) factors like interest rates.

==Discretionary policy vs policy rules==
For much of the 20th century, governments adopted [[discretionary policy|discretionary policies]] like [[demand management]] designed to correct the [[business cycle]]. These typically used fiscal and monetary policy to adjust inflation, output and unemployment.

However, following the [[1973–75 recession|stagflation of the 1970s]], policymakers began to be attracted to [[policy rule]]s. 

A discretionary policy is supported because it allows policymakers to respond quickly to events. However, discretionary policy can be subject to [[dynamic inconsistency]]: a government may say it intends to raise interest rates indefinitely to bring inflation under control, but then relax its stance later. This makes policy non-credible and ultimately ineffective.

A rule-based policy can be more credible, because it is more transparent and easier to anticipate. Examples of rule-based policies are fixed [[exchange rate]]s, [[interest rate rule]]s, the [[stability and growth pact]] and the [[Golden Rule (fiscal policy)|Golden Rule]]. Some policy rules can be imposed by external bodies, for instance the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] for currency. 

A compromise between strict discretionary and strict rule-based policy is to grant discretionary power to an independent body. For instance, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], [[European Central Bank]], [[Bank of England]] and [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] all set interest rates without government interference, but do not adopt rules.

Another type of non-discretionary policy is a set of policies which are imposed by an international body. This can occur (for example) as a result of intervention by the [[International Monetary Fund]].

==Economic policy through history==
{{main|Economic history}}
The first economic problem was how to gain the [[Resource (economics)|resources]] it needed to be able to perform the functions of an early government: the [[military]], [[road]]s and other projects like building the [[Pyramids]].

Early governments generally relied on [[tax]] in kind and [[forced labor]] for their economic resources. However, with the development of [[money]] came the first policy choice. A government could raise money through taxing its citizens. However, it could now also [[coin|debase the coinage]] and so increase the [[money supply]]. 

Early civilizations also made decisions about whether to permit and how to tax [[trade]]. Some early civilizations, such as [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] adopted a '''closed currency policy''' whereby foreign merchants had to exchange their coin for local money. This effectively levied a very high [[tariff]] on foreign trade.

By the early modern age, more policy choices had been developed. There was considerable debate about [[mercantilism]] and other restrictive trade practices like the [[Navigation Acts]], as trade policy became associated with both national wealth and with foreign and colonial policy.

Throughout the 19th Century, [[monetary standard]]s became an important issue. [[Gold]] and [[silver]] were in supply in different proportions. Which metal was adopted influenced the wealth of different groups in society.

===The first fiscal policy===
With the accumulation of private capital in the Renaissance, states developed methods of financing [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s without debasing their coin. The development of [[capital market]]s meant that a government could borrow money to finance war or expansion while causing less economic hardship. 

This was the beginning of modern [[fiscal policy]].

The same markets made it easy for private entities to raise [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] or sell [[stock]] to fund private initiatives.

===Business cycles===
The [[business cycle]] became a predominant issue in the 19th century, as it became clear that industrial output, employment, and profit behaved in a [[economic cycle|cyclical]] manner. One of the first proposed policy solutions to the problem came with the work of [[Keynes]], who proposed that fiscal policy could be used actively to ward off depressions, recessions and slumps.  The [[Austrian School]] of economics argues that central banks create the business cycle.

An '''elite pact, settlement''' or '''political settlement''' is an agreement or understanding between political elites which moderates the violence and winner takes all nature of unrestrained conflict.  Such settlements are often understood to transform government from an autocratic mode into more pluralistic, democratic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=John Higley, Michael Burton |title=Elite Settlements and the Taming of Politics |journal=Government and Opposition |volume=33 |issue=1 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd. |doi=10.1111/j.1477-7053.1998.tb00785.x |page=98 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcN252eB1gYC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Understanding democracy |author=Albert Breton |page=33 |chapter=Elite pacts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-521-58236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others view the political settlement as normatively neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/9968/1/Political_Settlements_internet.pdf Kahn, Mustaq 2010, Political Settlements and the Governance of Growth-enhancing Institutions, working paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept in political theory is part of [[elite theory]] and [[state-building]].  Joel Migdal has suggested that the concept of political settlements has a pedigree going back to the work of [[Barrington Moore]].  Political settlements are the frameworks for governing a state established by elites, either through formal processes or informally over time.  There are numerous definitions of political settlements and elite pacts, often including an emphasis on understandings between elites that bring about the conditions to end conflict, or maintain peace.  In 2011 the World Bank's World Development Report suggested a new terminology for political settlements with the concept of `good enough coalitions.'&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDRS/Resources/WDR2011_Full_Text.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Elite pacts can be explicitly articulated (enshrined in an evolving
document – such as a peace agreement or a constitution).

Verena Fritz and Alina Rocha Menocal published a paper in 2007 arguing that political settlements are a `domain' at the heart of all state processe.  They relate the concept to broader state theory (including the issues of elections and legitimacy).  They stress that political settlements are not one-off events but evolve over time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odi.org.uk/pppg/politics_and_governance/publications/ODI_state_building_paper.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important contributions on the establishing of political settlements in modern (particularly newly democratic) states have also been made by [[Thomas Carothers]] and Marina Ottaway of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].  Also of note is JC Scott's work `[[Seeing Like a State]]' which explores the routes through which political settlements in medieval Europe began to consolidate formal state structures.

More recently Christine Bell of the [http://www.politicalsettlements.org/ Political Settlements Research Programme] has argued that political settlements analysis is centrally concerned with how to understand and support elite pacts while enabling transformation to other forms of broader inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Christine [http://www.politicalsettlements.org/files/2015/09/20150901-PSRP-Concepts-Working-Paper-1-1.pdf 'What we talk about when we talk about Political Settlements', PSRP Working paper 1, 1 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In political science the concept of `political settlements' is distinct from short-term processes aimed at elite agreements, such as a `peace process' or `peace agreement.'  Peace negotiations and agreements may be part of the process of achieving a political settlement, but the settlement itself is the period of time for which an elite agreement holds, which could last for days or centuries.

Controversially the political scientist [[Patrick Chabal]] has suggested that the concept of political settlements is often less useful than that of `political sedimentation,' the residue of elite accommodation that is left after a period of contestation or explicit conflict, (quoted from Whaites above) see also.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/Expert-feedback.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term political settlement is now use by key development agencies, despite confusion over what exactly the term  means, and doubts over how the concept assists development actors intervene more effectively to support stable, open and inclusive political settlement.

{{History of Portugal}}

The '''''Estado Novo''''' ({{IPA-pt|(ɨ)ʃˈtadu, -ðu ˈnovu}}, "New State"), or the '''Second Republic''', was the [[Corporate statism|corporatist]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime installed in [[Portugal]] in 1933, which was considered [[fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Pais de Sousa, ''O Fascismo Catedrático de Salazar'', Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It evolved from the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' ("National Dictatorship") formed after the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|''coup d'état'' of 28 May 1926]] against the [[democracy|democratic]] but unstable [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]]. Together, the ''Ditadura Nacional'' and ''Estado Novo'' are recognised as the Second Portuguese Republic. The ''Estado Novo'', greatly inspired by [[Conservatism|conservative]] and authoritarian ideologies, was developed by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], [[President of the Council of Ministers]] of Portugal from 1932 to 1968, when he fell ill and was replaced by [[Marcelo Caetano]].

Opposed to [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[Nazism|national socialism]] and [[anti-colonialism]],{{efn|Before WWII, Salazar declared: "We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimize, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one’s country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right". Salazar criticized Fascist dictatorship that according to his opinion was leaning towards pagan Caesarism and towards a new state which recognized no limitations of legal moral order.{{sfn | Kay | 1970 | p=68}}}} the regime was [[Corporatism|corporatist]], [[conservative]], and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] in nature, defending Portugal as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a [[Pluricontinentalism|pluricontinental]] nation under the doctrine of [[lusotropicalism]], with [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and other [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese territories]] as extensions of Portugal itself, and it being a supposed [[Civilizing mission|source of civilization and stability]] to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions. Under ''Estado Novo'', Portugal [[Portuguese Colonial War|tried to perpetuate]] a vast, centuries-old empire with a total area of {{convert|2168071|km2|mi2}}, while other former colonial powers had largely already acceded to global calls for self-determination and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html Portugal Não É Um País Pequeno] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514052605/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal joined the [[United Nations]] (UN) in 1955, and was a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] (1961), and [[EFTA]] (1960). In 1968 [[Marcelo Caetano|Marcello Caetano]] was appointed the new head of government. On 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], a military ''coup'' organised by left-wing Portuguese military officers&amp;nbsp;– the [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA)&amp;nbsp;– overthrew the ''Estado Novo'' regime. Fiercely criticised by most of the international community after [[World War II]] and [[decolonisation]], it was one of the longest-surviving authoritarian regimes in Europe. By the fall of the ''Estado Novo'' in 1974, Portugal had the lowest per capita income in Western Europe, as well as the highest rate of preventable deaths and infant mortality rate in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perreira Gomes|first1=Isabel|last2=Amorim|first2=José Pedro|last3=Correira|first3=José Alberto|last4=Menezes|first4=Isabel|title=The Portuguese literacy campaigns after the Carnation Revolution (1974-1977)|journal=Journal of Social Science Education|date=1 January 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=69-80|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ1101128|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neave|first1=Guy|last2=Amaral|first2=Alberto|title=Higher Education in Portugal 1974-2009: A Nation, a Generation|date= 21 December 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-9400721340|pages=95,102|edition=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vElS1E_-9h0C&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;ots=KoO1RPYx6D&amp;dq=infant%20mortality%20rate%20portugal%201974&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=infant%20mortality%20rate%20portugal%201974&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitman|first1=Alden|title=Antonio Salazar: A Quiet Autocrat Who Held Power in Portugal for 40 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/28/archives/antonio-salazar-a-quiet-autocrat-who-held-power-in-portugal-for-40.html|accessdate=19 January 2018|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=28 July 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
{{further|Portuguese First Republic}}
King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] confirmed colonial treaties of the 19th century that stabilized the situation in [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]]. These agreements were, however, unpopular in Portugal, where they were seen as being to the disadvantage of the country. In addition, Portugal was declared bankrupt twice—first on 14 June 1892 and again on 10 May 1902—causing industrial disturbances, socialist, and republican antagonism and press criticism of the monarchy. Carlos responded by appointing [[João Franco]] as Prime Minister and subsequently accepting Parliament's dissolution. In 1908, Carlos I was [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated in Lisbon]]. The [[Portuguese monarchy]] lasted until 1910 when, through the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October revolution]], it was overthrown and Portugal was proclaimed a [[republic]]. The overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910 led to a 16-year struggle to sustain parliamentary democracy under republicanism&amp;nbsp;– the Portuguese First Republic (1910–1926).

The 28 May 1926 ''coup d'état'' or, during the period of ''Estado Novo'', the National Revolution ({{lang-pt|Revolução Nacional}}), was a military action that put an end to the chaotic Portuguese First Republic and initiated the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) (years later, renamed ''Estado Novo'').

With [[fascism|fascist]] organizations being popular and widely supported across many countries (like [[Italian Fascism]] and [[National Socialism]]) as an [[Anti-communism|antagonist]] of [[communism|communist]] ideologies, [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] developed the ''Estado Novo'' which can be described as a right leaning [[Corporate statism|corporatist]] regime of [[Fascism#Para-fascism|para-fascist]] inspiration. The basis of his regime was a platform of stability, in direct contrast to the unstable environment of the [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]]. According to some Portuguese scholars like [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDBtgA-81D4 O Maior Português de Sempre&amp;nbsp;– Oliveira Salazar (1ª Parte)], [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]] presents Salazar in [[O maior português de sempre]] ([[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]])&lt;/ref&gt; and Rui Ramos,&lt;ref name="ionline.pt"&gt;[http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/31720-historia-portugal-luta-faccoes-os-salazaristas História de Portugal. A luta de facções entre os salazaristas] "Até os americanos já o tinham abandonado, temendo "recriar o caos que existia em Portugal antes de Salazar tomar o poder".", from História de Portugal (2009), Rui Ramos, Bernardo de Vasconcelos e Sousa, and Nuno Gonçalo Monteiro, Esfera dos Livros, cited in ionline.pt&lt;/ref&gt; his early reforms and policies changed the whole nation since they allowed political and financial stability and therefore [[social order]] and [[economic growth]], after the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the [[Portuguese First Republic]] (1910–1926). After the First Republic, when not even public order was achieved, this looked like an impressive breakthrough to most of the population; Salazar achieved his height in popularity at this point. This transfiguration of Portugal was then known as ''A Lição de Salazar''&amp;nbsp;– "Salazar's Lesson". Salazar's program was opposed to [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[liberalism]]. It was pro-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[conservative]], and [[Nationalism|nationalistic]]. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a [[pluricontinental]] empire, financially autonomous and politically independent from the dominating [[superpower]]s, and a [[Civilizing mission|source of civilization and stability to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions]].

==Regime==
The ''Estado Novo'' was an authoritarian regime with an [[integralism|integralist]] orientation, which differed greatly from other [[fascism|fascist]] and [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] regimes by its lack of expansionism, lack of a fanatical leader, lack of dogmatic party structure, and more moderate use of state force.&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Aristotle A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tP2wXl5nzboC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=estado+novo+fascit&amp;source=web&amp;ots=loM9xsNU7r&amp;sig=TSgWomLAR3hTFq2XstvYIlQJC94#PPA313,M1 Fascism Reader] p. 313-317 2003
Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated, however, the principles for its military from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s system in [[Italy]]. Salazar was a Catholic traditionalist who believed in the necessity of control over the forces of economic modernization in order to defend the religious and rural values of the country, which he perceived as being threatened. One of the pillars of the regime was the [[PIDE]], the secret police. Many political dissidents were imprisoned at the [[Tarrafal camp|Tarrafal]] prison in the African archipelago of [[Cape Verde]], on the capital island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], or in local jails. Strict state censorship was in place.

Executive authority was nominally vested in a president, elected by popular vote for a five-year term.  On paper, the president was vested with sweeping executive and legislative powers, making him a virtual dictator. In practice, however, the real power was held by the prime minister, Salazar. The legislature was a unicameral [[National Assembly of Portugal|National Assembly]], elected every four years. An advisory body, the [[Corporative Chamber]], nominally represented economic, social and cultural organizations. While opposition candidates theoretically could stand for office after 1945, in practice the system was so heavily rigged in favour of the official party, the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]], that they had no realistic chance of winning.

The ''Estado Novo'' enforced nationalist and conservative Roman Catholic values on the Portuguese population. The whole education system was focused toward the exaltation of the Portuguese nation and its five-century old overseas territories (the ''Ultramar''). The motto of the regime was ''"Deus, Pátria e Família"'' (meaning "God, Fatherland, and Family", and obviously intended as a counterpart to the [[French Revolution]]'s ''"[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]"''). It echoed instead the motto of [[Vichy France]] "Travail, Famille et Patrie" ("Work, Family and Fatherland") . After 1945, the main ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' of the regime became resistance to the wave of [[decolonization]] which swept Europe after the end of World War II.

The ''Estado Novo'' accepted the idea of [[corporatism]] as an economic model. Although Salazar refused to sign the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in 1938, the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] was intensely persecuted. So were Anarchists, Liberals, Republicans, and anyone opposed to the regime. The National Union embraced a wide array of politics, passing through [[monarchism]], [[corporatism]], para-[[fascism]] and [[nationalism]].

The ''[[Portuguese Legion (Estado Novo)|Legião Nacional]]'' was a popular militia similar to the Italian [[Blackshirts]]. For young people, there was the ''[[Mocidade Portuguesa]]'', an organization similar in organization to the [[Hitler Youth]] of [[Nazi Germany]], but not in ideology; the ''Estado Novo'' and the Nazis had little time for each other as Portugal made an effort to avoid [[racism]] and [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick G.

===World War II===
{{Main article|Portugal in World War II}}

Portugal was officially neutral in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39), but quietly furnished help to the nationalists of [[Francisco Franco]]. During the [[Diplomatic history of World War II|Second World War (1939-45)]], Portugal remained officially neutral, but the regime had more pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] sympathies; Salazar even expressed support for the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. This support, however, can be mainly attributed to Salazar's staunch anti-communist position rather than actual support for Hitler, or the Nazi regime. 

From 1943, Portugal favoured the Allies, leasing air bases in the [[Azores]]. Portugal reluctantly leased the Azores as a direct result of being threatened with invasion should Portugal not cater to the requests of the Allies. Portugal traded with both sides, but cut off vital shipments of [[tungsten]] and rubber to Germany in 1944, after heavy pressure from the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L.

Foot, eds. ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) pp 910-911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Australian troops briefly occupied [[Portuguese Timor]], but were soon overwhelmed by invading Japanese. Salazar worked to regain control of East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Sonny B. Davis, "Salazar, Timor, and Portuguese Neutrality in World War II," ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2005) 13#1 pp 449-476.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
Salazar's policy after the war was to provide a certain level of liberalization in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more freedom of the press. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn L. Raby, "Controlled, Limited and Manipulated Opposition Under a Dictatorial Regime: Portugal, 1945-9," ''European History Quarterly'' (1989) 19#1 pp 63-84. doi: 10.1177/026569148901900103&lt;/ref&gt; He permitted the formation of [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] (Movimento de Unidade Democrática) in 1945. It boycotted the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1945|election]] and Salazar won handily, on 18 November 1945.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945-1985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Portugal became a [[Member states of NATO|founding member]] of [[NATO]].

President [[Óscar Carmona]] died in 1951 after 25 years in office and was succeeded by [[Francisco Craveiro Lopes]]. However, Lopes was not willing to give Salazar the free hand that Carmona had given him, and was forced to resign just before the end of his term in 1958. Naval Minister [[Américo Tomás]], a staunch conservative, ran in the [[Portuguese presidential election, 1958|1958 elections]] as the official candidate. General [[Humberto Delgado]] was the opposition candidate. Delgado was credited with only around 25% of the votes with 52.6% in favor of Tomás,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portugal-info.net/history/second-republic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; despite the consensual opinion that Delgado would have won had the count been honest. Delgado had electrified the contest, previously seen by many as little better than a pantomime of democracy by declaring, when asked what he would do with Salazar, "Obviamente, demito-o!" ("Obviously, I'll sack him"). Delgado's rallies subsequently attracted vast crowds.  Evidence later surfaced that the PIDE had stuffed the ballot boxes with votes for Tomás. After the elections, Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese Military, and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile, spending much of it in Brazil and later in Algeria. To keep opposition candidates from coming to power in 1959, Salazar abolished direct election of presidents in favor of election by the National Assembly—which was firmly controlled by the regime—serving as an [[electoral college]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/history-of-portugal.htm/printable History of Portugal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223032924/http://history.howstuffworks.com/european-history/history-of-portugal.htm/printable |date=23 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1961, military officer and politician [[Henrique Galvão]] led the [[Santa Maria hijacking|hijacking of the Portuguese passenger ship ''Santa Maria'']]. The terrorist operation was successful as anti-regime propaganda but killed one man in the process. Galvão claimed that his intentions were to sail to the [[Angola (Portugal)|Overseas Province of Angola]] to set up in [[Luanda]] a renegade Portuguese Government in opposition to Salazar. Galvão released the passengers in negotiation with Brazilian officials in exchange for [[political asylum]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Chalk|title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czK7lIU7m1oC&amp;pg=PT903|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=903|isbn=9780313385353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the [[Academic Crisis]] occurred. The regime, fearing the growing popularity of both purely democratic and communist ideas among the students, carried out the boycott and closure of several student associations and organizations, including the important National Secretariat of Portuguese Students. Most members of this organization were opposition militants, among them many communists. The political activists who were anti-regime used to be investigated and persecuted by [[PIDE-DGS]], the secret police, and according to the gravity of the offence, were usually sent to jail or transferred from one university to another in order to destabilize oppositionist networks and its hierarchical organization. The students, with strong support from the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]], responded with demonstrations which culminated on 24 March with a huge student demonstration in Lisbon, that was vigorously suppressed by the riot police. [[Marcelo Caetano]], distinguished member of the regime and the incumbent [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Lisbon]], resigned.

The reluctance of many young men to embrace the hardships of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] resulted in hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens each year leaving to seek economic opportunities abroad in order to escape conscription. In over 15 years, nearly one million emigrated to [[France]], another million to the [[United States]], many hundreds of thousands to [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Venezuela]], or [[Brazil]]. Political parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], persecuted at home, were established in exile. The only party which managed to continue (illegally) operating in Portugal during all the dictatorship was the Portuguese Communist Party.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1964, Delgado founded the [[Portuguese National Liberation Front]] in [[Rome]], stating in public that the only way to end the ''Estado Novo'' would be by a [[military coup]], while many others advocated a ''national uprising'' approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen L. Weigert|title=Angola: A Modern Military History, 1961-2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdzJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=50–51|isbn=9780230337831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delgado and his Brazilian secretary, Arajaryr Moreira de Campos, were murdered on 13 February 1965 in Spain after being lured into an ambush by [[PIDE]].

According to some Portuguese conservative scholars like [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]] and [[Rui Ramos (academic)|Rui Ramos]],&lt;ref name="ionline.pt"/&gt; Salazar's early reforms and policies allowed political and financial stability and therefore [[social order]] and [[economic growth]], after the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the [[Portuguese First Republic]] (1910–1926). Other historians like, the also [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politician, [[Fernando Rosas]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosas, Fernando, Fernando Martins, Luciano do Amaral, Maria Fernanda Rollo, and José Mattoso. O Estado Novo (1926-1974). Estampa, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; point out that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s, led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration, turning Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe, that was also thwarted by scoring lower on literacy than its peers of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Salazar suffered a stroke in 1968. As it was thought that he did not have long to live, Tomás replaced him with [[Marcelo Caetano]], a reputed scholar of the University of Lisbon Law School, statesman and a distinguished member of the regime. Salazar was never informed of this decision, and reportedly died in 1970 still believing he was prime minister. Most of the people hoped Caetano would soften the edges of Salazar's authoritarian regime and modernize the already growing economy. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and made important social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay [[social security]]. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing centre in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]]. The economy reacted very well at first, but into the 1970s some serious problems began to show, due in part to two-digit inflation (from 1970 and on) and to the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the [[oil crisis of 1973]] had a potentially beneficial effect to Portugal because the largely unexploited oil reserves that Portugal had in its overseas territories of [[Angola]], and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] were being developed at a fast pace.

Although Caetano was fundamentally an authoritarian, he did make some efforts to open up the regime. Soon after taking power, he rebranded the regime as the "Social State", and slightly increased freedom of speech and the press. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a significant element of the population who had no memory of the instability which preceded Salazar. The people were also disappointed that Caetano was unwilling to open up the electoral system; the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1969|1969]] and [[Portuguese legislative election, 1973|1973 elections]] saw the National Union—renamed People's National Action—sweep every seat, as before. However, Caetano had to expend all of his political capital to wring even these meager reforms had out of the hardliners in the regime—most notably Tomás, who was not nearly as content to give Caetano the free rein that he gave Salazar. Caetano was thus in no position to resist when Tomás and the other hardliners forced the end of the reform experiment in 1973.

{{Main article|Economic history of Portugal}}
[[File:Foto 3 Visita Salazar obras Ponte Coimbra015.jpg|thumb|right|[[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] observing [[Edgar Cardoso]]'s Santa Clara Bridge maquette in [[Coimbra]].]]
During the 1940s and 1950s, Portugal experienced economic growth due to increased raw material exports to the war-ravaged and recovering nations of Europe. Until the 1960s, however, the country remained very poor and largely underdeveloped due to its disadvantaged starting position and lack of effective policies to counter that situation. Salazar managed to discipline the Portuguese [[public finances]], after the chaotic [[Portuguese First Republic|First Portuguese Republic]] of 1910–1926, but consistent economic growth and development remained scarce until well into the 1960s, when due to the influence of a new generation of technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, the Portuguese economy started to take off with visible accomplishments in the people's [[quality of life]] and [[standard of living]], as well as in terms of secondary and post-secondary education attainment. During the early period of Salazar's rule, a brand new road system was built, new bridges spanned the rivers, and an educational program was able to build a [[primary school]] in each Portuguese town (an idea developed and begun during the democratic First Republic). Some liberal economic reforms advocated by elements of the ruling party, which were successfully implemented under similar circumstances in neighboring Spain, were rejected out of fear that industrialization would destabilize the regime and its ideological base and would strengthen the Communists and other left-wing movements. [[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|left|Portuguese overseas territories in Africa during the ''Estado Novo'' regime: [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the two largest of those territories.]]
In 1958, when the Portuguese government announced the 1959–64 Six-Year Plan for National Development, a decision had been reached to accelerate the country's rate of economic growth, a decision whose urgency grew with the outbreak of [[Portuguese Colonial War|guerrilla warfare in Angola in 1961 and in Portugal's other African territories]] thereafter. Salazar and his policy advisers recognized that additional military expenditure needs, as well as increased transfers of official investment to the "overseas provinces", could only be met by a sharp rise in the country's productive capacity. Salazar's commitment to preserving Portugal's "multiracial, [[pluricontinental]]" state led him reluctantly to seek external credits beginning in 1962, an action from which the Portuguese treasury had abstained for several decades.

Beyond military measures, the official Portuguese response to the "[[Wind of Change (speech)|winds of change]]" in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the [[Overseas Province of Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]], boomed.

The liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister [[Marcello José das Neves Caetano]] (1968–1974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged [[European Community]]. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, [[EFTA]] membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]]. Notwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers. Before the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TqRn1lAypsgC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Financial+crisis+1974+Portugal#PPA129,M1 Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation, Juan José Linz]&lt;/ref&gt; On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 Fundação da SEDES&amp;nbsp;– As primeiras motivações], "Nos anos 60 e até 1973 teve lugar, provavelmente, o mais rápido período de crescimento económico da nossa História, traduzido na industrialização, na expansão do turismo, no comércio com a EFTA, no desenvolvimento dos sectores financeiros, investimento estrangeiro e grandes projectos de infra-estruturas.

Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/ave/wpaper/382006.html], Joaquim da Costa Leite ([[Aveiro University]])&amp;nbsp;– Instituições, Gestão e Crescimento Económico: Portugal, 1950-1973&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s Portugal's fast economic growth with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in [[Transportation in Portugal|transportation]]. [[Brisa&amp;nbsp;– Autoestradas de Portugal]] was founded in 1972 and the State granted the company a 30-year concession to design, build, manage, and maintain a modern network of express motorways.

The economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new [[capital equipment]] and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable [[consumer goods]].

The Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the Estado Novo regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s, including those founded by the families of [[António Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor]], [[Cimpor]]), [[José Manuel de Mello]] (CUF&amp;nbsp;– [[Companhia União Fabril]], [[Banco Totta &amp; Açores]]), [[Américo Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jerónimo Martins]]). Those Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with similarities to [[Japan]]ese [[keiretsu]]s and [[zaibatsu]]s. The Companhia União Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its [[core business]]es ([[cement]], [[chemicals]], [[petrochemicals]], [[agrochemicals]], [[textiles]], [[beer]], [[beverages]], [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], [[banking]], [[paper]], [[tourism]], [[mining]], etc.) and corporate headquarters located in [[mainland Portugal]], but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the Portuguese territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance those located in the city of [[Covilhã]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of [[Alcobaça Municipality|Alcobaça]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (like [[SONAE]] near [[Porto]]), canned fish (like those of [[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like [[Licor Beirão]] and [[Ginjinha]], to beer like [[Sagres (beer)|Sagres]], were produced across the entire country, but [[Port Wine]] was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in [[Estoril]]/[[Cascais]]/[[Sintra]] and growing as an international attraction in the [[Algarve]] since the 1960s) and in agriculture (like the ones scattered around the [[Alentejo]]&amp;nbsp;– known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s. In addition, the rural population was committed to [[agrarianism]]—greatly important for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.

Besides that, the overseas territories were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974), a [[counterinsurgency]] war against independentist [[guerrilla]] and [[terrorism]], the overseas territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] (Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer (Cuca and Laurentina were successful beer brands produced locally), cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles. Tourism was also a fast developing activity in Portuguese Africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves. While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create [[sustainability]] policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. On 13 November 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] (''Fundo do Ultramar'' - The Overseas Fund) was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.º 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&amp;seccao=Convidados&amp;page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164133/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&amp;seccao=Convidados&amp;page=1 |date=11 May 2013 }}, [[Diário de Notícias]] (29 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating irregular militia as if they were regular military academy officers.&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{pt icon}} Movimento das Forças Armadas (MFA).

[[Labour union]]s were not allowed and a [[minimum wage]] policy was not enforced. However, in a context of an expanding economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity, reducing fiscal and actuarial imbalance, and achieving more efficiency for the economy as a whole, for example, by establishing contributions less distortive to labour markets or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy. In 1969, with the replacement of Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the Estado Novo-controlled nation got indeed a very slight taste of democracy and Caetano allowed the formation of the first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s.

==Education==
{{Main article|Education in Portugal}}
[[File:UC-GeneralLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Coimbra General Library]] main building&amp;nbsp;– ''Edifício Novo'' (New Building, 1962) in the ''Alta Universitária'', Coimbra.]]
Until the 1960s, post-[[primary education]] was limited to a tiny elite. In general, teenagers used to leave school and start to work early. In contrast with other European nations, the country had had a poor record in educational policies since the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century the [[illiteracy]] rate was at over 80 percent and higher education was reserved for a small percentage of the population. 68.1 percent of Portugal's population was still classified as illiterate by the 1930 census. Portugal's literacy rate by the 1940s and early 1950s remained low for [[North America]]n and [[Western Europe]]an standards at the time. However, in the 1960s the country made public education available for all children between the ages of six and twelve, founded universities in the overseas provinces of Angola and Mozambique (the [[University of Luanda]] and the [[University of Lourenço Marques]] during the period of [[Adriano Moreira]] as Minister of the Overseas Provinces), recognized the [[Portuguese Catholic University]] in 1971, and by 1973 a wave of new state-run universities were founded across [[mainland Portugal]] (the [[Minho University]], the [[New University of Lisbon]], the [[University of Évora]], and the [[University of Aveiro]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Veiga Simão]] was the Minister in charge for education by then). In addition, the long established Lisbon and Coimbra universities were highly expanded and modernized in the 1960s. New buildings and campuses were constructed, like the ''Cidade Universitária'' (Lisbon) and the ''Alta Universitária'' (Coimbra). The last two decades of the Estado Novo, from the 1960s to the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], were marked by strong investment in [[Education in Portugal|secondary and university education]], which experienced in this period one of the fastest growth rates of Portuguese education history to date. Though this corresponded to significant growth of post-primary enrollment in larger urban areas, yet there was a gap to be filled in the following years, given the little time to overcome their disadvantaged starting position. The massification of [[secondary education]] was only achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s, so by the time of the Carnation Revolution in 1974 illiteracy was receding, but low-literacy and illiteracy was still high, compared with the highest standards already achieved by the most developed countries in the world.

[[Egas Moniz]], a Portuguese physician who developed the [[cerebral angiography]] and [[leucotomy]], received in 1949 the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]&amp;nbsp;– even now, the only Portuguese recipient of a Nobel in the sciences.

After [[India]] achieved independence in 1947 under the [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government, pro-Indian residents of the Portuguese overseas territory of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organizations, liberated Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.&lt;ref name =lele&gt;P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the fort of [[Ouidah#Fort of S.C3.A3o Jo.C3.A3o Baptista de Ajud.C3.A1|São João Baptista de Ajuda]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old [[Portuguese Empire]]. According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty. Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations]] resulted in the defeat of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portugal's National Assembly]]. The so-called "[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]]" concerning historical colonization in Europe-ruled overseas territories, started to have influence over the centuries-old empire. The end of the Estado Novo effectively began with the uprisings in the overseas territories in Africa during the 1960s. The independence movements active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]] were supported by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which both wanted to end all colonial empires and expand their own spheres of influence.

For the Portuguese ruling regime, the centuries-old overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]]. The criticism against some kinds of racial discrimination in the Portuguese African territories were refuted on the grounds that all Portuguese Africans would be [[Westernized]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] in due time, through a process called [[civilising mission]]. The wars had the same effects in Portugal as the [[Vietnam War]] in the United States, or the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]] in the Soviet Union; they were unpopular and expensive lengthy wars which were isolating Portugal's diplomacy, leading many to question the continuation of the war and, by extension, the government. Although Portugal was able to maintain some superiority in the colonies by its use of elite paratroopers and special operations troops, the foreign support to the guerrillas, including arms embargoes and other sanctions against the Portuguese, made them more maneuverable, allowing them to inflict losses on the Portuguese army. The international community isolated Portugal due to the long-lasting [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. The situation was aggravated by the illness of Salazar, the strong man of the regime, in 1968. His replacement was one of his closest advisors, [[Marcelo Caetano]], who tried to slowly democratize the country, but could not hide the obvious dictatorship that oppressed Portugal. Salazar died in 1970.

After spending the early years of his priesthood in Africa, the British priest [[Adrian Hastings]] created a storm in 1973 with an article in ''[[The Times]]'' about the "Wiriyamu massacre"&lt;ref&gt;Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto. OS anos da Guerra Colonial - Wiriyamu, De Moçambique para o mundo. Lisboa, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in Mozambique, revealing that the Portuguese Army had massacred some 400 villagers at the village of Wiriyamu, near [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]], in December 1972. His report was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister, Marcelo Caetano, was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]]. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the "carnation revolution" coup which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (26 June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The various conflicts forced the Salazar and subsequent Caetano governments to spend more of the country's budget on colonial administration and military expenditures, and Portugal soon found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. After Caetano succeeded to the presidency, the colonial war became a major cause of dissent and a focus for anti-government forces in Portuguese society. Many young dissidents, such as left-wing students and anti-war activists, were forced to leave the country so they could escape imprisonment or conscription. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were also three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism. The core of the struggle of these radical students lay in an uncompromising defence of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the days of the authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf A direita radical na Universidade de Coimbra (1945–1974)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234238/http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf |date=3 March 2009 }}, MARCHI, Riccardo. A direita radical na Universidade de Coimbra (1945-1974). Anál. Social, Jul. 2008, nº 188, pp. 551–76. ISSN 0003-2573.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] continued to rage on, requiring a steadily increasing budget. The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as a whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal – thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.

The war in the colonies was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people became weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. However, despite the guerrilla's unpredictable and sporadic attacks against targets all over the countryside of the Portuguese African territories, the economies of both Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were booming, cities and towns were expanding and prospering steadily over time, new transportation networks were being opened to link the well-developed and highly urbanized coastal strip with the more remote inland regions, and the number of ethnic European Portuguese migrants from mainland Portugal (the ''[[metrópole]]'') increased rapidly since the 1950s (although always as a small minority of each territory's total population).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html Testemunhos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124075350/http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html |date=24 January 2011 }}, Observatório da Emigração&lt;/ref&gt;

Suddenly, after some failed attempts of military rebellion, in April 1974 the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers – the [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA), overthrew the Estado Novo regime. The military-led coup can be described as the necessary means of bringing back democracy to Portugal, ending the unpopular [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] where thousands of Portuguese soldiers had been commissioned, and replacing the [[authoritarian]] ''Estado Novo'' (New State) regime and its secret police which repressed elemental [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s. However, the military coup's organization started as a professional class&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=movicapi Cronologia: Movimento dos capitães], Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]&lt;/ref&gt; protest of [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] [[captain (land)|captain]]s against a decree law: the ''Dec.

Caetano's [[Portuguese Government]] had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened [[government budget]]. After the coup, the [[Movimento das Forças Armadas|MFA]]-led [[National Salvation Junta]], a military junta, took power. Caetano resigned, and was flown under custody to the [[Madeira Islands]] where he stayed for a few days. He then flew to exile in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949058,00.html Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975 the [[Portuguese Empire]] had all but collapsed.

==Aftermath==
After the ''Estado Novo'' the country would then experience a turbulent period of provisional governments and a nearly disintegrated state reminiscent of the First Republic, a condition that the ''Estado Novo'' had so assiduously attempted to avoid. These provisional governments also briefly censored newspapers and detained oppositionists. Historian [[Kenneth Maxwell]] considers that, for many reasons, Portugal, in its transition from authoritarian rule to a more democratic government, resembled Nicaragua more than any other among the South American nations.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Kenneth (1986) 'Regime Overthrow and the Prospects for Democratic Transition in Portugal' in Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Prospects for Democracy, ed. Guillermo O’Donnell, Philippe C. Schmitter, and Laurence Whitehead (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; During the final months of the [[Francoist State]], which had survived to this point, Spain considered invading Portugal to check the perceived threat of communism caused by the Carnation Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Govan|first=Fiona|year=2008|title=Gen Franco wanted to declare war on Portugal|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3373194/Gen-Franco-wanted-to-declare-war-on-Portugal.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=Madrid|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of social unrest, factionalism, and uncertainty in Portuguese politics, between 1974 and 1976, neither far left nor far right radicalism prevailed. However, pro-communist and socialist elements retained control of the country for several months before elections. [[Álvaro Cunhal]]'s [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP) remained Stalinist in outlook and unsympathetic to the sort of reforms that were emerging as "Euro-Communism" in other countries in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott B. MacDonald|title=European Destiny, Atlantic Transformations: Portuguese Foreign Policy Under the Second Republic, 1974-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wP5gjdGinkwC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1993|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=81|isbn=9781412822961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retreat from the colonies and the acceptance of its independence terms which would create newly independent communist states in 1975 (most notably the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]]) prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (16 August 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, 7 July 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; creating over a million destitute Portuguese [[refugee]]s&amp;nbsp;— the ''[[White African#Portuguese in Africa|retornados]]''. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first [[Portuguese Constituent Assembly election, 1975|democratic elections]] in 50 years. However, the country continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salvação Nacional|military-civilian provisional administration]] until the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]].

For the Portuguese and their former colonies, this was a very difficult period, but many felt that the short-term effects of the Carnation Revolution were well worth the trouble when civil rights and political freedoms were achieved. The Portuguese celebrate Freedom Day on 25 April every year, and the day is a national holiday in Portugal.

By refusing to grant independence to its overseas territories in Africa, the Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo was criticized by most of the international community, and its leaders [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] were accused of being blind to the "Winds of change". After the [[Carnation revolution]] in 1974 and the fall of the incumbent Portuguese authoritarian regime, almost all the Portugal-ruled territories outside Europe became independent. For the regime, the retention of those overseas possessions had been a matter of [[national interest]].

[[Image:Sculpture pont de l'alma Paris FRA.jpg|thumb|The ''Flame of Liberty'', which was offered to the people of France by donors throughout the world as a symbol of the [[Franco-American]] friendship. In the background, the [[Eiffel Tower]].]]

The '''''Flame of Liberty''''' (''Flamme de la Liberté'') in [[Paris]] is a full-sized, gold-leaf-covered replica of the flame of the torch from the [[Statue of Liberty]] (''Liberty Enlightening the World''), located at the entrance to the harbor of [[New York City]] since 1886.&lt;ref&gt;The earlier version of the flame, designed by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in 1916, was made of glass, and was lighted from the inside with electric lamps. See [[:File:NYC old torch.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; The monument, which measures approximately 3.5 metres in height, is a sculpture of a flame, executed in gilded copper, supported by a pedestal of gray-and-black marble. It is located near the northern end of the [[Pont de l'Alma]], on the Place de l'Alma, in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]].&lt;ref name="IHT 2007"&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was offered to Paris in 1989 by the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' on behalf of donors who had contributed approximately $400,000 for its fabrication. It represented the culmination of that newspaper's 1987 celebration of its hundredth anniversary of publishing an English-language daily newspaper in Paris. More importantly, the ''Flame'' was a token of thanks for the restoration work on the Statue of Liberty accomplished three years earlier by two French businesses that did artisanal work on the project, namely Métalliers Champenois, which did the bronze work, and the Gohard Studios, which applied the gold leaf. While the gift to France was prompted by the centennial of the newspaper, the ''Flame of Liberty'', more broadly, is a lasting symbol of the friendship uniting the two countries, just as the statue itself was when it was given to the United States by France.

This project was overseen by the director of the French craft unions at that time, Jacques Graindorge. He foresaw an installation of the ''Flame of Liberty'' in a public square called [[Place des États-Unis]] (United States Square) in the [[16th arrondissement]], but the mayor of Paris at the time, [[Jacques Chirac]], was opposed to it. After a protracted period of negotiations, it was decided that the ''Flame'' would be placed in an open area near the intersection of l'Avenue de New-York (New York Avenue) and the Place de l'Alma. The monument was dedicated on 10 May 1989 by Chirac. 

On the base of the monument, a commemorative plaque recounts the following story:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "The ''Flame of Liberty''. An exact replica of the Statue of Liberty's flame offered to the people of France by donors throughout the world as a symbol of the Franco-American friendship. On the occasion of the centennial of the ''International Herald Tribune''.  Paris 1887–1987."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Flame of Liberty'' became an unofficial memorial for [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her 1997 death]] in the tunnel beneath the Pont de l'Alma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,624681,00.html

Anthropologist Guy Lesoeurs said, "Most people who come here think this was built for her."&lt;ref name="IHT 2007"/&gt;

The site of the monument is served by the [[Métro de Paris]] station [[Alma – Marceau (Paris Métro)|Alma-Marceau]] on Line No. 9 and by the RER commuter rail station, Pont de l'Alma, on its 'C' Line, as well as by buses numbered 42, 63, 72, 80, 92, and the Balabus sightseeing buses.

&lt;!--A new ''Flame of Liberty'', a sculpture by [[Jean Cardot]], was unveiled on June 14, 2008. It symbolizes the warm and respectful relations between the French and the Americans. It was installed in the gardens of the [[Embassy of the United States in Paris|United States Embassy to France]] in the [[Place de la Concorde]], and it was dedicated in the presence of the President of the French Republic, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], and [[George W. Bush]]. This new flame is the embodiment of an impulse shared by French businessman, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, and the American ambassador, [[Craig Roberts Stapleton]], and it displays two inscriptions, one by the Frenchman, the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], and another by the American statesman, [[Benjamin Franklin]].--&gt;

Composed of approximately 65 military and civilian members, '''Fleet Survey Team''' (FST) is collocated with the
[[Naval Oceanographic Office]] and [[Commander, Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command]], at Stennis
Space Center, MS.

FST, an echelon-five command since 2006, is tasked with performing an unparalleled function within the U.S.
Navy.

The command enables combatant commanders with access in the littoral regions through expeditionary hydrography.
When forces are armed with detailed descriptions of the environmental conditions they could face, operations have
a greater chance of being safely and efficiently executed.

FST gathers the needed information via timely, self-contained hydrographic surveys in response to combatant
commanders’ requests. These requests frequently are for areas where Navy operations will take place or where charting
accuracy is uncertain.

FST members (both civilian and military) can quickly deploy to areas around the world outfitted with equipment
to perform surveys from various boats of opportunity. Because of these unique capabilities, civilian and military
members of FST have deployed to areas of combat like the Middle East to perform near-shore surveys to collect
data which aids in the safe navigation of U.S. forces and supplies traversing the area.

FST members have also played significant roles in charting areas affected by natural disasters such as the south
Asia tsunami of 2004 and hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf of Mexico.

Command personnel offer a unique blend of military and civilian knowledge and experience. Enlisted sailors
routinely qualify as level two military hydrographers, certifying their skills.

In addition to their strong backgrounds in math, science and engineering, officers and civilians frequently obtain
master’s degrees in hydrographic science through an ongoing program with The University of Southern Mississippi
and are also recognized by the International Hydrographic Office as Category A hydrographers.

Fleet Survey Team command members are commonly known as the Fightin’ Crawdads in reference to the crawfish featured prominently in the FST logo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10547">The '''G8 Climate Change Roundtable''' was formed in January 2005 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Report On The Business Impact Of Climate Change |url=http://media.ford.com/downloads/05_climate.pdf |publisher=Ford |accessdate=23 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402173540/http://media.ford.com/downloads/05_climate.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was to address the global climate change issue facing governments, business and civil society. The first meeting was held in [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]], [[Scotland]], from 6&amp;ndash;8 July 2005, to coincide with the [[31st G8 summit]].

The roundtable was established by twenty-three leading [[Multinational corporation|international businesses]] with the assistance of [[G8]] President and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]], to co-operatively engage in a global plan of action.&lt;ref name="bhg8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2005/2005-07-01-01.asp |title=Bush Heads for G8 With Malaria Relief, Nod to Climate Change |author= |accessdate=2009-12-04 |date=2005-07-01 |work=Environmental News Service |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the group was to ensure that a long-term [[policy framework]] was set up to enable consistent and transparent market-based solutions in [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigating climate change]], while also addressing issues linked to [[climate change]]; such as [[economic growth]], [[poverty]], and adequate [[Energy supply|energy supplies]].&lt;ref name=economic&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of G8 Climate Change Roundtable |url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=23 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508123035/http://www.weforum.org/pdf/g8_climatechange.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon trading]] is one of the most popular pricing mechanisms used to the reduce [[greenhouse emissions]] worldwide.

The group devised a Framework for Action which called for technology incentive programs, the establishment of common metrics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatebiz.com/news/2005/07/10/more-business-leaders-support-action-climate-change |title=More Business Leaders Support Action on Climate Change |accessdate=2009-12-04 |date=2005-07-10 |work=ClimateBiz |publisher=Greener World Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and the expansion of [[emissions trading]] schemes.

Some of the companies participating include [[Ford]], [[British Airways]], [[HSBC]], [[EdF]] and [[BP]].&lt;ref name="pa"/&gt; Now, the Climate Change Roundtable has a membership of 150 businesses spread across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Warming and Climate Change|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/55566449/Global-Warming-and-Climate-Change|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists raised concerns that the body's statement does not call for targets or include timetables.&lt;ref name="pa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/31198/story.htm |title= Big Business Urges Urgent G8 Global Warming Action |author=Jeremy Lovell |accessdate=2009-12-04 |date=2005-06-10 |work=[[Planet Ark]] |publisher=Thomson Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth]] noted that the roundtable represented a major shift by the [[Business action on climate change|business community towards]] efforts to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]].&lt;ref name="pa"/&gt;

==Key Principles==

The G8 Climate Change Roundtable stated 5 key points to be addressed:
* Companies must recognize their responsibility in addressing [[climate change]].
* The issue of climate change requires further international attention and support.
* [[Market forces]] must be considered in the crafting of a solution, consumer support is needed to solve the problem.
* Specific policies for the [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] of climate change.
* Specific policies which should be adopted by [[G8]] members.

===Key Principles for Business===

The G8 Climate Change Roundtable developed 5 key principles for businesses to consider when crafting a climate change mitigation strategy. These principles are:
* Strategies should be based on [[scientific]] and [[economic]] facts.
* Businesses should adopt market based policy frameworks which are [[transparency (behavior)|transparent]] and offer consistent [[price signals]] in the long-term. 
* Solutions should be adopted globally in order to achieve long term success.
* Climate change solutions must not be viewed in isolation from other global challenges, such as ensuring access to [[energy]], expanding availability of [[clean water]], alleviating [[poverty]], and achieving [[economic growth]] in [[emerging markets]].&lt;ref name="Siemens Power Generation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Voges |first=Klaus |title=Climate Change Mitigation Technologies - the Siemens Roadmap to Carbon Capture and Storage |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/p001091.pdf |publisher=World Energy Congress |accessdate=23 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125153721/http://worldenergy.org/documents/p001091.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Businesses should seek a [[system]] wide solution, identifying opportunities for [[CO2]] mitigation throughout the [[supply chain]].

===Key Principles for Governments===

The G8 Climate Change Roundtable developed 3 key principles for governments to consider when addressing climate change. Governments should:
* Focus their [[resources]] on measuring the [[effects of climate change on human health|effects of climate change on human]], [[economic]] and [[environmental health]].
* Increase their understanding of current and future changes taking place within the [[global environment]]. (e.g. sea level rise, sea/ice cover).&lt;ref name="economic"/&gt;
* Quickly and effectively adopt climate stabilization policies with the goal of mitigating future environmental harm.

== Policy Framework==

The G8 Climate Change Roundtable aimed to create a long-term [[policy framework]] which was both [[transparency (behavior)|transparent]] and [[consistent]]. Through market based solutions such as [[carbon trading]], the Roundtable established a [[policy framework]] which now encompasses 150 businesses across the globe.

By creating long term value, these members established a market based framework extending to 2030 and indicative signals extending to 2050.&lt;ref name="economic"/&gt; This policy framework they hoped would take on a global scale, with consistent [[policies]] throughout the various states. The framework was meant to not only mitigate climate change but also promote [[sustainable development]] by addressing issues of [[poverty]], [[energy]] and [[economic growth]] in [[emerging markets]].

The Roundtable recommended encouraging [[technological innovation]] through performance based incentives.&lt;ref name="economic"/&gt; By quickly commercializing [[low-carbon emission|low carbon technologies]] they aimed to mitigate climate change quickly. They noted that by ensuring that climate change mitigation goals aligned with societal goals, governments would be able to optimize [[greenhouse gas]] reductions.
By ensuring that emerging markets, such as [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[South African]] and [[Mexico]], invest in low carbon economic growth, new technologies can be applied globally while streamlining emerging markets. New investments should align with societal goals, creating partnerships between G8 nations as well as emerging nations. Through such a partnership, members can effectively collaborate on specific projects within countries or rapid dissemination of specific technologies.

Members of the new policy framework should establish common metrics. By streamlining greenhouse emissions reporting processes and systems, countries can achieve this goal.
Business and G8 governments should use supply chain drivers and the power of [[procurement]] to integrate climate change solutions into their global supply chain requirements.&lt;ref name="economic"/&gt; By committing to the use of the Roundtable’s policy framework throughout the supply chain, optimal greenhouse gas mitigation can be achieved.

'''GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders''' ('''GLAD''') is a non-profit legal rights organization in the United States. The organization works to end discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]], [[HIV]] status, and gender identity and expression. The organization primarily achieves this goal through litigation, advocacy, and education work in all areas of [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights and the rights of people living with HIV. In addition, GLAD operates a legal information line, GLAD Answers, where LGBTQ &amp; HIV+ residents of New England can receive attorney referrals and information about their rights. The organization changed its name to GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glad.org/current/post/the-generations-of-a-name&lt;/ref&gt;

GLAD is based in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and serves the [[New England]] area of [[Northeastern United States]].

==Background==
GLAD was originally called the '''Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders'''. It was founded by John Ward in 1978, in response to a [[sting operation]] conducted by Boston police that resulted in the arrest of more than a hundred men in the men's rooms of the main building of the [[Boston Public Library]].&lt;ref name=allis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allis|first1=Sam|title=Looking Back|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/404754947/|accessdate=August 2, 2014|work=Boston Globe|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAD filed its first case, ''Doe v. McNiff'', that same year and eventually all those arrested were either found not guilty or had the charges against them dismissed.&lt;ref name=allis/&gt; An early victory came in ''[[Fricke v. Lynch]]'' (1980), in which GLAD represented [[Aaron Fricke]], an 18-year-old student at [[Cumberland High School (Rhode Island)|Cumberland High School]] in Rhode Island, who won the right to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance&lt;ref name="fricke_v_lynch"/&gt;.

==Notable cases==
* '''''[[Fricke v. Lynch]]''''': GLAD founder John Ward won a ruling from the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island on May 28, 1980, that the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of free speech prohibits a public school from denying a student the right to attend a school prom with a same-sex date.&lt;ref name="fricke_v_lynch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karlan|first1=Sarah|title=In 1980, Two Boys Fought For The Right To Attend Prom Together|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/in-1980-two-boys-fought-for-the-right-to-attend-prom-togethe#.mua0NngQ4|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=BuzzFeed LGBT|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, &amp; Bisexual Group of Boston|Hurley v. GLIB]]''''': GLAD founder John Ward became the first openly gay man to argue in front of the Supreme Court in defense of the rights of Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Group of Boston to march in South Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day parade. Massachusetts courts had affirmed that the group had the right to march.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glad.org/about/history/hurley-v-glib&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decisions of the Massachusetts court, barring them from marching in the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1994/1994_94_749#argument|title=Hurley ''v.''

* '''''[[Bragdon v. Abbott]]''''': In 1995, GLAD's case established that people with HIV and AIDS are protected by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). It was the first case that the U.S. Supreme Court had ever heard on the ADA, and the first involving HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/bragdon_us_19980625_decision-us-supreme-court|title=Decision from the U.S. Supreme Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibeaut|first1=John|title=Filling a Need|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IT1o1lCOpfkC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=ABA Journal|date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Doe v. Yunits''''': In 2000, GLAD brought a case to the Massachusetts Superior Court on behalf of a transgender student, Katrina, who had been disciplined for wearing the clothing that matched her female identity. The Superior Court ruled that a middle school may not prohibit a transgender student from expressing her female gender identity. It was the first reported decision in a case brought by a transgender student.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glad.org/about/history/doe-v-yunits&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''O'Donnabhain v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue''''': On February 2, 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled that treatment for gender dysphoria qualifies as medical care under the Internal Revenue Code and is therefore tax deductible.&lt;ref&gt;In re Rhiannon O'Donnabhain http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/in-re-rhiannon-odonnabhain/odonnabhain-tax-court-decision-02-02-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''[[Doe v. Regional School Unit 26]]''''' (2014): The [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled that denying a transgender girl the use of a girls' restroom at her school violated her rights under the state's Human Rights Act. This case marked the first time that a state court ruled denying a transgender student access to the bathroom consistent with their gender identity is unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work= The Advocate |title=Maine Trans Student Wins Landmark Discrimination Case |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/01/30/trans-student-maine-wins-landmark-discrimination-case }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]''''' (2015): GLAD's Civil Rights Project Director, [[Mary Bonauto]], argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on April 28, 2015, on behalf of same-sex couples seeking the right to marry. This case was consolidated with [[Obergefell v. Hodges]], and concluded in the landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a right to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today |title=Gay Marriage Pioneer Chosen to Argue Supreme Court Case |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/31/supreme-court-gay-marriage/70713840/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on marriage equality==
In 1997, GLAD, along with Beth Robinson and Susan Murray filed a lawsuit, ''[[Baker v. Vermont]]'' on behalf of three [[Vermont]] couples seeking the right to marry. On December 20, 1999 The [[Vermont Supreme Court]] ruled that same-sex couples must be granted the same legal benefits, protections, and obligations as marriage under Vermont law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/baker_vt_19991220_decision-vt-supreme-court|title=Decision from the Supreme Court of the State of Vermont|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result of this decision in 2000 Vermont became the first state to allow same-sex couples to enter a legal relationship equal to marriage, known in Vermont as a civil union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/publications/vt-civil-unions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, GLAD received national attention for its work in winning [[same-sex marriage|marriage]] rights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts. In ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'', it successfully argued before the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] that to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples was a violation of the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Bonauto, "''Goodridge'' in Context", in ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'', vol. 40, 1-69, [available online], accessed April 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, GLAD won marriage rights for same-sex couples in Connecticut with a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Connecticut]] in ''[[Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|title=Gay Marriage Is Ruled Legal in Connecticut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/nyregion/11marriage.html|accessdate=April 15, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2008, the fifth anniversary of ''Goodridge'', GLAD, working with other statewide groups, launched a project called the "Six by Twelve" campaign that aimed to bring same-sex marriage to all six New England states by 2012.&lt;ref name="GLAD"&gt;[http://www.glad.org/current/news-detail/five-years-after-goodridge-glad-announces-6x12/ Five Years After Goodridge, GLAD Announces "6x12"], GLAD, November 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aimed to make New England a "marriage equality zone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2009/03/24/same_sex_marriage_bills_gain_in_ne/ Same-sex marriage bills gain in N.E.], ''Boston Globe'', David Abel, March 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign worked primarily through state legislatures and hoped to provide a road map for the rest of the country in 2012.&lt;ref name="WT"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/04/gay-marriage-backers-target-new-england/ Gay marriage backers target New England], Washington Times, January 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Within six months, same-sex marriage laws were passed in three more states, but the Maine law was repealed by the voters on November 3, 2009. After this decision by the voters, along with a coalition of other civil rights groups, GLAD proceeded with a two-year public education campaign in Maine. On June 30, 2011, [[EqualityMaine]] and GLAD announced plans to place a voter initiative in support of same-sex marriage on Maine's November 2012 ballot. The voter initiative passed, making Maine the first state to legalize same sex marriage through a ballot vote.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'': [https://www.wsj.com/articles/AP209adcacbac9485f900611a52972a05e "Gay marriage supporters plan referendum in Maine," June 30, 2011], accessed June 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, 2013 the "Six by Twelve" campaign came to a close when Rhode Island's legislature passed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and Governor [[Lincoln Chafee]] signed it into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/05/02/rhode-island-gov-signs-marriage-equality-bill|title=Rhode Island Gov. Signs Marriage Equality Bill|date=2 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it filed ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' in March 2009, GLAD became the first organization to file a [[United States district court|federal court]] challenge to Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) that prevented the federal government from recognizing the validity of same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/us/03marriage.html |title=Suit Seeks to Force Government to Extend Benefits to Same-Sex Couples |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 2010, GLAD filed a second challenge to Section 3 with ''[[Pedersen v.

After consulting with [[scholar]]s and governmental experts, the Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at [[Harvard University]] (HPCR) created in 2003 a multi-annual Project intended to restate the existing [[international law]]s applicable to [[Air warfare|air]] and missile warfare.  This Project helped to formulate the ''HPCR Manual'' on International Law Applicable to Air and Missile Warfare.  In 1923, the Rules of Air Warfare were drafted at [[the Hague]] by a Commission of Jurists.  Since then, air power has become a crucial element of military arsenal and [[modern warfare]].  The developments in air and missile technology in the last few decades have completely altered [[military strategy]] and created distinct challenges to the protection of civilians in time of [[armed conflict]].  Although a number of international treaties have been adopted in response to modern warfare, including the four 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]] for the Protection of War Victims, the two Additional Protocols of 1977, and various conventions regarding [[cultural property]], [[biological weapon]]s, and [[chemical weapons]], many important aspects of air and missile operations are not included.  Also, some of these instruments, especially AP/I, are not binding on all states, including the [[United States]].  Because of this, the Commentary on the HPCR Manual identifies US practices and positions which are consistent with the rules of AP/I.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;[http://www.ihlresearch.org/amw/about-project.php HPCR, ''About the Project'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the Manual==
The goal of the ''HPCR Manual'' is to give a methodical restatement of international law and air and missile warfare, based on the practice of States accepted as law and [[Treaty|treaties]] in force.  Because the authors of the HPCR Manual have no [[legislative power]], there is no innovative aspect.  By providing a reference on international law applicable to air and missile warfare, the HPCR Manual will help to stimulate discussions among legal advisors, military advisors, and humanitarian practitioners, which in turn will help improve the protection of [[civilian]]s in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

The HPCR Manual hopes to serve as a valuable resource for military forces while developing [[rules of engagement]], writing military manuals, preparing training courses, and the actual conduct of [[armed forces]] in combat operations, while also providing the armed services' [[lawyer]]s a cohesive text to assist them in their tasks. The HPCR Manual is a practical tool that will make decision-making easier in a real-time operational environment, while also giving confidence to those who utilize it.  The objective of the HPCR Manual is to be of help to those who plan, approve or execute air or missile operations before rather than after the event.  The HPCR Manual is also meant to be used by other segments of armed forces, such as commanders of forces that are receiving these attacks. Needless to say, it is hoped that the HPCR Manual will be used extensively in training and instruction courses in both [[war]]time and [[peacetime]], so as to familiarize prospective users with the patterns of behavior expected of them.&lt;ref name="multiples"&gt;[http://www.ihlresearch.org/amw/aboutmanual.php HPCR, ''About the Manual'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Black-Letter Rules and the Accompanying Commentary===
The Black-Letter Rules of the ''HPCR Manual'' are a collective creation of the Group of Experts. The Black-Letter Rules reflect the [[consensus]] of the Group of Experts as to the state of the most significant elements of [[International humanitarian law|International Humanitarian Law]] bearing on air and missile warfare in 2009.  Each Black-Letter Rule of the HPCR Manual includes a user-friendly explanation for both legal advisers and those who plan, approve or execute air or missile operations on both sides of the armed conflict.  The commentary is done in "bullet point" style.&lt;ref name="multiples"/&gt;

==Expert Participants==
The Core Group of Experts is made up of 24 people, including Claude Bruderlein, Director of the Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University, Dr. [[Yoram Dinstein]], Senior Academic Advisor at HPCR and Professor Emeritus of International Law at [[Tel Aviv University]], Knut Dörmann, Head of the Legal Division at the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], Dr. Frits Kalshoven, Professor Emeritus of International Law at [[Leiden University]], Colonel (ret.) W. Hays Parks, Former Special Assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Army for Law of War Matters with the Office of General Counsel in the US Department of Defense, Professor [[Michael N Schmitt]], Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, and Dr. Zhu Wenqi, Professor of International Law at the Law School of [[Renmin University of China]].  Other experts, including 7 government experts and 6 experts that participated in some of the sessions, also contributed to the ''HPCR Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihlresearch.org/amw/participants.php HPCR, ''Expert Participants'', 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Independence from Europe''' was a [[Minor political party#United Kingdom|minor]], [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]]. The party was first registered in June 2012 but remained inactive until it was launched in October 2013 by sole party leader [[Mike Nattrass]], a disaffected member of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP). It had no official political representation at the time of its dissolution in November 2017, but previously had one [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) and three [[Councillor#United Kingdom|Councillors]], all of whom were once members of UKIP.

Nattrass' deselection as a UKIP candidate in August 2013 saw him voluntarily leave the party and after deliberation, launch his own group whilst still an MEP. The party's name changed twice subsequently, largely due to the potential of voters mistaking it with UKIP; use of the word "Independence" in both parties' names proved particularly contentious, prompting two separate investigations by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]. Virtually all commentators dismissed the party as a means for disgruntled former UKIP members to confuse the electorate and split their previous party's support, an allegation Independence from Europe denied. This is despite the party costing UKIP between one and three seats at the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament election]], for which Nattrass' group is perhaps best known. Collecting 1.49% of the national vote, it proved to be their most successful election, although the party never had a candidate elected to any office.

It shared a similar [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] policy platform with UKIP, with Nattrass stating as such amid the party's launch. Key policies included [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawing the UK]] from the [[European Union]] (EU), prioritising relations with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and introducing more stringent measures on immigration. It further supported widespread use of [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referenda]], promoting [[Devolution in the United Kingdom#England|English devolution]] and abolishing the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. Nattrass placed his party to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of UKIP, however, due to both the party's general opposition to [[Privatization|privatisation]] and its proposed [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of targeted infrastructure and amenities.

== History ==
=== Background and formation ===
[[File:Mike Nattrass.jpg|thumb|170px|Founder and sole party leader, [[Mike Nattrass]]]]
Before establishing the party, [[Mike Nattrass]] had long been involved with [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Britain's Eurosceptic movement]]. In 1994, Nattrass joined the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[New Britain Party]] and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the [[Dudley West by-election, 1994|Dudley West by-election]] of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in [[Solihull (UK Parliament constituency)|Solihull]] for the single-issue [[Referendum Party]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Anthony {{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/west-midlands-european/ |title=UKPollingReport Election Guide 2010 » West Midlands European |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qMvAbM6w?url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/west-midlands-european/ |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[James Goldsmith]], this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the [[European Union]] (EU), specifically as to whether the British population wanted to be part of a federal Europe or a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|Kavanagh|1997|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass subsequently joined the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader.&lt;ref name="Nattrass Deselection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-23852962 |title=Mike Nattrass: West Midlands MEP 'failed' selection for UKIP |website=BBC News |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qMwebGJc?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-23852962 |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands constituency]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2004/euro_uk/html/37.stm |title=European Election: West Midlands Result |website=BBC News |date=14 June 2004 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNWXnAt9?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/vote2004/euro_uk/html/37.stm |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was re-elected [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_37.stm |title=European Election 2009: West Midlands |website=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNWBQ4VF?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_37.stm |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nattrass failed a candidacy assessment in August 2013 and was duly deselected as UKIP candidate for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 election]], prompting him to initiate unsuccessful legal action against the party.&lt;ref name="Nattrass Deselection 2"&gt;Walker, Jonathan {{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/ukip-mep-mike-nattrass-loses-5798307 |title=MEP loses selection battle to stand for UKIP |work=Birmingham Mail |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNYnoHuU?url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/ukip-mep-mike-nattrass-loses-5798307 |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He duly left UKIP and was in talks with the [[English Democrats]], but cancelled plans to ally with them after they prematurely announced his joining the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24354411 |title=Ex-UKIP man dismisses English Democrats 'deal' claim |website=BBC News |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNY4z944?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24354411 |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass, still a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), instead launched his own party after considering a career as an [[Independent politician|independent]].&lt;ref name="Nattrass Deselection 2"/&gt; '''An Independence Party''''s creation was announced in October 2013,&lt;ref name="IFE Launch"&gt;Edwards, Tom {{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/NEWS/10773566.UKIP__in_meltdown__as_members_quit_to_launch_new_party/?ref=rss |title=UKIP 'in meltdown' as members quit to launch new party |work=Worcester News |date=30 October 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNb5IDPc?url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/NEWS/10773566.UKIP__in_meltdown__as_members_quit_to_launch_new_party/?ref=rss |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; being renamed '''An Independence from Europe''' on 7 March 2014 to avoid confusion with UKIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/169499/4-attachments.pdf |title=Electoral Commission Records (An Independence Party) |publisher=Electoral Commission |pages=22–23 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNaQUM3J?url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/169499/4-attachments.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass had previously considered the label '''4 A Referendum'''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Les {{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/west-midlands-mep-mike-nattrass-6064413 |title=West Midlands MEP Mike Nattrass pulls out of joining English Democrats |work=Coventry Telegraph |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=11 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNZ9ffMf?url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/west-midlands-mep-mike-nattrass-6064413 |archivedate=11 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] records show that he had registered his own party significantly earlier, on 20 June 2012.

==Ideology and policies==
Little to no academic commentary has been conducted with regard to the party's ideology. Upon its launch in 2013, Nattrass implied "it will have similar [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] ideals as UKIP",&lt;ref name="IFE Launch"/&gt; only to assert a year later that "we are not the same, we are to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of UKIP."&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt; He subsequently repeated the line in 2015.&lt;ref name="GE Interview"/&gt; Aside from any ideological reason, the party was founded out of a general disaffection with UKIP's management, particularly leader Nigel Farage and Party Chairman [[Steve Crowther]],&lt;ref name="Pain Expulsion"/&gt; who left members feeling "dictated to".&lt;ref name="IFE Launch"/&gt; That said, the party stated in 2014 that some UKIP MEPs were frustrated at the party's 2009 effort in creating, and embracing, the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) group in the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8129312.stm |title=UKIP forms new Eurosceptic group |website=BBC News |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qbhd68ed?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8129312.stm |archivedate=20 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt; [[Right-wing populism|Right-wing populist]] in ideology,&lt;ref&gt;Maggini, Nicola {{cite web|url=http://cise.luiss.it/cise/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DCISE6EN_79-86.pdf |title=The populist and Eurosceptic right: The evolution of its electoral success |publisher=Italian Centre for Electoral Studies |page=1 |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=20 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qbh7JEAZ?url=http://cise.luiss.it/cise/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DCISE6EN_79-86.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass labelled EFD as "probably obnoxious"&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt; and temporarily left the group whilst an MEP.&lt;ref name="EFD Membership"&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Milazzo|2015|p=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nattrass first left EFD on 23 June 2010 to become a [[Non-Inscrits|Non-Inscrit]] UKIP MEP;&lt;ref name="Nattrass Record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28506/MIKE_NATTRASS_home.html |title=Mike Nattrass |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=23 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qfG615ab?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28506/MIKE_NATTRASS_home.html |archivedate=23 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; five days before, his colleague [[Nikki Sinclaire]] refused to renew her allegiance to the grouping.&lt;ref name="EFD Membership"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96960/NICOLE_SINCLAIRE_home.html |title=Nicole Sinclaire |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=23 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qfG4xhJi?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96960/NICOLE_SINCLAIRE_home.html |archivedate=23 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently rejoined on 11 December 2012, but left again on 9 September 2013 as a result of his resignation from UKIP.&lt;ref name="Nattrass Record"/&gt;}} Despite calling Farage a "totalitarian",&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Rowena {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/12/nigel-farage-ukip-totalitarian-mike-nattrass |title=Nigel Farage runs Ukip as 'totalitarian' operation, says party's ex-deputy leader |work=The Guardian |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qPNKc705?url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/12/nigel-farage-ukip-totalitarian-mike-nattrass |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass maintained "I support the principles UKIP stands for"&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Jonathan {{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/barred-ukip-mep-mike-nattrass-5795667 |title=Barred UKIP MEP takes his own party to court |work=Birmingham Mail |date=28 August 2013 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qPMkg0n7?url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/barred-ukip-mep-mike-nattrass-5795667 |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst protesting his deselection in court. The party claimed to advocate a society comprising "[p]ersonal freedom with personal responsibility", supported by what it saw as "traditional commonsense policies".&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

===Constitutional and legislative policy===
[[File:Debating chamber, Y Senedd - geograph.org.uk - 1375999.jpg|thumb|left|The party favoured the abolition of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] ''(pictured)''.]]
Independence from Europe's primary policy was to guarantee that the [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|United Kingdom left]] the European Union (EU).&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GE Interview"/&gt; This included its legal accessories, promising a withdrawal from the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR). The party advocated the increased use of [[direct democracy]], namely through [[Referendum|referenda]]. Petitions with support from more than 5% of the electorate would trigger a national referendum on a respective issue, with the outcome legally binding by default.&lt;ref name="Policies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/ManifestoPolicies.php |title=Policies and Manifesto |publisher=Independence from Europe |accessdate=15 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qTnBPDGv?url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/ManifestoPolicies.php |archivedate=15 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Nattrass stated in 2014 that his party was adverse to the idea of a nationwide vote on the UK's membership of the EU, calling for "MPs with backbone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27412682 |title=Show backbone, An Independence From Europe party tells MPs |website=BBC News |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=15 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qTsImBAo?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27412682 |archivedate=15 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure a departure was delivered.

The party advocated sweeping reforms of the UK's legislative process. These included a reduction of the number of [[Members of Parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by one third (650 to 430) and the replacement of the [[House of Lords]] with an elected upper chamber.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; Scheduled debates would have been introduced, upon which members for Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh constituencies would return to their devolved legislatures, leaving the UK Parliament to discuss English affairs exclusively.&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt; The party repeatedly advocated the abolition of the [[National Assembly for Wales]], however, at one time adopting the tagline 'Abolish Assembly and leave European Union';&lt;ref name="EC Record"/&gt; it suggested a referendum be held in Wales over the matter. Devolved legislatures' membership would have no longer consisted of politicians elected specifically to those chambers (i.e. [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLAs]], [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] or [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|AMs]]), but would have instead comprised those UK MPs returning routinely from the national parliament.&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

On an individual basis, MPs would have been paid and claimed expenses in-line with existing British civil service guidelines. If elected, the party claimed it would "[b]uild a condominium to house MP's whilst they reside in London"&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; and scrap their second home allowances. Legislators would have been accountable by way of an 'Independent Politicians Complaints Commission', with its members chosen by designated [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs). Furthermore, the activities of political parties would have faced greater regulation; [[Whip (politics)#United Kingdom|whips]] would have been removed from the [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] appointment process and party sanctioning against rebellious MPs disallowed.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

===Economic policy===
The party claimed that by disowning tariffs and restrictions imposed by the [[European Union Customs Union]] (EUCU) the UK could focus on adopting amicable [[Commonwealth free trade|free trade with]] the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; The party would have further sought to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], as well as attempted to lower [[Council Tax]] by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's [[Landfill Directive]]. Independence from Europe claimed that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt could have been cleared. Domestic budgetary policies included the raising of [[personal allowance]] to [[Pound sterling|£]]15,000, broad simplification of both [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Personal taxes|personal]] and [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporate]] tax and opposition to [[Zero-hour contract|zero-hours contracts]]. In addition, the party condoned the forced collection of tax from [[Tax evasion|evaders]] and the [[nationalisation]] of [[private finance initiative]]s (PFIs).&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

===Energy, environment and transport policy===
[[File:West Ruislip station MMB 31.jpg|thumb|Scrapping plans for the [[High Speed 2]] (HS2) railway has been described among the party's "key policies".]]
The party opposed government subsidy of [[wind turbine]]s and instead proposed the increased use of [[clean coal technology]] and [[nuclear fusion]] to address the UK's energy shortage. This would have been accompanied by a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hoped would keep consumer costs affordable. The party would also have abandoned catch quotas set by the EU's [[Common Fisheries Policy]] and established 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful [[Fish stock|stocks]].&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

In transport policy, Independence from Europe was generally skeptical of large-scale developments. [[BBC News]] characterised the group's opposition to the construction of the [[High Speed 2]] (HS2) railway as among "[i]ts key policies";&lt;ref name="GE Interview"/&gt; the group further warned against expansion of London's [[London Stansted Airport|Standsted]] and [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] airports, as well as the [[Expansion of Heathrow Airport#Third runway and sixth terminal|introduction of a third runway]] at [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].&lt;ref name="Transport Policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/pdf/Transport_Policy_NOV%202013.pdf |title=Transport for an Independent Britain: A 10 Point Policy Statement |publisher=Independence from Europe |page=5 |accessdate=16 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qVREe4o0?url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/pdf/Transport_Policy_NOV%202013.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the party sought to abolish [[Toll roads in Great Britain|toll roads]] and nationalise [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|UK railway franchises]] "if they fail[ed] in viability or in their contractual obligations."&lt;ref name="Transport Policy"/&gt;

===Foreign, defence and immigration policy===
The group sought to re-establish "traditional links"&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; with the Commonwealth of Nations, believing that the UK had "lost invaluable trading links, respect and friendship"&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt; with the organisation since joining the EU. Independence from Europe twice asserted that the UK misspends foreign aid on countries wealthy enough to fund independent [[Space policy|space programs]],&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; it suggested such funding should be diverted to support Britain's elderly population. In defence policy, the party pledged to increase the number of [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]] personnel to 200,000 and reduce the amount of British troops sent to fight abroad, further encouraging the [[United Nations]] (UN) to take more responsibility over international security.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

Independence from Europe called for stricter immigration policy to be implemented in the UK, but refused to set a statistical migration target.&lt;ref name="GE Interview"/&gt; It supported an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK had left the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA),&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt;{{efn|Australia issues [[Travel visa|visas]] to candidates who accumulate an acceptable amount of 'points' to be considered a skilled migrant; points are conditional on criteria such as age, competency in the [[English language]], qualifications and current/past occupation(s).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Helen {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/01/what-is-australia-points-based-immigration-system-brexit |title=What is Australia's points-based immigration system? |work=The Guardian |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=25 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qi8klLgh?url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/01/what-is-australia-points-based-immigration-system-brexit |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also have faced more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have had to carry [[Identity document#United Kingdom|identification]] at all times, as well as resided in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; Such measures, the party hoped, would justify the reintroduction of the country's [[Work permit (United Kingdom)|work permit scheme]].&lt;ref name="GE Interview"/&gt;

===Social policy===
The party supported the maintenance of Britain's [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to be free at the point of delivery and described itself as "dead against privatisation"&lt;ref name="Euro Interview"/&gt; of the institution. Whilst reducing bureaucracy in the NHS, the party would also have aimed to invest a further £5 billion to train 40,000 more nurses in addition to 10,000 extra doctors. Free dental and eye treatment would have been restored and foreign visitors would be required to possess [[Health insurance|private medical insurance]] during their time in the UK.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt; It sought to return more community services, like the NHS, into public ownership where they had been privatised entirely or in-part, including [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|prisons]] and the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]].&lt;ref name="IFE Broadcast"/&gt; It would have reserved the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|UK's wider welfare system]] to cater exclusively for British citizens; they would also have limited the amount of [[tax credit]]s a childless, able-bodied citizen could receive to 80% of the weekly [[Minimum wage|national minimum wage]] as well as restricted [[Child benefits in the United Kingdom|child benefit]] payments for households with more than two juveniles and/or a combined annual income of over £50,000. Independence from Europe supported and sought to extend tenants' '[[Right to Buy]]' [[Council house|council]] and [[housing association]] properties.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

To address crime, the party sought to deport foreign offenders, extend [[Neighborhood watch|neighborhood watch schemes]] and hold a referendum on restoring [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment in the UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/AIPvUKIP.php |title=How AIP Differs from UKIP |publisher=Independence from Europe |accessdate=30 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qqtORY9t?url=http://www.aipmep.org/Policies/AIPvUKIP.php |archivedate=30 May 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It further pledged to invest £2.5 billion into the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police service]], promising to recruit 10,000 more [[Police officer|officers]]. In addition, the group would have reformed education policy by aiming to cut school class sizes and scrapping [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] for UK students attending [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]]; conversely, all foreign students would have been required to pay in full.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

'''Internal Security Service ''' ('''ISS'''; {{lang-ar|'''جهاز الأمن الداخلي'''}}) [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]:''' ''Jahaz al Amn al Dakhly''''', is the [[national security]] agency of the Sultanate of [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Security Service|url=http://www.oman.om/wps/portal/!ut/p/a0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOKNDdwNDPwtPX1NnAJdDIy8jLxNgx2NjQyCTfSDM0viPUP0C7IdFQFFnssd/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/EN/site/home/gov/gov1/gov5governmentorganizations/iss/|website=www.oman.om|accessdate=7 July 2017|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency focuses solely upon domestic security while foreign intelligence operations is specifically handled by the [[Palace Office (Oman)|Palace Office]], which controls external security and coordinates all intelligence and security policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oman, Page 3|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/186654.pdf|publisher=US DOS|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kragujevac massacre''' was the [[mass murder]] of between 2,778 and 2,794&amp;nbsp;mostly [[Serbs|Serb]] men and boys in [[Kragujevac]]{{efn|{{lang-sr-cyr|Крагујевац}}, {{IPA-sh|krǎɡujeʋat͡s|pron|Kragujevac.ogg}}}} by [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers on 21&amp;nbsp;October 1941. It occurred in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]] during [[World War II]], and came in [[reprisal]] for insurgent attacks in the [[Gornji Milanovac]] district that resulted in the deaths of 10&amp;nbsp;German soldiers and the wounding of 26&amp;nbsp;others. The number of hostages to be shot was calculated as a ratio of 100&amp;nbsp;hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by [[Adolf Hitler]] with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.

After a punitive operation was conducted in the surrounding villages, during which 422&amp;nbsp;males were shot and four villages burned down, another 70&amp;nbsp;male [[Jews]] and [[communism|communists]] who had been arrested in Kragujevac were shot. Simultaneously, males between the ages of 16&amp;nbsp;and 60, including high school students, were assembled by German troops and local [[collaborationism|collaborators]], and the victims were selected from amongst them. The selected males were then marched to fields outside the city, shot with heavy [[machine gun]]s, and their bodies buried in [[mass grave]]s. Contemporary German military records indicate that 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages were shot. After the war, inflated estimates ranged as high as 7,000&amp;nbsp;deaths, but German and Serbian scholars have now agreed on the figure of nearly 2,800&amp;nbsp;killed, including 144&amp;nbsp;high school students. As well as Serbs, massacre victims included Jews, [[Romani people in Serbia|Romani people]], [[Islam in Serbia|Muslims]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Slovenes]] and members of other nationalities.

Several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]]. The massacre had a profound effect on the course of the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|war in Yugoslavia]]. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and the royalist, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Chetniks]], and convinced Chetnik leader [[Draža Mihailović]] that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as they tended to drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100&amp;nbsp;executions for one soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the [[October in Kragujevac Memorial Park]] and the co-located 21st&amp;nbsp;October Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.

==Background==
===Encirclement and invasion of Yugoslavia===
Following the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6–7}} At the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II, the Yugoslav government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6–7}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25&amp;nbsp;March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a "government of national unity" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Dušan Simović]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=10–13}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6&amp;nbsp;April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}

Yugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. The [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]] was limited to the pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and was directly occupied by the Germans for the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, as well as its valuable resources, particularly [[non-ferrous metals]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=49}} The occupied territory covered about {{convert|51,000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 3.8&amp;nbsp;million. Hitler had briefly considered erasing all existence of a Serbian state, but this was quickly abandoned and the Germans began searching for a Serb suitable to lead a [[puppet government]] in Belgrade.{{sfn|Ramet|Lazić|2011|pp=19–20}} They initially settled on [[Milan Aćimović]], a staunch [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] who served as Yugoslavia's [[Ministry of the Interior (Yugoslavia)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] in late 1939 and early 1940.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=177–178}}

===Occupation and resistance===
[[File:Territory Of The German Military Commander In Serbia 1941-44.png|thumb|right|upright=1|alt=Wartime map of Serbia|Map of German-occupied Serbia]]
Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist]]-led, multi-ethnic [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], and the royalist, Serbian nationalist [[Chetniks]], although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted almost entirely of Serbs. The Partisans were led by the [[President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], [[Josip Broz Tito]]; the Chetniks were led by [[Colonel]] [[Draža Mihailović]], an officer in the interwar [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. The two movements had widely divergent goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war ''[[status quo]]'', whereby the Yugoslav monarchy—and, by extension, Serb political hegemony—would be restored.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=59–60}} Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=177–178}} By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=59–60}} The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders had ample military experience, having fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Within several months of the invasion, they had 8,000&amp;nbsp;fighters spread across 21&amp;nbsp;[[detachment (military)|detachments]] in Serbia alone.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=198}} Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World War&amp;nbsp;I or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=118–123}} They boasted around 20,000&amp;nbsp;fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia at the time of the massacre.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}}

On 29&amp;nbsp;August, the Germans replaced Aćimović with another fervent anti-communist, the former [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Minister of the Army and Navy]] and [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|Chief of the General Staff]], General [[Milan Nedić]], who formed a [[Government of National Salvation|new puppet government]].{{sfn|Ramet|Lazić|2011|p=22}} In September, the Nedić government was permitted to form the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Command]] ({{lang-sh|Srpska dobrovoljačka komanda}}; SDK), an auxiliary [[paramilitary]] formation to help quell anti-German resistance. In effect, the SDK was the military arm of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Yugoslav National Movement]] ({{lang-sh-Latn|links=no|Združena borbena organizacija rada}}, ''Zbor''), led by [[Dimitrije Ljotić]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=38}} It was originally intended to have a strength of 3,000–4,000&amp;nbsp;troops, but this number eventually rose to 12,000.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=58–59}} It was headed by [[Kosta Mušicki]], a former colonel in the Royal Yugoslav Army, whom Nedić appointed on 6&amp;nbsp;October 1941.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=37}} In the early stages of the occupation, the SDK formed the bulk of Nedić's forces, which numbered around 20,000&amp;nbsp;men by late 1941.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=28}}

==Prelude==
===Anti-German uprising===
{{main|Uprising in Serbia (1941)}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H30220, Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]] of the [[OKW]] issued Hitler's order regarding the ratio of hostages to be shot. After the war, he was convicted of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], and executed in 1946.|alt=a black and white image of a man in uniform]]
Nedić's inability to crush the Partisans and Chetniks prompted the Military Commander in Serbia to request German reinforcements from other parts of the continent.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=28}} In mid-September, they transferred the 125th Infantry Regiment from Greece and the [[342nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|342nd Infantry Division]] from France to help put down the uprising in Serbia. On 16&amp;nbsp;September, Hitler issued Directive No.&amp;nbsp;312 to ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) [[Wilhelm List]], the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' commander in Southeast Europe, ordering him to suppress all resistance in that part of the continent. That same day, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Supreme Command of the Armed Forces]] (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht''; OKW) issued Hitler's order on the suppression of "Communist Armed Resistance Movements in the Occupied Areas", signed by ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=146}} This decree specified that all attacks against the Germans on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were to be "regarded as being of communist origin", and that 100&amp;nbsp;hostages were to be shot for every German soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;were to be shot for every German soldier wounded.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=140}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=61}} It was intended to apply to all of [[Eastern Europe]], though an identical policy had already been implemented in Serbia as early as 28&amp;nbsp;April 1941, aimed at deterring guerrilla attacks. Attacks against the Germans increased in the first half of the year and Serbia once again became a warzone. German troops fanned through the countryside burning villages, taking hostages and establishing concentration camps. The first mass executions of hostages commenced in July.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=61}}

The strengthening of Germany's military presence in Serbia resulted in a new wave of mass executions and [[war crime]]s. The commanders who bore the most responsibility for these atrocities were primarily of Austrian origin and had served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=215}} Most were ardently [[Anti-Serb sentiment|anti-Serb]], a prejudice that the historian [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]] links to the Nazis' wider anti-[[Slavs|Slavic]] racism.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=60–61}}

On 19&amp;nbsp;September, ''[[General der Gebirgstruppe]]'' ([[Lieutenant General]]) [[Franz Böhme]] was appointed as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia, with direct responsibility for quelling the revolt, bringing with him the staff of [[XVIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XVIII&amp;nbsp;Mountain Corps]]. He was allocated additional forces to assist him in doing so, reinforcing the three German occupation divisions already in the territory.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=97–98}} These divisions were the [[104th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|704th Infantry Division]], [[114th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|714th Infantry Division]] and [[117th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|717th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=96}} Böhme boasted a profound hatred of Serbs and encouraged his predominantly Austrian-born troops to exact "vengeance" against them. His primary grievances were the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and subsequent Austro-Hungarian military defeats at the hands of the [[Royal Serbian Army]], which he thought could only be rectified by the reprisal shooting of Serbian civilians. "Your objective," Böhme declared, "is to be achieved in a land where, in 1914, streams of German blood flowed because of the treachery of the Serbs, men and women. You are the avengers of those dead."{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=199}}

===Clash at Gornji Milanovac===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J21813, Franz Böhme.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''General der Gebirgstruppe'' [[Franz Böhme]] was furious when his orders to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages were not carried out. After the war, he committed suicide before his arraignment on war crimes charges.|alt=a black and white image of a male in uniform]]
On 28&amp;nbsp;September, the 6th Company of the German 920th ''Landesschützen'' (Local Defence) Battalion was captured by insurgents in the town of [[Gornji Milanovac]].{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|pp=980–981}}{{sfn|Manoschek|1995|pp=158–159}} According to the journalist [[Misha Glenny]], the Partisans launched an attack on a small German detachment based at a local school. They did not expect to capture the German garrison, but undertook the attack in order to generate new recruits from the surrounding area. The local Chetnik commander, Zvonimir Vučković, became aware of the Partisan plans and decided to join in the attack to avoid the significant loss of prestige that would result from allowing the Partisans to attack alone. The insurgents launched a morning attack against the school. Although they were successful in overrunning the sentry posts, the Germans' heavy [[machine gun]]s soon stopped the assault. In 90&amp;nbsp;minutes of fighting, 10&amp;nbsp;Germans were killed and 26&amp;nbsp;wounded. The two insurgent groups judged that continuing the assault would be too costly and Vučković suggested negotiating with the Germans. To the insurgents' surprise, the Germans surrendered. They were then taken away by Vučković and his men.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|pp=491–492}}

A German officer who escaped reported that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme became aware of the situation, he decided that retaliation was needed.{{sfn|Manoschek|1995|pp=158–159}}{{sfn|Glenny|2001|pp=491–492}} He ordered III.&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the [[117th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht)|717th Infantry Division]], to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6&amp;nbsp;October, and released the 170&amp;nbsp;hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and on 15&amp;nbsp;October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16&amp;nbsp;October.{{sfn|Manoschek|1995|pp=158–159}}

===Kraljevo massacre===
{{main article|Kraljevo massacre}}
On 15–16&amp;nbsp;October,{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=343}} 10&amp;nbsp;German soldiers were killed and 14&amp;nbsp;wounded during a joint Partisan-Chetnik attack on [[Kraljevo]], a city about {{convert|150|km}} south of [[Belgrade]] and {{convert|50|km}} southeast of Gornji Milanovac.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} On 15&amp;nbsp;October, troops of the 717th Infantry Division shot 300&amp;nbsp;civilians from Kraljevo in reprisal.{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|loc=p. 306, note 109}} These reprisal killings continued over the following days, and by 17&amp;nbsp;or 20&amp;nbsp;October,{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} German troops had rounded up and shot 1,736&amp;nbsp;men and 19&amp;nbsp;"communist" women from the city and its outskirts,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|loc=p. 146, note 92}}{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=84}} despite attempts by local collaborationists to mitigate the punishment.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} These executions were personally supervised by the commander of the 717th Infantry Division, ''[[Generalmajor]]'' ([[Brigadier general|Brigadier General]]) [[Paul Hoffmann (general)|Paul Hoffman]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=140}}

Kragujevac is an [[industrial district|industrial city]] in [[Central Serbia]], about {{convert|100|km}} south of Belgrade,{{sfn|Mazower|2002|p=7}} and {{convert|37|km}} east of Gornji Milanovac.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=492}} It had a population of more than 40,000&amp;nbsp;in 1941,{{sfn|Jorgić|2013|p=79}} and was the headquarters of a German military district.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=492}} The city was also home to [[Zastava Arms|Yugoslavia's largest armaments factory]], which had between 7,000 and 8,000 workers before the invasion.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=624}}

A report was written by the military district commander in Kragujevac, ''[[Hauptmann]]'' ([[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]]) Otto von Bischofhausen, immediately after the massacre. This report was addressed to Böhme, and was later tendered in evidence at the [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials]]. According to von Bischofhausen, in the late evening of 18&amp;nbsp;October, all male [[Jews]] in Kragujevac, along with some communists, were arrested according to lists, totalling 70&amp;nbsp;persons. As this constituted far too few hostages to meet the quota of 2,300, it was proposed to collect the balance by arrests on the streets, squares and houses of Kragujevac, in an operation to be conducted by III./749th Infantry Regiment, and I.&amp;nbsp;Battalion of the 724th Infantry Regiment, part of the 704th Infantry Division. In response to this proposal, von Bischofhausen claimed that he suggested to the garrison commander, [[Major]] Paul König, that, instead of using the population of Kragujevac, the required hostages be gathered from surrounding villages which were known to be "completely strewn with communists".{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|p=981}} According to von Bischofhausen's account, this suggestion was initially accepted by König, and, on 19&amp;nbsp;October, III./749th Infantry Regiment "mopped up" the villages of Mečkovac and Maršić, and I./724th Infantry Regiment conducted a similar operation in the villages of [[Grošnica]] and Milatovac. A total of 422&amp;nbsp;men were shot in these four villages, without any German losses.{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|pp=981–982}}

On the evening of 19&amp;nbsp;October, von Bischofhausen again met with König and was told that the original proposal was to be implemented the following day in order to collect the 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages. The following evening, the male Jews and communists, who had been held without food since their arrest, were shot by German troops at the barracks and courtyard where they were being held.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=492}} Simultaneously, males between the ages of 16&amp;nbsp;and 60&amp;nbsp;were arrested within Kragujevac itself.{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|p=982}}{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} They were detained in the barracks of a former motorised battalion at Stanovija Field.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=492}} Over 7,000&amp;nbsp;hostages were assembled.{{sfn|Byford|2011a|loc=pp. 126–127, note 35}} German troops and [[Germans of Yugoslavia|ethnic German]] units from the [[Banat (1941–44)|Banat]] were involved in the round-up,{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}} as was the Fifth Regiment of the SDK, under the command of Marisav Petrović.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=38}} According to von Bischofhausen, König permitted several classes of males to be excluded from the round-up, including those with a special pass issued by von Bischofhausen's district headquarters, members of a vital profession or trade, and those who were members of Ljotić's movement.{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|p=982}}{{efn|Those excluded on the basis of their profession included medical personnel, pharmacists and technicians.{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}}}} When too few adult males could be located, high school students were also rounded up.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}} Also seized were priests and monks from the city's churches. Each hostage was registered and his belongings noted meticulously.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=492}}

===Executions===
[[File:Notification on 21 October 1941.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|German public notification announcing the shooting of hostages, 21 October 1941]]
The hostages were held overnight on a public plaza in the town. In his version of events, von Bischofhausen claimed that he made objections to König, but the latter insisted that his orders, which had been issued by the commander of the 749th Infantry Regiment, would be carried out.{{sfn|von Bischofhausen|1950|p=982}} Shortly before the executions commenced, Ljotić obtained approval for two ''Zbor'' officials to scrutinise the hostages. Over 3,000&amp;nbsp;individuals, those identified as being "genuine nationalists" and "real patriots", were excluded from the execution lists as a result of Ljotić's intervention.{{sfn|Byford|2011a|loc=pp. 126–127, note 35}} Those who were not extracted from the hostage pool were accused of being communists or spreading "communist propaganda". The ''Zbor'' officials told them they were not "worth saving" because they had "infected the younger generation with their leftist ideas."{{sfn|Antić|2012|p=29}} The Germans considered ''Zbor'''s involvement to be a "nuisance". According to the [[social science|social scientist]] Jovan Byford, it was never intended or likely to reduce the overall number of hostages killed in reprisal, and served only to ensure the exclusion of those that were deemed by ''Zbor'' to be worth saving.{{sfn|Byford|2011a|loc=pp. 126–127, note 35}}

On the morning of 21&amp;nbsp;October, the assembled men and boys were marched to a field outside the town. Over a period of seven hours, they were lined up in groups of 50&amp;nbsp;to 120 and shot with heavy machine guns. "Go ahead and shoot", said an elderly teacher, "I am conducting my class".{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}} He was shot together with his students.{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} As they faced the [[firing squad]], many hostages sang the patriotic song ''[[Hey, Slavs]]'', which became Yugoslavia's [[national anthem]] after the war.{{sfn|Pavković|Kelen|2016|p=56}} One German soldier was shot for refusing to participate in the killings.{{sfn|West|1995|p=112}} A German report stated: "The executions in Kragujevac occurred although there had been no attacks on members of the Wehrmacht in this city, for the reason that not enough hostages could be found elsewhere."{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|loc=p. 370, note 74}}{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=194}} Even some German [[informant]]s were inadvertently killed.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|loc=p. 370, note 74}} "Clearly", the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] historian Mark Levene writes, "Germans in uniform were not ''that'' particular about who they shot in reprisal, especially in the Balkans, where the populace were deemed subhuman."{{sfn|Levene|2013|p=84}}

Following the massacre, the Germans held a military parade through the city centre.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=493}} On 31&amp;nbsp;October, Böhme sent a report to the acting Wehrmacht commander in Southeast Europe, ''[[General der Pioniere]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Walter Kuntze]], reporting that 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages had been shot in Kragujevac.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|pp=767 &amp; 1277}}

==Aftermath==
===Response===
The Partisan commander and later historian [[Milovan Djilas]] recalled how the Kragujevac massacre gripped all of Serbia in "deadly terror".{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=483}} Throughout the war, local collaborators pressured the Germans to implement stringent vetting procedures to ensure that "innocent civilians" were not executed, though only when the hostages were ethnic Serbs.{{sfn|Byford|2011a|p=306}}{{sfn|Byford|2011b|p=120}} By the time Böhme was relieved as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in December 1941, between 20,000 and 30,000 civilians had been killed in German reprisal shootings.{{sfn|Manoschek|2000|p=178}} The ratio of 100&amp;nbsp;executions for each soldier killed and 50&amp;nbsp;executions for each soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. Henceforth, each individual execution had to be approved by Special Envoy [[Hermann Neubacher]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=69}} The massacres in Kragujevac and Kraljevo caused German military commanders in Serbia to question the efficacy of such killings, as they pushed thousands of Serbs into the hands of anti-German guerrillas. In Kraljevo, the entire Serbian workforce of an airplane factory producing armaments for the Germans was shot. This helped convince the OKW that arbitrary shootings of Serbs not only incurred a significant political cost but were also counterproductive.{{sfn|Mazower|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Browning|2007|p=344}}

The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo exacerbated tensions between the Partisans and Chetniks.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=62}} They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile for as long as the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=146}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=31}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=63}} The killings occurred only a few days before Captain [[Bill Hudson (British Army officer)|Bill Hudson]], a [[Special Operations Executive]] officer, met with Mihailović at his [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] headquarters.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=217}} Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," he recounted, "because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović."{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=61}} "The tragedy gave to Nedić convincing proof that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," Djilas wrote, "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans".{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=483}} Mihailović's decision to refrain from attacking the Germans led to a rift with Tito and the Partisans. The Chetniks' non-resistance made it easier for the Germans to confront the Partisans, who for much of the remainder of the war could not defeat them in open combat.{{sfn|Shepherd|2016|p=200}}

===Legal proceedings and casualty estimates===
[[File:List Indictment.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|[[Wilhelm List]] is handed the indictment in the [[Hostages Trial]], 12 May 1947]]
List and Böhme were both captured at the end of the war. On 10&amp;nbsp;May 1947, they were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of the [[Hostages Trial]] of the subsequent Nuremberg trials.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=759}} One of the crimes specifically listed in Count&amp;nbsp;1 of the indictment was the massacre of 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages in Kragujevac.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=767}} Böhme committed suicide before his [[arraignment]].{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=759}} List was found guilty on Count&amp;nbsp;1, as well as on another count.{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=1274}} He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in 1948,{{sfn|Nuremberg Military Tribunals|1950|p=1318}} but was released due to ill health in 1953. Despite this, he lived until June&amp;nbsp;1971.{{sfn|Wistrich|2013|p=159}} Keitel was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], and subsequently hanged.{{sfn|Wistrich|2013|p=137}} Hoffmann, whom the local population dubbed the "butcher of Kraljevo and Kragujevac", was promoted to command the more capable [[352nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|352nd Infantry Division]] in November&amp;nbsp;1941.{{sfn|Browning|1985|loc=p. 100, note 86}} He ended the war as the commander of a [[prisoner-of-war camp]], having been demoted for refusing to shoot deserters in the Ukraine.{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=140}} The 717th Infantry Division was reorganised as the 117th Jäger Division later in the war and its troops took part in the [[Massacre of Kalavryta|massacre]] of hundreds of Greek civilians at [[Kalavryta]] in December 1943.{{sfn|Mazower|2004|p=154}}

At least 31&amp;nbsp;mass graves were discovered in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|pp=492–493}} In 1969, the historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300&amp;nbsp;hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed that the number of victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|loc=p. 370, note 74}} In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some estimates of the number of those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|loc=p. 146, note 92}} In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000&amp;nbsp;victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|loc=p. 62, note 15}} In the same year, the curator of the 21st&amp;nbsp;October Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794&amp;nbsp;victims.{{sfn|Markovich|2014|loc=p. 139, note 17}} Of the total killed, 144&amp;nbsp;were high school students, and five of the victims were 12&amp;nbsp;years old.{{sfn|Glenny|2001|p=493}} The last living survivor of the massacre, Dragoljub Jovanović, died in October 2018 at the age of 94. He survived despite sustaining 11 bullet wounds and had to have one of his legs amputated. After the war, he was appointed the inaugural director of the 21st&amp;nbsp;October Museum.{{sfn|Radio Television of Serbia 22 October 2018}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Da.se.ne.zaboravi.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The ''Interrupted Flight'' monument at the [[October in Kragujevac Memorial Park]]]]
The massacre at Kragujevac came to symbolize the brutality of the German occupation in Yugoslav popular memory.{{sfn|Benz|2006|p=206}} It has drawn comparisons to the Germans' [[Lidice massacre|destruction]] of the Czechoslovak village of [[Lidice]] in June 1942 and the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|massacre]] of the inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane, in France, in June 1944.{{sfn|Prusin|2017|p=97}} To commemorate the victims of the Kragujevac massacre, the whole of Šumarice, where the killings took place, was designated a memorial park in 1953. It is now known as the [[October in Kragujevac Memorial Park]], and covers {{convert|353|ha}} encompassing the area that contains the mass graves. The 21st&amp;nbsp;October Museum was founded within the park on 15&amp;nbsp;February 1976. There are also several monuments within the park, including the ''Interrupted Flight'' monument to the murdered high school students and their teachers, and the monuments ''Pain and Defiance'', ''One Hundred for One'', and ''Resistance and Freedom''. The Memorial Park website notes that the victims of the massacre included Serbs, Jews, [[Romani people in Serbia|Romani people]], [[Islam in Serbia|Muslims]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Slovenes]] and members of other nationalities.{{sfn|Memorial Park|2017}} The memorial was damaged during the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999.{{sfn|Winstone|2010|loc=Serbia}}

The Serbian poet and writer [[Desanka Maksimović]] wrote a poem about the massacre titled ''Krvava bajka'' ("A Bloody Fairy Tale").{{sfn|Hawkesworth|2000|p=209}} The poem was later included in the Yugoslav secondary school curriculum and schoolchildren were required to memorise it.{{sfn|Milojković-Djurić|1997|loc=p. 106, note 5}} It ranks among the most famous Serbian-language poems.{{sfn|Juraga|2002|p=204}} In 1965, the Belgian poet [[Karel Jonckheere]] wrote the poem ''Kinderen met krekelstem'' ("Children with Cricket Voices"), also about the massacre.{{sfn|Bourgeois|1970|p=68}} ''The Blue Butterfly'', a book of poetry by [[Richard Berengarten]], is based on the poet's experiences while visiting Kragujevac in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on his hand at the entrance to the memorial museum.{{sfn|Derrick|2015|pp=170–171}}

The massacre has been the subject of two feature films: ''Prozvan je i&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|V-3}}'' (''{{nowrap|V-3}} is Called Out''; 1962){{sfn|Daković|2010|p=393}} and ''Krvava bajka'' (''A Bloody Fairy Tale''; 1969), named after the eponymous poem.{{sfn|Liehm|Liehm|1977|p=431}} In 2012, the [[National Assembly (Serbia)|National Assembly of Serbia]] passed a law declaring 21&amp;nbsp;October a [[public holiday]], the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War&amp;nbsp;II.{{sfn|Radio Television of Serbia 21 October 2012}}

[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] face legal challenges and discrimination not faced by other people. Same-sex sexual activity is no longer criminalized, and neither is same-sex marriage. The Virgin Islands lacks a [[hate crimes]] statute and provides LGBT residents no protection against discrimination. Following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' on June 26, 2015, which found the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional, same-sex marriage became legal in the islands.

==Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity==

The first anti-gay criminal law was imposed by Denmark, who had purchased the islands, in 1917.   In 1957 the law was expanded to prohibit oral sex.  

In 1978, the law was challenged in court as being too vague, but the court rejected this argument.

In 1984, the legislature revised its sex crimes statues to allow consenting adults to have a private life.  This revision formally took effect a year later.

Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 1985, as long as it occurs between consenting adults in private.  Initially, the age of consent was set at 16, but this was raised to 18 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay rights map: Notes on the data|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-26016267|accessdate=November 3, 2014|work=BBC News|date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the United States Virgin Islands}}
The statutes of the Virgin Islands state that "Marriage is hereby declared to be a civil contract which may be entered into between a male and a female in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virgin Islands Code 16 V.I.C. ch. 2 § 31 |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/vicode/|accessdate=November 3, 2014|publisher=LexisNexis|work=Virgin Islands Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on June 30, 2015, Governor [[Kenneth Mapp]] announced that the territorial government would comply with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', recognizing marriage as a fundamental right that cannot be denied to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Ernice|title=Mapp to Issue Executive Order Mandating Gov.

===History===
In May 2014, Senator Judi Buckley introduced draft legislation in the [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands|legislature]] to establish same-sex marriage. Called the Civil Marriage Equality Act, it would replace the Code's "between a male and a female" with "between two persons". It included language that would allow anyone authorized to perform a wedding ceremony to decline to do so for any reason. She anticipated that it would take several months for its language to be reviewed.&lt;ref name=fierce&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=November 2, 2014 |url=http://m.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/buckley-s-same-sex-marriage-bill-sparks-fierce-debate-1.1716904 |work=Virgin Islands Daily News |date=July 10, 2014 |first=Jenny |last=Kane |title=Buckley's same-sex marriage bill sparks fierce debate |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220055237/http://m.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/buckley-s-same-sex-marriage-bill-sparks-fierce-debate-1.1716904 |archivedate=December 20, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She expected that she and Governor [[John de Jongh]], who she said would sign the legislation, would leave office in January 2015 before the legislation came to a vote.&lt;ref name=unlikely&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stcroixsource.com/content/news/local-news/2014/07/13/buckley-marriage-equality-bill-unlikely-pass-she-leaves-office|first=Susan|last=Ellis|agency=St. Croix Source|title=Buckley: Marriage Equality Bill Unlikely to Pass Before She Leaves Office|date=July 13, 2014|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the legislation include Liberty Place, an LGBT advocacy organization based on St. Croix.&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt;

In response, a group of church leaders organized [[One Voice Virgin Islands]] to oppose the legislation and plan a petition drive that aimed to collect 50,000 signatures.&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt; The group authored a letter to V.I. officials that some of its members found objectionable because it included the suggestion that some government officials were homosexual.&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt;&lt;ref name=unlikely/&gt; The group's president, New Vision Ministries Pastor James Petty of St. Thomas, said: "We do not wish to be America's same-sex paradise".&lt;ref name=fierce/&gt; Pastor Lennox Zamore said that he rejected the argument that legalizing same-sex marriage would benefit the local economy: "We don't want to balance our books by bringing the sex industry – whether it is same sex or not – to the Virgin Islands",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stjohnsource.com/content/news/local-news/2014/07/24/one-voice-rallies-against-marriage-equality-bill|agency=St. John Source|title='One Voice' Rallies Against Marriage-Equality Bill|date=July 24, 2014|accessdate=November 3, 2014|first=James|last=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberism''' (derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] term ''liberismo'') is a term for the [[Economics|economic doctrine]] of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] first used by the philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and popularized in [[English language|English]] by the [[Italian-American]] [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Giovanni Sartori]].

Sartori imported the term from Italian in order to distinguish between [[social liberalism]], which is generally considered a [[political ideology]] often advocating extensive government intervention in the economy; and those [[Economic liberalism|liberal theories of economics]] which propose to virtually eliminate such intervention. In informal usage, liberism overlaps with other concepts such as [[free trade]], [[neoliberalism]], [[right-libertarianism]], the [[United States|American]] concept of [[libertarianism]] and the [[French language|French]] notion of ''laissez-faire''.

In Italy, liberism is often identified with the [[Political philosophy|political theories]] of [[Gaetano Mosca]], [[Luigi Einaudi]] and [[Bruno Leoni]]. Internationally, liberism has been advocated by the [[Austrian School]] of economic theory, for instance by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]].

This is a partial list of allegations of misuse of the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which traces its roots to the creation of the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] in 1862. Examples of political profiling controversies include cases in which IRS employees or government officials have allegedly used IRS resources to target individuals and groups for espousing or expressing particular political beliefs.

== 1930s ==

Use of the IRS for political targeting has been alleged as far back as the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration.

:“My father,” [[Elliott Roosevelt]] observed of his famous parent, “may have been the originator of the concept of employing the IRS as a weapon of political retribution.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HwTPk00QMHIC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cmay+have+been+the+originator+of+the+concept+of+employing+the+IRS+as+a+weapon+of+political+retribution.%E2%80%9C&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5wz0QI69fL&amp;sig=BE2PbH1Ad4E52vnnamVIe_68W1s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BeWUUYLPD4eJ4ASkwIHoAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cmay%20have%20been%20the%20originator%20of%20the%20concept%20of%20employing%20the%20IRS%20as%20a%20weapon%20of%20political%20retribution.&amp;f=false New Deal Or Raw Deal?: How FDR's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America By Burton W. Folsom, Jr. Chapter 11:"The IRS, FDR's personal weapon". ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1940s-1960s ==

The most famous Kennedy administration project allegedly deploying tax-related targeting was called the "Ideological Organizations Project".  This was a project which allegedly investigated, intimidated, and challenged the tax-exempt status of right-wing foundations.&lt;ref name="amazon2002"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Power-Destroy-Political-Kennedy-Nixon/dp/1566634520/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368521622&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=irs+political Andrew, John A., III (2002) Power to Destroy: The Political Uses of the IRS from Kennedy to Nixon  ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many instances of alleged political profiling were coordinated with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), sometimes under [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scherer |first=Michael |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/14/anger-over-irs-audits-of-conservatives-anchored-in-long-history-of-abuse/#ixzz2TMyxsVPZ |title=IRS Scandal Echoes a Long History of Political Harassment &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Swampland.time.com |date= 14 May 2013|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRS provided the FBI with free access to tax returns, which the FBI used to investigate groups as ideologically varied as the [[John Birch Society]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and the [[American Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/lists/irs-scandal/american_communists.html?state=stop |title=History of IRS Abuse: American Communists |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Real Clear Politics |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the 1960s, the IRS audited civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] numerous times.&lt;ref name="burnham"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burnham |first=David |year=1989 |title=MISUSE OF THE I.R.S.: THE ABUSE OF POWER |journal=The New York Times Magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/magazine/misuse-of-the-irs-the-abuse-of-power.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/lists/irs-scandal/martin_luther_king.html?state=stop |title=History of IRS Abuse: Martin Luther King Jr. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Real Clear Politics |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to King himself, the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] and several of King's lawyers were subjected to audits.

==Nixon==
{{main|Watergate scandal}}
In 1974, a Bill of Impeachment against President [[Richard Nixon]] was approved by the [[House Judiciary Committee]] that included charges that his administration attempted to use the IRS in a discriminatory manner:
:
:RESOLVED, That Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours...
:
:Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States...
:
:He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to... cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watergate.info/impeachment/articles-of-impeachment |title=Watergate Articles Of Impeachment |publisher=Watergate.info |date= |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinton ==
Conservative groups including the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[National Rifle Association]], and [[Judicial Watch]] alleged that the [[Bill Clinton administration|Clinton administration]] subjected them to politically motivated audits.&lt;ref name="rcp1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/lists/irs-scandal/paula_corbin_jones.html?state=stop |title=History of IRS Abuse: Paula Corbin Jones |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Real Clear Politics |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==G. W. Bush ==

The NAACP was audited in 2004 after its chairman criticized then-President [[George W. Bush]] for failing to address the group, becoming the first president to do so since [[Herbert Hoover]].&lt;ref name="naacp1"&gt;{{cite news |title=NAACP blames tax audit on criticism of Bush |author=Kelly Brewington |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-10-29/news/0410290318_1_tax-exempt-organizations-audit-naacp |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=29 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRS informed the NAACP that the audit was prompted by then-NAACP-chairman [[Julian Bond]]'s speech, which "condemned the administration policies of George W. Bush on education, the economy and the war in Iraq."&lt;ref name="naacp2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrats denounce IRS audit of NAACP |author=Kelly Brewington |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-10-30/news/0410300223_1_naacp-bond-tax-exempt-status |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=30 October 2004 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the IRS maintained that the audit was an attempt to determine whether the NAACP had involved itself in a political campaign, the NAACP and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] representatives characterized the audit as an attempt to stifle criticism of Bush, intimidate NAACP members, and harm the NAACP's get-out-the-vote campaign.&lt;ref name="naacp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=naacp2 /&gt;

According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in 2004, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the IRS audited the liberal group [[Greenpeace]] at the request of [[Public Interest Watch]], a group funded by Exxon-Mobil.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Cesca |title=10 Examples of Bush and the Republicans Using Government Power to Target Critics |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-cesca/10-examples-of-bush-and-t_b_3288007.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exxon-Mobil said it was not aware of the IRS audit, nor did it have a role in initiating the audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steve Stecklow |title=Did a Group Financed by Exxon Prompt IRS to Audit Greenpeace? |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114291044305003774 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=21 March 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' ''PolitiFact'' the allegation that the IRS during the Bush Administration targeted liberal groups is "Mostly False".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jon Greenberg |title=IRS targeted liberal groups during Bush years, says Jim McDermott |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/06/jim-mcdermott/irs-targeted-liberal-groups-bush-years-jim-mcdermo/ |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=6 June 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obama ==

{{main|IRS targeting controversy}}

In May 2013, the IRS admitted it had subjected conservative political groups to closer scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status based on particular keywords in their names.  The agency has maintained that low-level employees took it upon themselves to do this.  However, Republicans argue that the refusal of [[Lois Lerner]] (at the time was Director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations Unit) to testify before Congress, twice citing her Constitutional right against self-incrimination, suggests involvement by higher-level employees.  An internal report by the agency's Inspector General cited "ineffective management" as the cause and indicated that the IRS "will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future." &lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/irs-irs-long-history-dirty-tricks/story?id=19177178]&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress continues to investigate the possibility that Lerner or other high-level officials were involved in improper political targeting.  Republican lawmakers say the IRS has improperly withheld and destroyed evidence, while Democrats argue that Republicans are attempting to keep the controversy alive for political purposes.

'''Logrolling''' is the trading of favors, or ''[[quid pro quo]]'', such as [[vote trading]] by [[legislative]] members to obtain [[passage (legislature)|passage]] of actions of interest to each legislative member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.education2020.com/activities/vocab.aspx?keystr=12891&amp;order=03030605&amp;stbl=2196465] – Education 2020, government course; definition of logrolling: ''"An agreement by two or more lawmakers to support each other's bills."''&lt;/ref&gt; In an academic context, the ''[[Nuttall Encyclopedia]]'' describes logrolling as "mutual praise by authors of each other's work". In [[organizational analysis]], it refers to a practice in which different organizations promote each other's agendas, each in the expectation that the other will reciprocate.

== Concept and origin ==
There are three types of logrolling:
* Logrolling in [[direct democracy|direct democracies]]: a few individuals vote openly, and votes are easy to trade, rearrange, and observe. Direct democracy is pervasive in representative assemblies and small-government units
* Implicit logrolling: large bodies of voters decide complex issues and trade votes without a formal vote trade (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=James M. and Tullock, Gordon|title=The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy|year=1962|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Distributive logrolling: enables policymakers to achieve their public goals. These policymakers logroll to ensure that their district policies and [[pork barrel]] packages are put into practice regardless of whether their policies are actually efficient (Evans 1994&lt;ref name="EvansDiana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=Diana|title=Policy and Pork: The Use of Pork Barrel Projects to Build Policy Coalitions in the House of Representatives|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=1994|volume=38|series=4|pages=894–917|doi=10.2307/2111726|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

Distributive logrolling is the most prevalent kind of logrolling found in a democratic system of governance{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

"Quid pro quo" sums up the concept of logrolling in the United States’ political process today. Logrolling is the process by which politicians trade support for one issue or piece of legislation in exchange for another politician's support, especially by means of legislative votes (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holcombe|first=Randall|title=Public Sector Economics: The Role of Government in the American Economy|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|pages=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;). If a legislator logrolls, he initiates the trade of votes for one particular act or bill in order to secure votes on behalf of another act or bill. Logrolling means that two parties will pledge their mutual support, so both bills can attain a simple majority. For example, a vote on behalf of a tariff may be traded by a congressman for a vote from another congressman on behalf of an agricultural subsidy to ensure that both acts will gain a majority and pass through the legislature (Shughart 2008&lt;ref name="econlib"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shughart II|first=William|title=Public Choice|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicChoice.html|work=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=11/04/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Logrolling cannot occur during presidential elections, where a vast voting population necessitates that individual votes have little political power, or during secret-ballot votes (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Because logrolling is pervasive in the political process, it is important to understand which external situations determine when, why, and how logrolling will occur, and whether it is beneficial, efficient, or neither.

===Origins===
[[File:Davy Crockett by William Henry Huddle, 1889.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Davy Crockett by [[William Henry Huddle]], 1889.]]
American [[frontiersman]] [[Davy Crockett]] was one of the first to apply the term to legislation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first known use of the term was by [[member of Congress|Congressman]] [[Davy Crockett]], who said on the floor (of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]) in 1835, "my people don't like me to log-roll in their business, and vote away pre-emption rights to fellows in other states that never kindle a fire on their own land."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = E. L. Carey and A. Hart
| last = Crockett
| first = Davy
| title = An account of Col. Crockett's tour to the North and down East: in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four. His object being to examine the grand manufacturing establishments of the country; and also to find out the condition of its literature and its morals, the extent of its commerce, and the practical operation of "The Experiment" ...
|year=1835
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The widest accepted origin is the old [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] of [[neighbourhood|neighbors]] assisting each other with the moving of logs. If two neighbors had cut a lot of [[timber]] which needed to be moved, it made more sense for them to work together to roll the logs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=log Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/29/L0232900.html logrolling. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it is similar to a [[barn-raising]] where a neighbor comes and helps a family build their barn, and, in turn, that family goes and returns the favor, helping him build his.

Here is an example of the term's original use:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A family comes to sit in the forest," wrote an observer in 1835. "Their neighbors lay down their employments, shoulder their axes, and come in to the log-rolling. They spend the day in hard labor, and then retire, leaving the newcomers their good wishes, and a habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnhart|first1=David K.|last2=Metcalf|first2=Allan A.|title=America in So Many Words: Words That Have Shaped America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYrJZLjgDmIC&amp;pg=PA95|year=1999|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-00270-7|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Choice to Logroll ===
Human beings, whether ignorant or informed, rational or irrational, logical or illogical, determine individual and group action through choices. Economics studies these choices, including the choice to logroll, and their particular influence within the market sector (Schwartz 1977&lt;ref name="SchwartzThomas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Thomas|title=Collection of Issues and Vote Trading|journal=The American Political Science Review|year=1977|volume=71|issue=3|pages=999–1010|doi=10.2307/1960103}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In America, political and economic decisions are usually made by politicians elected to legislative assemblies, and not directly by the citizenry (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Although legislative votes are recorded and are available to the American public, legislators can exchange their votes on issues they do not care much about for votes on other issues that are more important to their personal agendas (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;). In ''[[The Calculus of Consent]]'', [[James M. Buchanan]] and [[Gordon Tullock]] explore the relationship between individual choice in the voting process and in the marketplace, specifically within logrolling. Logrolling vote trades, like any activity within the marketplace, must be mutually beneficial (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

A vote trade is like a legislative [[IOU]]. When a legislator needs a few more votes to acquire a simple majority, he will seek support through a vote exchange. He will promise a fellow legislator an IOU vote for another piece of legislation in return for a vote on his own act or bill. Legislators who logroll within a small body, for example, the U.S. House or Senate, have incentive to honor their IOU votes because they cannot have their reputations tainted if they wish to be effective politicians (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;).

===Logrolling and the role of preference===
People have varying preferences, and make decisions at the margin to maximize their utility and improve their welfare. The same is true for legislators, who all enter office with different agendas, passions, and goals. Ideological diversity plays a significant role in the result of a vote and carries with it a significant cost. In addition, legislators will favor interests that offer them the most support. Legislative votes are determined by the intensity of personal preference, desires of constituents, and, ultimately, what will lead to the particular legislator's greatest utility. When people have ideologies at opposite ends of the political spectrum, it's difficult to ensure a simple majority, so buying a [[supermajority]] vote through logrolling may be the most cost effective (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

In the [[General Possibility Theorem]], Kenneth Arrow argues that if a legislative consensus can be reached through a simple majority, then minimum conditions must be satisfied, and these conditions must provide a superior ranking to any subset of alternative votes (Arrow 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrow|first=Kenneth|title=Social Choice and Individual Values, 2nd Ed.|year=1963|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A bill must be attractive to a legislator, or else he will not cast his vote for it. A vote, by the pure nature of the voting process, demonstrates explicit interest in whatever is voted upon. In logrolling, a superior ranking means that the marginal benefit of the vote is greater than any alternatives, so exchanging votes is worthwhile. The General Possibility Theorem necessitates that allocating one vote for another must constitute true utility and a sincere vote. Arrow's theory may place more restrictions and limitations on an individual voter's preferences than Buchanan and Tullock's; regardless, individuals will always choose the option they value most.

=== Logrolling to reach the optimal decision ===
Decisions reach an optimum only when they are unanimous, when votes are not coerced and everyone has veto power (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Unanimous votes, however, are not required for the American voting process. This is why some logrolling advocates argue that logrolling must be allowed within a democracy—sometimes there may not be a "best" or "most efficient" option on a vote.

Logrolling creates a market within which votes are exchanged as a sort of currency, and thus, facilitates the political process that produces the highest valued outcomes (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;). If individual participants recognize the value of their own vote, they are motivated to trade. When methods of trade do not conflict with given standards or ethical procedures, individuals naturally seek mutually advantageous vote trades. An individual may effectually, but imperfectly, "sell" his vote on a particular issue to, in return, secure votes from other individuals on behalf of legislation he prefers (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

Logrolling has one necessary condition: benefits from the public activity must be significantly more concentrated or localized than the costs. In economics, decisions are made at the margin. Logrolling depends on the reality that the marginal benefit (or utility) of at least some elected officials, or the citizenry, will increase when the legislation is passed (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Any economist will consider the immediate opportunity cost of the logrolling procedure within the legislative body, as well as the external cost of the vote (the cost to enact and see the bill through to fruition).

When transaction costs are low and parties involved are perfectly informed, a mutually beneficial agreement will occur: [[Coase theorem|whoever values the property the highest will end up with it]]. This is what [[Ronald H. Coase]] proposed in his ''Theory of Property Rights'' in 1960. [[Coase theorem|This theory]] holds true within the world of economics. In the American system of government, legislators have the incentive to logroll because transaction costs are low. When transaction costs are low, the [[Coase theorem]] says that the political marketplace (the decisions of the legislatures) will allocate resources to the highest valued point (Coase 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coase|first=Ronald H.|title=The Problem of Social Cost|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|year=1960|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1086/466560 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9932210/becker%2cbergstresser%2csubramanian-Does_Shareholder_Proxy.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Typically, logrolling is a mechanism used to gain support for special interest and minority groups. However, because of the ideological mix that already exists within the legislature itself, minority views are often represented, even if only marginally. With low [[transaction cost]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, the Coase theorem will come into play. The highest valued outcome is chosen by the legislature, regardless the member's ideological stance or political affiliation (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;).

The problem of cyclical majorities may arise with the absence of logrolling. The cyclical majority problem occurs when voters are faced with multiple voting options but cannot choose the option they most prefer, since it is not available. Voters must consider whether the alternative option is closer to their original preference (Bara and Weale 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bara|first=Judith, and Weale, Albert|title=Democratic Politics and Party Competition: Essays in Honor of Ian Budge|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, when logrolling is allowed, the highest valued outcome is secure without the threat of a cyclical majority. For example, suppose a country road in [[West Virginia]] is in disrepair. The local congressman proposes a bill to have the main road in his community resurfaced and paved. The road leads to a town of merely 600 residents. Thus, the other legislators will vote against the measure because the funding is not worthwhile to their constituents. In a logrolling system, the local legislator can use his vote to bargain with his fellow legislators. He will exchange his vote for his fellow legislators’ bills to promote, for instance, the construction of new hospitals and the increase of veteran's benefits, in return for their votes to repair the road (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

=== Logrolling: An example ===

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size:90%; text-align:center;" align="right"
|+ Table 1-1 
|-
! !! Agriculture !! Tax !! Vote !! School !! Tax !! Vote !! Fire !! Tax!! Vote
|-
| align="left"|Tanya || $300 || $200 || Y || $150 || $200 || N || $100 || $200 || N
|-
| align="left"|Alvin || $150 || $200 || N || $350 || $200 || Y || $150 || $200 || N
|-
| align="left"|Rebecca || $100 || $200 || N || $50 || $200 || N || $225 || $200 || Y
|-
| align="left"|Total || $550 || $600  || Inefficient || $550 || $600 || Inefficient || $475 || $600 || Inefficient
|-
|}

'''Table 1-1''' explains another example of logrolling. In the example, we have three individuals: Tanya, Alvin, and Rebecca. Tanya favors subsidies for agriculture, Alvin favors school construction, and Rebecca favors the recruitment of more firefighters. It seems as if the proposals are doomed to fail because each is opposed by a majority of voters. Even so, this may not be the outcome. Tanya may visit Rebecca and tell her that she will vote for Rebecca's bill to recruit more firefighters so long as Rebecca votes for her policy, subsidies for agriculture, in return. Now both proposals will win because they have gained a simple majority ('''Table 1-2'''), even though in reality the subsidy is opposed by two of the three voters. It's easy to see the [[Coase theorem]] at work in examples like this. Here, transaction costs are low, so mutually beneficial agreements are found, and the person who values the service the most will hold it (Browning and Browning 1979&lt;ref name="BrowningEdgar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Edgar K. and Browning, Jacquelene M.|title=Public Finance and the Price System, Voting and Resource Allocation|year=1979|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Still, outcomes may be inefficient.

=== Efficient logrolling ===

{| class="wikitable" style="font-size:90%; text-align:center;" align="right"
|+ Table 1-2 
|-
! !! Agriculture !! Tax !! Vote !! School !! Tax !! Vote !! Fire !! Tax!! Vote
|-
| align="left"|Tanya || $350 || $200 || Y || $150 || $200 || N || $100 || $200 || Y
|-
| align="left"|Alvin || $150 || $200 || N || $350 || $200 || Y || $200 || $200 || N
|-
| align="left"|Rebecca || $125 || $200 || Y|| $50 || $200 || N || $300 || $200 || Y
|-
| align="left"|Example || $625 || $600 || Efficient || $550 || $600  || Inefficient || $600 || $600 || Efficient
|-
|}

If the sum of the total benefit of the legislation for all the voters is less than the cost of the legislation itself, the legislation is inefficient. Despite its inefficiency, however, it still may pass if logrolling is permitted. If Tanya trades her vote to recruit more firemen to Rebecca in exchange for Rebecca's vote in favor of agriculture subsidies, a mutually beneficial agreement will be reached, even though the outcome is inefficient. On the other hand, if the sum of the total benefit of the legislation for all voters is greater than the cost of the legislation itself, the legislation is efficient. If Tanya trades her vote once again for Rebecca's vote, both parties will reach a mutually beneficial agreement and an efficient outcome.

=== Minimum winning coalitions and logrolling ===
A minimum winning coalition is the smallest number of votes required to win the passage of a piece of legislation. Minimum winning coalitions demonstrate the importance of logrolling within a democracy, because the minimal winning coalition may be overthrown with the sway of a single vote. As previously mentioned, coalitions will buy a supermajority of votes if the support for the proposed legislation sways. If a legislator logrolls a few votes beyond the minimal winning coalition to his side, he will ensure that the final vote will be in favor of his legislation. In a way, vote trading does combine positions on distinct issues to form single legislative votes and packages (Stratmann 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stratmann|first=Thomas|title=The Effects of Logrolling on Congressional Voting|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1992|volume=82|issue=5|pages=1162–1176}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Logrolled votes transcend affiliations and party lines and become feasible outcomes preferred by a majority or winning coalition (Schwartz 1977&lt;ref name="SchwartzThomas" /&gt;).

=== Logrolling in real politics ===
A problem in research is that it is impossible to identify vote trading directly within the House of Representatives or the Senate because roll call votes on specific goods are not observed (Irwin and Kroszner 1996&lt;ref name="IrwinDouglass"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Douglass|author2=Randall Kroszner |title=Log-Rolling and Economic Interests in the Passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff|journal=Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy|year=1996|series=45|pages=173–200|doi=10.1016/S0167-2231(96)00023-1|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, examples of refurbished bills can shed some light on the working-out of logrolling within the legislature. For example, in 1930, the [[Smoot-Hawley tariff]], the second-highest tariff in U.S. history, passed the House and Senate. Congress voted to increase tariffs exponentially, which worked to push the United States from a stagnant recession into a plummeting depression (Irwin and Kroszner 1996&lt;ref name="IrwinDouglass" /&gt;). Strict party line votes suggest that partisan polarization in 1929 prevented the Smoot-Hawley bill from passing through Congress. The bill, however, was revamped, and legislators used logrolling to pass it through both chambers in 1930.

Omnibus bills can be an alternative market to logrolling. Various clauses are added to a bill to satisfy all involved parties sufficiently. However, large bills, like the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], require an in depth knowledge of 1,000 plus pages. Many sections of these types of bills are initially opposed but are later supported because of special benefit clauses (Evans 1994&lt;ref name="EvansDiana" /&gt;).

Because logrolling allows special-interest groups a voice in the political process, programs that benefit a minority group can get the approval of a majority. However, this may not be in the best interest of the majority. Special-interest groups typically do not represent the typical voter, but rather, small branches of minority ideologies (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;). Voting results with or without logrolling will differ only if the minority is more interested in an issue than the majority, enough to separate the marginal voters from the majority. Studies show that lobbying and political pressure exerted by special-interest groups are not atypical behavior in a modern democracy (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Conditions imposed upon the social choice of the legislature imply a more severe restriction on the individual voter's preferences than the theory of logrolling presented by Buchanan and Tullock and presumed by Arrow's General Possibility Theory (Wilson 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=An Axiomatic Model of Logrolling|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1969|volume=59|series=3|pages=331–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Critics reproach members of Congress for protecting their own electoral interests at the expense of the general welfare. Congressmen tend to distribute specialized benefits at a great cost and ignore the particular costs the legislation bears upon the taxpayers (Evans 1994&lt;ref name="EvansDiana" /&gt;). Legislators, who seek their personal benefit via logrolling even though it may not benefit those who must pay for the measure, are known as maximizers. Maximizers only take into account their personal cost and electability, instead of the effects of their actions on other parties involved. In short, other taxpayers will pay for the policy even if it does not affect them (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;). Initially, maximizers will encourage other legislators to have the same selfish behavior because significant gains can be accrued in the short run. Buchanan and Tullock state that within a system of maximizers, all individuals are worse off than if they had all adopted [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] norms of behavior.

Legislative bodies can expect higher government spending and taxation when logrolling is allowed to flourish. Logrolling does not imply excessive spending; members can trade tax reductions just as easily as they can trade pork barrel policies. The problem is that benefits of a vote only reach a particular portion of the population, while the tax costs that pay for the vote are spread throughout the entire populace, especially when the act depends on revenue from sales or income taxes. Benefits are concentrated in localities, and the costs are dispersed throughout the nation. Committee members can thus exploit pork barrel projects for electoral purposes. The citizenry is seen as a “common pool,” used to finance projects through taxes. Somehow the citizens end up paying higher taxes than those who are not in a logroll system (Dalenberg and Duffy-Deno 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalenberg|first=Douglas R|author2=Kevin Duffy-Demo |title=At Large Vs. Ward Elections: Implications for Public Infrastructure|journal=Public Choice|year=1991|pages=335–342|doi=10.1007/BF00156239|volume=70|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gilligan and Matsusaka 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilligan|first=Thomas|author2=John Matsusaka |title=Deviations from Constituent Interests|journal=Economic Inquiry|year=1995|pages=383–401|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1995.tb01870.x|volume=33|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In a system where logrolling is permitted, a third party may bear the cost of the project, rather than those who receive the full benefit of the legislation. This is always inefficient.

The logic of collective action shows that votes for bills are motivated by politicians and are determined by a simple majority (Olson 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Mancur Jr.|title=The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups|year=1971|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Politicians are in the game to win it. &lt;!-- Win what?? --&gt;Collective effort explains why farms acquire government subsidies at the expense of millions of consumers and why those in the textile industry benefit at the expense of clothing buyers (Shughart 2008&lt;ref name="econlib" /&gt;). Congressional committees ensure that each committee leader will create legislative coalitions to push his policies to fruition. Thus, ceteris paribus, members who receive such projects, are likely to vote in support of their leader's wishes (Evans 1994&lt;ref name="EvansDiana" /&gt;).

Policymakers and congressmen have goals of power, and making their own mark in public policy, not pure aims of reelection (Dodd 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodd|first=Lawrence|title=Congress and the Quest for Power|journal=Congress Reconsidered|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Reelection does play a great part in the legislative process as a condition to achieving any other political goal. Thus, logrolling can be a powerful tool for committee chairs, who control the voting agendas (Evans 1994&lt;ref name="EvansDiana" /&gt;). While committee leaders create the supermajority, they try to achieve their personal goals and help a bare majority of members achieve theirs. Indeed, a skilled policy-oriented committee leader often seeks to exploit the goals of other members in order to construct legislation he or she will prefer (Arnold 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Douglas R.|title=Congress and the Bureaucracy|year=1979|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Strahan 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strahan|first=Randall|title=Member's Goals and Coalition-Building Strategies in the U.S. House: The Case of Tax Reforms|journal=Journal of Politics|year=1989|volume=51|pages=373–384|doi=10.2307/2131347|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Wafelijzerpolitiek====

''Wafelijzerpolitiek'' (lit. waffle iron politics) is a form of logrolling used in [[Belgium]]. Until the split of the unitary Belgium in several parts, the unitary government decided on the funds given to big projects. As there were usually two opposing groups of about equal size in Belgium, this norm resulted in the approval of two equally sized projects in the two parts of the country, with the funds given to the two projects being equal. As a result, one project was always overfunded. Many see ''wafelijzerpolitiek'' as the source of Belgium's high debt.

After the first state reformation in 1988, many big projects were decided regionally, so the number of ''wafelijzer'' projects went down. There are still some things that fall under the supervision of the federal government, where ''wafelijzerpolitiek'' still happens. One example is the Belgian railway network.

Another result of the ''wafelijzerpolitiek'' is the big useless works. As Flanders is a part of Belgium with many ports (e.g., big ports in [[Antwerp]] and [[Zeebrugge]]), for every investment in Flemish waterways there had to be an investment in Walloon waterways. Some results are the [[Ronquières inclined plane]] and the [[Strépy-Thieu boat lift]].

=== Simple referenda ===
In a referendum on a simple issue, the voter cannot easily trade his own vote for a vote on a reciprocal favor. This is because first, he is unsure as to when and how the other issues will be voted upon, and second, he and his immediate neighbors represent a fraction of the total electorate. Thus, trading may not be worthwhile (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

Vote trading under a democratic, majority-rule institution is sometimes considered morally reprehensible behavior. However, the only perfect solution to rid the political system of distributive logrolling would be to develop a specific formula to weigh the costs and benefits of legislation perfectly and only allow efficient programs to be enacted (This is inconceivable. Therefore, logrolling must occur, but only by observing the constitutional rules that have been laid down as safeguards of democracy (Buchanan and Tullock 1962&lt;ref name="BuchananJames" /&gt;).

=== Summary ===
The reality is that transaction costs are high, and most voters, who are ignorant of political issues and the political process, see little incentive to attempt to influence their local legislator's political decisions (Holcombe 2006&lt;ref name="HolcombeRandall" /&gt;). It is also difficult for voters to be informed of their legislator's voting habits. Because of this, distributive logrolling will occur in democratic systems. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the legislator to measure the costs and benefits of legislation and determine what is most efficient for his constituents. Logrolling will occur only if members of the legislature fail to gather enough votes for the passage of specific legislation. In essence, logrolling is a legal way to manipulate voter preference toward either an efficient or an inefficient outcome that would not otherwise be enacted (Browning 1979&lt;ref name="BrowningEdgar" /&gt;).

==Other usages==

''[[Spy Magazine]]'' ran a feature entitled "Logrolling in Our Time" that cited suspicious or humorous examples of mutually admiring [[book jacket]] [[blurb]]s by pairs of authors. ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' magazine regularly draws attention to alleged logrolling by [[authors]] in "books of the year" features published by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;''Private Eye'', 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National conservatism''' is a variant of [[conservatism]] that concentrates more on national interests and upholding cultural or ethnic identity than most other conservatives.{{sfn|Mandal|2007|p=306}} In Europe, national conservatives are usually [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptics]].&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |date= |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gua"&gt;Traynor, Ian, [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ian_traynor/2006/04/post_15.html The EU's weary travellers] ''The Guardian'', 4 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; National conservatism shares characteristics with [[traditionalist conservatism]] and [[social conservatism]] given how the 3 variations focus on preservation and tradition. As national conservatism seeks to preserve national interests, traditional conservatism emphasizes ancestral institutions and social conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005867754|title=ESSENTIALS OF POLITICAL IDEAS : for a level.|last=ANDREW.|first=HEYWOOD,|date=2018|publisher=PALGRAVE|isbn=1137611677|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1005867754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/839305105|title=Varieties of conservatism in America|date=2004|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|others=Berkowitz, Peter, 1959-|isbn=0817945725|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=839305105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/896728569|title=Mediations of social life in the 21st century|others=Dahms, Harry F.,|isbn=9781784412227|edition= First|location=Bingle, UK|oclc=896728569}}&lt;/ref&gt; National-conservative parties often have roots in environments with a  rural, traditionalist or peripheral basis, contrasting with the more urban support base of [[liberal conservative|liberal-conservative]] parties.&lt;ref name="HloušekKopecek2010A"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vít Hloušek|author2=Lubomír Kopecek|title=Origin, Ideology and Transformation of Political Parties: East-Central and Western Europe Compared|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMsoDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-08503-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most conservative parties in post-communist Central and Southeastern Europe since 1989 have been national conservative.&lt;ref name="Bakke"/&gt;

==Ideology==
===Social policies===
National conservative parties are "socially traditional"&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; and support the traditional [[family]] and social stability.&lt;ref name="Rosenberger"&gt;Rosenberger, Sieglinde, [http://www.lolapress.org/elec3/artenglish/rose_e.htm Europe is swinging towards the right - What are the effects on women?], University of Vienna, 2002. Retrieved 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Austrian political scientist Sieglinde Rosenberger, "national conservatism praises the family as a home and a center of identity, solidarity and emotion."&lt;ref name="Rosenberger"/&gt; Many national conservatives are thus [[social conservatism|social conservatives]], as well as in favor of [[Opposition to immigration|limiting]] [[immigration]] and enacting [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] policies.&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt;

===Economic policies===
National conservative parties in different countries do not necessarily share a common position on economic policy: their views may range from support of a [[planned economy]] to a centrist [[mixed economy]] to a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' approach.{{sfn|Mandal|2007|p=306}} In the first, more common, case, national conservatives can be distinguished from [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]],&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;National Questions, ''National Review'', Vol. 49, Issue 12, 30 June 1997, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; for whom [[free market]] economic policies, [[deregulation]] and tight spending are the main priorities. Some commentators have indeed identified a growing gap between national and [[economic liberalism|economic liberal]] conservatism: "most parties of the Right [today] are run by economically liberal conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, [[cultural conservatism|cultural]], and national conservatives."&lt;ref name="NR"/&gt;

[[Image:Kevin Trudeau Updated Edition.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Trudeau's book ''Natural Cures'' &amp;ndash; Updated Edition]]

'''''Natural Cures "They" Don't Want You To Know About''''' is a 2005 self-published book by American author [[Kevin Trudeau]], promoting a variety of non-drug and non-surgical purported cures for many diseases, primarily in support of his business selling such products. Trudeau accuses [[pharmaceutical companies]] and the [[United States government]] of censoring these products and methods on the basis that it would cut into their profit-margin. The book is the subject of widespread allegations of fraud.

== Premise ==
In the book, Trudeau claims that there are all-natural cures for serious illnesses including [[cancer]], [[herpes]], [[arthritis]], [[AIDS]], [[acid reflux disease]], various [[phobia]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[attention deficit disorder]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and that these are being deliberately hidden and suppressed from the public by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[Federal Trade Commission]], and the major food and drug companies, in an effort to protect the profits of these industries and the authority of the governmental agencies.  Trudeau claims that the source of illness are toxins from processed food, nutritional deficiencies, and other environmental sources; and that eliminating these factors will facilitate a cure for most diseases.  Trudeau claims that his lack of medical training or expertise is what makes him most qualified to investigate alternative medicine, and reports his opinions in his self-published book.  The first edition of the book lacked any mention of specific, brand-name products for any illnesses within its pages, as Trudeau claims the FDA and FTC censored this information and prohibited him from publishing it in the book.  Instead, the book contained references to Trudeau's subscription-based website where the actual 'cures' were supposedly posted and accessible for a monthly fee.

In May 2006, Trudeau self-published ''More Natural "Cures" Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease''. This book responded to complaints that its earlier version did not actually contain any cures but pointed consumers to his subscription website. In ''More Natural "Cures" Revealed'', Trudeau says that workers at the FDA and FTC want to censor him and, figuratively, burn his books.

== Versions ==
The original book contained 271 pages. After he released ''More Natural "Cures" Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease'' in response to earlier criticism, an "Updated Edition" of the original ''Natural Cures'' was sold shortly thereafter, containing 563 pages.  This adds a new Introduction, a Frequently Asked Questions chapter and a chapter on website information.  It also adds three appendices, containing newsletter articles, "No-Hunger Bread: A True FDA Horror Story," and locations of several health care practitioners.  The FDA article, originally a short letter and summary of the case in the original book, is included in its entirety in the updated edition. One omission in the updated edition is a Glossary section containing several [[New Age]] techniques.

According to Trudeau, the chapter "The Cures For All Diseases" was completely censored by the FTC in the original book.  The chapter is included titled as "Natural Cures for Specific Diseases" in the updated edition.

His website contains a number of references and articles, notably "FDA Horror Stories" such as "No-Hunger Bread," which describe alleged instances of the FDA suppressing natural cures.  Another article addresses [[714X]], a disproven cancer treatment developed in Canada.

== Criticism ==
The book has been the focus of much controversy since its publication, with widespread allegations of fraud.  The [[New York State Consumer Protection Board]] issued a warning in 2005 that the book "does not contain the 'natural cures' for cancer and other diseases that Trudeau is promising."  It asserted that "Trudeau is not only misrepresenting the contents of his self-published book, he is also using false endorsements to encourage consumers to buy ''Natural Cures "They" Don’t Want You to Know About.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infomercialwatch.org/reports/nycpb.shtml  Cancer ‘Cures’ Are Empty Promises in Kevin Trudeau’s ‘Natural Cures’ Book]. New York State Consumer Protection Board News Release, August 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Board also alleged that Trudeau was selling the consumer's contact information to other marketers without their consent and hitting purchasers with unauthorized charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/trudeaucpb.html Without Notice to Consumers, Kevin Trudeau is Selling Consumer Names and Addresses from Infomercial Orders - Consumers Also Hit with Unexpected Charges for Trudeau Newsletter and Discount Purchase Program]. New York State Consumer Protection Board News Release, October 27, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical author [[Michael Shermer]] writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;As for the "natural cures" themselves, some are not cures at all but just obvious healthy lifestyle suggestions: eat less, exercise more, reduce stress. Some of the natural cures are flat-out wrong, such as oral chelation for heart disease, whereas others are laughably ludicrous, such as a magnetic mattress pad and crocodile protein peptide for fibromyalgia. Worst of all are the natural cures that the book directs the reader to Trudeau's Web page to find. When you go there, however, and click on a disease to get the cure, you first have to become a Web site member at $1000 lifetime or $9.95 a month. It is a classic con man's combo: [[bait and switch]] (the book directs them to the Web page) and double-dipping (sell them the book, then sell them the membership).&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. "[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=cures-and-cons Cures and Cons: Natural scams "he" doesn't want you to know about]." ''Scientific American'', March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shermer and other critics have argued that Trudeau has used ''Natural Cures'' to circumvent a [[Federal Trade Commission]] ruling that Trudeau is barred "from appearing in, producing, or disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product, service, or program to the public."  The FTC issued its decision after it found that Trudeau had defrauded consumers by making numerous false claims about his merchandise in infomercials.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Melanie. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071106180205/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/business/media/28trudeau.html?ei=5090&amp;en=32618c85dc64a518&amp;ex=1282881600&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1194372125-HEkucWgcctphYi7LxeupKQ After Jail and More, Salesman Scores Big With Cure-All Book]." ''The New York Times'', August 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized the book for making such claims as, "If your body is [[alkaline]], you cannot get cancer [...] and if you have cancer, it goes away."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427064012/http://www.corante.com/pipeline/archives/2005/08/28/kevin_trudeaus_snake_oil_empire.php Kevin Trudeai's Snake Oil Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book makes extensive unreferenced claims that some drugs cause such conditions as [[AIDS]], headaches, bloating, [[indigestion]], heartburn, nausea, allergies, [[asthma]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[arthritis]], [[diabetes]], [[constipation]], [[yeast infections]], [[dandruff]], [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[halitosis]], fatigue, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and inability to lose weight.

The '''New Era Party''' ({{lang-lv|Jaunais laiks}}, JL) was a [[centre-right]] political party in [[Latvia]]. Founded in 2002, the party merged with [[Civic Union (Latvia)|Civic Union]] and [[Society for Other Politics]] to form [[Unity (Latvia)|Unity]] in 2011.

New Era is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and its MEPs in the [[European Parliament]] sat in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party]] (previously EPP-ED).

==History==
New Era was founded on 2 February 2002 by [[Einars Repše]], a politician and central banker who was very popular at that time. Originally, most of the party candidates were political unknowns led by Repše.

In its first election campaign, New Era promised to combat corruption and tax evasion. According to New Era promises, eliminating tax evasion would increase [[Latvia]]'s state [[budget]] by 400 million [[Latvian lats]] (about 750 million United States dollars), allowing for increased funding for a variety of programs and also for tax cuts. Running on this platform, the party won 23.9% of the popular vote and 26 out of 100 seats in the 2002 legislative election and became the largest party in the [[Saeima]], the parliament of [[Latvia]]. It formed a [[coalition government]] with 3 other parties, with the New Era leader [[Einars Repše]] as the prime minister. In January 2004, the coalition fell apart and Repše resigned.

New Era was in the opposition until October 2004, when it joined a coalition government led by [[Aigars Kalvītis]] of the People’s Party. It left the coalition after a vote-buying scandal in the [[Jūrmala]] municipal elections which involved one of its coalition partners, the [[Latvia's First Party]]. The New Era Party first requested Latvia's First Party to leave the coalition. After Latvia's First Party and prime minister Kalvītis refused this demand, all New Era ministers resigned on 13 April 2006. In the October 2006 parliamentary elections, the New Era party won 18 seats. After the elections it did not rejoin the coalition government. Despite its significant losses, it became the largest opposition party.

Repše has lost most of his popularity, due to a sequence of scandals, but remains one of the party leaders. In March 2007, the party established a new structure, in which it had two leaders: Einars Repše and [[Arturs Krisjanis Karins]]. Arturs Krisjanis Karins is a United States citizen, born in the United States to a Latvian family.

In 2008, prominent MPs and members of the board&amp;nbsp;– [[Ina Druviete]], Karlis Sadurskis, Ilma Cepane and [[Sandra Kalniete]] left the New Era to create [[Civic Union (Latvia)|Civic Union]]. Its leadership resigned, and Solvita Aboltina and Artis Kampars became new leaders. The chairman of the New Era parliamentary faction is [[Dzintars Zakis]].

In March 2009, New Era Party member [[Valdis Dombrovskis]], who served as finance minister from 2002 to 2004, became Prime Minister, bringing the New Era Party to the leadership of a 4-party, center-right coalition government.

On 6 August 2011, it merged with two other parties to form the new political party [[Unity (Latvia)|Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/246138 Apollo&amp;nbsp;– Ziņas: Izveidota partija «Vienotība»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808090150/http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/246138 |date=8 August 2011 }}.

==Ideology==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
The New Era Party has strong [[populism|populist]] leanings and derives most of its appeal from positioning itself as the main anti-corruption force in Latvian politics. New Era supporters characterize most of the other political parties as corrupt and controlled by [[business oligarch|oligarchs]]. As a result, New Era has very strained relations with most of the other political parties, which make a considerable effort to leave New Era in opposition whenever possible.

On ethnic issues, New Era tends to be somewhat nationalist. Its economic positions are uncertain and have changed over time. Its original platform in 2002 included radical [[free-market]] reforms in health care and education, such as replacing government-funded higher education by [[student loans]].

The '''Nordic model''' refers to the economic and [[Social policy|social policies]] common to the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Sweden]]). This includes a comprehensive [[welfare state]] and [[collective bargaining]] at the national level with a high percentage of the workforce [[labour unions|unionized]], while being based on the economic foundations of [[capitalism|free market capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Anders |last1=Bruhn |first2=Anders |last2=Kjellberg |first3=Åke |last3=Sandberg |year=2013 |url=http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/19441202/Nordic_lights_kapitel_4_Bruhn_Kjellberg_Sandberg_Correct.pdf |title=A New World of Work Challenging Swedish Unions |editor-first=Åke |editor-last=Sandberg |location=Stockholm |pp=126–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Sweden%20Paper.pdf |title=The surprising ingredients of Swedish success – free markets and social cohesion |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=''[[Institute of Economic Affairs]]'' |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100714/nordic-model-pros-and-cons.asp |title=The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons |date=June 25, 2013 |author=James E.

The [[Scandinavia]]n countries were all [[monarchy|monarchies]], with Finland and Iceland becoming republics in the 20th century; currently, the Nordic countries have been described as being [[Democracy_Index#Democracy_Index_by_country_(2017)|highly democratic]]. Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all share some common traits. These include support for a "universalist" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting [[social mobility]]; a [[corporatist]] system involving a tripartite arrangement where representatives of labor and employers negotiate wages and labor market policy mediated by the government;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hicks|first= Alexander|title= Social democracy and Welfare Capitalism: A century of Income Security Politics|publisher= Cornell University Press|date=January 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0801485565|page = 130|quote=By the late 1950s, labor had been incorporated alongside Swedish business in fully elaborated corporatist institutions of collective bargaining and policy making, public as well as private, supply-side (as for labour training) as well as demand side (e.g., Keynesian).

* Free trade combined with collective risk sharing ([[welfare|social programs]], [[Labour economics|labour market]] institutions) which has provided a form of protection against the risks associated with economic openness.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt;
* Little [[product market]] regulation. [[Nordic countries]] rank very high in product market freedom according to [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] rankings.&lt;ref name="nordicmodel"/&gt;

These employees work in various fields including education, healthcare, and for the government itself. They often have greater job security and make up around a third of the workforce (more than 38% in Denmark). Public spending in social transfers such as unemployment benefits and early-retirement programmes is high. In 2001, the wage-based unemployment benefits were around 90% of wage in Denmark and 80% in Sweden, compared to 75% in the Netherlands and 60% in Germany. The unemployed were also able to receive benefits several years before reductions, compared to quick benefit reduction in other countries.

==Aspects==

===Labor market policy===
{{see also|Social corporatism}}
The Nordic countries share active labor market policies as part of a [[corporatist]] economic model intended to reduce conflict between labor and the interests of capital. The corporatist system is most extensive in Sweden and Norway, where employer federations and labor representatives bargain at the national level mediated by the government. Labor market interventions are aimed at providing job retraining and relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 226|quote=Liberal corporatism is largely self-organized between labor and management, with only a supporting role for government. Leading examples of such systems are found in small, ethnically homogeneous countries with strong traditions of social democratic or labor party rule, such as Sweden's Nordic neighbors. Using a scale of 0.0 to 2.0 and subjectively assigning values based on six previous studies, Frederic Pryor in 1988 found Norway and Sweden the most corporatist at 2.0 each, followed by Austria at 1.8, the Netherlands at 1.5, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium at 1.3 each, and Switzerland and West Germany at 1.0 each…with the exception of Iceland all the Nordic countries have higher taxes, larger welfare states, and greater corporatist tendencies than most social market economies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic labor market is flexible, with laws making it easy for employers to hire and shed workers or introduce labor-saving technology. To mitigate the negative effect on workers, the government labor market policies are designed to provide generous social welfare, job retraining and relocation to limit any conflicts between capital and labor that might arise from this process.&lt;ref name="James E. McWhinney"/&gt;

===Economic system===
The Nordic model is underpinned by a free market capitalist economic system that features high degrees of private ownership&lt;ref name="The Nordic Model: Pros and Cons"/&gt; with the exception of Norway, which includes a large number of [[State ownership|state-owned]] enterprises and state ownership in publicly listed firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich |title=Norway: The rich cousin |author= |date=2 February 2013 |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic model is described as a system of competitive capitalism combined with a large percentage of the population employed by the [[public sector]] (roughly 30% of the work force).&lt;ref name="Economist leaders"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel | title = The Nordic countries: The next supermodel | date = 2 February 2013 | publisher = [[The Economist]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[The Economist]]'' described its countries as "stout free-traders who resist the temptation to intervene even to protect iconic companies" while also looking for ways to temper capitalism's harsher effects, and declared that the Nordic countries "are probably the best-governed in the world".&lt;ref name="Economist leaders" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570835-nordic-countries-are-probably-best-governed-world-secret-their | title = The secret of their success | publisher = ''[[The Economist]]'' | date = 31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists have referred to the Nordic economic model as a form of "cuddly" capitalism, with low levels of inequality, generous welfare states and reduced concentration of top incomes, and contrast it with the more "cut-throat" capitalism of the [[United States]], which has high levels of inequality and [[Income inequality in the United States|a larger concentration of top incomes]].&lt;ref name="nordicmodel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/01/29/lower-levels-of-inequality-are-linked-with-greater-innovation-in-economies/ | title = Lower levels of inequality are linked with greater innovation in economies | first1 = Jonathan | last1 = Hopkin | authorlink1 = Jonathan Hopkin | first2 = Victor | last2 = Lapuente | first3 = Lovisa | last3 = Moller | date = 29 January 2014 | publisher = [[London School of Economics]] | access-date = 27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Social Democratic America | first = Kenworthy | last1 = Lane | authorlink = Lane Kenworthy | date = 3 December 2013 | isbn = 9780199322527 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eVTSAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 88–93 | location = [[United States|USA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1990s, the Swedish economy pursued [[neoliberal]] reforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.socialistalternative.org/2014/03/22/13527/ | title = IS SWEDEN A MODEL TO FOLLOW? | first = Per-Åke | last = Westerlund | date = 22 March 2014 | website = [[Socialist Alternative (United States)|Socialist Alternative]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/02/sweden-welfare-social-democracy-socialism/ | title = Beyond the Swedish Model | first = Michal | last = Rozworski | date = 27 February 2015 | magazine = [[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that reduced the role of the public sector, leading to the fastest growth in inequality of any [[OECD]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/swedish-riots-stockholm | title = Swedish riots rage for fourth night | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = 23 May 2013 | access-date = 27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sweden's income inequality still remains lower than most other countries.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Andrew |date=26 May 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/europe/swedens-riots-put-its-identity-in-question.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Sweden, Riots Put an Identity in Question |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway's particularities ==== 
The state of Norway has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stockmarket&lt;ref name=Economist2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich|title=Norway: The rich cousin – Oil makes Norway different from the rest of the region, but only up to a point|date=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operating the country's largest non-listed companies including [[Statoil]] and [[Statkraft]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' reports that "after the second world war the government nationalised all German business interests in Norway and ended up owning 44% of Norsk Hydro's shares. The formula of controlling business through shares rather than regulation seemed to work well, so the government used it wherever possible. 'We invented the [[Socialist market economy|Chinese way of doing things]] before the Chinese', says Torger Reve of the Norwegian Business School".&lt;ref name=Economist2/&gt; 

The government also operates a sovereign wealth fund, the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]]—whose partial objective is to prepare Norway for a post-oil future, but "unusually among oil-producing nations, it is also a big advocate of human rights—and a powerful one, thanks to its control of the Nobel peace prize".&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

Norway is the only major economy in the West where younger generations are getting richer, with a 13% increase in disposable income for 2018, bucking the trend seen in other Western nations of millennials becoming poorer than the generations which came before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Savage|first=Maddy|date=July 10, 2018 |title=Unlike most millennials, Norway's are rich |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180709-unlike-most-millennials-norways-are-rich|work=BBC |location= |access-date=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic welfare model===
The Nordic welfare model refers to the [[welfare]] [[Social policy|policies]] of the Nordic countries, which also tie into their labor market policies. The Nordic model of welfare is distinguished from other types of welfare states by its emphasis on maximizing labor force participation, promoting  [[gender equality]], [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and extensive benefit levels, the large magnitude of income redistribution and liberal use of expansionary fiscal policy.&lt;ref name="Esping-Andersen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Esping-Andersen |first=G. |year=1991 |title=The three worlds of welfare capitalism |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are differences among different Nordic countries, they all share a broad commitment to social cohesion, a universal nature of welfare provision in order to safeguard individualism by providing protection for vulnerable individuals and groups in society and maximizing public participation in social decision-making. It is characterized by flexibility and openness to innovation in the provision of welfare. The Nordic welfare systems are mainly funded through [[taxation]].&lt;ref name="The Nordic Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/en/about-nordic-co-operation/areas-of-co-operation/the-nordic-welfare-model/about-the-nordic-welfare-model |title=About the Nordic welfare model  |author=The Nordic Council |date= |publisher=Norden |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the common values, the Nordic countries take different approaches to the practical administration of the welfare state. Denmark features a high degree of private sector provision of public services and welfare, alongside an assimilation immigration policy. Iceland's welfare model is based on a "welfare-to-work" (see: [[workfare]]) model while part of Finland's welfare state includes the [[voluntary sector]] playing a significant role in providing care for the elderly. Norway relies most extensively on public provision of welfare.&lt;ref name="The Nordic Council"/&gt;

====Poverty reduction====
The Nordic model has been successful at significantly reducing poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=Drum |date=26 September 2013 |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/we-can-reduce-poverty-if-we-want-we-just-have-want |title=We Can Reduce Poverty If We Want To. We Just Have To Want To. |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |access-date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, poverty rates before taking into account the effects of taxes and transfers stood at 24.7% in Denmark, 31.9% in Finland, 21.6% in Iceland, 25.6% in Norway and 26.5% in Sweden. After accounting for taxes and transfers the poverty rates for the same year became 6%, 7.5%, 5.7%, 7.7% and 9.7% respectively, for an average reduction of 18.7 p.p.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=usa&amp;lg=en|title=Compare your country – Income distribution and poverty|publisher=[[OECD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the United States, which has a poverty level pre-tax of 28.3% and post-tax of 17.4% for a reduction of 10.9 p.p., the effects of tax and transfers on poverty in all the Nordic countries are substantially bigger.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"/&gt; However, in comparison to France (27 p.p. reduction) and Germany (24.2 p.p. reduction) the taxes and transfers in the Nordic countries are smaller on average.&lt;ref name="compareyourcountry.org"/&gt;

=== Religion as a factor ===
Scandinavian countries have [[Lutheranism]] as their main religion. Schroder argues that Lutheranism promotes the idea of a nationwide community of believers and it promotes state involvement in economic and social life. This allows nationwide welfare solidarity and economic coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Schröder |title=Integrating Varieties of Capitalism and Welfare State Research |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2013 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, a large number of Scandinavians have been described as being [[irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinfels |first=Peter |date=February 27, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html |title=Scandinavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Nordic model has been positively received by some American politicians and political commentators. [[Jerry Mander]] has likened the Nordic model to a kind of "hybrid" system which features a blend of [[capitalist]] economics with [[socialist]] values, representing an alternative to [[Anglo-Saxon model|American-style capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| author-link=Jerry Mander |first=Jerry |last=Mander |date=24 July 2013 |url=http://www.alternet.org/books/there-are-good-alternatives-us-capitalism-no-way-get-there?page=0%2C2 |title=There Are Good Alternatives to US Capitalism, But No Way to Get There |work=[[Alternet]] |access-date=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) has pointed to Scandinavia and the Nordic model as something America can learn from, in particular with respect to the benefits and social protections the Nordic model affords workers and its provision of universal healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sanders |first=Bernie |date=May 26, 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/what-can-we-learn-from-de_b_3339736.html |title=What Can We Learn From Denmark? |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |access-date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sasha|last=Issenberg|date=January 9, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/01/09/sanders_a_growing_force_on_the_far_far_left/?page=1|title=Sanders a growing force on the far, far left|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|quote=You go to Scandinavia, and you will find that people have a much higher standard of living, in terms of education, health care, and decent paying jobs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Zeeshan |last=Aleem |date=May 4, 2015 |url=http://mic.com/articles/117334/bernie-sanders-says-the-u-s-could-learn-a-lot-from-scandinavia-here-s-why-he-s-right |title=Bernie Sanders Says the U.S. Could Learn a Lot From Scandinavia. Here’s Why He's Right |work=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]] |access-date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Naomi Klein]], former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] sought to move the [[Soviet Union]] in a similar direction to the Nordic system, combining free markets with a social safety net but still retaining public ownership of key sectors of the economy - ingredients that he believed would transform the Soviet Union into "a socialist beacon for all mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Naomi Klein |last=Klein |first=Naomi |year=2008 |title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] |ISBN=0312427999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwHUAq5LPOQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Philip |last1=Whyman |first2=Mark |last2=Baimbridge |first3=Andrew |last3=Mullen |year=2012 |title=The Political Economy of the European Social Model (Routledge Studies in the European Economy |publisher=[[Routledge]] |ISBN=0415476291 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-M_cdwdgoMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=108 |quote=In short, Gorbachev aimed to lead the Soviet Union towards the Scandinavian social democratic model.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic model has also been positively received by various social scientists and economists. American professor of sociology and political science [[Lane Kenworthy]] advocates for the United States to make a gradual transition toward a social democracy similar to those of the Nordic countries, defining social democracy as "The idea behind social democracy was to make capitalism better. There is disagreement about how exactly to do that, and others might think the proposals in my book aren't true social democracy. But I think of it as a commitment to use government to make life better for people in a capitalist economy. To a large extent, that consists of using public insurance programs—government transfers and services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=9 January 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/09/this-sociologist-has-a-plan-to-make-america-more-like-sweden/ |title=This sociologist has a plan to make America more like Sweden |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has noted that there is higher social mobility in the Scandinavian countries than in the United States and argues that Scandinavia is now the land of opportunity that the United States once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/03/news/economy/stiglitz-income-inequality/index.html |title='Scandinavian Dream' is true fix for America's income inequality |work=CNN Money |date=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Ann Jones (author)|Ann Jones]], who lived in Norway for four years, contends "the Nordic countries give their populations freedom ''from'' the market by using capitalism as a tool to benefit everyone", whereas in the United States "[[neoliberal]] politics puts the foxes in charge of the henhouse, and capitalists have used the wealth generated by their enterprises (as well as financial and political manipulations) to capture the state and pluck the chickens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/after-i-lived-in-norway-america-felt-backward-heres-why/ |title=After I Lived in Norway, America Felt Backward. Here’s Why |work=[[The Nation]] |date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] is a proponent of the Nordic model, having pointed out that the Nordic model is "the proof that modern capitalism can be combined with decency, fairness, trust, honesty, and environmental sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalhealthminders.dk/prof-jeffrey-sachs-plea-to-the-nordic-countries/ |title=Prof Jeffrey Sachs’ plea to the Nordic countries |work=Global Health Minders |date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic combination of extensive public provision of [[welfare]] and a culture of [[individualism]] has been described by Lars Trägårdh, of [[Ersta Sköndal University College]], as "[[Statism|statist]] individualism".&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570835-nordic-countries-are-probably-best-governed-world-secret-their |title=The secret of their success |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 survey by the think tank [[Israel Democracy Institute]] found that nearly 60 percent of [[Israeli Jews]] preferred a "Scandinavian model" economy, with high taxes and a robust welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sales|first=Ben|title=Survey: Israeli Jews Want Broader Welfare State, Israeli Arabs Prefer 'American Model'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.721012|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions===
George Lakey, author of ''Viking Economics'', asserts that Americans generally misunderstand the nature of the Nordic "welfare state":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Americans imagine that "welfare state" means the U.S. welfare system on steroids. Actually, the Nordics scrapped their American-style welfare system at least 60 years ago, and substituted universal services, which means everyone—rich and poor—gets free higher education, free medical services, free eldercare, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/continuing-revelation-scandinavian-economies |title=The “Continuing Revelation” of Scandinavian Economies |work=americanmagazine.org |date=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his role as economic adviser to Poland and Yugoslavia in their post-socialist transitional period, Jeffrey Sachs noted that the specific forms of Western-style capitalism such as Swedish-style social democracy and Thatcherite liberalism are virtually identical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The eastern countries must reject any lingering ideas about a “third way”, such as a chimerical “market socialism” based on public ownership or worker self-management, and go straight for a western-style market economy...The main debate in economic reform should therefore be about the means of transition, not the ends. Eastern Europe will still argue over the ends: for example, whether to aim for Swedish-style social democracy or Thatcherite liberalism. But that can wait. Sweden and Britain alike have nearly complete private ownership, private financial markets and active labour markets. Eastern Europe today [in 1990] has none of these institutions; for it, the alternative models of Western Europe are almost identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13002085 |work=The Economist |date=January 13, 1990 |title=What is to be done?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Danish Prime Minister [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] addressed the American misconception that the Nordic model is a form of socialism: "'I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism,' he said. 'Therefore, I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/10/31/9650030/denmark-prime-minister-bernie-sanders |title=Denmark's prime minister says Bernie Sanders is wrong to call his country socialist |work=Vox |date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize Nordic-style social democracy for its questionable effectiveness in promoting relative [[egalitarianism]] as well as its [[sustainability]]. They point out that Nordic social democracy requires a strong [[labour movement|labor movement]] to sustain the heavy redistribution required, arguing that it is idealistic to think similar levels of redistribution can be accomplished in countries with weaker labor movements. They note that even in the Scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline since the weakening of the labor movement in the early 1990s, arguing that the sustainability of social democracy is limited. Roemer and Bardham argue that establishing a [[market socialist]] economy by changing enterprise ownership would be more effective than social democratic redistribution at promoting egalitarian outcomes, particularly in countries with weak labor movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation |first1=Pranab |last1=Bardhan |first2=Johen E. |last2=Roemer |year=1992 |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=6 |number=3 |page=104 |quote=...we believe that social democracy requires rather special political circumstances that are absent in many countries for which our market socialism proposal may be feasible. Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Guðmundur Jónsson argues that it would be inaccurate to include Iceland in one aspect of the Nordic model, that of [[consensus democracy]]. He writes that "Icelandic democracy is better described as more adversarial than consensual in style and practice. The labour market was rife with conflict and strikes more frequent than in Europe, resulting in strained government–trade union relationship. Secondly, Iceland did not share the Nordic tradition of power-sharing or corporatism as regards labour market policies or macro-economic policy management, primarily because of the weakness of Social Democrats and the Left in general. Thirdly, the legislative process did not show a strong tendency towards consensus-building between government and opposition with regard to government seeking consultation or support for key legislation. Fourthly, the political style in legislative procedures and public debate in general tended to be adversarial rather than consensual in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Iceland and the Nordic Model of Consensus Democracy |journal = Scandinavian Journal of History|date = 2014-08-08|issn = 0346-8755|pages = 510–28|volume = 39|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/03468755.2014.935473|first = Guðmundur|last = Jónsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their paper "The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergeneration Mobility in Denmark and the U.S.", Rasmus Landersøn and James J. Heckman compared American and Danish social mobility and found that social mobility is not as high as figures might suggest in the Nordic countries. When looking exclusively at wages (before taxes and transfers), Danish and American social mobility are very similar. It is only after taxes and transfers are taken into account that Danish social mobility improves, indicating that Danish economic redistribution policies simply give the impression of greater mobility. Additionally, Denmark's greater investment in public education did not improve educational mobility significantly, meaning children of non-college educated parents are still unlikely to receive college education, though this public investment did result in improved cognitive skills amongst poor Danish children compared to their American peers. The researchers also found evidence that generous welfare policies could discourage the pursuit of higher-level education due to decreasing the economic benefits that college education level jobs offer and increasing welfare for workers of a lower education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rasmus |last1=Landersøn |first2=James J. |last2=Heckman |title=The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the US |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=178–230 |doi=10.1111/sjoe.12219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nima Sanandaji]], a [[libertarian]], has also criticized the Nordic model, questioning the link between the model and socio-economic outcomes in works of his such as ''Scandinavian Unexceptionalism'' and ''Debunking Utopia: Exposing the Myth of Nordic Socialism''.

==Political ideologies in the Nordic countries==
According to sociologist [[Lane Kenworthy]], in the context of the Nordic model "[[social democracy]]", the ideology of the Nordic labour parties, refers to a set of policies for promoting economic security and opportunity within the framework of capitalism rather than a replacement for capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140345/lane-kenworthy/americas-social-democratic-future |title=America's Social Democratic Future |author=Lane Kenworthy |date=January 2014 |publisher=Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Command Aerial Sensor Platform, also known as '''Operation Lowrider''', is an American [[surveillance]] program intended to aid in combat against Mexican [[drug cartels]], in effect since 2011. While the United States has long aided the [[Mexican government]], the program marks a shift in US tactics.

Re-purposing techniques and equipment honed in the conflicts in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], Lowrider employs manned, single engine surveillance planes that track the day-to-day movements of cartel personnel. The program created controversy as it employs private contractors to conduct surveillance, contracts awarded without bidding. The use of manned, single engine surveillance planes is also considered a dangerous risk, since the failure of the one engine could strand a pilot in the Mexican wilderness. The future of the program is in question due to Mexican President, [[Enrique Peña Nieto]]'s desire to disengage his country's intelligence agency from that of the United States.

The '''Police Department of the [[MVD]]''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Департамент Полиции МВД России}}) was the main police force of the [[Russian Empire]] and part of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Rissian Empire)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) in the late 19th century, and was responsible for the management of all the police forces in the [[Russian Empire]] including [[Okhrana]] branches&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gumer.info/bibliotek_Buks/History/pereg/11.php Перегудова З.

==History==
{{main|Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery}} 
The Police Department was established on August 6, 1880 following the dissolution of the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Third Section]]. The newly formed Police department was part of the [[MVD]]. From 1880 til 1883 it was called '''The Department of the State Police''' ("Департамент государственной полиции"). Under it jurisdiction was the [[Okhrana]], all the policing bodies, including the detective branches, and the Fire departments.

After the [[February Revolution]] the Department was dissolved by the decree of the Russian provisional government from February 27, 1917. 

After the [[October Revolution]] the government has announced the establishment of the [[Militsiya]], as the new police force.

==Director==
The head of the department was The Director of the Police Department, which was appointed by the Minister of the Internal Affairs.

The '''Project on Middle East Democracy''' ('''POMED''') is a [[nonprofit]], [[nonpartisan]] organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]], dedicated to examining how genuine democracies can develop in the Middle East and how the United States can best support that process. Through dialogue, research, and advocacy, POMED works to strengthen the constituency for U.S. policies that peacefully support democratic reform in the [[Middle East]].

== History ==

In 2004, a small group of graduate students at Georgetown University began meeting regularly to discuss the need for a stronger voice in Washington in support of democratic principles in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The group was driven by a firm belief that the advancement of democratic values is not only in the interest of the region's citizens, but also very much in the strategic interests of the United States.

In 2006, this group formally established the Project on Middle East Democracy (POMED) to help fill gaps it had identified: to inform the Washington policy community on key political developments in the MENA region and the impact of U.S. policy on the prospects for genuine democratic change; to carry out sustained advocacy on behalf of greater U.S. support for democratic values; and to help broaden U.S. engagement beyond relationships with the region's governments and narrow set of traditional elites.

Since that time, POMED has also grown to help build the capacity of dozens of independent civil society organizations in the MENA region that wish to play the same role locally that POMED plays in Washington—of undertaking independent research and analysis, generating independent recommendations for policy, and carrying out advocacy to advance those recommendations.

== Programs ==

Through Research, Advocacy, and Civil Society Partnerships, POMED works to strengthen support for genuine democratic development in the Middle East and North Africa.

'''Research''': The research program produces original analysis of key issues and trends in democratic change, political reform, human rights, and authoritarianism in the countries of the Middle East and North Africa and of U.S. policy as it pertains to democratic development in the region. Research publications include Snapshots, Policy Briefs, Expert Q&amp;A’s, Backgrounders, Reports, and Fact Sheets. Authors include POMED’s Nonresident Fellows, resident staff, and other experts based in the region, the United States, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://pomed.org/about/#_programs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advocacy''': The advocacy program directly engages a broad network of U.S. policymakers, while working closely with the coalition of activists and advocates who share a commitment to democracy and human rights in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://pomed.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil Society  Partnerships''': The civil society partnerships program aims to build the capacity of emerging regional policy centers through technical assistance trainings and regular guidance and mentorship. We work with nascent civil society organizations across the MENA region to strengthen advocacy and policy writing skills and promote improved institutional practices to help ensure organizational viability and impact.

==Anti-gay activism==
The organization has been designated as a [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) for its anti-gay activism.&lt;ref name="WP_2012-03-26"/&gt;

In September 2012, it was reported that the SPLC was suing Public Advocate in Denver, Colorado, federal court over a mailer sent to some Colorado primary voters in 2010.  The mailer included a modified version of their client's engagement photo, taken of them kissing with the Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop.  Their client is a gay couple who were married in a civil ceremony in Connecticut.  The photo had been copied without permission from the couple's blog and edited to appear as if they were kissing with snow-covered pine trees surrounding them, with bold words on a red background saying "State Senator Jean White's idea of "Family Values?"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-gay-picture-lawsuit-20120926,0,7297532.story |title=Gay couple shocked to find their faces on anti-gay mailer |first=Tina |last=Susman |date=September 26, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9386">A '''risk-free bond''' is a theoretical [[Bond (finance)|bond]] that repays [[interest]] and [[:wikt:principal|principal]] with absolute certainty. The rate of return would be the [[risk-free interest rate]].  It is primary security, which pays off 1 unit no matter state of economy is realized at time &lt;math&gt;t+1 &lt;/math&gt;. So its payoff is the same regardless of what state occurs. Thus, an investor experiences no risk by investing in such an asset.

In practice, [[government bond]]s of financially stable countries are treated as risk-free bonds, as governments can raise taxes or indeed print money to repay their domestic currency debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b050f19c-dd17-11e3-ba13-00144feabdc0.html|title=Belgium’s KBC scraps ‘risk-free’ practice on sovereign bonds - FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[United States Treasury security#Treasury note|United States Treasury notes]] and [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bond|United States Treasury bonds]] are often assumed to be risk-free bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk-Free Asset|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskfreeasset.asp|website=[[Investopedia]]|publisher=investopedia.com|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though investors in United States Treasury securities do in fact face a small amount of [[credit risk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mattia|first1=Laura|title=Think Bonds Are Risk-Free? Think Again.|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/bold-bond-moves-make-now-late/story?id=22649607|website=abcnews.go.com|publisher=ABC|accessdate=1 March 2016|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this risk is often considered to be negligible. An example of this credit risk was shown by Russia, which defaulted on its [[domestic debt]] during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].

==Modelling the price by Black-Scholes model&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=iojEts9YAxIC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=risk+free+bond&amp;hl=sk&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYucjN59XaAhWILVAKHanUBQkQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=risk-free%20bond&amp;f=false|title=Martingale Methods in Financial Modelling|last=Musiela|first=Marek|last2=Rutkowski|first2=Marek|date=2006-01-21|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540266532|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
In financial literature, it is not uncommon to derive the [[Black scholes formula|Black-Scholes formula]] by introducing a continuously rebalanced ''risk-free [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]'' containing an option and underlying stocks. In the absence of [[arbitrage]], the return from such a portfolio needs to match returns on risk-free bonds. This property leads to the Black-Scholes partial differential equation satisfied by the arbitrage price of an option. It appears, however, that the risk-free portfolio does not satisfy the formal definition of a self-financing strategy, and thus this way of deriving the Black-Sholes formula is flawed.

We assume throughout that trading takes place continuously in time, and unrestricted borrowing and lending of funds is possible at the same constant interest rate. Furthermore, the market is frictionless, meaning that there are no transaction costs or taxes, and no discrimination against the short sales. In other words, we shall deal with the case of a [[Perfect market|''perfect market''.]]

Let´s assume that the ''short-term [[interest rate]]''  &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is constant (but not necessarily nonnegative) over the trading interval &lt;math&gt;[0, T^*]&lt;/math&gt;. The risk-free security is assumed to continuously compound in value at the rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;dB_t = rB_t~dt&lt;/math&gt;. We adopt the usual convention that &lt;math&gt;B_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so that its price equals &lt;math&gt;B_t = e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, T^*]&lt;/math&gt;. When dealing with the [[Black–Scholes model|Black-Scholes model]], we may equally well replace the savings account by the ''risk-free bond''. A unit [[zero-coupon bond]] maturing at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a security paying to its holder  1 unit of cash at a predetermined date &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;   in the future, known as the bond´s ''[[maturity date]]''. Let &lt;math&gt;B(t, T)&lt;/math&gt; stand for the price at time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, T]&lt;/math&gt; of a bond maturing at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. It is easily seen that to replicate the payoff 1 at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; it suffices to invest &lt;math&gt;B_t/B_T&lt;/math&gt; units of cash at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the savings account &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. This shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the price of the bond satisfies

&lt;math&gt;B(t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)} ~~~,~~~ \forall t \in [0, T] ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for any fixed T, the bond price solves the [[ordinary differential equation]]

&lt;math&gt;dB(t, T) = rB(t, T)dt~~~,~~~ B(0, T) = e^{-rT} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We consider here a ''risk-free'' bond, meaning that its issuer will not default on his obligation to pat to the bondholder the face value at maturity date.

== Risk-free bond vs. Arrow-Debreu security&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ==
The risk-free bond can be replicated by a portfolio of two [[Arrow-Debreu security|Arrow-Debreu]] securities. This portfolio exactly matches  the payoff of the risk-free bond since the portfolio too pays 1 unit regardless of which state occurs. This is because if its price were different from that of the risk-free bond, we would have an ''[[arbitrage]] opportunity'' present in the economy. When an arbitrage opportunity is present, it means that riskless profits can be made through some trading strategy. In this specific case, if portfolio of Arrow-Debreu securities differs in price from the price of the risk-free bond, then the arbitrage strategy would be to buy the lower priced one and sell short the higher priced one. Since each has exactly the same payoff profile, this trade would leave us with zero net risk (the risk of one cancels the other´s risk because we have bought and sold in equal quantities the same payoff profile). However, we would make a profit because we are buying at a low price and selling at a high price. Since arbitrage conditions cannot exist in an economy, the price of the risk-free bond equals the price of the portfolio.

== Calculation the price&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=MGtZz-Fl4coC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=risk+free+bond&amp;hl=sk&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYucjN59XaAhWILVAKHanUBQkQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=risk-free%20bond&amp;f=true|title=Financial Derivatives: Pricing, Applications, and Mathematics|last=Baz|first=Jamil|last2=Chacko|first2=George|date=2004-01-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521815109|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The calculation is related to an Arrow-Debreu security. Let´s call the price of the risk-free bond at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(t, t+1)&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt; refers to the fact that the bond matures at time &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;. As mentioned before,  the risk-free bond can be replicated by a portfolio of two Arrow-Debreu securities, one share of &lt;math&gt;A(1)&lt;/math&gt; and one share of &lt;math&gt;A(2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using formula for the price of an  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; Arrow-Debreu securities

&lt;math&gt;A(k)=p_k \frac{u^{\prime}(C_{t+1}(k))}{u^{\prime}(C_t)}, ~~~~~ k=1,\dots, n&lt;/math&gt;

which is a product of ratio of ''the intertemporal [[marginal rate of substitution]]'' (the ratio of marginal utilities across time, it is also referred to as the ''state price density'' and ''the pricing kernel'') and ''the probability'' of state occurring in which the Arrow-Debreu security pays off 1 unit. The price of the portfolio is simply

&lt;math&gt;P(t,t+1)=A(1)+A(2)=p_1\frac{u^{\prime}(C_{t+1}(1))}{u^{\prime}(C_t)}+p_2\frac{u^{\prime}(C_{t+1}(2))}{u^{\prime}(C_t)}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(t,t+1)=\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb P}\Bigg[\frac{u^{\prime}(C_{t+1}(k))}{u^{\prime}(C_t)}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the price of a risk-free bond is simply the [[expected value]], taken with respect to the [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P=\{p_1,p_2\}&lt;/math&gt;, of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. The interest rate &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, is now defined using the reciprocal of the bond price.

&lt;math&gt;1+r_t=\frac{1}{P(t,t+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we have the fundamental relation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+r}=\mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb P}\Bigg[\frac{u^{\prime}(C_{t+1}(k))}{u^{\prime}(C_t)}\Bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

that defines the interest rate in any economy.

== Example ==
Suppose that the ''probability of state 1'' occurring is 1/4, while ''probability of state 2'' occurring is 3/4. Also assume that ''the pricing kernel'' equals 0.95 for state 1 and 0.92 for state 2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Let the pricing kernel denotes as &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; . Then we have two Arrow-Debreu securities &lt;math&gt;A(1),~A(2)&lt;/math&gt; with parameters

&lt;math&gt;p_1=1/4 ~~,~~U_1=0.95~,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_2 = 3/4 ~~,~~ U_2=0.92~.&lt;/math&gt;

Then using the previous formulas, we can calculate the bond price

&lt;math&gt;P(t,t+1)=A(1)+A(2)=p_1U_1+p_2U_2=1/4\cdot 0.95+3/4\cdot 0.92=0.9275~.&lt;/math&gt;

The interest rate is then given by

&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{1}{P(t,t+1)}-1=\frac{1}{0.9275}-1=7.82\%~.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we see that the pricing of a bond and the determination of interest rate is simple to do once the set of Arrow-Debreu prices, the prices of Arrow-Debreu securities, are known.

'''The San Francisco Mime Troupe''' is a theatre of [[political satire]] which performs free shows in various parks in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area {{Coord|37.7565|-112.4131|display=title|name=SF Mime Troupe HQ}} and around [[California]]. The Troupe does not, however, perform silent [[mime artist|mime]], but each year creates an original musical comedy that combines aspects of [[Commedia dell'Arte]], [[melodrama]], and broad [[farce]] with topical political themes. The group was awarded the [[Regional Theatre Award]] at the [[41st Tony Awards]].

==History==

===Origins===
The group was founded in 1959 by R. G. Davis as a medium of expression of his divergent{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} theatrical concepts. The group debuted with ''Mime and Word'' (1959) and ''The 11th Hour Mime Show'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Performed at the Encore Theater after shows by the Actors Workshop of San Francisco, where "Ronnie" Davis was working on the staff.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1961, the group transitioned to the Commedia dell'Arte format to more thoroughly comment on perceived political repression in the [[United States of America]], the growing [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and military and covert intervention abroad. In the mid-1960s the group started to rely less on the direct Commedia dell'Arte format and transitioned into a more rambunctious, satirical style.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} It also began integrating elements of Jazz into its musical composition, eventually leading to the inclusion of a jazz band within the troupe. The group gained significant notoriety for its free performances in [[Golden Gate Park]] and numerous altercations with law enforcement.

By the early 1970s, the Troupe had earned a reputation for opposing capitalism, sexism, and war.&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernstein |first1=Lee |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=America is the Prison: Arts and Politics in Prison in the 1970s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3yRlKxxDtkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2010 |month= |origyear= |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |language= |isbn=9780807871171 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=52|pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=The Age of Jackson: George Jackson and the Radical Critique of Incarceration |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3yRlKxxDtkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Davis history===
In the early 70s Mr. Davis left the Troupe when it re-formed as a [[Collective]], the members of which operate as the [[Artistic Director]], at which time the Troupe produced one of its most successful shows, ''The Independent Female'' (1970). In the 1980s, the group's productions retaliated against the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration with a number of productions:

* In ''Factwino meets The Moral Majority'' (1981), Factwino, an alcoholic superhero that became a recurring protagonist, bestowed wisdom upon prominent icons, such as [[Jerry Falwell]].
* ''Steel Town'' (1984) characterized the plight of steel workers and the decline of steel manufacture in the U.S. For this production, the troupe toured the Midwest, primarily in factory cities.
* In 1987, the troupe's [[Brechtian]] style of [[guerrilla theatre]] earned them a special [[Regional Theatre Tony Award|Tony Award for Excellence in Regional Theater]].

Some of the Troupe's more recent popular shows include "The Minstrel Show or Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel," which satirized entrenched attitudes among liberals and bigots during the Civil Rights Struggle,&lt;ref&gt;Which,  when professor Keith Fowler booked it into Massachusetts' Williams College in 1968, elicited comments from the opening night crowd of "I've been raped!"  The next day a panel discussion was held in which professor Paul Gray of Bennington College thrust a KKK hood over his head and shouted, "If any of them M--F--s comes near my wife, I'll kill him!"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seeing Double,'' about a two-state solution in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, ''Ripped VanWinkle'' which explores the  gap between  the optimism of 1968 and the 1988 reality.''Offshore,'' about the real cost of Globalization, ''Eating It,'' about genetic engineering and profit driven science, ''[http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/1600/2001.php 1600 Transylvania Avenue],'' about corporate government feeding on public wealth, ''[http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/godfellas/2006.php GodFellas],'' a farce exposing the dangers of Fundamentalism to Democracy, and ''[http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/makingakilling/2007.php Making a Killing],'' about war propaganda, and the plight of Iraqis contaminated by depleted uranium. ''[http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/redstate/2008.php Red State],'' the Troupe's 2008 fable about a small Midwest town that, after years of being ignored, demands accountability for their tax dollars, was nominated for a San Francisco Bay Area Theater Critic's Award for Best New Script, as was their 2009 production, [http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/toobigtofail/2009.php Too Big To Fail], which detailed how credit and the philosophy of profit at all costs trap mesmerized citizens in a cycle of debt, while endlessly enriching the Capitalists who cast the spell. Most recently the Troupe produced [http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/posibilidad/2010.php Posibilidad, or Death of the Worker], which juxtaposes the stories of workers taking over two factories - one in Argentina and one in the U.S. - and poses the question: why are  American Workers fighting for a seat at the table? Why not fight for... the whole table?

As well as the park-based shows, the Mime Troupe also tours nationally and internationally, having performed throughout Europe, Asia, South and Central America, and has won several awards. The group also facilitates community workshops. They are a nonprofit making organization. The season traditionally starts on [[Fourth of July]] weekend and ends on [[Labor Day]] weekend.

Early Mime Troupers include Joe Bellan, [[Saul Landau]], [[Arthur Holden]], [[Nina Serrano]], [[Steve Reich]], [[John Connell]], Robert Nelson, [[William T. Wiley]], Sandra Archer, Robert Hudson, [[Wally Hedrick]], Judy North, Jerry Jump, Fred Hayden,
[[Victoria Hochberg]], Joaquin Aranda, Esteban Oropezo and [[John Broderick (producer)|John Broderick]]. Posters for several of the 1970s productions were designed by [[Jane Norling]], and are accessible through the extensive online archive of the San Francisco Mime Troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmt.org/company/archives/|title=Show Archive - San Francisco Mime Troupe - America's Theater of Political Comedy|website=www.sfmt.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later veterans include [[Arthur Holden]], [[Sharon Lockwood]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Luis Valdez]], [[Barry Shabaka Henley]], [[Bruce Barthol]], Joan Holden, [[Joan Mankin]], Melody James, Andrea Snow, Daniel Chumley, [[Jael Weisman]], Jim Haynie, John Robb,  [[Emmett Grogan]], [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], and [[Bishop Joey|Ed Holmes]].

The current San Francisco Mime Troupe Collective comprises Rotimi Agbabiaka, Michael Bello, [http://www.velinabrown.com/velina/velinabio.htm Velina Brown], Ellen Callas, Hugo E Carbajal, Michael Carreiro, Marie Cartier, Lisa Hori-Garcia, Taylor Gonzalez, Keiko Shimosato Carreiro, Daniel Savio, [http://www.michaelgenesullivan.com/michael/michael.htm Michael Gene Sullivan].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">'''Shopping Mall High School''' is a term used in reference to consumer-oriented secondary educational institutions offering an abundance of student choice within its program.  This most often includes choice of schedule, classes, a wide variety of subject matter, subjulty, and extracurricular activities (sports and hobbies).  Schools dubbed shopping mall high schools make such numerous and different accommodations for students in an attempt to allow students to achieve the customized, individualized education and training they desire. Shopping mall high schools offer various curricula in order to maximize holding power, graduation percentages, and customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur G. Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David K. Cohen. The Shopping Mall High School : Winners and Losers in the Educational Marketplace. Boston : Houghton Mifflin, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The concept of a shopping mall high school was first introduced in the best-selling 1985 book, ''The Shopping Mall High School : Winners and Losers in the Educational Marketplace'' by authors Arthur G. Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David K. Cohen.  The book is the second report from "A Study of High Schools," and is the successor volume to education reform leader [[Ted Sizer|Theodore Sizer]]'s ''Horace's Compromise''.  [[Albert Shanker]], former president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]], called ''The Shopping Mall High School'' "a sobering analysis of current conditions in our secondary schools and how they got that way." In ''The Shopping Mall High School'', the authors argue that high schools have come to resemble shopping malls in terms of variety, choice and neutrality.  The book, often required reading for education majors in the 1980s and 1990s, exposed the realities of the comprehensive high school and set off a debate that would later incorporate themes about [[school vouchers]] and the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Anne C.  Students as Commodities.  Phi Delta Kappan, Vol. 84, Issue 8. April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

As high school enrollment increased and diversified during the 20th century, researchers have concluded that standards became lower, resulting in the less-challenging and more-accommodating shopping mall high school style.  In their book, ''The Failed Promise of the American High School 1890-1995,'' authors David Angus (education historian and professor in Education Studies at the [[University of Michigan]]) and Jeffrey E. Mirel (also a professor in Education Studies at the University of Michigan) report that by the 1950s, education aimed at the lowest common denominator become the norm in America's high schools.&lt;ref&gt;Angus, David L., and Jeffrey E. Mirel. The Failed Promise of the American High School: 1890-1995. New York: Teachers College, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and [[Professor Emeritus]] of Philosophy at [[Southwest State University]], H.M. Curtler, identifies two main factors that have resulted in "the dumbing-down of high school and college curricula" and the subsequent increase in  shopping mall high schools: "the major effort in the late 1940s to focus attention in the schools on the disadvantaged student in the guise of teaching what was called real-life experience," and the correlative de-emphasis on traditional literate knowledge.  This approach was linked to progressive educational theories that soon spawned the "[[self-esteem]] movement" prevalent today, turning attention away from traditional educational standards to the students themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Curtler, H.M. "A Plea For Humanistic Education."  Modern Age 48.4 (2006): 330-36 http://www.mmisi.org/ma/48_04/curtler.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopping Mall High Schools Today==
In the 1980s, ''The Shopping Mall High School'' and similar books documented the lack of challenging content in many high school courses.  Despite the current policies of mandated student testing and performance-based school funding, evidence from recent reports indicates that the problem of high school students graduating without thoroughly developing many standard intellectual skills persists.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, C., Mellor, L., and Jian, S. "Orange Juice or Orange Drink." National Center for Educational Accountability.  2006.  http://www.nc4ea.org/files/orange_juice_or_orange_drink_02-13-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases this problem results from the lack of clear state and local standards for what students are expected to learn, and the methods used to teach them.  According to the National Center for Educational Achievement, "the failure of schools, school systems and states to define appropriate standards for high school courses has been a major influence in the move to [[Advanced Placement]] and IB courses." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nc4ea.org/files/preparation_matters-04-01-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of Shopping Mall High Schools==
While advocates for shopping mall style schools boast inclusiveness and freedom of student choice within such programs, critics warn against catering to juvenile whims.  Educator and academic critic [[E.D. Hirsch, Jr.]] refers to the trend of shopping mall high schools in his influential book ''Cultural Literacy'', calling the American public school curriculum "cafeteria style education" that detrimentally serves to diminish "commonly shared information between generations and between young people themselves."  Hirsch believes the unavoidable consequence of the shopping mall high school is a lack of shared knowledge across and within American schools resulting in harmful cultural fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, E.D., Jr. Cultural Literacy What Every American Needs to Know. New York: Vintage, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal article "What High Schools Are Like," writer and Emeritus Professor of Education at the [[University of California, Davis]], Donald Arnstine critiques the shopping mall approach:&lt;blockquote&gt;
To urge the proliferation of shopping mall high schools is to ignore the fact that learning just isn't like shopping. Presented with a wide array of goods, we can purchase what we want and carry it home in a shopping bag.  But if we are presented with a wide array of knowledge, organized by others for ''their'' purposes, we cannot just acquire it and carry it home in our heads.  In fact most of it disappears once we're home (that's why teachers like to give tests on Friday).  Only if one assumes that learning is simply a matter of acquiring information (for how long? a week?  a semester?  forever?) can one believe that schools can be improved by becoming more like shopping malls.&lt;ref&gt;Arnstine, Donald.  "What High Schools Are Like".  Educational Studies: A Journal in the Foundations of Education, v18 n1 p1-12 Spr 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Mall and High School Experience==
The 1982 film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' also makes a comparison of high schools to shopping malls.  Its opening titles appear over scenes of a mall, which continues throughout as the main setting where students live out their adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Kael, The Current Cinema, “RICE KRISPIES,” The New Yorker, November 1, 1982, p. 146. http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1982/11/01/1982_11_01_146_TNY_CARDS_000123486#ixzz0kRXCCN1b
&lt;/ref&gt;

Malls across the United States have seen a decline in business since the heyday of the 1980s.  At the same time, school systems are dealing with budget cuts affecting programs for troubled teens.  The two problems have joined together in a unique solution.  Malls such as the [[Westminster Mall (California)|Westminster Mall]] in Southern California houses an alternative school in mall space donated by the Simon Youth foundation.  Rick Markoff, the executive vice president of the foundation, says there are 25 "mall schools" like Westminster across the U.S. and more on the way.  Most students don't just attend school at the mall, they also intern and work there.

'''Thaksin Shinawatra''' ({{lang-th|ทักษิณ ชินวัตร}}; {{RTGS|''Thaksin Chinnawat''}}; {{IPA-th|tʰák.sǐn t͡ɕʰīn.nā.wát|pron}}; born 26 July 1949) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] businessman, politician and visiting professor who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Thailand|Prime Minister of Thailand]] from 2001 to 2006 and [[Royal Thai Police|Thai Police]] from 1973 to 1987. 

The former police officer founded the mobile phone operator [[Advanced Info Service]] and the IT and telecommunications conglomerate [[Shin Corporation]] in 1987, that made him one of the richest people in Thailand. He joined politics in 1994, founded the [[Thai Rak Thai Party]] (TRT) in 1998 and, after a landslide electoral victory, became prime minister in 2001.

Thaksin's government launched programs to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and universal healthcare coverage. Thaksin declared a "war on drugs" in which more than 2,500 people died and took a strong-arm approach against the [[South Thailand insurgency|separatist insurgency in the Muslim southern provinces]]. He was the first democratically elected prime minister of Thailand to serve a full term and was re-elected in 2005 by an overwhelming majority.

After selling shares of his corporation worth more than a billion dollars to foreign investors without paying taxes, considerable criticism resulted. A citizens' movement against Thaksin, called [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] or "yellow shirts", launched mass protests, accusing him of corruption, abuse of power and autocratic tendencies. Thaksin called snap elections that were boycotted by the opposition and invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]].

He was [[Deposition (politics)|overthrown]] in a [[2006 Thai coup d'état|military coup on 19 September 2006]]. His party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin Shinawatra: from billionaire to fugitive ex-prime minister|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 26 February 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/feb/26/thailand?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487#/?picture=359796750&amp;index=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin has since lived in self-imposed exile except for a brief visit to Thailand in 2008. He was sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to two years in jail for abuse of power. From abroad he has continued to influence Thai politics, through the [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] that ruled in 2008, and its successor organisation [[Pheu Thai Party]], as well as the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] or "red shirt" movement. His younger sister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] was the prime minister of Thailand from 2011 to 2014.

In 2009, Thaksin said in an interview that he was living in Dubai and still had access to about $100 million of his money.

==Heritage and early life==
Thaksin's great-grandfather, [[Seng Saekhu]], was an immigrant from [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]], China, who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in [[Chiang Mai]] in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Saekhu, was born in [[Chanthaburi]] in 1890 and married a Thai woman named Saeng Samana. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra ("routinely appropriate action") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement, and the rest of the family also adopted it.&lt;ref name="familytree"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/08/08/the-shinawatra-family-tree/|title=The Shinawatra family tree|work=New Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seng Saekhu had made his fortune through [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farming]]. Chiang Saekhu/Shinawatra later founded Shinawatra Silks and then moved into finance, construction, and property development. Thaksin's father, Loet, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. Yindi's father, Charoen Ramingwong (born: Wang Chuan Cheng), was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] immigrant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://shanghaiist.com/2014/11/01/yingluckthaksin_go_on_a_family_trip.php |title=Former Thai leaders Yingluck, Thaksin visit ancestral village in Meizhou, Guangdong

In 1968, Loet Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai and deputy leader of the now-defunct Liberal Party. Loet Shinawatra quit politics in 1976. He opened a coffee shop, grew oranges and flowers in Chiang Mai's San Kamphaeng district, and opened two cinemas, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.&lt;ref name="familytree"/&gt;

Thaksin was born in [[Amphoe San Kamphaeng|San Kamphaeng]], Chiang Mai province. He is [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]]. He lived in the village of San Kamphaeng until he was 15, then moved to Chiang Mai city to study at [[Montfort College]]. At 16, he helped run one of his father's cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm BBC News, Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal] BBC News, 18 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin married [[Potjaman Shinawatra|Potjaman Damapong]] in July 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Pasuk Phongpaichit (2009), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son, [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Panthongtae]] and two daughters, Pintongtha and Peathongtarn. They divorced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hP1oYydxL4F7Gt2NLyhoiQVHE_eQ |title=Thailand's deposed PM Thaksin divorces wife: spokesman |accessdate=16 November 2008 |agency=AFP |date=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin's youngest sister, [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], is said to have entered politics in 2011 at her brother's request as leader of the pro-Thaksin [[Pheu Thai Party]] and was elected prime minister on 3 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/CAROUSEL2013/?standalone=1&amp;slug=THAILAND1126 |title=Turmoil in Thailand: Key Players - WSJ.com |accessdate=11 May 2014 |agency=WSG |date=11 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225851/http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/CAROUSEL2013/?standalone=1&amp;slug=THAILAND1126 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin earned a [[doctorate]] in criminology at [[Sam Houston State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shsu.edu/~pin_www/T@S/2001/ShinawatraFeature.html|title=(Archived) Shinawatra Feature|first=Sam Houston State University, SHSU,|last=753|date=|website=www.shsu.edu|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin Shinawatra is a former [[university lecturer]] at [http://sh.mahidol.ac.th/?lang=en Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities] of [[Mahidol University]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tdw.polsci.chula.ac.th/?q=event/2010/02/26/%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%93-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police career==
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD PREFIX MR. HERE. IT IS NOT NEEDED FOR WIKIPEDIA --&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra was a member of the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School,&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, Thaksin's classmates closed ranks behind him on his 58th birthday, 27 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and was then admitted to the Thai Police Cadet Academy. Graduating in 1973, he joined the [[Royal Thai Police]]. He received a master's degree in Criminal Justice from [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a [[doctorate]] in criminal justice at [[Sam Houston State University]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]]. Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a [[Police rank|Police Lieutenant Colonel]] and leaving the police. His former wife, [[Potjaman Shinawatra|Potjaman Damapong]], is the daughter of a Police General Priewpan Damapong and now uses her mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;Pasuk Phongpaichit (2009), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former [[university lecturer]] at [[Royal Thai Police|Royal Police Cadet Academy]] in 1975-1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neutron.rmutphysics.com/teaching-glossary/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9076&amp;Itemid=26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hilight.kapook.com/view/46634&lt;/ref&gt;
Thaksin Shinawatra was revoked his Police Lieutenant Colonel rank on September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2558/E/207/1.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/679772/prayut-signs-order-revoking-thaksin-police-rank&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Early ventures===
Thaksin and his wife began several businesses while he was still in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures and left him over 50 million baht in debt. In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tri333.exteen.com/ |title=Transcript of an interview between Thaksin Shinawatra and Cheeptham Khamwisit (Thai: ชีพธรรม คำวิเศษณ์) on the Thaiventure.com program on FM 102 radio station |publisher=Tri333.exteen.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503214920/http://tri333.exteen.com/ |archive-date=3 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaksin.net/life.html Personal background from personal website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419102042/http://www.thaksin.net/life.html |date=19 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1986, he founded [[Advanced Info Service]] (AIS), which started off as a computer rental business.&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jobtopgun.com/profile/searchprofile?id_emp=255 |title=Google Cache of a JobTopGun profile of AIS's corporate milestones |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Thaksin resigned from the police. He then marketed a romance drama called ''Baan Sai Thong'', which became a popular success in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin Shinawatra-a biography |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/election2001/thaksinprofile.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Thai govt pins border hopes on soaps |date=25 May 2002 |access-date=5 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111093614/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=60278&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=11 November 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he joined [[Pacific Telesis]] to operate and market the PacLink [[pager]] service, a modest success, though Thaksin later sold his shares to establish his own paging company.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3700199.stm Billionaire hopes to score Liverpool deal] 18 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, he launched IBC, a cable television company. At that time, Thaksin had a very good relationship with Chalerm Yoobumrung, the minister of the Prime Minister's Office, who was in charge of Thai press and media. It is a question whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://silance-mobius.blogspot.com/2007/11/blog-post_06.html |title=Thaksin's words }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group's UTV.&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UBC 2004 Annual Report, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Thaksin established a data networking service, Shinawatra DataCom,&lt;ref name="TranscriptInterview" /&gt; today known as Advanced Data Network and owned by AIS and the TOT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |title=Business Operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries |journal=Company Annual Report |format=PDF |access-date=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903104301/http://investor.ais.co.th/FileUpload/Editor/DocumentUpload/WebContent/Annual%20Report/2010/068BusOperationsEN53.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Thaksin's businesses were later consolidated as [[Shin Corp]].

===Advance Info Service and later ventures===
{{Main article|Advanced Info Service}}
[[Advance Info Service]] was given a monopoly contract by his contacts in the military in 1986&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt; and operates under GSM 900 frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1990"&lt;/ref&gt; AIS grew rapidly and became the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ais.co.th/eng/company/ AIS corporate website], click on "About AIS", "Company profile", and then "1994"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|listed]] in 1990.

In 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated four [[Thaicom]] communications satellites.

In 1999, the Shinawatra family spent some 1&amp;nbsp;billion baht establishing [[Shinawatra University]] in [[Pathum Thani]]. It offers international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management, though it ranks quite low in international standings.

In 2000, Thaksin acquired the ailing [[ITV (Thailand)|iTV]] television station from the [[Crown Property Bureau]], [[Nation Multimedia Group]], and [[Siam Commercial Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/nations/0,8782,98445,00.html Taming The Media: Allegations of political interference cast a cloud over Thaksin's incoming administration] Asia Week Vol.27, No.6 16 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 The Television Business, Democracy and The Army] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030702173146/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=99 |date=2 July 2003 }} December 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into politics==

===Political debut===
Thaksin entered politics in late 1994 through [[Chamlong Srimuang]], who had just reclaimed the position of [[Palang Dharma Party]] (PDP) leader from [[Boonchu Rojanastien]]. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP Cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing [[Prasong Soonsiri]].&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HL22Ae01.html Grumbles, revelations of a Thai coup maker], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin left Palang Dharma along with many of its [[House of Representatives of Thailand|MPs]] in 1996, and founded the [[populism|populist]] [[Thai Rak Thai]] (TRT) party in 1998. After a [[Thai general election, 2001|historic election victory in 2001]], he became prime minister, the country's first to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Jan McGirk |title= Thaksin Shinawatra: The man who turned disaster into victory |publisher=BBC |date= 7 February 2005 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thaksin introduced a range of policies to alleviate rural poverty; highly popular, they helped reduce poverty by half in four years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – TEM Oct05 Full version_Nov 7,2005 with ABB.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Should Thaksin Stay? |work=Time |date= 13 March 2006 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1172779-3,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched the country's first [[universal healthcare]] program,&lt;ref&gt;NaRanong, Viroj, Na Ranong, Anchana, Universal Health Care Coverage: Impacts of the 30-Baht Health Care Scheme on the Rural Poor in Thailand, TDRI Quarterly Review, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Health in Thailand|30-baht scheme]], as well as a highly notorious drug suppression campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Red light district reels as Thais embrace family values |author= Alex Spilius |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date= 8 September 2001 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/1339963/Red-light-district-reels-as-Thais-embrace-family-values.html | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin embarked on a massive program of infrastructure investment, including roads, public transit, and [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].

The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of [[Chuan Leekpai]] to collapse.

===PDP leader and Deputy Prime Minister under Banharn===
Chamlong, strongly criticised for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.

Thaksin joined the government of [[Banharn Silpa-Archa]] and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, he and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/96/0524/nat12.html Thailand: Double Trouble For the PM: A parliamentary vote splits the government coalition] 24 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; But Chamlong lost to Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.

Chamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's "temple" faction and Thaksin's. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.

Thaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government, and in September 1996 Banharn dissolved Parliament.

Thaksin announced he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections but would remain as leader of the PDP. It suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only one seat, and soon imploded, with most members resigning.

===Deputy Prime Minister under Chavalit===
On 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]]'s government, after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the [[Asian Financial Crisis]]. He held the position for only three months, leaving on 14 November when Chavalit resigned.

During a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat [[Suthep Thaugsuban]] accused Thaksin of profiting from insider information about the government's decision to float the baht,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1010/nat2.html Pressure from below: Supporters of the new, improved Constitution now have to help turn words into action] 10 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; but the next Democrat party-led government did not investigate the accusations.

During this period, Thaksin also served on the Asia Advisory Board of the Washington, D.C. based [[Carlyle Group]] until he resigned upon becoming Prime Minister in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicalfriendster.com/rateConnection.php?id1=3190&amp;id2=145 |title=Rate Connection – Thaksin Shinawatra connected to Carlyle Group |publisher=Political Friendster |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Thai Rak Thai Party and the 2001 elections===
Thaksin founded the [[Thai Rak Thai]] ("Thais Love Thais" – TRT) party in 1998 along with [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], PDP ally [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]], Purachai Piumsomboon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 MSU alumni, friends, honored for outstanding achievements: Purachai Piumsombun of Bangkok, Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212200729/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/index.php3?article=14Oct2004-8 |date=12 February 2006 }} 14 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and 19 others.

With a populist platform often attributed to [[Somkid Jatusripitak|Somkid]], TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and 1&amp;nbsp;million THB locally managed development funds for all Thai villages.

After Prime Minister [[Chuan Leekpai]] dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the [[Thailand legislative election, 2001|January 2001 elections]], the first held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, some academics called it the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history.&lt;ref name="2001electionclean"&gt;Robert B.

Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the [[Chart Thai Party]] (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats).&lt;ref&gt;Aurel Croissant and Jörn Dosch, Old Wine in New Bottlenecks?

==Prime Minister of Thailand, 2001–06==
[[Image:Thaksin Shinawatra (December 2001).jpg|thumb|Thaksin meeting [[Donald Evans]] in December 2001]]

Thaksin Shinawatra was the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country's modern history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Hewison, Kevin. "Thaksin Shinawatra and the reshaping of Thai politics." Contemporary Politics 16, no. 2 (June 2010): 119–133.&lt;/ref&gt; They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.&lt;ref name=jam&gt;Protesters Jam Bangkok, but Rural Thais Love the Leader. ''The New York Times'', 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's most effective policies were reducing rural poverty&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely untapped support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.&lt;ref name=jam /&gt;

His Cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the [[Palang Dharma Party]], including [[Prommin Lertsuridej]], Chaturon Chaisang, [[Prapat Panyachatraksa]], Surapong Suebwonglee, [[Somkid Jatusripitak]], [[Surakiart Sathirathai]], and [[Sudarat Keyuraphan]]. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.

However, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, [[demagogy]], corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards [[Censorship in Thailand|a free press]]. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of [[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]], treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|religious desecration]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Economic policies===
Thaksin's government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed [[microcredit]] development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.

Thaksin's economic policies helped Thailand recover from the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1&amp;nbsp;trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the [[International Monetary Fund]] two years ahead of schedule.

Income in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46% from 2001 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;NESDB, [http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip Economic Data, 1995–2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719090712/http://www.nesdb.go.th/Portals/0/eco_datas/account/gpp/GPP%201995-2006.zip |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Thailand's [[Gini coefficient]], a measure of [[income inequality]], fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) ).&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTHAILAND/Resources/Economic-Monitor/2005nov-econ-full-report.pdf Thailand Economic Monitor November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] outperformed other markets in the region.

Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor "hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|title=Forget the apologies, let the PM rebuild democracy|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221520/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/05/opinion/opinion_30015415.php|archivedate=14 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin helped legalise Thailand's massive underground lottery system [[numbers game]] (Thai: หวย) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2&amp;nbsp;billion) were used for social projects, including the "One District, One Scholarship" program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|title=Activists call for MCOT delisting|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930004248/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/24/national/national_30019832.php|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|title=Thaksinomics 'not a driver of growth'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717175908/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/30/business/business_30000503.php|archivedate=17 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare policies===
Thaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidised universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials.&lt;ref name=Dual-track&gt;{{cite news |first=Charoen |last=Kittikanya |title=Dual-track system |url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |newspaper=Bangkok Post |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820004448/http://www.bangkokpost.net/midyear2004/health01.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=14 July 2006 |title=Bt30 health scheme still lacks funds, says official |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015165033/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/07/14/national/national_30008668.php |archivedate=15 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thaksin lauds his own achievements |publisher=Bangkok Post |url=http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010025253/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=112327 |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in [[medical tourism]], with 1.3&amp;nbsp;million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33&amp;nbsp;billion (US$800&amp;nbsp;million) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 85 Bogus Doctors Arrested In Thailand Last Year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101121830/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=201904 |date=1 January 2007 }} 6 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiwebsites.com/medical-tourism-thailand.asp First International Trade Exhibition and Conference on Medical Tourism, Spa and Wellness Industries, in Bangkok, 20–23 March 2008] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-coup public health minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30 baht program a "marketing gimmick" and claimed that the government would "very soon" stop charging patients any fees for visits to state hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|title=Bt30 health fee may be scrapped|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031063056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/13/national/national_30016065.php|archivedate=31 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who received the treatment claimed that they prefer drugs from pharmacists than from facilities covered by the scheme and almost half of the patients were dissatisfied with the service given by the facilities.&lt;ref name=Dual-track /&gt; The universal health care scheme raised a debt of 7.7&amp;nbsp;billion baht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Fernquest |title=Thailand's draft government budget for 2007 |url=http://www.readbangkokpost.com/business/2007_currency_crisis/thailands_draft_government_bud.php |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall [[prevalence]] rate noticeably declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/2006_country_progress_report_thailand_en.pdf Follow-up to the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS)] December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public Health at Risk: A US Free Trade Agreement could threaten access to medicines in Thailand |publisher=The Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (Oxfam)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3&amp;nbsp;million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labour protection. [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticised the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais.

===The War on Drugs===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin administration#Anti-drug policies}}
Thaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to counter a perceived boom in the Thai drug market, particularly in [[methamphetamine]]. Earlier policies like border blocking (most methamphetamine is produced in [[Myanmar]]), education, sports, and promoting peer pressure had proved ineffective. In a 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol noted the rise in drug use and called for a "War on Drugs." Privy Councillor Phichit Kunlawanit called on the government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that "if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma".&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Connors, [http://sovereignmyth.blogspot.com/2009/09/ambivalent-about-rights.html Ambivalent About Rights: "Accidental" Killing Machines, Democracy and Coups D’etat.], Draft paper presented to Human Rights in Asia Workshop, University of Melbourne, 1–2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid "every square inch of the country" of drugs in three months.&lt;ref&gt;Anucha Yuwadee, Bangkok Post, 15 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets including "blacklists", awarding government officials for achieving targets and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeting dealers, and "ruthless" implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"&gt;National News Bureau of Thailand, [http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/378944-academics-call-for-law-to-prosecute-thaksin-in-world-court/ Academics call for law to prosecute Thaksin in World Court], 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/aids/2004/thai.htm |title=The War on Drugs, HIV/AIDS, and Violations of Human Rights in Thailand |quote=Beginning in February 2003, the Thaksin government instructed police and local officials that persons charged with drug offenses should be considered "security threats" and dealt with in a "ruthless" and "severe" manner.

King Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticised those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html |title=พระราชดำรัส พระราชทานแก่คณะบุคคลต่างๆ ที่เข้าเฝ้าฯ ถวายชัยมงคล ในโอกาสวันเฉลิมพระชนมพรรษา ณ ศาลาดุสิดาลัย สวนจิตรลดา พระราชวังดุสิตฯ วันพฤหัสบดีที่ ๔ ธันวาคม พ.ศ. ๒๕๔๖ (ฉบับไม่เป็นทางการ) |quote=ไอ้การชัยชนะของการปราบไอ้ยาเสพติดนี่ ดีที่ปราบ แล้วก็ที่เขาตำหนิบอกว่า เอ้ย คนตาย ตั้ง ๒,๕๐๐ คน อะไรนั่น เรื่องเล็ก ๒,๕๐๐ คน ถ้านายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ นายกฯ ไม่ได้ทำ ทุกปี ๆ จดไว้นะ มีมากกว่า ๒,๕๐๐ คนที่ตาย ที่ตายทั้งคนที่เสพติด แล้วก็ขึ้นไป ฆ่าคน หรือทำอะไร เผาอะไรต่าง ๆ รวมทั้งเจ้าหน้าที่ที่ต้องไปปราบปกติ ก็ตายมากเหมือนกัน แต่ไม่พูดเท่านั้นเอง ไม่ไปนับ แต่นี้เขาก็นับไปชี้ ชี้ ชี้นับ พวกที่ค้า พวกที่ทำ ก็ตายเยอะเหมือนกัน ก่อนนี้ แต่ไม่พูดถึง เชื่อว่าพอๆ กับที่ได้จดว่า มีผู้ที่ตายในการสงครามต่อสู้ยาเสพติด ที่ทราบว่าคนตาย เพราะยาเสพติดนี่ มากมาย |publisher=The Golden Jubilee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Victory in the War on Drugs is good. They may blame the crackdown for more than 2,500 deaths, but this is a small price to pay. If the prime minister failed to curb [the drug trade], over the years the number of deaths would easily surpass this toll.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Sentinel [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?Itemid=185&amp;id=628&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view The Long Wait for Justice in Thailand], 10 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;"}}

Bhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Royal Jubilee Network, [http://kanchanapisek.or.th/speeches/2003/1204.th.html 2003 Birthday Speech of King Bhumibol Adulyadej]&lt;/ref&gt; Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.

The war on drugs was widely criticised by the international community. Thaksin requested that the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, "The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=75010&amp;date=4 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 March 2003 |title=DRUG-RELATED KILLINGS: Verify the toll, say diplomats }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee to investigate the anti-drug campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 "Kanit to chair extrajudicial killings probe"] ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', 3 August 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090211/http://bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=120634 |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in January 2008: "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted."&lt;ref name=economist24jan08&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10566797 "Thailand's drug wars.

While he was opposition leader, [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] accused Thaksin of [[crimes against humanity]] for his alleged role in the campaign. After being appointed Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation into the killings, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]]. Former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen led the investigation and the investigation committee was approved by Abhisit's Cabinet. Abhisit denied that the probe was politically motivated. Witnesses and victims were urged to report to the Department of Special Investigation, which operated directly under Abhisit's control.&lt;ref name="thaivisa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thailand Times, [http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ Thaksin’s ‘Drug Murders’ investigated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402164354/http://thailandtimes.asia/thailand-news/thaksins-drug-murders-investigated/ |date=2 April 2012 }}, 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalthailand.com/threads/677-Extra-juridical-killing-cases-by-Thaksin-government-investigated-again-in-Thailand|title=Extra-juridical killing cases by Thaksin government investigated again in Thailand|work=Personal Thailand - Travel and Live in Thailand}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the August 2011 parliamentary elections, Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicise any conclusive evidence linking Thaksin or members of his Government to any extrajudicial killings.

===Educational policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Education policies}}
[[File:LulaShinawatra.jpg|thumb|Thaksin in a meeting with the [[President of Brazil]], [[Lula da Silva]], in 2004]]

One of Thaksin's educational reforms was school decentralisation, as mandated by the 1997 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|title=54th Thai Government Policy|author=|date=26 May 2001|website=archive.org|accessdate=15 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010526124921/http://www.thaiembdc.org/politics/govtment/policy/54thpolicy/policy_e.html|archivedate=26 May 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. Teachers also feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 Crisis in the 'Land of the Smile'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917045902/http://internationalviewpoint.org/article.php3?id_article=1009 |date=17 September 2006 }} International Viewpoint, Online magazine: IV376 – March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other intended policy changes included learning reform and related curricular decentralisation, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |title=Thai News Agency, Rote learning to be eliminated from schools, says PM, 21 January 2006 |publisher=Etna.mcot.net |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016205115/http://etna.mcot.net/query.php?nid=19066 |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To increase access to universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|title=New student loan scheme to have higher family-income limit|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709030754/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/13/national/national_30018789.php|archivedate=9 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was one of the first supporters of [[Nicholas Negroponte]]'s [[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712025355/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/08/15/byteline/index.php?news=byteline_18342256.html|archivedate=12 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The junta later cancelled the project.

Thaksin also initiated the controversial "One District, One Dream School" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district had at least one high-quality school. It was criticised, with claims that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving inadequate financial support from the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |title=Suicide puts spotlight on model schools' money woes |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=15 September 2005 |access-date=4 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124804/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=3&amp;id=121026&amp;usrsess= |archive-date=29 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAI TALK: Nightmares haunt dream-school project |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=13 October 2005 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614082702/http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/10/13/opinion/index.php?news=opinion_18859784.html |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he altered the state university entrance system, which had relied exclusively on nationally standardised exams. Thaksin pushed for greater weighting of senior high-school grades in the hope of focusing students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.

===Energy policies===
{{See also|Policies of the Thaksin government#Energy policies|Energy Industry Liberalization and Privatization (Thailand)}}

In energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the [[Chuan Leekpai]] government's privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-[[Asian financial crisis]] policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale [[Electricity market|power pool]] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/ffd/domestic/2001/0927trump.htm |title=Far Eastern Economic Review, "Power Politics Trump Reform", 27 September 2001 |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=27 September 2001 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin's policies aimed to create [[Leadership|national champions]] that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm Bangkok Post, "Raising sector efficiency `crucial': Utility's B140bn debt strains public purse"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529234341/http://my.reset.jp/~adachihayao/040503C.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.

===South Thailand insurgency===
{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}

A resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with their Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians (including Buddhist monks) are also regular targets. Thaksin was widely criticised for his management of the situation.

Of three key controversial incidents, the first was the Army's storming of the [[Krue Sae Mosque|Krue Se Mosque]], where protesters had holed up and were killed.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DA123CF931A15754C0A9639C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fT%2fThaksin%20Shinawatra U.N. Criticizes Emergency Powers], Warren Hoge, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, in October 2004, was the killing of 84 Muslim demonstrators at [[Tak Bai]], when the Army broke up a peaceful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THAILAND: At least 84 people killed in Southern Thailand |publisher=Asian Human Rights Commission |date=26 October 2004 |url=http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2004/838/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims were reported to have been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.

In a third incident, Muslim lawyer [[Somchai Neelapaijit]] disappeared, allegedly abducted and killed by police for his role in defending alleged insurgents who claimed to have been tortured. Despite witness testimony and forensic evidence during the court of police investigations and court trials, all allegations against police said to be involved were dropped and the enforced disappearance case closed.

Thaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Somchai Phatharathananunth "Civil Society and Democratization" p.222&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organisations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/08/04/thaila11592.htm |title=Emergency Decree Violates Thai Constitution and Laws |date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister [[Anand Panyarachun]] to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled South. In its final report in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing elements of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and making [[Yawi language|Pattani-Malay (Yawi)]] an official language in the region along with Thai. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, but nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |title=Government shrugs off NRC final report |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=7 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195700/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/07/regional/regional_30005908.php |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin blamed Malaysia's jungle that has occasionally been used to train Islamic militants to cause violence in the south and Indonesia for being an inspiration to the militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|title=The Nation: Southern Unrest|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527043825/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/south2years/dec2304.php|archivedate=27 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative reform===
One of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labelled the "big bang." It was hailed as a "historic breakthrough" and "the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand's modern system of departmental government in 1897." Plans had been studied for years to loosen perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system but were not implemented until the Thaksin government.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Painter, Managerial Reform and Political Control, Department of Public and Social Administration, City University of Hong Kong, [http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc the Case of Thaksin and the Thai Bureaucracy*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012055631/http://www.sog-rc27.org/Paper/Scancor/Martin_Painter.doc |date=12 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.

Thaksin transformed the role of provincial governors to that of active policy managers. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials who reported back to Bangkok, while the Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.

A key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, the "CEO-governors" epitomised what was called his "transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive." Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and co-ordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The "CEO governors" were assisted by "provincial CFOs" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. Governors were authorised to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kellogg School of Management |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news/hits/030817bp.htm |title=CEO governors mini-premiers, says PM: Can issue bonds, use management methods |date=17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors.

The Thaksin era also saw the opening of a number of government one-stop service centres to reduce red tape for anything from investment to utilities and ID-card processing.

===Foreign policies===
[[Image:Vladimir Putin in Thailand 21-22 October 2003-1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thaksin with the [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at [[APEC Bangkok 2003]] on 21 October 2003 in Bangkok]]
Thaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=กลุ่มศึกษาข้อตกลงเขตการค้าเสรีภาคประชาชน |url=http://www.ftawatch.org/ |title=FTA Watch Group website |publisher=Ftawatch.org |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.

Thaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906011819/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=3502 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 September 2004 |work=Straits Times |title=Thaksin's Chance for Leading Role in the Region |date=10 March 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was repeatedly attacked for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders and the international community. Besides his famous swipe at the UN (see The 'war on drugs' above), there were also allegations of gaffes at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Ex-envoys tell of 'multi-tasking' premier |date=17 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907051258/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/26/headlines/headlines_30000240.php |archivedate=7 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was keen to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries like Laos. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the impoverished country a 4&amp;nbsp;billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ 'Thaksin to face charges over Burma telecom deal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103061415/http://www.burmait.net/ict-news/2007/aug07/thaksin-to-face-charges-over-burma-telecom-deal/ |date=3 January 2009 }}. ICT News, 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Powell Thaksin 20020729.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] and Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra at Government House]]
Thaksin energetically supported his former foreign minister [[Surakiart Sathirathai]]'s somewhat improbable campaign to become UN Secretary General.

===Suvarnabhumi Airport===
Despite debate and long abandonment of the plan due to the stability of the ground for the location of the airport, the Thaksin government pushed to complete the construction of the new Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The airport was officially opened a week after Thaksin's government was overthrown. It is one of the world's largest airports.

However, some members of Thaksin's government were accused of [[corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project]]. These allegations were used by the military junta to justify the 2006 coup.&lt;ref&gt;International Herald Tribune, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/02/news/thai.php Thailand's airport imbroglio grows], 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CDRM|junta]] initiated several investigations into the airport. Nevertheless, investigative panels found that damage to the airport was "minute" and "common." The cost of repairing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused by its opponents of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems to pin further blame on the Thaksin government. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Criticism===

===="Policy corruption"====
Thaksin was accused of "policy corruption", such as infrastructure and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|title=Thaksin-era corruption'cost state Bt400 bn'|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115212205/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/01/headlines/headlines_30015092.php|archivedate=15 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]]. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4&amp;nbsp;billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the minimum air fare of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about to enter into a joint venture with low-cost carrier [[AirAsia]] to open a Thai subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tackling the 'policy corruption' of the Thaksin regime |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 November 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013143400/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/05/opinion/opinion_30018078.php |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2006 coup, the military junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets based on charges of policy corruption.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;Asia Sentinel, [http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=536&amp;Itemid=185 Thailand's Thaksin Freeze Out], 14 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin denied the allegations. "They just made up a beautiful term to use against me. There's no such thing in this government. Our policies only serve the interests of the majority of the people", he said.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt; From 2002 to 2006, the stock price of Shin Corp increased from 38 to 104 baht (an increase of 173 per cent) while the stock price of Shin Satellite fell. In the same period, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 161 per cent, and the price of other major SET blue chip companies increased vastly more. Industry deregulation caused the market share of AIS to fall from 68 per cent to 53 per cent.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

====Corruption====
[[Transparency International]] reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved somewhat during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61), whilst in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).&lt;ref&gt;Thai Public Relations Department, "Thailand's Image on Transparency", 26 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 TI 2005 Corruption Perceptions Index] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512023516/http://transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 |date=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International, [http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 Corruption Perceptions Index 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929153638/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2001 |date=29 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a study of [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] by the [[World Bank]] gave Thailand a lower score on Control of Corruption during 2002–2005 under Thaksin when compared to the Democrat-led government of 1998–2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |title=Worldwide Governance Indicators |format=PDF |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710170031/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/pdf/c213.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 Thaksin Shinawatra was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in absentia over a corrupt land deal. In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/thaksin-thailand-corruption|title=Former Thai PM Thaksin found guilty of corruption|author=Ian MacKinnon|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other charges====
Immediately after the events in March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajivas stated that he would talk to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin's wealth and extravagance, carving a contrast between the alleged opulence of the premier's house and the humbler, agrarian roots of many of the demonstrators. Shortly after, he also directly condemned his opponent's self-proclaimed affinity with the ordinary people, the "phrai", arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the "ammart", or the traditional elites in Thailand's army, bureaucracy, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomat, [http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ Thailand's Blood Red Protest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095707/http://the-diplomat.com/2010/03/21/thailand%E2%80%99s-blood-red-protest/ |date=27 May 2010 }}, 21 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin's government was accused of exerting political influence in its [[Censorship of radio and film (Thailand)|crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations]], and Thaksin brought massive defamation suits against critical journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |date=1 June 2005 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Community-radio crackdown panned |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215020/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/06/01/national/index.php?news=national_17552513.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Acting prime minister files more criminal and defamation lawsuits |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=15 June 2006 |url=http://cpj.org/2006/06/thailand-acting-prime-minister-files-more-criminal.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin was also accused of interference when the Senate appointed [[Wisut Montriwat]] (former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) to the position of Auditor General, replacing [[Jaruvan Maintaka]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===2005 re-election===
Under the slogans "Four Years of Repair{{spaced ndash}}Four years of Reconstruction" and "Building Opportunities", Thaksin and the TRT won landslide victories in [[Thai general election, 2005|February 2005 elections]], sweeping 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. But his second term was soon beset by protests, with claims that he presided over a "parliamentary dictatorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand Election Triumph: Re-packaging old politics? |publisher=ASEAN Focus Group, Australian National University |accessdate=4 April 2009 |url=http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720192841/http://www.aseanfocus.com/asiananalysis/article.cfm?articleID=838 |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations by Sondhi Limthongkul===
The political crisis was catalysed by several accusations published by media mogul and popular talk show host [[Sondhi Limthongkul]], a former Thaksin supporter who had broken with him. These included accusations that Thaksin:
* Restricted press freedom by suing Sondhi after he printed a sermon by a [[Luang Ta Maha Bua|controversial monk]] (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Luang Ta Maha Bua incident|Luang Ta Maha Bua incident]])
* Masterminded the desecration of the famous [[Erawan Shrine|Erawan]] shrine (see [[Thailand political crisis 2005-2006#Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident|Phra Phrom Erawan Shrine incident]])

===Sale of Shin Corporation===
{{Main article|Sale of Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings}}
On 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in [[Shin Corporation]] to [[Temasek Holdings]]. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73&amp;nbsp;billion [[baht]] (about US$1.88&amp;nbsp;billion) tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand|stock exchange]] exempt from [[capital gains tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |title=Complex transaction a model for avoiding tax, ownership law |date=27 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712041022/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/shincorp/shin22.html |archivedate=12 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thaksin was the target of accusations of corruption for selling forbidden national assets such as national utility company to a foreign entity in exchange for personal profits and kickbacks.  Thai laws at the time disallowed the sale of integral assets of national importance to the public or to any foreign entity, but Thaksin amended the laws to allow such sale.

===Anti-Thaksin rallies===
{{See also|Thailand political crisis 2005-2006}}
Thaksin faced pressure to resign following the Shin Corp. sale.

Protests, led by the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) whose leaders included Chamlong and Sondhi, soon swelled to tens of thousands who occupied the area around Government House in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Tens of thousands rally against Thailand's Prime Minister]]&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of both working-class and middle-class Bangkokians and included prominent social figures, academics and students.

===House dissolution and election===
{{Main article|Thailand legislative election, April 2006}}
Thaksin announced a [[Dissolution of parliament|House dissolution]] on 24 February 2006. General elections were scheduled for 2 April.

Thaksin was attacked for calling the snap elections, which in effect prevented any member of parliament from changing parties. In an editorial, ''The Nation'' noted it "fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept [of democracy], particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin's manipulation has been well documented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |title=Democracy put to the ultimate test |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=21 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231731/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/21/opinion/opinion_20003175.php |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election results and by-elections===
Thaksin's TRT Party won the widely boycotted elections, gaining 462 seats in Parliament, with the ratio of voters to no-voters 16:10, not counting non-voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Thai Rak Thai win 16&amp;nbsp;million votes: Thaksin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427050223/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000870 |archivedate=27 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by-elections were needed for 40 TRT candidates who failed to win the minimum 20% required by the 1997 Constitution in an uncontested seat.&lt;ref name="NationSecond"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=4 April 2006 |title=38 one-horse candidates fail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206162906/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/03/headlines/headlines_30000858.php |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=Second round of elections be held on 23 April |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908022737/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000955 |archivedate=8 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party refused to contest them&lt;ref name="NationSecond" /&gt; and, along with the [[People's Alliance for Democracy|PAD]], petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrat asks court to cancel 2nd round of election |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120030/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30001232 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamlong Srimuang declared that the PAD would ignore the elections and "go on rallying until Thaksin resigns and Thailand gets a royally appointed prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=5 October 2006 |title=PAD ignores vote results |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122030026/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30000759 |archivedate=22 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were held on 25 April and resulted in the TRT winning 25 of the constituencies and losing 2. Yet another round of by-elections on 29 April was scheduled for 13 constituencies. The Thai Rak Thai Party was later accused and found guilty of paying smaller parties to contest the election to fulfill the 20% rule, while the Democrat Party was accused of paying smaller parties not to. The by-elections were suspended by the Constitution Court while it deliberated whether to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=Thaksin Shinawatra Talkasia Transcript |date=12 February 2007 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/22/talkasia.thaksin.script/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invalidation of the elections===
On 8 May 2006, the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] ruled 8–6 to invalidate the April elections based on the awkward positioning of voting booths. The ruling was called a landmark case in "judicial activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bangkok Post |title=End of the beginning in Thailand's crisis 19 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrat Party, which had boycotted the April elections, said they were now ready to contest an October election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |title=Constitution Court invalidate the April election and order new election |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=8 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616174003/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/08/headlines/headlines_30003512.php |archivedate=16 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new election was ordered and later set for [[Thailand legislative election, October 2006|15 October]]. The Court found the Election Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them. But the election was cancelled when the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military seized power on 19 September]].

===Break from politics===
Thaksin announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of Prime Minister after Parliament reconvened, but would continue as Caretaker Prime Minister until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Channel NewsAsia |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/201527/1/.html |date=4 April 2006 |title=Thai PM Thaksin says he'll stop down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then delegated his functions to Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister [[Chidchai Wannasathit]], moved out of Government House, and went on vacation.

==September 2006 coup==
{{Main article|2006 Thai coup d'état}}
In the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 soldiers ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex to lay down their weapons. Troops also surrounded the [[Thaicom]] satellite receiving station and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza and government units along Rajdamnoen Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai armed forces seize Bangkok |agency=Reuters |date=19 September 2006 |url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-19T164005Z_01_BKK256153_RTRUKOC_0_UK-THAILAND-EMERGENCY.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211164830/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews |archivedate=11 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troops participating in the coup were from the 1st and 3rd Army Regions, the [[Internal Security Operations Command]], the Special Warfare Centre and Army units in Nakhon Ratchasima and Prachin Buri provinces and sections of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=nationmultimedia.com|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|title=Caretaker PM tries to fight back|date=20 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102202724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014074.php|archivedate=2 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to coup leader Army Commander General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]], the coup leaders had arrested Deputy Prime Minister [[Chitchai Wannasathit]] and Defense Minister [[Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece One night in Bangkok] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008104423/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1621779.ece |date=8 October 2006 }}, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The military, originally calling itself the [[Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch]] (CDRM), issued a statement citing the government's alleged ''[[lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse majesté]]'', corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |title=Statement from the military reformist |date=20 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212504/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/20/headlines/headlines_30014072.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It declared the king of Thailand the head of state, and said elections would be held soon to return democracy to the country. Thaksin later arrived in [[UK|Britain]], where he had family.

===Thai Rak Thai party===
Many [[Thai Rak Thai]] party members were reported to have resigned from the party in the aftermath of the coup for fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction. It was not clear whether [[Suriya Jungrungreangkit]], another influential member of the faction, would also resign. [[Sontaya Kunplome]] was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |title=Sonthaya leads 20 members out of Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014221431/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015188 |archivedate=14 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |url=http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |title=Somsak leads 100 members to resign from Thai Rak Thai |date=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528033455/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015187 |archivedate=28 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2006 Thaksin and his former deputy Somkid Jatusipitak resigned from the TRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |title=Thaksin resigns from Thai Rak Thai |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183911/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/03/headlines/headlines_30015263.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=nationmultimedia.com |date=2 October 2006 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |title=Somkid resigns from Thai Rak Thai Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012233156/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015265 |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaturon Chaisang took over as party head.

The TRT was finally dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal, which banned over 100 of its executives, including Thaksin, from politics for five years, based on charges that two party executives (Defense Minister Thammarak and Pongsak Raktapongpaisarn) bribed a smaller party to stand in the [[April 2006 Thailand legislative election|April 2006 election]]. The Democrat party was cleared on a similar charge.

===2006 Bangkok New Year's Eve bombings===
{{Main article|2006 Bangkok bombings}}
On 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2007, several bombs exploded in Bangkok, killing and wounding a number of bystanders. General Surayud accused "those who lost power as a result of the military takeover" of masterminding the bombings, but did not directly identify Thaksin. Thaksin went on CNN to publicly deny any involvement in the bombings. The government did not make any arrests in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|title=Surayud suspects "power losers" as finger--pointing begins|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220033330/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/01/01/headlines/headlines_30023035.php|archivedate=20 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal charges===
Thaksin's [[diplomatic passport]] was revoked on 31 December 2006 after the junta accused him of engaging in political activities while in exile. Thai embassies were ordered not to facilitate his travels.

A junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets and attempted to bring charges against him. The AEC was criticised for being stacked with anti-Thaksin appointees. At one point, AEC Secretary [[Kaewsan Atibodhi]] claimed that "evidence and witnesses are useless", when an AEC panel recommended legal action without hearing 300 witnesses or considering 100 additional pieces of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The AEC froze Thaksin's assets

In January 2007, Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with an Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772&amp;nbsp;million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which prohibits government officials and their spouses from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authority.

The Assets Examination Committee also accused Thaksin of issuing an unlawful cabinet resolution approving the spending of state funds to buy rubber saplings.

In March 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General charged Thaksin's wife and brother-in-law with conspiring to evade taxes of 546&amp;nbsp;million baht (US$15.6&amp;nbsp;million) in a 1997 transfer of Shin Corp shares.

The Assets Examination Committee found Thaksin guilty of malfeasance for obstructing competition by imposing an excise tax on telecom operators. Thaksin's Cabinet had approved the relevant executive decree in 2003.

==Purchase of Manchester City Football Club==
As prime minister, Thaksin had unsuccessfully sought to buy the English [[Premier League]] football clubs [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and later [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in what critics claimed was a publicity stunt in response to his political problems.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/footballNews/idUKSP17548520070706?pageNumber=3 NEWSMAKER-City takeover keeps Thaksin in the political limelight], 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2007, now out of office, he bought Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £81.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;PLUS Markets Group [https://archive.is/20070911041449/http://www.plusmarketsgroup.com/story.shtml?ISIN=GB0005599336&amp;NewsID=25324 Manchester City plc – Offer unconditional in all respects], 7 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He became briefly popular with fans (who nicknamed him 'Frank'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/11/football.comment | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Hattenstone | title=Why Thaksin's billions are a fan's living nightmare | date=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;), especially after appointing [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] manager of the club and bringing in prominent players.&lt;ref&gt;Official Manchester City website, [http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pageid=115&amp;pagegid=%7BDBD12D53%2D8346%2D431D%2DA04F%2D5D0F8664DE80%7D&amp;newsid=439107&amp;siteid=&amp;pageno=1&amp;newscategory=&amp;frommonth=5&amp;fromyear=2007&amp;tomonth=7&amp;toyear=2007 Sven-Goran Eriksson appointed Manchester City Manager] 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eriksson was later critical of Thaksin's running of the club, saying "he [Thaksin] didn't understand football – he hadn't a clue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=England need a winter break, says Sven-Goran Eriksson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/8682830/England-need-a-winter-break-says-Sven-Goran-Eriksson.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=4 August 2011 |first=Henry |last=Winter |accessdate=4 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the club to investors from [[Abu Dhabi United Group]] in September 2008 for a reported £200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City Owner Agrees to Sell to Abu Dhabi|publisher=Bloomberg |date =2 September 2008 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a1QqM9gkEXWQ&amp;refer=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After selling Manchester City Football Club, Thaksin was nominated as "honorary president" but does not have any administrative responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/world/europe/01iht-thaksin.1.15793147.html|title=Thaksin sells Manchester City club to Emirates group|date= 1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later dismissed from honorary club president after the club has decided to take a position against him following his conviction and is currently "on the run" from Thai authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/10/manchester-city-thaksin-sacked|title=Football: Manchester City dump Thaksin Shinawatra from president's role|author=Daniel Taylor|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions and exile==
In May 2007, Prime Minister [[Surayud Chulanont]] said Thaksin was free to return to Thailand, and he would personally guarantee Thaksin's safety. In January 2008 Thaksin's wife Potjaman was arrested on arrival in [[Bangkok]] but released on bail after appearing at the Supreme Court, with orders not to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7176160.stm |title=/2, Thaksin's wife back in Thailand |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was set to be tried for alleged violation of [[stock]]-trading and land sale laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7203913.stm news.bbc.co.uk, Ex-PM's wife set for Thai trial] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratchadaphisek land verdict===
{{See also|Potjaman Shinawatra#Ratchadaphisek land purchase controversy}}
On 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions ruled that Thaksin, while prime minister, abused his power to help his wife buy public land at auction, and sentenced him to two years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[Online].

Soon after, Thaksin told [[Reuters]], "I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way", and added that the case was politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=131548 ''Thaksin guilty of corruption''] Bangkok Post (21 October 2008.

===Self-imposed exile===
On 10 November 2008, a Philippine spokesman said his government would "politely" turn down any request for political refuge from Thaksin due to [[Manila]]'s "friendly" relations with [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081110-171229/RP-closes-door-on-Thaksin |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, RP closes door on Thaksin |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418023813/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081110-171229/RP-closes-door-on-Thaksin |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=(AFP) – 8 November 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIJDty8bXGTsp4wJ0RfqmtmSKzMg |title=afp.google.com/article, Philippine asylum for Thaksin unlikely: foreign dept official |publisher=Google |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418065844/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iIJDty8bXGTsp4wJ0RfqmtmSKzMg |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/388799/1/.html |title=channelnewsasia.com, Philippine foreign dept official says asylum for Thaksin unlikely |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Government [[Home Office]], meanwhile, revoked Potjaman and Thaksin's [[visa (document)|visas]] due to their convictions, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines directing them to disallow either of them to board flights to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/09/news/10thaksin.php UK visa revoked, Thaksin looks for new home] www.iht.com&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, ''[[Arabian Business]]'' reported after an exclusive interview that the UK froze $4.2&amp;nbsp;billion of his assets in the UK. However, the UK government has not confirmed or denied this claim.&lt;ref name="DownToLast500million"&gt;Straits Times, [http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_318574.html Down to his last US$500m] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110255/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/SE+Asia/Story/STIStory_318574.html |date=9 March 2009 }}, 26 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin had reportedly considered sanctuaries such as [[China]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Nicaragua]], and several other countries in [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. Reports said the Shinawatras were granted honorary citizenship by the Bahamas and Nicaragua, and were building a £5.5&amp;nbsp;million home in China. As of late May 2009, he reportedly remained in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/388847/1/.html |title=www.channelnewsasia.com, Thailand to push Thaksin extradition wherever he goes |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=(AFP) – 9 November 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEpvCQ8QzDppeQTiAAWBHv91BoPA |title=afp.google.com, Thailand to push Thaksin extradition wherever he goes: officials |publisher=Google |date=9 November 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418064751/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEpvCQ8QzDppeQTiAAWBHv91BoPA |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: Thaksin still in UAE |publisher=Bangkok Post |date=21 May 2009 |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/143938/police-thaksin-still-in-uae}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman claimed Thaksin was travelling on six passports, none of them Thai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thaksin no Cambodian passport |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/143999/thaksin-doesn-t-have-cambodian-passport |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=22 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008 Thaksin obtained a residency permit for [[Germany]]&lt;ref name="NationThird"&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany lifts travel ban on fugitive Thaksin |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/07/28/national/Germany-lifts-travel-ban-on-fugitive-Thaksin-30161360.html |newspaper=nationmultimedia.com (Thailand) |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206075302/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2011/07/28/national/Germany-lifts-travel-ban-on-fugitive-Thaksin-30161360.html |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequently withdrawn on 28 May 2009 when the German government became aware of the arrangement.

===Songkran unrest===
{{Main article|April 2009 Thai political unrest}}
In mid-April 2009, violent protests of mostly Thaksin-supporters calling themselves the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD) led to the cancellation of the [[ASEAN]] summit in Pattaya and declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok. Thaksin had been giving enthusiastic encouragement at UDD rallies via satellite and phone-in link, at one point calling for a "people's revolution", following the suppression of the protests he claimed to have merely been offering "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opposition raises specter of civil war in Thailand |author=Brian McCartan |publisher=World Politics Review |url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/article.aspx?id=3691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaksin supported protests by the [[National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship|UDD]] against the Abhisit Vejjajiva government, demanding Thaksin be allowed to return free from all the earlier corruption charges.&lt;ref name="Thaksin pitches 'all-out' fight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangkok Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enews.mcot.net"/&gt; Thaksin denied leading the UDD, claiming he only gave them "moral support."&lt;ref name="Thaksin on protests in Thailand"/&gt;

===Money laundering allegations===
In April 2009, Privy Councilor General [[Pichitr Kullavanijaya]] reported he had been informed by former US ambassador to Thailand [[Ralph L. Boyce]] that Thaksin had laundered 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht (US$2.8&amp;nbsp;billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts to organise the anti-government protests.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/KD17Ae02.html Smoke, mirrors and lies], 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic advisor to Cambodia===
On 4 November 2009, it was announced that Thaksin Shinawatra had been appointed a special advisor to the [[Cambodia]]n government and [[Hun Sen]] and stated that Cambodia would refuse to extradite Thaksin because it considered him a victim of political persecution.

On 5 November 2009, both countries recalled their ambassadors.&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai envoy recalled from Cambodia |url=
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8343703.stm|date=5 November 2009 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] stated this was "the first diplomatic retaliation measure".&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt; Stating Cambodia was interfering in Thailand's internal affairs and as a result all bi-lateral co-operation agreements would be reviewed.&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 5-11-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etaiwan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Recall of envoys escalates Thai-Cambodian tensions |url=

===="Spy" controversy====
On 11 November 2009, [[Sivarak Chutipong]] was arrested by Cambodian police for passing the confidential flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia Air Traffic Service, the private firm which manages [[air traffic control]] in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009111329536/Online-Edition/thai-national-arrested-for-espionage.html|title=Search|work=Phnom Penh Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phnompenhpost.com"/&gt; Sivarak denied that he was a spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct on the part of the First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/29256/irate-sivarak-demands-answers|title=Irate Sivarak demands answers - Bangkok Post: news|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sivarak's mother appeared often on Thai television, pleading for the government to assist her son.

Sivarak was later sentenced to jail for 7 years. Thaksin personally requested the Cambodian government to pardon Sivarak, and he was soon pardoned by King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] and expatriated. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban later accused Sivarak of staging his own arrest in order to discredit the Abhisit government.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/162987/sivarak-mum-may-sue-suthep Sivarak's mum threatens to sue Suthep], 17 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Former Thai spy chief and Foreign Minister [[Prasong Soonsiri]] concurred, claiming, "It has been a set-up from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|title=Mother justifies seeking royal pardon for her son|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004136/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2009/12/10/politics/politics_30118266.php|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frozen asset seizure===

====Prior to the verdict====
On 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court was scheduled to render its verdict on whether to seize his family's Thai assets, worth 76&amp;nbsp;billion baht frozen by the AEC after the coup. The AEC froze the assets under the authority of Announcement No. 30 of the military junta.&lt;ref name="AECrationaleforfreeze"/&gt; Tensions ran high through Thailand, tens of thousands of government security forces were deployed, particularly in routes leading to Bangkok. However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/32952/security-forces-ready-for-action Security forces ready for action], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/168673/udd-won-t-rally-on-feb-26 UDD won't rally on 26 February], 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption. Policy corruption, was defined by the court as the abuse of powers by implementing economic policies that, while in themselves legal and of potential benefit to society and the economy, also aided companies that were owned in part by the policy maker.&lt;ref name="PolicyCorruption" /&gt; The prosecution claimed that Thaksin abused his powers five times while Premier.

[[File:Judgment-of-the-Supreme-Court-of-Thailand-26022010-firstlastpages.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The first and last pages of the verdict with the signatures of the nine supreme court judges]]

====The verdict====
The court first ruled that Thaksin and Potjaman were the real owners of the assets, rather than his children and relatives. The court also ruled that it had the authority to seize assets, based on the announcements of the junta. The court found Thaksin guilty of four out of five policy corruption, and ordered that 46&amp;nbsp;billion baht be seized. The remaining 30&amp;nbsp;billion continued to remain frozen.
* Count 1: Conversion of telecom concession fees into excise charges. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT/CAT a percentage of their revenue as a concession fee (TOT/CAT are state-owned enterprises, although they were going through the process of privatisation). The Thaksin government modified this into a system wherein all operators would instead directly pay the government an equivalent excise tax. The imposition of excise tax here would eventually be passed on to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|title=Telecom laws were manipulated to benefit Shin Corp subsidiary AIS, says court|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004210/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Telecom-laws-were-manipulated-to-benefit-Shin-Corp-30123620.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaksin claimed that all operators continued to pay the same total costs. The judges ruled that this benefited AIS while harming the TOT, and thus was an abuse of power.
* Count 2: Modification of a revenue sharing agreement on pre-paid mobile services. Previously, telecom operators had to pay the TOT a percentage of their revenues for post-paid mobile services. To offer pre-paid services, which are generally cost less to the consumer, AIS negotiated with TOT to design a revenue sharing agreement for pre-paid services that offered less revenue to the TOT comprising an estimated loss of 14.2&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 25% to 20%) from 2001 to 2006 and another estimated loss of 56&amp;nbsp;billion baht (revenue reduced from 30% to 20%) from 2006 to 2015.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|title=Minefield of criminal cases awaits Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302143058/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/28/politics/Minefield-of-criminal-cases-awaits-Thaksin-30123621.html|archivedate=2 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges ruled that the terms of the pre-paid agreement harmed TOT while benefiting AIS. The judges did not dispute the fact that TOT's total revenue actually increased substantially as a result of the agreement, but noted that the rise in pre-paid revenue came about while harming TOT's post-paid revenue. The massive growth in Thai mobile penetration from 13% in 2001 to 80% in 2007, due almost completely to pre-paid services, and the reduction in AIS market share from 68% to 53% in the same period were not taken into account by the court.
* Count 3: Modification of mobile roaming agreement. Previously, there were no roaming agreements between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator were not allowed to use services on another operator's network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its subscribers roaming on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT's income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS's new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.
* Count 4: Replacement of [[ThaiCom 4]] with [[iPSTAR]]. A previous government had originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 as a backup satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, at the time the largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as [[ThaiCom 3]]. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's communications security by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.
* Count 5: EXIM Bank loan to Myanmar to pay for ThaiCom services. Thaksin was scheduled to meet with Burmese leaders to negotiate trade deals between the two countries. One of the deals negotiated gave Myanmar a Thai EXIM Bank loan to purchase 376&amp;nbsp;million baht in satellite services from ShinSat. Thaksin noted that many deals were struck in the negotiations, and that 16 other companies also benefited from the EXIM Bank's loans. The judges ruled that the loans gave preferential treatment to Thaksin, and hence were an abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|title=Thaksin guilty,  Bt46 bn seized, Bt30 bn returned|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301054928/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/26/politics/Timeline-on-Thaksins-Judgement-Day-30123503.html|archivedate=1 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225032201/http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-02-25|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=thaksinlive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges decided to seize 46&amp;nbsp;billion differences in value of Shin Corp. shares from the date when he came to office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8&amp;nbsp;billion to 9&amp;nbsp;billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while [[Siam Cement]], one of Thailand's premier blue chip companies, gained 717%.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704625004575088720584763744?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories, Thai Court Rules to Seize $1.4&amp;nbsp;Billion From Thaksin], 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100&amp;nbsp;billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmultimedia.com%252Foption%252Fprint.php%253Fnewsid%253D30118020&amp;h=7fa87f0939dbf3b20d395d4dea9a35be&amp;ref=mf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
In an email to his supporters, Thaksin claimed that the court was used as a tool. He also noted how the Thai stock market rose to the benefit of many companies, not just his, and claimed that all charges against him were politically motivated. He thanked his supporters for not protesting while the verdict was being read, and implored them to use non-violent means in the future. Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It&amp;039;s-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|title=It's my money : Pojaman|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225141212/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/02/10/politics/It%26039%3Bs-my-money-Pojaman-30122199.html|archivedate=25 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Pojaman's claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company's account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|title=How evidence trapped Thaksin|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617004539/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/06/opinion/How-evidence-trapped-Thaksin-30124060.html|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some UDD members held a small protest in front of the court, but did not disrupt the ruling as the government had predicted they would. The UDD leaders announced that a large-scale protest was scheduled to be held on 14 March 2010.

On the evening of 27 February (Saturday of a 3-day holiday), [[M67 grenade]]s were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of [[Bangkok Bank]]. Nobody was hurt or injured in the attacks. The perpetrators were not caught, and no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks. Thaksin and the UDD were quick to deny any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303045519/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/PM-pleads-for-public-calm-following-several-Bangko-30123642.html |archivedate=3 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }} PM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170009/stringent-security-measures-invoked Stringent security measures invoked], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170025/udd-denies-link-in-bomb-attacks UDD denies link in bomb attacks], 28 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An arrest warrant was issued based on sketches of a motorcycle driver.&lt;ref&gt;Bangkok Post, [http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/170129/warrant-issued-for-bomb-suspect Warrant issued for bomb suspect], 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfer of Shin Corp. Shares===
The laws does not allow the prime minister to run a side business while holding office. Thaksin was pressed charged on wealth concealment while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20091221-187194.html|title=Thaksin assets case verdict due in January|work=asiaone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-Pu-Z/Shinawatra-Thaksin.html|title=Thaksin Shinawatra|work=notablebiographies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the wealth declaration of Thaksin and his family when he took office, there has been an appeal to The National Anti-Corruption Commission that there are some suspicions about the numbers in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokbiznews.com/home/detail/politics/opinion/sarinee-achavanuntak/20100305/103531/%E0%B8%8B%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99-301-:-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C-%E0%B8%9E.%E0%B8%95.%E0%B8%97.%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%93-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3-(1).html|title=กรุงเทพธุรกิจ - เกี่ยวกับกรุงเทพธุรกิจออนไลน์|work=www.bangkokbiznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring to maid and driver====
Thaksin was charged with illegally concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of [[Shin Corporation|Shin Corp.]] shares to his drivers and maids, without their knowledge. Thaksin tearfully told the Constitutional Court that it was an honest mistake before the Court acquitted him on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|title=Thaksin court drama grips Bangkok|work=CNN Travel|access-date=27 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504192344/http://www.cnngo.com/bangkok/none/thaksins-political-roller-coaster-887576|archive-date=4 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transferring shares to children who reached maturity====
There was also a controversy over whether there was any hidden tax evasion when Thaksin and Potjaman transferred their Shin Corporation shares to their children. [[Panthongtae Shinawatra|Panthongtae]] and Pinthongta Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parent.

The transfer of shares from Thaksin and Potjaman to Parnthongtae was claimed to have been a sham, since there was no actual transfer of money. Panthongtae said the shares were sold to him at cost. Thaksin stated he had a written agreement proving the transfer to his son. Prior to the transfer, Panthongtae had signed an agreement with his father to settle a 4.5 billion baht debt from buying 300 million shares of the [[TMB Bank|Thai Military Bank]] (TMB). However, the actual market value of the TMB shares at that time was only 1.5 billion baht. This showed a "fake debt" of 3 billion baht had been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|title=Door now open for more agencies to reclaim their money|work=nationmultimedia.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304132514/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/01/columnists/Door-now-open-for-more-agencies-to-reclaim-their-m-30123674.html|archivedate=4 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assets Examination Committee (Thailand)|The Assets Examination Committee]] (AEC) discovered that Panthongtae's account that receives Shin Corporation's dividend has been used to transfer money to Potjaman's account to the amount of 1.1 billion baht.

Pintongtha also was accused of being nominee for her parents. She said that the money from her mother was a "birthday present". This birthday present was used to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corporation, which leaves her brother with the same amount. The AEC found the account has been receiving dividends from Shin Corp. There were no transactions between Pintongtha's account and her mother's account. However, the dividend money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark to the amount of 71 million baht and shares from 5 real-estate firms from 2 funds in 2004 worth of 485 million baht.

DSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that both WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and his former wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Potjaman insists family assets of B76bn were legally earned |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/23916/potjaman-insists-family-assets-of-b76bn-were-legally-earned |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Soviet Union}}

The '''Treaty on the Creation of the USSR''' officially created the '''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics''' ('''USSR'''), commonly known as the '''[[Soviet Union]]'''. It ''[[de jure]]'' legalised a [[Political union|union]] of several [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]]s that had existed since 1919 and created a new [[Centralization|centralised]]  [[Federalism|federal government]] ([[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] and [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] (TsIK) were the legislative while [[Council of People's Commissars]] was the executive) where key functions were centralised in [[Moscow]].

The Treaty along with the [[Declaration of the Creation of the USSR]] was approved on December 29, 1922 by a conference of delegations from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]. The Treaty and the Declaration were confirmed by the 1st [[Congress of Soviets]] of the USSR and signed by heads of delegations&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://region.adm.nov.ru/pressa.nsf/0c7534916fcf6028c3256b3700243eac/4302e4941fb6a6bfc3256c99004faea5!OpenDocument Voted Unanimously for the Union] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204132112/http://region.adm.nov.ru/pressa.nsf/0c7534916fcf6028c3256b3700243eac/4302e4941fb6a6bfc3256c99004faea5%21OpenDocument |date=2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{spaced ndash}} [[Mikhail Kalinin]], [[Mikhail Tskhakaya]], [[Mikhail Frunze]] and [[Grigory Petrovsky]], [[Aleksandr Chervyakov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.hronos.km.ru/sobyt/cccp.html Creation of the USSR] at Khronos.ru&lt;/ref&gt; respectively on  December 30, 1922. The treaty provided flexibility to admit new members. Therefore, by 1940 the Soviet Union grew from the founding four republics to [[republics of the Soviet Union|15 republics]].

On 8 December 1991, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian Presidents signed the [[Belavezha Accords]]. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (denunciation of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. On 10 December, the accord was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Belarusian]] parliaments. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Russian Parliament]], therefore the Russian SFSR renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and [[de facto]] declared Russia's independence from the USSR.

On 26 December 1991, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR was self-dissolved]] by the [[Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|''Council of the Republics'' of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], the [[Upper house|first house]] of [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet legislature]] (the [[Lower house|second house]], the ''[[Council of the Union]]'', was without a quorum).

== Causes of the treaty ==
The Treaty was a result of many internal political conflicts within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] and governments inside the Union. Initially [[Vladimir Lenin]] did not see that Russia's [[October Revolution]] would end all foreign borders as such. This view was supported by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers, who believed that Russia was only a first step in a future [[world revolution]]. However, as the [[Red Army]] approached former internal national and foreign borders, it needed an excuse to cross them. One such method was a creation of an alternative government, a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]], that would then take over authority as the Red Army ousted the existing government. This was the case with [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukraine]], [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|Armenia and Azerbaijan]] and failed campaigns such as in the Baltic States and [[Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee|Poland]]. Alternatively it would use the presence of a minority to undermine the standing army (such as the establishment [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar]] and [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkir]] autonomies), and where there was no national minority, a government based on geographical locale – [[Far Eastern Republic]], [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].

However, the [[Red Army]]'s ultimate failure in the [[Polish–Soviet War|Polish campaign]] placed Trotsky's World Revolution plans on hold. Simultaneously the [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|growing figure]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] pursued a different [[Socialism in One Country|agenda]]. Lenin himself saw the creation of national republics as a permanent feature in line with his ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policies. In spring of 1922, Lenin suffered his first stroke, and Stalin, still being a [[People's Commissariat for Nationalities|People's Commissar for Nationalities]] gained a new official chair as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].

Stalin argued that now that the [[Russian Civil War]] had concluded and that [[war communism]] was now replaced by the [[New Economic Policy]], it required a country whose legal ''[[de jure]]'' framework would match its ''[[de facto]]'' one, and re-organising the Bolshevik state into a single sovereign entity. This included liquidating the many splinter Soviet governments and restoring supreme rule to Moscow.

This line went directly in conflict with both proponents of ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' and some of the local governments, most notably in Ukraine (opposition of [[Christian Rakovsky]]) and Georgia ([[Georgian Affair]]). Thus the treaty can be viewed as a compromise between the different groups within the Bolshevik camp, to satisfy the aspirations of large minorities (the named examples of Georgia and Ukraine) and to allow for potential expansion, as well. Byelorussia was the smallest republic, yet its official languages included [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] in addition to Russian and Belarusian to undermine the authority of the neighbouring [[Second Polish Republic]] and to use its sizeable Jewish minority, as well as the [[Western Belarus|Belarusians]] and [[Western Ukraine|Ukrainians in Poland]] as a future [[fifth column]]. At the same time, it created a new centralised federal government where key functions would clearly be in the hands of Moscow.

== Content ==
[[File:Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR-1922-page3.jpg|thumb|Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, 1922, page 3 (with signatures)]]

The original document included a cover sheet, the declaration, the treaty (containing the preface and 26 articles) and the signatures of the delegations that signed it.

In the '''cover sheet''', the title ''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' was typed in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], as well as the actual words ''Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' also in those four languages. It contained the original [[state emblem of the Soviet Union]].

The '''[[Declaration of the Creation of the USSR|declaration]]''' was written as a reflection on contemporary [[international relations]] and why the treaty was necessary. According to the narrative, there are now two distinct camps, an "exploiting" [[capitalism|capitalist]] with [[colonialism]], [[chauvinism]] and [[social inequality|social]] and [[discrimination|ethnic]] inequalities and a "free" [[socialism|socialist]] one with mutual trust, peace and international cooperation and solidarity. The former sought to destroy the latter, but because of the common good that the latter is based on, the former has [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|failed]].

The declaration goes on and lists three factors as to why this Union is a necessary step. First of all, the aftermath of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] left many of the republics' economies destroyed, and rebuilding in the new socialist fashion is proving difficult without closer economic cooperation. Secondly, foreign threats continue to loom over the socialist camp, and its sovereignty requires an alliance for defence. Finally, the ideological factor, that the Soviet rule is [[Communist International|international]]ist in nature and pushes the [[working class|working masses]] to unite in a single socialist family. These three factors justify in uniting in a single state that would guarantee prosperity, security and development.

Finally the declaration then specifies that the resultant Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is one that is created on free will of the peoples, that its purpose follows the ideals of the [[October Revolution]], that each and every socialist republic has the right to join and leave the Union at its own will, and hinting at the Soviet foreign policy of socialist [[irredentism]] (see [[World revolution]]), finishes stating that the treaty ''...will serve a decisive step on the path of unification of all workers into a "World Socialist Soviet Republic".''

Following the declaration, is the '''treaty''' itself consisting of a preface and 26 articles.

*In the '''preface''' it is fixed that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic]], the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic]] and the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (containing [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]]) acting in free will, agree to form a single '''[[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]''', that is governed on articles listed in the treaty.
*'''Article 1''' lists the competency of the responsibilities that the Union's authorities would contain. These include all foreign affairs; international treaties; change in external borders; expansion of the Union by accepting new republics; declaring war and agreeing to peace; foreign and domestic trade; authority over economic development; creating a single postal and transport services; the armed forces; internal migration; creation of single judiciary, education and healthcare services as well as unifying all units of measurement. All of the above would be thus explicitly controlled directly by the Union's authority. Moreover, the final clause explicitly listed, that the Union's authorities could now overturn acts of all Republics' authorities (be it Congresses of Soviets, Soviets of People's Commissars or Central Executive Committees) that were deemed in violation with regard to this Treaty.
*'''Articles 2–10''' determined the structure of supreme authorities of the Union. The [[legislature|legislative authority]], according to the treaty, was the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] and between the congresses, this was to be carried out by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] (TsIK) (2). The delegates to the Congress are to be elected by local Soviets represented by one elected representative from 25,000 voters in urban areas and one per 125,000 voters in rural areas (3). The Congress delegates would be elected by local [[Guberniya]] Soviets, rather than Republican ones (4). The congresses would be held annually or may be summoned by requests of at least two Republics' or the Union's TsIK (5). The TsIK would be the main body to carry out executive functions between the congresses. This TsiK was a 371-person body, whose members were proportionally represented to the population of the Union, and elected by the Congress (6). The Union TsIK would meet four times per annum on a regular basis, whilst irregular sessions can be summoned on demand by the Union government (the [[Council of People's Commissars]]) or by one of the constituent Republics (7). The Congress and the TsIK would be held in the capitals of the Union Republics in the order that would be decided by TsIK's Presidium (8). The latter was to be appointed by TsIK, that would be the supreme power organ between its sessions (9). This Presidium would consist of nineteen members, with four chairmen, each representing the four republics (10). The Presidium also had the authority to summon an irregular session of TsIK.
*'''Article 11''' appointed the [[executive (government)|executive authority]], the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK). The council's members were appointed by TsIK, and included ten [[ministry (government department)|portfolios]] (commissariats) as well as a chairmen and his deputies.
*'''Article 12''' specified the functions of the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] (under control of TsIK) and the secret police, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (under control of the SNK, and the OGPU chairman was to be a participant of the SNK with advisory vote). The creation of these two bodies was justified as ''measures to overcome criminal and counter-revolutionary elements'' in that very article.
*'''Articles 13–17''' specified the framework on the legal proceedings between the Union's supreme bodies (the TsIK and the SNK) and those of each republic. All of the decrees by Union's SNK were effective in every republic (13). Also confirmed, was the multilingual aspect of the Union, specifying that all of the Union's decrees are to printed in the official language of each constituent republic ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and ''[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]'' (i.e. [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]])) (14). It was specified that the Union's SNK resolution may only be overruled by the Union's TsIK or its Presidium (16), and if a republican TsIK chooses to protest the resolution or a decree of the Union's TsIK, the protest itself does not halt the implementation of the document (15). The latter is only possible if there are obvious violations with existing laws, and in such cases, the republic must immediately notify the Union's SNK and the relevant commissariat (17).
*'''Article 18''' listed the authorities that would be retained by the Republics and specified their respective Councils of People's Commissars, each to have a chairmen, his deputies, eleven portfolios and [[plenipotentiary|representatives]] with advisory votes of several Union-level commissariats, in particular foreign affairs, defence, foreign trade, transport and logistics.
*At the same time '''article 19''' specified that republican-level organs, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] (whose chairman was to also have a full seat in the relevant republican SNK), the commissariats for food supply, finance and labour, as well as the Soviet inspection (the [[Rabkrin]]) though subjugated to the Republican authorities, their activities were to be regulated by the Union's TsIK.
*'''Article 20''' discussed that the [[government budget|budget]]s of the Republics would form the Union's budget and that all expenses and spendings by the Republics would be determined by the Union's TsIK. Moreover, the latter would also determine the share of profits, if any, that each Republic would receive.
*'''Articles 21–23''' created a single [[Soviet people|Soviet citizenship]] (21), state symbolism ([[Flag of the Soviet Union|flag]], [[The Internationale#Russian lyrics|national anthem]] and a [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|coat of arms]] – 22), and specified the Union's capital in [[Moscow]] (23).
*'''Article 24''' demanded that the republics amended their constitutions with regard to the treaty.
*'''Article 25''' specified that any amendments, additions or changes to the treaty may be done only by the Union's [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]].
*'''Article 26''' affirmed the clause in the declaration where each republic has the right to leave the Union.

==Immediate aftermath==

===Politics===
Initially, the treaty did little to alter the major political spectrum. Most of the governing positions of the RSFSR's supreme organs were automatically transferred to the USSR's. For example, the Chairman of the All-Union Central Executive Committee (TsIK) was taken by [[Mikhail Kalinin]], who would retain his chair as Russia's TsIK. Likewise, Lenin's position as chairman of RSFSR's [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK), which he held since the Revolution, would now to be transformed as the Chairman of the Union's SNK. However, as Lenin remained ill from the stroke, both of his chairs would be occupied by [[Alexei Rykov]] as acting head of the government.

[[Joseph Stalin]]'s position as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] was also unchanged. However, the Party's position was. Prior to the treaty the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RKP(b)), had its own bureaus which oversaw the activities in distant regions (e.g. Turkestani bureau, Transcaucasian bureau, etc.). After the Treaty, the party was re-organized as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b) – V for Vsesoyuznaya, the All-Union). Whilst the Republic's parties remained, Russia's party not only retained its ''[[primus inter pares]]'' position but officially took over as a supreme authority in the USSR.

===Central Asia===
One area where the Soviet division of power was not resolved at the time of the Treaty's signing, was [[Soviet Central Asia]] which contained several problems. A major battleground during the [[Russian Civil War]], the region would remain unstable afterward. [[Turkestan]] came under [[Russian Turkestan|Russian control]] fairly recently, between 1867 and 1885. Moreover, unlike other ethnic borders of the former [[Russian Empire]], which were delimited during the Tsarist days (e.g. [[Transcaucasia]] lost its feudal administration by the mid-19th century), the Soviet authorities inherited two provinces that were ''de jure'' never part of Russia proper, the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. During the Russian Civil War, these too shared the fate of the other republics, but even here their special status was preserved, and they were established as the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukharan]] and [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm ''People's'' Soviet Republics]]. Despite [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s victories, the conflict was ongoing and whole provinces were under control of the [[Basmachi movement]] in 1922.

To settle this issue, in line with the ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policy a massive programme of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation in Central Asia]] was undertaken. On October 27, 1924, TsIK issued a decree where the former Bukharan, Khivan People's Republics as well as the RSFSR's [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]] were re-organized as the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] and the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen SSR]], both of whom became full Union Republics on 13 May 1925. The borders of the new republics matched the ethnic ones, and Uzbekistan initially also contained a newly formed [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which would be elevated to a full Union Republic on October 16, 1929, becoming the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]].

===Soviet Constitution===
{{main article|1924 Soviet Constitution}}
In January 1924, the Second [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]], that was called in accordance to the Treaty ratified the first [[1924 Soviet Constitution]]. The Constitution's text is essentially the re-written and expanded Treaty. It even contains the same Declaration. Whereas the Treaty contained 26 articles, the Constitution is split into eleven chapters containing 72 articles.

==Aftermath and legality==
Some experts argue that the original ''Union'' of Soviet Socialist Republics, ceased to exist as such, upon the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] on 5 December 1936 which greatly altered the internal arrangement and re-organised the USSR from a Union-based [[confederation]], into a proper federal country. Instead of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]], the new Constitution created a permanent parliament, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]. It also tied together most of the authorities and most significantly affirmed the role of the Communist Party as the ''driving force'' behind the USSR's working masses.

With regard to the original Treaty, the adoption of the Constitution re-organised the make-up of the Union. The Transcaucasian SFSR ceased to exist and the three republics that made it up were fully admitted to the Union. Simultaneously two of RSFSR's autonomies, the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazak]] and the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz ASSR]]s were re-organised as full republics. Therefore, the seven became the eleven.

The Transcaucasian SFSR existed until December 5, 1936, when it was broken into [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani]] SSRs. The same day [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] of the RSFSR ceased to exist, and its territory was divided between the new Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs.

== 1940 ==
In a prelude to [[World War II]], several new republics were created prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of USSR in 1941]]. The first was the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]], which on 31 March 1940 was elevated to a union republic from the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]], previously part of the RSFSR.

After the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|annexation of Baltic states]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] were transformed into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] (July 13), [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] (July 21) and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] (also July 21), and were formally adjoined to the Soviet Union on 3, 5 and 6 August respectively. The final republic was the [[Moldovian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian SSR]] that merged the large territory of [[Bessarabia]] with the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian ASSR]] previously part of the Ukrainian SSR.

After World War II, no new republics were established, instead, the Karello-Finnish SSR was downgraded into an autonomous republic and re-annexed by the RSFSR on July 16, 1956.

==Annulment==
On December 8, 1991, the leaders of the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs, and the RSFSR met [[Belavezha Accords|to agree on the annulment of the 1922 treaty]], which was terminated on December 25, 1991, effectively [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving the USSR]].

On March 15, 1996, the [[State Duma]] of the Russian Federation expressed its legal position in relation to the decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]] in "The denunciation of the Treaty establishing the Soviet Union" as the wrongful, unconstitutional act passed by a grave violation of the Constitution of the RSFSR, the norms of international law and then in force legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&amp;code=34000&amp;rdk=0&amp;nv=0 ПОСТАНОВЛЕНИЕ ГОСУДАРСТВЕННОЙ ДУМЫ ФЕДЕРАЛЬНОГО СОБРАНИЯ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417152935/http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&amp;code=34000&amp;rdk=0&amp;nv=0 |date=2011-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union Peace Conference - 21st Century Panglong''' ({{lang-my|ပြည်ထောင်စု ငြိမ်းချမ်းရေးညီလာခံ (၂၁) ရာစု ပင်လုံ}}) was a peace conference held from 31 August to 4 September 2016 at the Myanmar Convention Centre 2 in [[Naypyidaw]], [[Myanmar]] (Burma).

The first [[Panglong Conference]] was held in the [[Panglong, Southern Shan State|Panglong]] region of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] in 1947, and was negotiated between [[Aung San]] and ethnic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmars-panglong-peace-conference-to-include-all-armed-ethnic-groups-07052016152026.html|title=Myanmar’s Panglong Peace Conference to Include All Armed Ethnic Groups|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several meetings between ethnic [[List of insurgent groups in Myanmar|insurgent groups]] and the government prior to the Panglong Conference in 2016, it is unclear how many of them will actually attend.

Eighteen ethnic insurgent groups were expected to attend the conference, whilst three ethnic insurgent groups (The [[Arakan Army (Kachin State)|Arakan Army]], the [[Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army]], and the [[Ta'ang National Liberation Army]]) were not expected to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-peace-talks-seek-to-defy-weight-of-history-1472420156|title=Myanmar Peace Talks Seek to Defy Weight of History|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], also attended the opening ceremony. The [[United Wa State Army]] left the conference early, saying they were only permitted observer status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://burmese.dvb.no/archives/166520|title=တန္းတူညီမွ်မရွိသည့္အတြက္ ‘၀’ကိုယ္စားလွယ္မ်ား ၂၁ ရာစုပင္လံုညီလာခံမွ ထြက္ခြာ|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government planned to hold similar conferences semiannually until a permanent ceasefire and peace agreement was drafted; however, only signatories of the [[Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement]] (NCA) would be able to attend (though this requirement was later scrapped).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/myanmar-peace-summit-ends-long-road-ahead-084102914.html|title=Myanmar peace summit ends with long road ahead|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was chaired by Lt. Gen. Yar Pyae from the [[Tatmadaw]], [[Tin Myo Win]] from the union government, Shila Nan Taung from the [[Assembly of the Union|parliament]], Khun Myint Tun from the ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and Myint Soe from the political parties. The EAOs called for a federal system that "guarantees justice, equality, self-administration and protection of racial, religious and political rights of ethnic minorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/myanmarnewspaper/docs/4_sept_16_gnlm|title=21 Century Panglong Conference concluded successfully|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=kZYceWZ65wCScfRpVbUHnsQHu5f8VhTnkd7|title=၂၁ရာစုပင္လံုညီလာခံ စာတမ္းမ်ား|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Kingdom government austerity programme''' is a [[fiscal policy]] adopted in the early 21st century following the [[Great Recession]]. It is a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending and tax rises, intended to reduce the [[government budget deficit]] and the role of the [[welfare state in the United Kingdom]]. The [[National Health Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS funding protected?|url=http://www.nhscampaign.org/NHS-reforms/no-cuts-to-nhs-budget.html|publisher=NHS Support Federation|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School spending stays protected from budget cuts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-23063018|publisher=BBC News|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been "[[Ringfencing|ringfenced]]" and protected from direct spending cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22363650 |title=Should NHS budget be ring-fenced?|publisher=BBC News|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[#Effects|effects]] of United Kingdom [[austerity]] policies have proved [[#Reaction|controversial]] and the policies have received criticism from a variety of politicians and economists.

==History==
A UK government [[budget surplus]] in 2001–2 was followed by many years of [[budget deficit]]&lt;ref name=Partington&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Guardian|title=UK government deficit widens unexpectedly in August|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/21/uk-government-deficit-widens-for-first-time-in-three-years|author=Richard Partington |date=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] a period of economic [[recession]] began in the country. The first austerity measures were introduced in late 2008.&lt;ref name=Nevin&gt;{{cite web|title=Austerity in Northern Ireland.

In his keynote speech to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] forum in [[Cheltenham]] on 26 April 2009 he declared that "the age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity" and committed to end years of what he characterised as excessive government spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Austerity to Inequality|url=http://www.nicva.org/article/austerity-inequality|publisher=NICVA|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Deborah Summers |title= David Cameron warns of 'new age of austerity'

In his [[June 2010 United Kingdom budget|June 2010 budget]] speech, the Chancellor [[George Osborne]] identified two goals. The first was that the structural current budget deficit would be eliminated to "achieve [a] cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling, five-year forecast period". The second was that [[Government debt|national debt]] as a percentage of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] would be falling. The government intended to achieve both of its goals through substantial reductions in public expenditure.&lt;ref name=Nevin/&gt; This was to be achieved by a combination of public spending reductions and tax increases amounting to £110 billion.&lt;ref name=Chu&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ben Chu |date=6 July 2017 |title=Austerity: Is it really over? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/austerity-end-over-tories-pay-cap-what-is-it-over-public-spending-explained-a7825726.html |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the forecast period was 2015–16.

Between 2010 and 2013, the [[Cameron-Clegg coalition|Coalition government]] said that it had reduced public spending by £14.3 billion compared with 2009–10.&lt;ref name=Merrick&gt;{{cite news|title=Chancellor Philip Hammond accused of more 'failed austerity' after demanding extra spending cuts before the election|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chancellor-philip-hammond-latest-budget-spending-cuts-austerity-social-care-john-mcdonnell-a7603096.html|author=Rob Merrick|date=28 February 2017|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth remained low during this period, while unemployment rose.&lt;ref name=Chu/&gt; In a speech in 2013, David Cameron indicated that his government had no intention of increasing public spending once the structural deficit had been eliminated and proposed that the public spending reduction be made permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Cameron makes leaner state a permanent goal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/11/david-cameron-policy-shift-leaner-efficient-state|date=12 November 2013|author=Nicholas Watt|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] extended the proposed austerity period until at least 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Kirkup|title=George Osborne to cut taxes by extending austerity and creating smaller state|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/10552454/George-Osborne-to-cut-taxes-by-extending-austerity-and-creating-smaller-state.html|date=5 January 2014|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the deficit, as a percentage of GDP, had been reduced to half of what it was in 2010, and the sale of government assets (mostly the shares of banks nationalised in the 2000s) had resulted in government debt as a proportion of GDP falling.&lt;ref name=Nevin/&gt; By 2016, the Chancellor was aiming to deliver a budget surplus by 2020, but following the result of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]], he expressed the opinion that this goal was no longer achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe May Finally End Its Painful Embrace of Austerity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/business/international/europe-economy-budget-austerity.html|author=Peter S.

Osborne's successor as Chancellor, [[Philip Hammond]], retained the aim of a balanced budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Hammond to ditch George Osborne's economic targets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/03/philip-hammond-to-set-out-his-stall-for-balanced-budget-at-tory-conference|date=3 October 2016|author1=Peter Walker|author2=Rowena Mason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned plans to eliminate the deficit by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Hammond warns Britain's economy heading for post-Brexit 'rollercoaster' ride as he drops pledge for budget surplus by 2020|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/03/philip-hammond-budget-surplus-conservative-conference-live/|date=3 October 2016|author= Michael Wilkinson|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hammond's first Autumn statement in 2016, there was no mention of austerity, and some commentators concluded that the austerity programme had ended.&lt;ref name=Chalk&gt;{{cite news|title=Whatever happened to austerity?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/38092467/whatever-happened-to-austerity|date=24 November 2016|author=Will Chalk|work=BBC Newsbeat|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSE&gt;{{cite web|title=How does austerity look in retrospect?

This fulfilled one of the fiscal targets set by George Osborne in 2010, which he had hoped to achieve in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/03/01/back-black-uk-current-budget-surplus-imf-says-osborne-right/|title=Back in black: UK in current budget surplus as IMF says Osborne was right to cut spending|last=Wallace|first=Tim|date=1 March 2018|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=16 June 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Office for Budget Responsibility]] (OBR) predicted that in 2018–19 public sector debt would fall as a share of national income for the first time since 2001–02, while tax revenues would exceed public spending. Hammond's 2018 [[Spring Statement]] suggested that austerity measures could be reduced in the [[Budget of the United Kingdom|Autumn Budget]] of that year. However, according to the [[Resolution Foundation]] and the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] (IFS), the OBR's forecasts for borrowing and debt were based on the assumption that the government continued with the planned spending reductions that were announced after the 2015 general election. By 2018 only 25% of the proposed reductions in welfare spending had been implemented. The Resolution Foundation calculated that the proposed reduction in spending on working-age benefits amounted to £2.5 billion in 2018–19 and £2.7 billion in 2019–20, with the households most affected being the poorest 20%. The IFS calculated that the OBR's figures would require spending on public services per person in real terms to be 2% lower in 2022–23 than in 2019–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=UK will struggle to ease austerity in coming months, think-tanks warn|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b498f1fc-278f-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0|newspaper=Financial Times|author=Gemma Tetlow|date=14 March 2018|access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit in the first quarter of the 2018–19 financial year was lower than at any time since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=UK deficit at lowest level since before financial crisis|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3b46d9dc-8bf7-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340|newspaper=Financial Times|author=Chris Giles|date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 2018 it had reached the lowest level since 2002–3. Hammond's aim at this time was to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s.&lt;ref name=Partington/&gt; At the Conservative Party conference in October 2018 Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] indicated her intention to end the austerity programme following [[Brexit]] in 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Theresa May pledges end to austerity in Tory conference speech|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-conference-speech-ambasts-labour-as-she-calls-for-tory-unity|author=Heather Stewart|date=3 October 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposition leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said that austerity could not be ended without significant increases in public spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/10/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-claim-austerity-is-over-is-great-big-conservative-con-pmqs|title=Jeremy Corbyn: claim austerity is over is 'big Conservative con'|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Peter Walker|date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IFS calculated that funding an end to austerity would require an additional £19 billion per year raised through higher government borrowing or tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hammond’s £19bn bill to 'end austerity'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45863582|work=BBC News|date=16 October 2018|author=Kamal Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond's preference was to reduce the national debt with more years of austerity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Philip Hammond: party must offer solutions to Labour questions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/philip-hammond-vows-to-stick-with-austerity-in-conference-speech-amazon-google|author1=Phillip Inman|author2=Larry Elliott|date=1 October 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the October 2018 budget he agreed to defer the target date for eliminating the deficit, abandoning plans to achieve a surplus in 2022–23 to allow an increase in health spending and tax cuts. The [[Resolution Foundation]] described the step as a "significant easing of austerity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Financial times|title=Hammond defends decision to delay balancing books|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0366271c-dc0f-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c|author1=Jim Pickard|author2=George Parker|date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond said that the "era of austerity is finally coming to an end"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Budget 2018: Austerity finally coming to an end, says Hammond|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46010550|date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that there would be no "real terms" increase in public spending apart from on the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hammond v McDonnell on Budget 'end of austerity' claim|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46024014|work=BBC News|date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The austerity programme included reductions in welfare spending, the cancellation of school building programs, reductions in [[local government]] funding, and an increase in [[Value-added tax (United Kingdom)|VAT]].&lt;ref name=Chu/&gt; A  number of [[quango]]s were abolished, merged or reduced as a result of the [[2010 UK quango reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Bonfire of the quangos’ revealed|url=https://www.channel4.com/news/bonfire-of-the-quangos-promised|work=Channel 4 News|date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
A number of independent reports have considered the demographic effects of the austerity programme. In 2011, activist collective [[Feminist Fightback]] described its gendered impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feminist|first1=Fightack|title=Cuts Are a Feminist Issue|journal=Soundings Journal|date=15 December 2011|volume=Issue 49|issue= 49|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/cuts_are_a_feminist_issue|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012 the [[Fawcett Society]] published a report which was critical of the Treasury for not assessing the impact of austerity on women's equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of Austerity on Women|url=http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Impact-of-Austerity-on-Women-19th-March-2012.pdf|website=The Fawcett Society|publisher=The Fawcett Society|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report by the [[Resolution Foundation]] identified age-related disparities in the effects of austerity changes. The report projected that during the 2010s transfers to local authorities would fall by 64% and that spending on working-age welfare would fall by 71%, while between 1997 and 2020 spending on older people and health would rise from 33.8% to 43.4% of total government spending. In the same year a group of political scientists at the [[University of Nottingham]] found that the impact of austerity on in-work benefits and housing policy had been harmful to working families with children, while wealthy pensioners and older homeowners had benefited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New research shows austerity is favouring older voters at the expense of the young|website=The Intergenerational Foundation|url = http://www.if.org.uk/archives/7348/new-research-shows-austerity-is-favouring-older-voters-at-the-expense-of-the-young|author=David Kingman|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 research from the Women's Budget Group and the [[Runnymede Trust]] indicated that women, people of colour and in particular women of colour had been affected most by austerity, and that they would continue to be affected disproportionately until 2020. This was due to the fact that black and Asian women were more likely to be employed in the public sector, be in low-paid jobs and insecure work, and experience higher levels of unemployment than other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A toxic concoction means women of colour are hit hardest by austerity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/toxic-concoction-women-colour-pay-highest-price-austerity|author=Maya Goodfellow|date=28 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A cumulative gender impact assessment of ten years of austerity policies|url=http://wbg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/De_HenauReed_WBG_GIAtaxben_briefing_2016_03_06.pdf|website=The Women's Budget Group|publisher=The Women's Budget Group|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2017 by the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] identified an increase in [[child poverty]] and pensioner poverty compared to the previous year, following significant overall decreases during the previous 20 years. Reductions in benefit support and a shortage of affordable housing were considered to be contributing factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=UK government warned over sharp rise in child and pensioner poverty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/04/uk-government-warned-over-sharp-rise-children-pensioner-poverty-study|author=Richard Partington|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food banks===
Researchers have linked budget cuts and sanctions against benefit claimants to increasing use of [[food banks]]. In a twelve-month period from 2014 to 2015, over one million people in the United Kingdom had used a food bank, representing a "19% year-on-year increase in food bank use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Butler|first=Patrick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/22/food-bank-users-uk-low-paid-workers-poverty|title=Food bank use tops million mark over the past year| 
newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 April 2015|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A study published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2015 found that each one percentage point increase in the rate of [[Jobseeker's Allowance]] claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loopstra|first1=Rachel|title=Austerity, sanctions, and the rise of food banks in the UK|journal=BMJ|date=2015|page=2|url=http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/april/foodbanks.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2015|doi=10.1136/bmj.h1775|volume=350|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113008/http://press.psprings.co.uk/bmj/april/foodbanks.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] found that the number of people answering yes to the question "Have there been times in the past 12 months when you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?" decreased from 9.8% in 2007 to 8.1% in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/470840/Despite-the-Left-s-claims-over-soaring-foodbank-use-Britain-is-not-going-hungry |title=Despite the Left's claims over soaring foodbank use, Britain is not going hungry |last=McKinstry |first=Leo|date= |work=Daily Express|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to say that the rise was due to both more awareness of food banks, and the government allowing [[Jobcentre]]s to refer people to food banks when they were hungry, in contrast to previous governments.&lt;ref name="blogs.spectator.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Toby|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/was-food-poverty-actually-higher-under-the-last-labour-government/ |title=Was food poverty actually higher under the last Labour government? |work= [[The Spectator]] |date=22 April 2015 |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
When the coalition government came to power in 2010, capital investment in new affordable homes was cut by 60%, while government-imposed caps on local authority borrowing continued to restrict their ability to raise money to build new homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=How do you fix a housing crisis in a time of austerity?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/mar/11/housing-crisis-time-austerity|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Inside Housing]]'', former housing minister [[John Healey (politician)|John Healey]] observed that rate of starting social rented schemes had declined from 40,000 in 2009/10 to less than 1,000 in 2015/16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment: Time to end housing sector austerity|url=http://www.mulbury.co.uk/2016/09/comment-time-end-housing-sector-austerity/|publisher=Mulbury|date=1 September 2016|author=Greg Mulligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people sleeping rough on any one night across England had more than doubled between 2010 and 2016 to an estimated 4,134, according to a government street count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2017: The year the full effects of austerity are felt|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2017/02/13/2017-the-year-the-full-effects-of-austerity-are-felt|date=13 February 2017|author=Natalie Bloomer|website=politics.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[benefit cap]], introduced via the [[Welfare Reform Act 2012]], set a maximum level for the amount of state welfare benefits that could be paid to an individual household in any one year. The measure came into effect in 2013 with the figure initially set at £26,000 per year, close to the average income of a family in the UK at that time. The anticipated reduction in government expenditure as a result of the measure was £225 million by April 2015.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26065080 | work=BBC News|title='Thousands' hit by government benefit cap now in work|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit cap initially affected approximately 12,000 households, mainly in high-rent areas of the UK such as London, but in 2016/17 the limit was reduced to £20,000 per annum (£23,000 in London) extending its effects to around 116,000 households across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Benefit cap will hit 116,000 of poorest families, say experts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/01/extended-benefit-cap-hit-116000-families-housing-experts|author=Patrick Butler|date=1 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Local Housing Allowance]] (LHA) policy restricting [[Housing Benefit]] for private sector tenants to cover a maximum number of rooms had been in place since 2008. It was extended in April 2013 to cover [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] (except Northern Ireland). The resulting [[under-occupancy penalty]], commonly known as the "bedroom tax", affected an estimated 660,000 working age social housing tenants in the UK, reducing weekly incomes by £12–£22.&lt;ref name="Moffatt et al"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A qualitative study of the impact of the UK 'bedroom tax'|url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/38/2/197/1752995/A-qualitative-study-of-the-impact-of-the-UK|date=15 March 2015|author1=S.

From April 2016 the LHA rates used to calculate maximum housing benefit levels for private sector tenants were frozen for four years. Research by the housing charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]] indicated that the proportion of such tenants likely to experience a shortfall in housing benefit was 80%, amounting to 300,000 families. The degree of shortfall depends on dwelling, location and individual circumstances, but Shelter expected that by 2020 the shortfall could in some cases reach hundreds of pounds a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-income families in private housing face large benefit shortfalls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze|date=10 September 2015|author=Patrick Butler|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, housing benefit payments were ended for new claims made by people aged 18–21. Research by [[Heriot-Watt University]] found that the policy would reduce annual government expenditure by £3.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homelessness expected to rise further as Government scraps housing benefit for young people|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/housing-benefit-young-people-18-21-scrapped-universal-credit-exemptions-a7610581.html|date=3 March 2017|author=Jon Stone|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of austerity, the rate of homelessness has rapidly increased. For example, during 2016 the rate of homelessness increased by 16%. By 2018 the number of families living in bed and breakfast accommodation was almost 50,000, and there were many more "hidden homeless" people living on the floors and sofas of friends and acquaintances. An article in [[The BMJ]] regarded this as a "neon sign that something is fundamentally wrong" with how society is being run, noting that "homeless women die on average at 43 and homeless men at 47, compared with 77 for the rest of us".&lt;ref name="Moffatt et al"/&gt;

===Local government===
During the period of austerity there have been reductions in [[UK Government]] funding for [[county council]]s in England. This has combined with an increasing demand for [[social care]] services to cause reductions in expenditure on other services such as [[public libraries]], [[refuse collection]], [[road maintenance]] and [[Sure Start]], along with increases to [[council tax]] rates and the introduction of additional charges for county council services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/27/english-councils-warn-worst-is-yet-to-come-on-cuts|title=English councils warn 'worst is yet to come' on cuts|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Patrick Butler |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authority subsidies to bus services were reduced by almost half between 2010 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/02/bus-services-in-crisis-as-councils-cut-funding-campaigners-warn|title=Bus services in 'crisis' as councils cut funding, campaigners warn|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Gwyn Topham|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the [[Local Government Chronicle]] has indicated that between 2010 and 2018 there were more than 220,000 redundancies of local authority employees and nearly £4 billion was spent on redundancy payments, excluding [[outsourcing]] contracts. [[Rob Whiteman]] of [[CIPFA]] commented that "this scale of job losses reflects the intense financial pressure on councils as they now have no option other than to provide the bare minimum statutory provisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/13/councils-in-england-spend-4bn-on-220000-redundancies-since-2010|title=Councils in England spend £4bn on 220,000 redundancies since 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 September 2018|author=Patrick Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis by the [[Local Government Association]] in 2018 identified a decrease in the Revenue Support Grant for local authorities in England from £9,927 million in 2015–16 to £2,284 million for 2019–20, leaving 168 authorities with no grant for 2019–20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=English councils brace for biggest government cuts since 2010 despite 'unprecedented' budget pressures|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/england-council-budget-cuts-government-austerity-social-services-essential-care-safety-a8559486.html|newspaper=Independent|author=May Bulman|date=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK government plans in 2018 proposed the phasing out of grants to local authorities in England, instead funding English local government through a combination of local [[Business rates in England|business rates]] and council tax.&lt;ref name=Territorial&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/territorial-injustice-on-rise-england-due-to-council-cuts-study|title='Territorial injustice' may rise in England due to council cuts|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Patrick Butler|date= 9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the [[University of Cambridge]] published in 2018 said that the greatest reductions in local authority spending had occurred in impoverished [[post-industrial]] cities in the north of England and some poor [[Inner London]] boroughs. Over 30 such authorities in England had reduced spending by more than 30% between 2010 and 2017, with seven of them reducing spending by more than 40%. In contrast councils in wealthier areas had made smaller reductions. Councils in England experienced an average spending reduction of 24% compared to 12% in Scotland and 11.5% in Wales, the difference resulting from [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved government in those nations]].&lt;ref name=Territorial/&gt;

In 2018 [[Northamptonshire County Council]] become insolvent and proposed reducing services to the minimum required by law. Austerity measures were blamed for the insolvency, as was the council's refusal to raise council tax despite the rising costs of providing social services. At the time the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] said that up to 15 other local authorities were also at risk of insolvency.&lt;ref name=Reckless&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/01/northamptonshire-council-forced-pay-price-reckless-half-decade|title=Northamptonshire forced to pay the price of a reckless half-decade|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Patrick Butler|date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of council leaders, chief executives and mayors conducted by the [[New Local Government Network]] indicated that more than 70% of respondents expected that they would be unable to provide non-statutory services beyond 2023 if funding remained as restricted as it had been since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/2018/18304/|title=Most local authorities will only deliver the bare minimum in five years time|date=9 August 2018|website=New Local Government Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental Health===
In 2016, figures analysed by the [[King's Fund]] think tank showed that "mental health trusts in England are still having their budgets cut, despite government assurances they would be funded on a par with physical healthcare". The analysis "suggests 40% of the 58 trusts saw budgets cut in 2015–16".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37657954|title=Mental health budgets 'still being cut despite pledge'|work=BBC News|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report authored by the NatCen Social Research for [[UNISON]] shows that LGBT people have suffered from a lack of access to mental health services as a result of austerity.&lt;ref name="pinkausteritymeasuressinclair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=Sarah|title=Austerity measures are harming the LGBT community's mental health|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/11/25/austerity-measures-are-harming-the-lgbt-communitys-mental-health/|accessdate=26 November 2016|work=Pink News|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report published by [[Psychologists for Social Change]] indicates that austerity has contributed significantly to the incidence and level of depression and other mental health conditions within the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=The Psychological Impact of Austerity: A Briefing Paper|url=http://www.psychchange.org/uploads/9/7/9/7/97971280/paa-briefing-paper.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2018|work=Psychologists for Social Change|author1=Laura McGrath |author2=Vanessa Griffin|author3=Ed Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortality===
In 2017, the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] said that government austerity decisions in health and social care were likely to have resulted in 30,000 deaths in England and Wales in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/17/health-cuts-most-likely-cause-major-rise-mortality-study-claims|title=Health cuts most likely cause of major rise in mortality, study claims|author=Haroon Siddique|date=17 February 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/18/people-are-dying-at-the-hands-of-austerity-says-jeremy-corbyn|title=Tony Blair's Brexit speech 'not helpful', says Jeremy Corbyn|author=Hannah Summers|date=18 February 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[University College London]] published in [[BMJ Open]] in 2017 compared the figures for health and social care funding during the 2000s with that during the period 2010–2014. It found that annual growth in health funding during the 2000s was 3.8%, but after 2010 this dropped to 0.41%. Annual growth in social care funding of 2.2% during the 2000s became an annual decrease of 1.57% after 2010. This coincided with mortality rates decreasing by 0.77% annually during the 2000s but rising by 0.87% annually after 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|date=15 November 2017|author=Alex Matthews-King|title=Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deaths|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/tory-austerity-deaths-study-report-people-die-social-care-government-policy-a8057306.html|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of increase in [[life expectancy]] in England nearly halved between 2010 and 2017, according to research by epidemiology professor [[Michael Marmot]]. He commented that it was "entirely possible" that austerity was the cause&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life expectancy rises 'grinding to halt' in England|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40608256|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2017|author=Nick Triggle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "If we don't spend appropriately on social care, if we don't spend appropriately on health care, the quality of life will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Rise in life expectancy has stalled since 2010, research shows|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/18/rise-in-life-expectancy-has-stalled-since-2010-research-shows|author=Denis Campbell|date=18 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working-age social security payments such as [[Universal Credit]], [[Child benefits in the United Kingdom|Child Benefit]], [[Child Tax Credit]] and [[Working Tax Credit]], [[Housing Benefit]] and [[Jobseeker's Allowance]] have had their rate of increase reduced by austerity.&lt;ref name=£210&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Poorest families to lose out on £210 a year owing to benefits cap|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/13/poorest-families-to-lose-out-on-210-a-year-owing-to-benefits-cap|newspaper=The Guardian|author1=Heather Stewart|author2=Richard Partington|date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 onwards, these payments were limited to a maximum annual increase of 1% instead of being increased annually according to the rate of inflation. The policy of suspending the social security payments of unemployed claimants who were judged not to be adequately seeking work was continued, and the frequency and severity of the sanctions was increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Coalition Government, 2010-2015: A Marriage of Inconvenience|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o8YyDQAAQBAJ|first1=Peter|last1=Dorey|first2=Mark|last2=Garnett|year=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137023773|page=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2016 a four-year freeze on all working-age social security payments was introduced. It was anticipated that it would affect 11 million UK families and reduce expenditure by £9 billion, a figure later increased to £13 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Spending freeze to cut extra £4bn from benefits as raft of new benefit cuts kick in|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/benefit-freeze-cuts-austerity-measures-welfare-state-inflation-a7661196.html|date=1 April 2017|author=Ashley Cowburn|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016]] abolished the Work-Related Activity Component of [[Employment and Support Allowance]] for new claimants from April 2017. This reduced the weekly social security payments for the disabled people affected by £29.05 a week (at 2017/18 rates). The reduction in government expenditure was initially forecast to be £640 million per annum by 2020/21, though this was later revised to £450 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Abolition of the ESA Work-Related Activity Component|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7649|date=7 March 2017|publisher=House of Commons Library (Briefing paper)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis in 2018 by the [[Resolution Foundation]] indicated that by April 2019 the freeze in social security payments would have resulted in more than 10 million households experiencing a loss of income in [[real terms]], with the lack of an inflation-related increase in 2019 resulting in the average low-income couple with children losing an additional £210 per year. The analysis also said that the cumulative effect of these social security limitations had been to reduce the value of working-age benefits by more than 6% in real terms. Child Benefit had become worth less than it was in 1999 in real terms, and for a second child it was worth 14% less than when it was introduced in 1979.&lt;ref name=£210/&gt;

===State Pension===
The value of the [[State Pension (United Kingdom)|State Pension]] has not been subject to austerity measures, being increased each year since 2011 by a minimum of 2.5% per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Pensions triple lock: what you need to know|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/27/pensions-triple-lock-questions-answered|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Phillip Inman|date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some people have been adversely affected financially in their 60s by the rise in the age at which the State Pension is first paid. The decision to equalise the State Pension ages of men and women was made by the government in 1995. From 2010 the women's State Pension age was steadily raised from 60 with the aim of matching that of men at 65 by 2018. An additional increase to 66 for both sexes is intended to be implemented by 2020. Research by the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] (IFS) in 2017 found that the household incomes of over one million women aged between 60 and 62 had become £32 a week lower on average, and that poverty rates among that group had risen. The IFS also calculated that the reduction in state expenditure combined with the additional tax income from women continuing to work in their 60s resulted in a net increase in state revenue of £5.1 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Older women poorer after pension age change, says IFS|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40791216|date=2 August 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rise in the State Pension age to 67 for both sexes in 2036 had been proposed by [[Gordon Brown]] in the 2000s, followed by a rise to 68 in 2046.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Pension age to rise within 7 years, say Conservatives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/6263469/Pension-age-to-rise-within-7-years-say-Conservatives.html|newspaper=Telegraph|author1=Andrew Porter|author2=Robert Winnett|date=6 Oct 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 the date set for the rise to 67 had been brought forward to 2026&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Age 40? No access to pension until 58|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10982177/Age-40-No-access-to-pension-until-58.html|newspaper=Telegraph|author=Andrew Oxlade|date=22 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 the rise to 68 was brought forward to 2037. This last change alone resulted in an anticipated reduction in DWP expenditure of £74bn by 2046–47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=State pension age: Millions of people will have to work an extra year before retiring at 68|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/state-pension-age-workers-people-extra-year-68-increase-retirement-age-david-gauke-a7849091.html|newspaper=Independent|author=Tom Batchelor|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
Reductions in public expenditure in Northern Ireland have often been described as not as harsh as those for the UK as a whole. This is primarily due to the fact that the UK government has not been able to exert direct control over welfare expenditure in Northern Ireland, because welfare policy is a devolved matter for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref name=Nevin/&gt; On a number of occasions the Assembly has not agreed to cuts in public spending, effectively refusing to make them, despite pressure from the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Northern Ireland braces for austerity|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a40aa234-c0f6-11e4-88ca-00144feab7de?mhq5j=e1|date=2 March 2015|author=Vincent Boland|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UK government has sought to recoup the expected savings through a fine on Northern Ireland's block grant, which is calculated according to the [[Barnett formula]], and which fell by 8% in real terms between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref name=Nevin/&gt; Research by [[Oxfam]] Ireland which was published in 2014 indicated said that austerity measures were affecting Northern Ireland disproportionately due to its being one of the UK's most disadvantaged regions with a high dependence on public spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austerity creating 'more unequal NI society'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25737952|date=15 January 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the [[Conservative–DUP agreement]] resulted in an additional £1 billion of public sector funding for Northern Ireland over two years, with the money focused on the health, infrastructure and education budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40403434|title=Conservatives agree pact with DUP to support May government|date=26 June 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
During the early years of the austerity programme, many economists argued that the financial changes of the austerity programme should not be undertaken as extensively and as quickly as was done. Osborne, however, argued that without the implementation of the programme in the way that it was another financial crisis was likely.&lt;ref name=Chu/&gt;

The rationale behind the need for achieving a balanced budget in the financial climate following the Great Recession has been questioned by some [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economists]]. [[Andrew Gamble]] writing in ''[[Parliamentary Affairs]]'' in 2015 commented:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Economy|date=3 September 2015|last=Gamble|first=Andrew|doi=10.1093/pa/gsv033|url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/68/suppl_1/154/1403373/The-Economy|publisher=Oxford University Press and Hansard Society|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=68|pages=154-167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Most macroeconomists now agree that the austerity programme pursued by the Coalition Government in its first two years was both too severe and unnecessary and set back the economic recovery which was underway in the first half of 2010. The Office of Budget Responsibility confirmed that the austerity programme reduced GDP, while the Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis has calculated that the Coalition Government's austerity programme cost the average household £4000 over the lifetime of the Parliament and severely damaged those public services which were not ring-fenced.}} [[Ha-Joon Chang]], writing in 2017, observed that "in today’s UK economy, whose underlying stagnation has been masked only by the release of excess liquidity on an oceanic scale, some deficit spending may be good – necessary, even".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=The myths about money that British voters should reject|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/01/myths-money-british-voters-economy-britain-welfare|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Ha-Joon Chang|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Some criticism has been based allegations of [[economic opportunism]], with the government said to have made politically popular cuts rather than those necessary to achieve its long-term aims. Paul Mac Flynn wrote for the Nevin Economic Research Institute in 2015 that:&lt;ref name=Nevin/&gt;{{quote|Instead of focussing on the long-term structural causes of increases in public expenditure, the current government have adopted glib and uninformed targets for reductions in overall expenditure. Rather than tackling a housing crisis or low pay they have introduced measures like the benefit cap and the bedroom tax.}} Ben Chu, economics editor of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, commented that: "Austerity, as practiced by Osborne, was essentially a political choice rather than an economic necessity, and the human costs have been huge".&lt;ref name=Chu/&gt;

Economists [[Alberto Alesina]], Carlo A. Favero and [[Francesco Giavazzi]], writing in ''[[Finance &amp; Development]]'' in 2018, argued that deficit reduction policies based on spending cuts typically have almost no effect on output, and hence form a better route to achieving a reduction in the [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] than raising taxes. The authors commented that the UK government austerity programme had resulted in growth that was higher than the European average and that the UK's economic performance had been much stronger than the [[International Monetary Fund]] had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Climbing Out of Debt|first1=Alberto|last1=Alesina|first2=Carlo A.|last2=Favero|first3=Francesco|last3=Giavazzi|journal=Finance &amp; Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|date=March 2018|volume=55|issue=1|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/03/alesina.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations carried out an investigation in 2018 led by [[Philip Alston]], the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] on extreme poverty and human rights, into the effect of austerity policies in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/28/united-nations-tory-record-poverty-human-rights|title=UN to investigate Tory record on poverty and human rights|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Robert Booth|date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alston concluded that the austerity programme had breached UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=UK austerity has inflicted 'great misery' on citizens, UN says|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/16/uk-austerity-has-inflicted-great-misery-on-citizens-un-says|newspaper=The Guardian|author1=Robert Booth|author2=Patrick Butler|date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ring-fenced departments===
Peter Dominiczak (political editor at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'') wrote that because spending on the NHS and foreign aid is ring-fenced, "other [[Whitehall]] departments will face savage cuts to their budgets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11752132/George-Osborne-to-demand-20billion-of-Whitehall-cuts.html |title=George Osborne to demand £20billion of Whitehall cuts|author=Peter Dominiczak|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some (such as Dr Louise Marshall in ''[[The Guardian]]'') have questioned whether the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) really is exempt from austerity measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marshall|first1=Dr Louise|title=Should we start preparing for a decade of austerity in the NHS?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/dec/03/preparing-decade-austerity-nhs|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==

A [[YouGov]] poll in 2015 found that whilst 58% of those surveyed viewed austerity as "necessary", and 48% judged it to be good for economy (compared to 34% who thought it bad for the economy), 50% thought the programme was being carried out "unfairly".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first=Liam|last=Stanley|url=http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2015/07/09/public-opinion-graphs-austerity/|title=What six public opinion graphs tell us about austerity|publisher=Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute|access-date=16 June 2018|date=9 July 2015|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] found that 48% of those surveyed during the previous year wanted higher taxes to pay for more public spending, the first time since 2008 that more people wanted an increase in taxation and spending than opposed it, and the highest proportion to support such measures since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Attitudes Survey: More Britons 'back higher taxes'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40408576|work=BBC News|date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2018 opinion poll by [[Number Cruncher Politics]] in the [[Financial Times]] found that 66% of British adults, including majorities of all major parties' supporters, thought austerity had "gone too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poll shows even Tory voters feel austerity has gone too far|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c8d95118-4a42-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6|work=Financial Times|date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll by [[Survation]] for the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] trade union published in spring 2018 found that 62% of respondents wanted the 2018 spring budget to increase spending on public services in real terms, while 48% of those who had voted for the Conservative Party at the 2017 general election thought that austerity had been excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/philip-hammond-austerity-chancellor-spring-statement|title=Philip Hammond is trying to hide the pain of austerity.

==Effects on general elections==
The [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] was contested by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] which had both committed themselves to austerity policies. Labour's then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Alistair Darling]] predicted that "two parliaments of pain" would be necessary to address the UK's budget deficit. The [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] said that Labour's plans implied a cumulative decline of 11.9% in public spending over four years. This would reduce public expenditure by a total of £46 billion in inflation-adjusted terms, taking it from over 27% of the economy to below 21%, back to its level in the late-1990s. The IFS also said that there appeared to be only a modest difference between the plans put forward by the two main political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Alistair Darling: we will cut deeper than Margaret Thatcher|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/25/alistair-darling-cut-deeper-margaret-thatcher|date=25 March 2010|first=Larry|last=Elliott|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither party won a majority at that year's general election, resulting in a hung parliament with the Conservative Party forming a coalition government with the [[centrist]] [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

At the end of the first full parliament under the austerity programme, the Labour Party and the Conservatives were deadlocked in the polls. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the Conservative Party modified their commitment to austerity with a series of unfunded spending promises, including £8 billion of additional expenditure for the [[National Health Service|NHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Tories break with austerity and promise ‘good life’ to voters|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cd8de610-e2a8-11e4-ba33-00144feab7de?mhq5j=e1|date=14 April 2015|author=George Parker|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the 2015 Conservative Party general election manifesto proposed making sufficient reductions in public spending and welfare to eliminate the budget deficit entirely by 2018–19 and run a small budget surplus by 2020. The Labour Party's manifesto proposed the less rigorous objective of reducing the budget deficit every year with the aim of seeing debt as a share of GDP falling by 2020 and achieving a budget surplus "as soon as possible". This would render the spending reductions proposed by the Conservatives unnecessary, according to some analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Labour manifesto 2015: the key policies and what they mean for you|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11532277/manifesto-2015-summary.html|date=5 May 2015|author=Matthew Holehouse|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party won the general election with an overall majority for the first time in 23 years, which was unexpected by most polls as they had predicted another hung parliament.&lt;ref name=Tapper&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Anti-austerity protesters take to UK streets after Tory election victory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/09/anti-austerity-protesters-take-to-uk-streets-after-tory-election-victory|newspaper=The Guardian|author=James Tapper|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political commentator [[Patrick Wintour]] argued that one of the reasons for Labour's loss was its lack of clarity on the cause of the budget deficit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election|title=The undoing of Ed Miliband – and how Labour lost the election|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=3 June 2015|newspaper=the Guardian|access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-austerity protests followed the election result,&lt;ref name=Tapper/&gt; but post-election polling for an independent review conducted by Campaign Company for Labour MP [[Jon Cruddas]] indicated that voters in England and Wales did not support an anti-austerity platform, concluding: "the Tories did not win despite austerity, but because of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Anti-austerity unpopular with voters, finds inquiry into Labour's election loss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/04/anti-austerity-voters-poll-jeremy-corbyn-labour|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Patrick Wintour|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] was held almost three years earlier than scheduled under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] in an attempt to increase the Government's majority to facilitate the [[Brexit]] process. The Conservative Party manifesto pledged to eliminate the deficit by the "middle of the next decade",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reality check: How big is the UK's deficit and debt?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39897498|work=BBC News|date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an aim which the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] (IFS) said would "likely require more spending cuts or tax rises even beyond the end of the next parliament". The Labour Party manifesto proposed increasing the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]'s income by £49 billion per year as a result of taxation rises and increasing public expenditure "to its highest sustained level in more than 30 years". The IFS said that Labour's proposals "could be expected to raise ''at most'' £40 billion" and that Labour was planning to maintain a majority of the cuts to working-age benefits proposed by the Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Tory plan to balance budget by mid-2020s 'could require tax rises'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/tory-plan-balance-budget-mid-2020s-could-require-tax-rises/|date=26 May 2017|author=Edward Malnick|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the election, the Conservative Party lost their parliamentary majority, but remained in government as the largest single party in parliament. [[Gavin Barwell]], Theresa May's [[Downing Street Chief of Staff]], blamed anger over Brexit and austerity for the loss of seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40251997|title=Theresa May's chief of staff Gavin Barwell: Austerity and Brexit cost us|date=12 June 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour opposition announced a plan to challenge further austerity measures and vote against them in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. A Labour spokesman said: "We will be using the changed parliamentary arithmetic to drive home the fact that the Tory programme for five more years of austerity will not go on as before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/09/theresa-may-hopes-to-remain-pm-as-voters-deliver-hung-parliament|title=Theresa May adopts contrite tone after Tory MPs vent anger over election|newspaper=The Guardian|author= Heather Stewart|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World-Information Institute (WII) is an independent cultural institution located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] linking research and public discourse in the realms of innovation, digital culture technologies, and society. Its vast documentation and processing of digital media technologies sheds light on the future perspectives of global developments and involves complex and heterogeneous information resources.

World-Information Institute forms part of an international network of partner institutions and experts in the fields of information and communication technologies and their social implications.

WII’s main fields of research are a politics of the commons (and, from this perspective: problems of intellectual property regimes), new forms of cultural production, politics of search and organization of knowledge, surveillance technologies, big data and visualization, cultural and media policies. A recent example of an activity to further develop cultural and media policies is “Netzpolitischer Konvent” (Convention of the Austrian civil society on net politics),&lt;ref&gt;https://npk.servus.at/ (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; in which a catalogue of demands was drafted and subsequently presented to the public.

WII's main projects include:

=== World-Information.Org series of projects - launched Brussels 2000 ===
World-Information.Org was launched as the main media project of the [[European Capital of Culture]] 2000 in Brussels. The social, cultural and political dimensions of the new information and communication technologies were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=10&amp;pos=3&amp;textid=110&amp;lang=de Springerin – Hefte für Gegenwartskunst, Heft 3/00] (in German, retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The World-Information exhibition presented objects and research results on topics such as the history of modern communication technologies, the "big players" in the IT industry, financial networks or human rights. The program was completed by the "World-InfoCon" conference. Most resources are available on the world-information.org page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world-information.org/wio/program/brussels2000/events/1032966488/993056460/objects/993056638/993056659 World Infostructure Exhibition] (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
The first presentation was followed by a series of conferences and exhibitions in Vienna ([[Technisches Museum Wien]], 2000 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/vienna (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Amsterdam (Oude Kerk and [[De Balie]] Centre for Culture and Politics, 2002 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/amsterdam (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Novi Sad / Belgrade ([[Museum of Vojvodina]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade]], 2003 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/serbia (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;), Bangalore (2005 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/bangalore (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;) and Paris (as part of the festival "Futur en Seine", 2009 &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/program/paris/events/1242060832/1242061298 (retrieved: 03-16-2017)&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Deep Search (I) - Vienna 2008 ===

The "Deep Search" conference critically dealt with "the social and political dimensions of how we navigate the deep seas of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search/en/book/deepsearch-book_en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Critically analyzing a situation in which [[Google_Search|Google]] assumes a monopoly-like position in the field of search in many countries around the world, the conference asked questions as: „How is computer readable significance produced, how is meaning involved in machine communication? Where is the emancipatory potential of having access to such vast amounts of information? What are the dangers of our reliance on search engines? And are there any approaches that do not follow the currently dominating paradigm of [[Google_Search|Google]]?“ &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Strategies in Art and Media - New York 2009 ===

This conference on the future of cultural freedom and cultural intelligence in digital theory and practice &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/critical_strategies/en (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; took place at the [[Austrian Cultural Forum New York]]. It followed attempts to go beyound the obsolete models of the artist/author as genius and searched for collective and collaborative practices that could invent new terrains and flows. New kinds of 'virtual' spaces and their role for critical cultural practices were discussed. The conference also aimed at developing strategies that could elude being instrumentalized by the creative industries in their „seemingly infinite appetite for things radical“. &lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deep Search (II) - Vienna 2010 ===

The debate on the policies of searching continued 2010 with the conference "Deep Search II": "The automatic classification of data, its indexing, and its evaluation are at the heart of new communication environments. What lies beneath is not just a drive to organize the world's information, but also to classify human relations: from the management of the modern workplace and consumers in mass societies, to the bio-political management of the network society."&lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.org/wii/deep_search2/en/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shared Digital Futures - Vienna 2013 ===

The conference "Shared Digital Futures" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/sdf/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with the impact of digital networking technologies to the production of culture and examined about the new role of the artwork as the same end product and raw material for further production of culture, models for sustainable funding of Commons, new forms of collective authorship and the opportunities opened by the blurring of boundaries between artists and audiences.

=== Information as a reality - Linz, 2014 ===

The conference and exhibition "Information as a reality" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/iar/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] and with [[Ars Electronica]] at the [[Lentos Art Museum]] in Linz dealt with critical cultural practices in digital networks and the increasing change of social reality by digital models and virtual information regimes. Cultural workers have played an important pioneering role in the colonization of digital worlds. What role can they assume now, 20 years after the emergence of the Internet?

=== Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces - Vienna 2014 ===

The conference "Digital Clouds and Urban Spaces" &lt;ref&gt;http://world-information.net/digital-clouds/ (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Architekturzentrum Wien]] focused on [[Smart Cities]] and the city as an information system where urbanity is increasingly shaped by networks of informational technologies. The conference took account to the fact, that this does not only apply to phenomena as traffic control systems or planning models, but that the world of work, social spaces and cultural processes are also subject to substantial transformations related to these developments. Before this backdrop, the conference questioned the simplistic promises made by global corporations and their technologies to render cities more efficient, safer and cleaner.

=== Critical Net Practice – Vienna 2015 ===

In a cooperation with the magazine [[:de:Springerin|Springerin]] World-Information Institute revisited 20 years of net culture. The resulting texts formed the main part of issue XXI/1 (winter 2015) of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft.php?id=87&amp;pos=0&amp;textid=0&amp;lang=en (retrieved: 21-09-2016). The English version of Mission interconnectedness. A roundtable on 20 years of Net culture with Konrad Becker, Josephine Berry Slater, Felix Stalder, Pauline van Mourik Broekman, is also available at http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2015-03-17-becker-en.html (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Issue Presentation (MAK – [[Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna]]): Critical Net Practice: Information as a reality? &lt;ref&gt;http://mak.at/jart/prj3/mak-resp/main.jart?reserve-mode=active&amp;rel=de&amp;content-id=1343388632770&amp;article_id=1419146574316 (in German, retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Jumper / Band XXI, No. 1, Winter 2015.

=== Algorithmic Regimes - Vienna 2015/2016 ===

The international conference and event series "Algorithmic Regimes" &lt;ref&gt;A brief description of all project parts with links to documentation videos can be found at http://world-information.net/algorithmic-regimes-and-generative-strategies/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; examined the growing influence of digital control systems and their cascading effects of powerful effect on cultural and social realities. In addition to the conference, the event „Algorithms are no Angels“ with [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] und Graham Harwood, a Videointerview with Stefano Harney, and an audiovisual evening about the power of algorithms were conducted, that presented an annotated remix of film clips and documentaries,&lt;ref&gt;The playlist can be found at http://world-information.net/screening-the-algorithmic/ (retrieved: 21-09-2016).&lt;/ref&gt; relating to automated control systems.

=== Wahlkabine.at ===
Wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 and was presented for the first time during the National Council elections in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"WWWahlspielchen", Falter 45/02 (November 2002), p. 21. The article is not available in the newspaper's online archive, which goes back only to the year 2005, download scan: http://wahlkabine.at/presse/falter2002/filedownload (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; The online polling-booth sees itself as an instrument of political education, which encourages the users to deal with political content in a playful way and provides factual information and feedback opportunities.

Given the fact that increasing personalization nowadays replaces more and more the political content, Wahlkabine.at considers the publication of all party-programs and their scientific contextualization as a fundamental tool for political participation as well as a revealing resource collection for personal reflection on the voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "Why wahlkabine.at?" at: http://wahlkabine.at/ueber/Infofolder_wahlkabine_ENGL.pdf/attachment_download/file (retrieved 08-10-2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Wahlkabine.at focuses on elections on Austrian national and regional levels and on EU-level (European Parliament), but also includes elections of the Austrian National Student Union and a few individual cases (e.g. Austrian Economic Chambers / Sector Information and Consulting 2010).&lt;ref&gt;For a list of all elections covered, cf. http://wahlkabine.at/archiv (in German), retrieved: 16-09-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of regional elections in Vienna in autumn 2015 (with an electorate of approximately 1.14 million eligible voters) 160,000 users visited the online polling booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://wahlkabine.at/ltw2015wien/schlussauswertungltw2015wien/ (in German, retrieved: 21-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future Non Stop ===
Future Non Stop – started as a project in 2010, online since 2012 – is an extensive archive and an experiment in logics of navigating information: “Based on an extensive archive going back to 1994 the site collects materials that serve as important reference documents in the field of new media, politics, and art and makes them accessible to a wider public. Instead of a hierarchically structured archive an experimental navigation interface opens up new ways to explore large information nodes. Documents are associated by a range of tag that allow to filter relevance according to topics and issue relations. ASCR, short for Advanced Semantic Content Repository, is the open source information architecture and "editing back end" of Future Non Stop.” &lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/ (retrieved: 22-09-2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives / Sub-organizations and their Projects ==

===Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0===
[[File:Wio-savethedigitale-cology.jpg|thumb|left|Save the Digital Ecology/ Vienna 2000]]
The '''Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0''' was established in 1993 as an arts and culture related international competence platform for the critical use of information and communication technologies. Over the years it has pursued a broad range of transdisciplinary activities. From producing and hosting infrastructure to organizing conferences, festivals and exhibitions, local interventions and skill transfer, as well as international research and publishing. [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber, who founded the institute, currently form the board of directors together with [[:de:Felix Stalder|Felix Stalder]].

When the founders of the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 set up a web server (in an unofficially tolerated act of ‘misuse’ of the underemployed Internet server of Vienna’s general hospital AKH) in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Sousa Webber: "Building a Netbase from Scratch", in: Branka Ćurčić / Zoran Pantelić / New Media Center_kuda.org (Eds.): ‘’Public Netbase: Non Stop Future - New Practices in Art and Media’’, Frankfurt a. M. (Revolver), 2008, online: http://nonstop-future.org/txt?tid=195606bfd5f57eb46cbc3100ef62ff0c, retrieved: 18-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; they created one of the first arts and culture-related sites on the emerging World Wide Web.

The institute has been conceptualised as a platform from which independent initiatives and organizations could emerge. The first of these initiatives was [[Public Netbase]] – now an ‘historical example’ of an early new media organization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clemens Apprich / Felix Stalder (Hrsg.): ''Vergessene Zukunft. Radikale Netzkulturen in Europa.'' transcript, Bielefeld 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8376-1906-5}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, it was located in Messepalast, the predecessor of Vienna’s [[Museumsquartier]]. It combined various functions and activities: It was a non-profit Internet service provider that facilitated internet access mainly for the independent arts and cultural sector. This was accompanied by a program of workshops and courses to develop media competence. Public Netbase became a social space for this emerging scene of artists, techheads, activists etc., and ran an almost daily evening program of discussions, presentations, screenings and music events. In addition to these grassroots activities international exhibitions and conferences were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;For the period 1995-1999 press coverage - mainly in Austria, but also in international newspapers and magazines, e.g. [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], Kunstforum International, [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Mute (magazine)|Mute]], [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Telepolis]], [[The New York Times]] and Artbyte.The Magazine of Digital Arts - has been documented by t0: http://www.t0.or.at/1995.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1996.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1997.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1998.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1999.htm, retrieved: 04-12-2013, mostly in German&lt;/ref&gt; Public Netbase used to be t0’s main initiative until it had to be discontinued due to lack of funding (which was a result of repression by the Austrian right-wing government &lt;ref&gt;Subsidies by the federal government had made up a main part of Public Netbase’s funds before, cf. Robert Harauer / MEDIACULT (ed.): ''Digital Culture in Europe. A selective inventory of centres of innovation in the arts and new technologies'', Strasbourg (Council of Europe), 1999, pp. 14-17 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FHkk5HfkcD4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Cyberculture+en+Europe&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Waw2UqHAA-Hh4QSW7oCgAQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cyberculture%20en%20Europe&amp;f=false in Google books]))&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006.

But already in 1999 the next initiative had been founded: World-Information.Org (WIO). It was presented – under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] &lt;ref&gt;Cf. "The Exhibition 'World-Information.Org', Public Netbase t0", new media center_kuda.org, 28.07.2013, online: http://www.kuda.org/en/exhibition-world-informationorg-public-netbase-t0, retrieved: 16-09-2013, and F.E.Rakuschan, “Weltinformationsordnung 2.0”, [[Telepolis]] 28.11.2000 (in German), http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/4/4350/1.html, retrieved 16-09-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; – as the lead project of the New-Media-program of the Brussels 2000 [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacticalmediafiles.net/events/4724/World_Information-Brussels (retrieved: 08-10-2016)&lt;/ref&gt; WIO resembles an intelligence agency, that collects and analyses information, but not in the interest of a state or as a think tank for corporate businesses, but for the independent cultural sector. Starting from the Brussels project, a series of international exhibitions and conferences has been developed.
World-Information Institute (WII) is WIO’s research department. In addition to conducting research, it continues the program of international conferences and the activities to further develop culture and media policies. In addition, on the Austrian national level, wahlkabine.at was founded in 2002 and became Austria’s most prominent online “polling booth”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. coverage by Austrian media documented at http://wahlkabine.at/presse, retrieved: 16-09-2013, Cf. e.g. „Wenig Übereinstimmung zwischen SPÖ und ÖVP“ ([[Der Standard|derStandard.at]], 19.08.2013, http://derstandard.at/1376533958426/wahlkabineat-Wenig-Uebereinstimmung-zwischen-SPOe-und-OeVP, retrieved: 04-12-2013, in German), „Wahlkabine.at bietet Entscheidungshilfe“ (ORF Zeit im Bild 1, 17.08.2013; ZiB1 is the main evening TV-newscast of the Austrian public broadcasting corporation [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]].

Since 2010, Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 has developed the ‘living archive’ Future Non Stop,&lt;ref&gt;http://future-nonstop.org/, retrieved: 04-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt; in which all its activities are documented, which makes it a valuable resource covering twenty years of activities in new media art, net culture and participatory use and critical analyses of new technologies, digital networks and the World Wide Web.

Across all these activities, t0 has closely collaborated with groups and organizations such as [[Critical Art Ensemble]], [[RTMark]], [[The Yes Men]], [[De Balie]], Kuda.org, De Waag, [[Adbusters]], [[Institute for Applied Autonomy]], [[The Sarai Programme at CSDS|Sarai (Media Lab)]], [[Federal Agency for Civic Education|Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]], [[V2 Institute for the Unstable Media]], [[0100101110101101.ORG]] and [[Nettime]].

=== Public Netbase ===
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Netbase, media~space]]
[[Public Netbase]] was initiated by the Institute for New Culture Technologies/t0 in the Vienna [[Museumsquartier]] in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use of information and communication technology. With its WWW-server as well as with its workshops, instruction courses, and educational events for the broad public, Public Netbase contributed continually to the evolution of a lively internet scene and a heightened consciousness for the implications of the new communication and information technologies.

As a focal point of European and international art, culture, and media networks, the Viennese net culture institute attempted to develop an understanding for the manifold opportunities and the potential of new communication media, but also to look critically at a society that is increasingly determined by technology.

In addition to the series of workshops and discussions the activities of Public Netbase included, among other, projects that combined exhibitions, conferences and workshops (e.g. Synworld playwork:hyperspace&lt;ref&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (1999) and Free Bitflows &lt;ref&gt;http://freebitflows.t0.or.at/, retrieved: 16-09-2013, http://v2.nl/events/free-bitflows/, retrieved: 16-09-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2004)), projects in public space (nikeground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t0.or.at/nikeground, retrieved: 16-09-2013; cf.

Public Netbase was very active in the resistance movements against the Austrian right-wing government, that came into power beginning of 2000 and included Jörg Haider’s Freedom Party (FPÖ). An own strand of activities derived from this (e.g. government-austria.at &lt;ref&gt;http://government-austria.at/, retrieved: 11-07-2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2000/2001)) and elements of political activism became stronger across all strands of activities.
