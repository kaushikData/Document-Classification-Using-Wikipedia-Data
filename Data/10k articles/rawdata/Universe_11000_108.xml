      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1449">The '''Assam State Electricity Board''' (ASEB) is an electricity regulation board of the state of [[Assam]] in [[India]]. It is a Public Sector Undertaking managing the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in the state of Assam with its successor companies [http://www.apgcl.org/ Assam Power Generation Co. Ltd.], [http://www.aegcl.co.in/ Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Ltd.] and [http://www.apdcl.gov.in/ Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd].

Assam State Electricity Board was established in 1958 in the composite state of Assam under the Electricity Act 1948. The existing Board was reconstituted in 1975 after the state was trifurcated into Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram in 1972. Two central government corporations, [[NEEPCO|North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO)]] and the [[PowerGrid Corporation of India|Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL)]] supplement the efforts of the state in power development in generation and transmission respectively.

In  the field of [[electric power distribution]] and transmission, a '''Buchholz relay''' is a safety device mounted on some oil-filled power [[transformer]]s and  [[reactance (electronics)|reactors]], equipped with an external overhead oil reservoir called a "conservator". The Buchholz relay is used as a protective device sensitive to the effects of [[dielectric]] failure inside the equipment. A generic designation for this type of device is "gas detector relay". 

==Application==
Buchholz relays have been applied  on oil-filled power and distribution transformers at least since the 1940s. The relay is connected to the oil piping between the conservator and oil tank of a transformer. The piping between the main tank and conservator is arranged so that any gas evolved in the main tank tends to flow upward toward the conservator and gas detector relay. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transformerworld.co.uk/buchholz.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713071809/http://www.transformerworld.co.uk/buchholz.htm |archivedate=2008-07-13 |df= }} Tutorial T5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vermogentransformator 1.GIF|thumb|right| Schematic diagram of a large oil-filled power transformer. The conservator tank, green, at right, is marked 3 and the Buchholz relay is marked 5]]

==Operation==
Depending on the model, the [[relay]] has multiple methods to detect a failing transformer. On a slow accumulation of gas, due perhaps to slight overload, gas produced by decomposition of [[transformer oil|insulating oil]] accumulates in the top of the relay and forces the oil level down.  A [[float switch]] in the relay is used to initiate an alarm signal. Depending on design, a second float may also serve to detect slow oil leaks.

If an [[electrical arc]] forms, gas accumulation is rapid, and oil flows rapidly into the conservator.  This flow of oil operates a switch attached to a vane located in the path of the moving oil.  This switch normally will operate a [[circuit breaker]] to isolate the apparatus before the fault causes additional damage. Buchholz relays have a test port to allow the accumulated  gas to be withdrawn for testing.  Flammable gas found in the relay indicates some internal fault such as overheating or [[arcing]], whereas air found in the relay may only indicate low oil level or a leak. &lt;ref&gt; C. Christopoulos, A. Wright, ''Electrical Power System Protection Second Edition'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1999, {{ISBN|0412817608}} page 215  &lt;/ref&gt; 

Through a connected gas sampling device the control can also be made from the ground. Depending on the requirements, the Buchholz relay has a flange or threaded connection. The classic Buchholz relay has to comply with the requirements of the DIN EN 50216-2 standard. Depending on the requirements, it is equipped with up to four (2 per float) switches or change-over switches, which can either send a light signal or switch off the transformer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maier-accessories.com/en/transformer-accessories/protection-devices/buchholz-relay-mbp.html Operating principle of buchholz relay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misnomers==
The relay was first developed by Max Buchholz (1875–1956) in 1921. Names like "beechwood relay" or "beech relay" are an indication of incorrectly translated German language manuals of the "Buchholz relay "

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7401">[[File:PADC neu.svg|thumb|Structure]]
'''CR-39''', or '''allyl diglycol carbonate''' (ADC), is a [[plastic]] [[polymer]] commonly used in the manufacture of [[eyeglass]] [[lens (optics)|lenses]]. The abbreviation stands for "Columbia Resin #39", which was the 39th formula of a thermosetting plastic developed by the [[Columbia-Southern Chemical Corporation|Columbia Resins]] project in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporateportal.ppg.com/NA/chemicals/Optical/CR39/cr39History.htm |title=Optical Products |publisher=Corporateportal.ppg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial use of CR-39 monomer was to help create [[glass-reinforced plastic]] fuel tanks for the [[B-17]] bomber aircraft in World War II, reducing weight and increasing range of the bomber.  After the War, the Armorlite Lens Company in California is credited with manufacturing the first CR-39 eyeglass lenses in 1947. CR-39 plastic has an [[index of refraction]] of 1.498 and an [[Abbe number]] of 58.  CR-39 is now a trade-marked product of [[PPG Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporateportal.ppg.com/NA/chemicals/Optical/CR39/ |title=Optical Products |publisher=Corporateportal.ppg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative use includes a purified version that is used to measure [[neutron radiation]], a type of [[ionizing radiation]], in [[neutron]] [[dosimetry]].

Although CR-39 is a type of polycarbonate, it should not be confused with the general term [[polycarbonate]], a tough [[homopolymer]] usually made from [[bisphenol A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA091656&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|title=A Field study|publisher=Dtic.mil|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
CR-39 is made by polymerization of diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbonate (ADC) in presence of diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate (IPP) [[Radical initiator|initiator]]. The presence of the allyl groups allows the polymer to form [[cross-link]]s; thus, it is a [[thermoset]] resin. The monomer structure is
[[File:ADC.svg|thumb|none|Monomer]]
The polymerization schedule of ADC monomers using IPP is generally 20 hours long with a maximum temperature of 95&amp;nbsp;°C. The elevated temperatures can be supplied using a water bath or a forced air oven.

[[Benzoyl peroxide]] (BPO) is an alternative [[organic peroxide]] that may be used to polymerize ADC. Pure benzoyl peroxide is crystalline and less volatile than diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate. Using BPO results in a polymer that has a higher yellowness index, and the peroxide takes longer to dissolve into ADC at room temperature than IPP.

== Applications ==
"CR-39 is transparent in the [[visible spectrum]] and is almost completely opaque in the [[ultraviolet]] range. It has high [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] resistance, in fact the highest abrasion/scratch resistance of any uncoated optical plastic. CR-39 is about half the weight of [[glass]] with an index of refraction only slightly lower than that of [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]], and its high Abbe number yields low [[chromatic aberration]], altogether making it an advantageous material for eyeglasses and [[sunglasses]]. A wide range of colors can be achieved by [[dye]]ing of the surface or the bulk of the material. CR-39 is also resistant to most [[solvent]]s and other chemicals, [[gamma radiation]], aging, and to [[material fatigue]]. It can withstand the small hot [[Ember|sparks]] from [[welding]], something glass cannot do. It can be used continuously in temperatures up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C and up to one hour at 130&amp;nbsp;°C." 

In the radiation detection application, CR-39 is used as a [[Solid-State Nuclear Track Detector]] to detect the presence of ionising radiation. Energetic particles colliding with the polymer structure leave a trail of broken chemical bonds within the CR-39. When immersed in a concentrated alkali solution (typically [[sodium hydroxide]]) hydroxide ions attack and break the polymer structure, etching away the bulk of the plastic at a nominally fixed rate. However, along the paths of damage left by charged particle interaction the concentration of radiation damage allows the chemical agent to attack the polymer more rapidly than it does in the bulk, revealing the paths of the charged particle [[ion tracks]].  The resulting etched plastic therefore contains a permanent record of not only the location of the radiation on the plastic but also gives spectroscopic information about the source.  Principally used for the detection of alpha radiation emitting radionuclides (especially [[radon]] gas), the radiation-sensitivity properties of CR39 are also used for proton and neutron dosimetry and historically [[cosmic ray]] investigations.

The ability of CR-39 to record the location of a radiation source, even at extremely low concentrations is exploited in  autoradiography studies with alpha particles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irpa11.irpa.net/pdfs/3a31.pdf ''A quantitative method for determining the biodistribution of alpha radionuclides using whole-body cryosectioning and alpha-track autoradiography''] Cebrián, D., Morcillo, M.A.; Radiation Dosimetry, CIEMAT
Avd. Complutense 22; 28040-Madrid Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and for (comparatively cheap) detection of alpha-emitters like uranium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrc.org/du/subtopic/ambulance.pdf Busby Busby Chris and Williams Dai, ''Further Evidence of Enriched Uranium in guided weapons employed by the Israeli Military in Lebanon in July 2006: Ambulance Air Filter Analysis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224200811/http://www.llrc.org/du/subtopic/ambulance.pdf |date=2012-12-24 }} Green Audit Research Note 7/2006 Nov 3rd 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a thin section of a biological material is fixed against CR-39 and kept frozen for a timescale of months to years in an environment that is shielded as much as possible from possible radiological contaminants.   Before etching, photographs are taken of the biological sample with the affixed CR-39 detector, with care taken to ensure that pre-scribed location marks on the detector are noted.   After the etching process, automated or manual 'scanning' of the CR-39 is used to physically locate the ionising radiation recorded, which can then be mapped to the position of the radionuclide within the biological sample. There is no other non-destructive method for accurately identifying the location of trace quantities of radionuclides in biological samples at such low emission levels.

CR-39 is used in some [[photographic filter]]s, such as the [[Cokin filter system]].

A direct equivalent is produced by Acomon AG with the brand name RAV,
and another one by Danyang Yueda FineChemichal Co. Ltd in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ophthalmiclenses.blogspot.co.at/2011/07/story-of-cr-39.html ''Story of CR-39!''] blogspot&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- {{citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;  A highly purified CR-39, manufactured under the name of TASTRAK, is available specifically for radio-dosimetry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5887">'''Clive Mather''' is the Chairman of the Board of Tearfund USA, the latest member of the global Tearfund family. 
In September 2018 he retired as Chairman of Tearfund after serving his full term of 10 years. During this time he visited Tearfund's work in 47 countries, encouraging partners and local churches. Tearfund  is a Christian relief and development agency "following Jesus where the need is greatest". It is committed to eradicating poverty through 3 primary channels. Firstly through its disaster relief capacity, it is able to bring front line emergency help to those communities ravaged by war, earthquake or other calamities. Secondly working  through it worldwide partners and a global network of local churches, it is able to transform families and communities by empowering the local church to mobilise resources that are available and inspire collective action to tackle poverty in all its forms. And thirdly through its advocacy, Tearfund highlights the impact of climate change, injustice and corruption on those least able to cope. It calls governments and global institutions to account, arguing for concerted global action and a fairer allocation of resources to meet the needs of the poor and oppressed. 

He serves as a Director of Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) which works to develop and commercialise technologies which will reduce carbon and other GHG emissions in Canada and beyond.

He is the President, Relational Peacebuilding Initiatives (RPI) based in Geneva, working to bring relational solutions to long standing conflict situations in various parts of the world. The current main focus is the Korean Peninsula. After 70 years of bitter division, North and South Korea have now begun political talks aimed at replacing recrimination with co-operation.  What is needed is a parallel process which will bring economic growth and social transformation to the whole Peninsula. RPI is already working behind the scenes to develop a partnership model that will enable North and South to agree together the values, goals and priorities in each of the main sectors of society. This is vital if economic progress is to be demonstrated in the short-term and the possibility of peaceful unification nurtured for the future.

In 2008 he was appointed Chairman of the Shell Pensions Trust Ltd, one of the biggest defined benefit pension funds in the UK. The Trust oversees the investment and management of the Shell Contributory Pension Fund, providing benefits for  40,000+ active and retired members of Royal Dutch Shell in the UK. He was also appointed Chairman of Shell's new UK defined contribution scheme, the UK Shell Pension Plan Trust Limited which started in 2013. He stepped down from both roles on 31st May 2018 after 10 years' service to the Funds.

In 2012, he was appointed Chairman of the Garden Tomb (Jerusalem) Association and stepped down in 2017 after serving his full term of 9 years as a Trustee. He is the former Chairman of [[Iogen Corp.|Iogen]] Corporation, a Canadian [[bio-technology]] company specialising in enzyme technology and based in Ottawa. Iogen is the leading producer of cellulosic ethanol. He served as a Director for 10 years of which 9 were as Chairman. He retired in July 2017.

Mather is a former employee of [[Royal Dutch Shell]].He joined Shell in the United Kingdom 1969 and retired in 2007.  His career included assignments in [[Brunei]], [[Gabon]], [[South Africa]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]] and the UK where he was Chairman of Shell UK Limited between 2002 and 2004. His last position was as President and [[CEO]] of Shell Canada Ltd based in [[Calgary]], prior to its take over by Royal Dutch Shell Limited.

Mather was formerly Chairman of the UK Government/Industry CSR Academy, Deputy Chairman of the Windsor Leadership Trust and Chairman of the IMD Business Advisory Council in Switzerland. He has held a number of public appointments in the UK including Commissioner for the Equal Opportunities Commission, Chairman of the Petroleum Employer’s Council and Chairman of the Lambeth Education Action Zone. In July 2009 he was appointed as one of the 12 members of the Premier's Council for Economic Strategy in Alberta. He has also served on the Royal Anniversary Trust for some 7 years. 

Mather was educated at Warwick School and Lincoln College, Oxford. He is a Companion of the Chartered Management Institute and Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. He speaks on issues of leadership, ethics, the environment and energy internationally.
==CABE Annual Hugh Kay Lecture 2013==
In November 2013 Mather gave a lecture in the Palace of Westminster to the Christian Association of Business Executives on the occasion of its 75th birthday. It was entitled "Time travel - has big business lost its compass?" For the full text see  http://www.cabe-online.org/

==Evangelical Alliance speech==
In October 2004 Mather gave a speech to the [[Evangelical Alliance]] in London entitled “Trust: Whose business is it” &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20060715120000/http://www.eauk.org/_values/trust/Mathertemple.pdf Text of speech]&lt;/ref&gt; during which he said “Meticulous compliance with all the new regulations is a must, but will not be enough. We have to try harder; we have to set the highest standards in everything we do, because trust is essential to our business.”

==Relationships Foundation==
Mather has been involved with the [[Relationships Foundation]] to whom he has said "Concern for relationships is a vital part of sustainable development – whether economic, environmental or social - and must feature in political debate and decision making".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27760">'''Compressible flow''' (gas dynamics) is the branch of [[fluid mechanics]] that deals with flows having significant changes in fluid [[density]]. Gases, mostly, display such behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;But see [[compressibility]] which lists compressibilities for water and some other liquids&lt;/ref&gt; While all flows are [[compressibility|compressible]], flows are usually treated as being [[incompressible flow|incompressible]] when the [[Mach number]] (the ratio of the speed of the flow to the speed of sound) is less than 0.3 (since the density change due to velocity is about 5% in that case). &lt;ref name="J.D. Anderson 2007"&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', 4th Ed., McGraw–Hill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of compressible flow is relevant to high-speed aircraft, jet engines, rocket motors, high-speed entry into a planetary atmosphere, gas pipelines, commercial applications such as abrasive blasting, and many other fields.

==History==
The study of gas dynamics is often associated with the flight of modern high-speed aircraft and atmospheric reentry of space-exploration vehicles; however, its origins lie with simpler machines. At the beginning of the 19th century, investigation into the behaviour of fired bullets led to improvement in the accuracy and capabilities of guns and artillery.&lt;ref name = "Text"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/potto/text.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As the century progressed, inventors such as [[Gustaf de Laval]] advanced the field, while researchers such as [[Ernst Mach]] sought to understand the physical phenomenon involved through experimentation.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the focus of gas dynamics research shifted to what would eventually become the aerospace industry. [[Ludwig Prandtl]] and his students proposed important concepts ranging from the [[boundary layer]] to supersonic [[shock wave]]s, [[supersonic wind tunnel]]s, and supersonic nozzle design.&lt;ref name = "Text"/&gt;  [[Theodore von Kármán]], a student of Prandtl, continued to improve the understanding of supersonic flow. Other notable figures ([[Theodor Meyer|Meyer]], Luigi Crocco, and [[Ascher H. Shapiro|Shapiro]]) also contributed significantly to the principles considered fundamental to the study of modern gas dynamics.  Many others also contributed to this field.

Accompanying the improved conceptual understanding of gas dynamics in the early 20th century was a public misconception that there existed a barrier to the attainable speed of aircraft, commonly referred to as the "[[sound barrier]]." In truth, the barrier to supersonic flight was merely a technological one, although it was a stubborn barrier to overcome. Amongst other factors, conventional aerofoils saw a dramatic increase in drag coefficient when the flow approached the speed of sound. Overcoming the larger drag proved difficult with contemporary designs, thus the perception of a sound barrier. However, aircraft design progressed sufficiently to produce the [[Bell X-1]]. Piloted by [[Chuck Yeager]], the X-1 officially achieved supersonic speed in October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter3.html|title=Research in Supersonic Flight and the Breaking of the Sound Barrier|first=John D. Anderson,|last=Jr.|date=|website=history.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, two parallel paths of research have been followed in order to further gas dynamics knowledge. Experimental gas dynamics undertakes wind tunnel model experiments and experiments in [[shock tube]]s and ballistic ranges with the use of optical techniques to document the findings. Theoretical gas dynamics considers the equations of motion applied to a variable-density gas, and their solutions.  Much of basic gas dynamics is analytical, but in the modern era [[Computational fluid dynamics]] applies computing power to solve the otherwise-intractable nonlinear partial differential equations of compressible flow for specific geometries and flow characteristics.

==Introductory concepts==
[[File:Breakdown of Fluid Mechanics Chart.png|thumb|right|Breakdown of fluid mechanics chart]]
There are several important assumptions involved in the underlying theory of compressible flow. All fluids are composed of molecules, but tracking a huge number of individual molecules in a flow (for example at atmospheric pressure) is unnecessary. Instead, the continuum assumption allows us to consider a flowing gas as a continuous substance except at low densities. This assumption provides a huge simplification which is accurate for most gas-dynamic problems. Only in the low-density realm of rarefied gas dynamics does the motion of individual molecules become important.

A related assumption is the [[no-slip condition]] where the flow velocity at a solid surface is presumed equal to the velocity of the surface itself, which is a direct consequence of assuming continuum flow. The no-slip condition implies that the flow is viscous, and as a result a [[boundary layer]] forms on bodies traveling through the air at high speeds, much as it does in low-speed flow.

Most problems in [[incompressible flow]] involve only two unknowns: pressure and velocity, which are typically found by solving the two equations that describe conservation of mass and of linear momentum, with the fluid density presumed constant. In compressible flow, however, the gas density and temperature also become variables. This requires two more equations in order to solve compressible-flow problems: an [[equation of state]] for the gas and a [[conservation of energy]] equation.  For the majority of gas-dynamic problems, the simple [[Ideal gas law]] is the appropriate state equation.

Fluid dynamics problems have two overall types of references frames, called Lagrangian and Eulerian (see [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]). The Lagrangian approach follows a fluid mass of fixed identity as it moves through a flowfield. The Eulerian reference frame, in contrast,  does not move with the fluid. Rather it is a fixed frame or control volume that fluid flows through. The Eulerian frame is most useful in a majority of compressible flow problems, but requires that the equations of motion be written in a compatible format.

Finally, although space is known to have 3 dimensions, an important simplification can be had in describing gas dynamics mathematically if only one spatial dimension is of primary importance, hence 1-dimensional flow is assumed.  This works well in duct, nozzle, and diffuser flows where the flow properties change mainly in the flow direction rather than perpendicular to the flow.  However, an important class of compressible flows, including the external flow over bodies traveling at high speed, requires at least a 2-dimensional treatment.  When all 3 spatial dimensions and perhaps the time dimension as well are important, we often resort to computerized solutions of the governing equations.

==Mach number, wave motion, and sonic speed== 
The [[Mach number]] (M) is defined as the ratio of the speed of an object (or of a flow) to the speed of sound. For instance, in air at room temperature, the speed of sound is about {{convert|340|m/s|abbr=on}}. M can range from 0 to ∞, but this broad range falls naturally into several flow regimes. These regimes are subsonic, [[transonic]], [[supersonic]], [[hypersonic]], and [[hypervelocity]] flow.  The figure below illustrates the Mach number "spectrum" of these flow regimes.
[[File:Mach Number Flow Regimes.png|thumb|center|400px|Mach number flow regimes spectrum]]

These flow regimes are not chosen arbitrarily, but rather arise naturally from the strong mathematical background that underlies compressible flow (see the cited reference textbooks). At very slow flow speeds the speed of sound is so much faster that it is mathematically ignored, and the Mach number is irrelevant. Once the speed of the flow approaches the speed of sound, however, the Mach number becomes all-important, and shock waves begin to appear.  Thus the transonic regime is described by a different (and much more difficult) mathematical treatment.  In the supersonic regime the flow is dominated by wave motion at oblique angles similar to the Mach angle. Above about Mach 5, these wave angles grow so small that a different mathematical approach is required, defining the [[Hypersonic speed]] regime.  Finally, at speeds comparable to that of planetary atmospheric entry from orbit, in the range of several km/s, the speed of sound is now comparatively so slow that it is once again mathematically ignored in the [[Hypervelocity]] regime.

As an object accelerates from subsonic toward supersonic speed in a gas, different types of wave phenomena occur. To illustrate these changes, the next figure shows a stationary point (M = 0) that emits symmetric sound waves.  The speed of sound is the same in all directions in a uniform fluid, so these waves are simply concentric spheres. As the sound-generating point begins to accelerate, the sound waves "bunch up" in the direction of motion and "stretch out" in the opposite direction. When the point reaches sonic speed (M = 1), it travels at the same speed as the sound waves it creates. Therefore, an infinite number of these sound waves "pile up" ahead of the point, forming a [[Shock wave]]. Upon achieving supersonic flow, the particle is moving so fast that it continuously leaves its sound waves behind. When this occurs, the locus of these waves trailing behind the point creates an angle known as the [[Mach wave]] angle or Mach angle, µ:

:&lt;math&gt; \mu = \arcsin(a/V) = \arcsin(1/M) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents the speed of sound in the gas and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; represents the velocity of the object. Although named for Austrian physicist [[Ernst Mach]], these oblique waves were actually first discovered by [[Christian Doppler]].&lt;ref name=Doppler-bio&gt;P. M. Schuster:''Moving the Stars: Christian Doppler - His Life, His Works and Principle and the World After'', Pollauberg, Austria:Living Edition Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Explanation of Sonic Motion.png|thumb|center|400px|Wave motion and the speed of sound]]

==One-dimensional flow==
One-dimensional (1-D) flow refers to flow of gas through a duct or channel in which the flow parameters are assumed to change significantly along only one spatial dimension, namely, the duct length. In analysing the 1-D channel flow, a number of assumptions are made: 
*Ratio of duct length to width (L/D) is ≤ about 5 (in order to neglect [[friction]] and [[heat transfer]]), 
*[[Fluid dynamics|Steady vs. Unsteady Flow]],
*Flow is [[isentropic]] (i.e. a reversible adiabatic process), 
*[[Ideal gas law]] (i.e. P=ρRT)

===Converging-diverging Laval nozzles===
As the speed of a flow accelerates from the subsonic to the supersonic regime, the physics of [[nozzle]] and diffuser flows is altered. Using the conservation laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, the following relationship for channel flow is developed (combined mass and momentum conservation):

:&lt;math&gt; dP(1-{M}^2) = \rho{V}^2\left(\frac {dA} {A}\right) &lt;/math&gt;, 
where dP is the differential change in pressure, M is the Mach number, ρ is the density of the gas, V is the velocity of the flow, A is the area of the duct, and dA is the change in area of the duct. This equation states that, for subsonic flow, a converging duct (dA&lt;0) increases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA&gt;0) decreases velocity of the flow. For supersonic flow, the opposite occurs due to the change of sign of (1-M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A converging duct (dA&lt;0) now decreases the velocity of the flow and a diverging duct (dA&gt;0) increases the velocity of the flow. At Mach = 1, a special case occurs in which the duct area must be either a maximum or minimum. For practical purposes, only a minimum area can accelerate flows to Mach 1 and beyond. See table of sub-supersonic diffusers and nozzles.
[[File:Sub-Supersonic Diffusers and Nozzles.png|thumb|center|Table showing the reversal in the physics of nozzles and diffusers with changing Mach numbers]]

Therefore, to accelerate a flow to Mach 1, a nozzle must be designed to converge to a minimum cross-sectional area and then expand. This type of nozzle – the converging-diverging nozzle – is called a [[de Laval nozzle]] after [[Gustaf de Laval]], who invented it. As subsonic flow enters the converging duct and the area decreases, the flow accelerates. Upon reaching the minimum area of the duct, also known as the throat of the nozzle, the flow can reach Mach 1. If the speed of the flow is to continue to increase, its density must decrease in order to obey conservation of mass. To achieve this decrease in density, the flow must expand, and to do so, the flow must pass through a diverging duct. See image of de Laval Nozzle.
[[File:Nozzle de Laval diagram.png|thumb|center|Nozzle de Laval diagram]]

===Maximum achievable velocity of a gas===
Ultimately, because of the energy conservation law, a gas is limited to a certain maximum velocity based on its energy content. The maximum velocity, V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, that a gas can attain is:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{max} = \sqrt {2c_{p} T_{t}} &lt;/math&gt;

where c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the specific heat of the gas and T&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[stagnation temperature]] of the flow.

===Isentropic flow Mach number relationships===
Using conservations laws and thermodynamics, a number of relationships of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{{\text{property}_1}}{{\text{property}_2}}=f(M,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt;
 
can be obtained, where M is the Mach number and γ is the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air). See table of isentropic flow Mach number relationships. 
[[File:Isentropic Flow Relations Table.PNG|thumb|center|Isentropic flow relationship table. Equations to relate the field properties in isentropic flow.]]

===Achieving supersonic flow===
As previously mentioned, in order for a flow to become supersonic, it must pass through a duct with a minimum area, or sonic throat. Additionally, an overall pressure ratio, P&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, of approximately 2 is needed to attain Mach 1. Once it has reached Mach 1, the flow at the throat is said to be "[[choked flow|choked]]." Because changes downstream can only move upstream at sonic speed, the mass flow through the nozzle cannot be affected by changes in downstream conditions after the flow is choked.

===Non-isentropic 1D channel flow of a gas - normal shock waves===
Normal shock waves are shock waves that are perpendicular to the local flow direction. These shock waves occur when pressure waves build up and coalesce into an extremely thin shockwave that converts useful energy into heat.  The waves thus overtake and reinforce one another, forming a finite shock wave from an infinite series of infinitesimal sound waves. Because a loss of energy occurs over the thin shock wave, the shock is considered non-isentropic and [[enthalpy]] increases across the shock. When analysing a normal shock wave, one-dimensional, steady, and adiabatic (stagnation temperature does not change across the shock wave) flow of a perfect gas is assumed.

[[File:Rankine-Hugoniot Relationships.PNG|thumb|center|The Rankine-Hugoniot equations relate conditions before and after a normal shock wave.]]

Normal shock waves can occur in two reference frames: the standing normal shock and the moving shock.  The flow before a normal shock wave must be supersonic, and the flow after a normal shock must be subsonic. The Rankine-Hugoniot equations are used to solve for the flow conditions..

==Two-dimensional flow==
Although one-dimensional flow can be directly analysed, it is merely a specialized case of two-dimensional flow. It follows that one of the defining phenomena of one-dimensional flow, a normal shock, is likewise only a special case of a larger class of [[oblique shock]]s. Further, the name "normal" is with respect to geometry rather than frequency of occurrence. Oblique shocks are much more common in applications such as: aircraft inlet design, objects in supersonic flight, and (at a more fundamental level) supersonic nozzles and diffusers. Depending on the flow conditions, an oblique shock can either be attached to the flow or detached from the flow in the form of a [[bow shock (aerodynamics)|bow shock]].

{|style="margin: 0 auto;"

| [[File:Bowshock example - blunt body.jpg|thumb|right|Bowshock example for a blunt body]]
|}

===Oblique shock waves===
[[File:Oblique Shock Wave.JPG|thumb|Diagram of obstruction]]
Oblique shock waves are similar to normal shock waves, but they occur at angles less than 90° with the direction of flow.  When a disturbance is introduced to the flow at a nonzero angle (δ), the flow must respond to the changing boundary conditions. Thus an oblique shock is formed, resulting in a change in the direction of the flow.

[[File:Shock polar diagram.jpg|thumb|Shock polar diagram]]

====Shock polar diagram====
Based on the level of flow deflection (δ), oblique shocks are characterized as either strong or weak. Strong shocks are characterized by larger deflection and more entropy loss across the shock, with weak shocks as the opposite. In order to gain cursory insight into the differences in these shocks, a shock polar diagram can be used. With the static temperature after the shock, T*, known the speed of sound after the shock is defined as,
:&lt;math&gt; {A}^*= \sqrt{\gamma R{T}^*} &lt;/math&gt;

with R as the gas constant and γ as the specific heat ratio. The Mach number can be broken into Cartesian coordinates
:&lt;math&gt; {M}^*_{2x} = \frac{{V_x}}{{{a}^*}}&lt;/math&gt;               
:&lt;math&gt; {M}^*_{2y} = \frac{{V_y}}{{{a}^*}}&lt;/math&gt;

with V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; as the x and y-components of the fluid velocity V. With the Mach number before the shock given, a locus of conditions can be specified. At some δ &lt;sub&gt; max &lt;/sub&gt; the flow transitions from a strong to weak oblique shock. With δ = 0°, a normal shock is produced at the limit of the strong oblique shock and the Mach wave is produced at the limit of the weak shock wave.

====Oblique shock reflection====
Due to the inclination of the shock, after an oblique shock is created, it can interact with a boundary in three different manners, two which are explained below.

=====Solid boundary=====
Incoming flow is first turned by angle δ with respect to the flow. This shockwave is reflected off the solid boundary, and the flow is turned by – δ to again be parallel with the boundary. It is important to note that each progressive shock wave is weaker and the wave angle is increased.

=====Irregular reflection=====
An irregular reflection is much like the case described above, with the caveat that δ is larger than the maximum allowable turning angle. Thus a detached shock is formed and a more complicated reflection occurs.

===Prandtl-Meyer fans===

Prandtl-Meyer fans can be expressed as both compression and expansion fans. Prandtl-Meyer fans also cross a boundary layer (i.e. flowing and solid) which reacts in different changes as well. When a shock wave hits a solid surface the resulting fan returns as one from the opposite family while when one hits a free boundary the fan returns as a fan of opposite type.

====Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans====
[[File:Prandtl-Meyer Expansion.jpg|thumb|Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan diagram]]
To this point, the only flow phenomena that have been discussed are shock waves, which slow the flow and increase its entropy. It is possible to accelerate supersonic flow in what has been termed a [[Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan]], after Ludwig Prandtl and Theodore Meyer. The mechanism for the expansion is shown in the figure below.

As opposed to the flow encountering an inclined obstruction and forming an oblique shock, the flow expands around a convex corner and forms an expansion fan through a series of isentropic Mach waves. The expansion "fan" is composed of Mach waves that span from the initial Mach angle to the final Mach angle. Flow can expand around either a sharp or rounded corner equally, as the increase in Mach number is proportional to only the convex angle of the passage (δ). The expansion corner that produces the Prandtl-Meyer fan can be sharp (as illustrated in the figure) or rounded. If the total turning angle is the same, then the P-M flow solution is also the same.

The Prandtl-Meyer expansion can be seen as the physical explanation of the operation of the Laval nozzle. The contour of the nozzle creates a smooth and continuous series of Prandtl-Meyer expansion waves.

====Prandtl-Meyer compression fans====
[[File:Prandtl-Meyer Compression Fan.JPG|thumb|Basic PM compression diagram]]
A Prandtl-Meyer compression is the opposite phenomenon to a Prandtl-Meyer expansion. If the flow is gradually turned through an angle of δ, a compression fan can be formed. This fan is a series of Mach waves that eventually coalesce into an oblique shock. Because the flow is defined by an isentropic region (flow that travels through the fan) and an anisentropic region (flow that travels through the oblique shock), a slip line results between the two flow regions.

==Applications==

===Supersonic wind tunnels===
[[Supersonic wind tunnel]]s are used for testing and research in supersonic flows, approximately over the Mach number range of 1.2 to 5. The operating principle behind the wind tunnel is that a large pressure difference is maintained upstream to downstream, driving the flow.

[[File:SWT alt.JPG|thumb|center|600px|Supersonic wind tunnel classification list]]

Wind tunnels can be divided into two categories: continuous-operating and intermittent-operating wind tunnels. Continuous operating supersonic wind tunnels require an independent electrical power source that drastically increases with the size of the test section. Intermittent supersonic wind tunnels are less expensive in that they store electrical energy over an extended period of time, then discharge the energy over a series of brief tests. The difference between these two is analogous to the comparison between a battery and a capacitor.

{|style="margin: 0 auto;"
|[[File:Supersonic-en.svg|thumb|center|none|Blowdown supersonic wind tunnel schematic]]
|[[File:Langley hypersonic wind tunnels.jpg|thumb|none|center|Langley indraft supersonic wind tunnel vacuum sphere]]
|}

Blowdown type supersonic wind tunnels offer high Reynolds number, a small storage tank, and readily available dry air. However, they cause a high pressure hazard, result in difficulty holding a constant stagnation pressure, and are noisy during operation.

Indraft supersonic wind tunnels are not associated with a pressure hazard, allow a constant stagnation pressure, and are relatively quiet. Unfortunately, they have a limited range for the Reynolds number of the flow and require a large vacuum tank.
There is no dispute that knowledge is gained through research and testing in supersonic wind tunnels; however, the facilities often require vast amounts of power to maintain the large pressure ratios needed for testing conditions. For example, [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] has the largest supersonic wind tunnel in the world and requires the power required to light a small city for operation. For this reason, large wind tunnels are becoming less common at universities.

===Supersonic aircraft inlets===
Perhaps the most common application for oblique shocks is in high-speed aircraft [[inlet cone|inlets]]. The purpose of the inlet is to slow incoming supersonic flow to the subsonic regime before it enters the turbojet engine, with the caveat of minimizing losses across the shock. Knowledge of normal and oblique shocks suggests that this be accomplished with a series of weakening oblique shocks followed by a very weak normal shock, usually less than M = 1.4. 
This may sound relatively straightforward, but there is one rather large issue to be dealt with when designing a supersonic aircraft inlet: acceleration. Between taking off, manoeuvring, and cruising, an aircraft travels at a range of Mach numbers. In order to ensure efficient flight, the aircraft intake must be capable of variable geometry. If it is not, the shock waves will not reflect properly through the inlet and negatively affect performance.

{|style="margin: 0 auto;"
|[[File:McDonnell Douglas F-15C with the conformal FAST PACK fuel tanks 060905-F-1234S-017.jpg|thumb|McDonnell Douglas F-15C]]
|[[File:Concorde on Bristol.jpg|thumb|Concorde]]
|[[File:Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.jpg|thumb|Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]]
|}

Although variable geometry is a universally recognized approach to improve aircraft efficiency and performance over a range of Mach numbers, there is no one method to achieve variable geometry. The [[F-15 Eagle]] employs wedge inlets with adjustable flaps to control the flow. For subsonic flow, the flaps are completely closed and for supersonic flow, the flaps are open. The [[Concorde]] employed an external-compression inlet, using a series of oblique shocks followed by a normal shock to slow the flow sufficiently for the [[turbojet]] engine. Perhaps the most recognizable supersonic aircraft, the [[SR-71]], used a hydraulically actuated cone to reduce the speed of the supersonic flow through the aircraft inlet.

A '''counterion''' (pronounced as two words, i.e. "counter" "ion", and sometimes written as two words) is the [[ion]] that accompanies an ionic species in order to maintain electric neutrality. In table salt (NaCl), the sodium [[cation]] is the counterion for the chlorine [[anion]] and vice versa.
&lt;!-- not very helpful to typical reader: Counterions are generally vaguely defined in biological systems.  Depending on their charge, proteins are associated with a variety of smaller anions and cations.  In plant cells, the anion malate is often accumulated in the vacuole to decrease water potential and drive cell expansion. To maintain neutrality, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are often accumulated as the counterion.  Ion permeation through hydrophobic cell walls is mediated by ion transport channels.  Nucleic acids are anionic, the corresponding cations are often protonated [[polyamine]]s.--&gt;

==Interfacial chemistry==
Counterions are the mobile ions in ion exchange polymers and [[colloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01371.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ion exchange resin]]s are polymers with a net negative or positive charge.  Cation exchange resins consist of an anionic polymer with countercations, typically [[sodium|Na&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;]].  The resin has a higher affinity for highly charged countercations, e.g., by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of [[water softening]].  Complementarily, anion exchange resins are typically provided in the form of chloride, which is a highly mobile couteranion.

Counterions are used in [[phase-transfer catalysis]].  In a typical application lipophilic countercation such as [[Benzalkonium chloride|benzalkonium]] solubilizes reagents in organic solvents.

==Solution chemistry==
Solubility of salts in organic solvents is a function of both the cation and the anion.  The solubility of cations in organic solvents can be enhanced when the anion is lipophilic. Similarly, the solubility of anions in organic solvents is enhanced with lipophilic cations.  The most common lipophilic cations are [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s, called "quat salts".

Many cationic organometallic complexes are isolated with inert, noncoordinating counterions.  [[Ferrocenium tetrafluoroborate]] is one such example.

==Electrochemistry==
In order to achieve high ionic conductivity, electrochemical measurements are conducted in the presence of excess electrolyte.  In water the electrolyte is often a simple salt such as [[potassium chloride]].  For measurements in nonaqueous solutions, salts composed of both lipophilic cations and anions are employed, e.g., [[tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate]].  Even in such cases potentials are influenced by [[ion-pairing]], an effect that is accentuated in solvents of low [[dielectric constant]].&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, W.

==Counterion stability==
For many applications, the counterion simply provides charge and lipophilicity that allows manipulation of its partner ion.  The counterion is expected to be chemically inert.  For counteranions, inertness is expressed in terms of low [[Lewis base|Lewis basicity]].  The counterions are ideally rugged and unreactive. For quaternary ammonium and phosphonium countercations, inertness is related to their resistance of degradation by strong bases and strong nucleophiles.

[[File:CZ brilliant.jpg|right|frame|A round [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliant-cut]] cubic zirconia]]

'''Cubic zirconia''' ('''CZ''') is the cubic crystalline form of [[zirconium dioxide]] (ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The synthesized material is hard, optically flawless and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with [[zircon]], which is a [[zirconium silicate]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). It is sometimes erroneously called ''cubic zirconium''.

Because of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to [[diamond]], synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most [[gemology|gemologically]] and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic [[gemstone]] is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic [[moissanite]].

==Technical aspects==
Cubic zirconia is [[crystallography|crystallographically]] [[cubic (crystal system)|isometric]], an important attribute of a would-be diamond simulant. During synthesis zirconium oxide would naturally form [[monoclinic]] [[crystal]]s, its stable form under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer is required for cubic crystals to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; this may be typically either [[yttrium]] or [[calcium]] oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.

It is a dense substance, with a [[specific gravity]] between 5.6 and 6.0 — at least 1.6 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8–8.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]— slightly harder than most semi-precious natural [[gemstone|gems]].&lt;ref name="Mohs' Hardness of Abrasives"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.reade.com/resources/reference-charts-particle-property-briefings/851-mohs-hardness-of-abrasives| title = Mohs' Hardness of Abrasives| accessdate = 6 June 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091017120910/http://www.reade.com/resources/reference-charts-particle-property-briefings/851-mohs-hardness-of-abrasives| archivedate = 17 October 2009| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[refractive index]] is high at 2.15–2.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] is [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Adamantine lustre|adamantine]]. Its [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]] and exhibits a [[conchoidal fracture]]. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered [[Brittleness|brittle]].

Under shortwave [[UV]] cubic zirconia typically [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] a yellow, greenish yellow or "beige". Under longwave UV the effect is greatly diminished, with a whitish glow sometimes being seen. Colored stones may show a strong, complex [[rare earth element|rare earth]] [[absorption spectrum]].

==History==
Discovered in 1892, the yellowish monoclinic mineral [[baddeleyite]] is a natural form of zirconium oxide.&lt;ref name= Bayanova/&gt;

The high melting point of zirconia (2750&amp;nbsp;°C or 4976&amp;nbsp;°F) hinders controlled growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product ''stabilized zirconia'' introduced in 1929. Although cubic, it was in the form of a [[polycrystalline]] [[ceramic]]: it was used as a [[refractory]] material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540&amp;nbsp;°C or 4604&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=growth/&gt;

In 1937, German [[mineralogy|mineralogists]] M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba discovered naturally occurring cubic zirconia in the form of microscopic grains included in [[metamictization|metamict]] zircon. This was thought to be a byproduct of the metamictization process, but the two scientists did not think the mineral important enough to give it a formal name. The discovery was confirmed through [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]], proving the existence of a natural counterpart to the synthetic product.&lt;ref name=chudoba/&gt;&lt;ref name=chic&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding more about Cubic Zirconia|url=http://chicjewelry.com/blog/understanding-more-about-cubic-zirconia/|publisher=Chic Jewelry|accessdate=6 December 2013|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214145340/http://chicjewelry.com/blog/understanding-more-about-cubic-zirconia/|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the majority of [[crystal growth|grown]] diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in [[lasers]] and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic [[strontium titanate]], synthetic [[rutile]], [[YAG]] ([[yttrium]] [[aluminium]] [[garnet]]) and [[gadolinium gallium garnet|GGG]] ([[gadolinium]] [[gallium]] garnet).

Some of the earliest research into controlled single-crystal growth of cubic zirconia occurred in 1960s France, much work being done by Y. Roulin and R. Collongues. This technique involved molten zirconia being contained within a thin shell of still-solid zirconia, with crystal growth from the melt. The process was named ''cold crucible'', an allusion to the system of water cooling used. Though promising, these attempts yielded only small crystals.

Later, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists under V. V. Osiko at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in Moscow perfected the technique, which was then named ''[[skull crucible]]'' (an allusion either to the shape of the water-cooled container or to the form of crystals sometimes grown). They named the jewel ''Fianit'' after the institute's name [[Lebedev Physical Institute|FIAN]] (Physical Institute of the Academy of Science), but the name was not used outside of the USSR. Their breakthrough was published in 1973, and commercial production began in 1976.&lt;ref name=Hesse/&gt; In 1977 cubic zirconia begun to be mass-produced in the jewelry marketplace by the Ceres Corporation with crystals stabilized with 94% yttria. Other major producers include Taiwan Crystal Company Ltd, Swarovsi and ICT inc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zirconia|last=|first=|publisher=Mitchell Market Reports|year=1993|isbn=|editor-last=Fletcher|editor-first=Andrew|edition=3|volume=1|location=ScienceDirect|pages=31–93|chapter="7.7 Glass and Gemstones."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chic/&gt; By 1980 annual global production had reached 60 million [[Carat (unit)|carats]] (12 tonnes)and continued to increase with production reaching around 400 tpa in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because the natural form of cubic zirconia is so rare, all cubic zirconia used in jewelry has been synthesized, or created by humans.

==Synthesis==
[[Image:1000kwCZLpKelley.jpg|thumb|Worker monitoring melting zirconium oxide and yttrium oxide in an induction heated "cold crucible" to create cubic zirconia.]]

Currently the primary method of cubic zirconia synthesis employed by producers remains to be through the skull-melting method. This method was patented by Josep F. Wenckus and coworkers (1997). This is largely due to the process allowing for temperatures of over 3000 degrees to be achieved, lack of contact between crucible and material as well as the freedom to choose any gas atmosphere. Primary downsides to this method include the inability to predict the size of the crystals produced and it is impossible to control the crystallization process through temperature changes.&lt;ref name="growth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The apparatus used in this process consists of a cup-shaped crucible surrounded by radio-frequency (RF) activated copper coils and a water-cooling system.&lt;ref name="growth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Zirconium dioxide thoroughly mixed with a stabilizer (normally  10% [[Yttrium(III) oxide|yttrium oxide]]) is fed into a cold crucible. Metallic chips of either zirconium or the stabilizer are introduced into the powder mix in a compact pile manner. The RF generator is switched on and the metallic chips quickly start heating up and readily oxidize into more zirconia. Consequently, the surrounding powder heats up by thermal conduction and begins melting, which in turn becomes electroconductive and thus it begins to heat up via the RF generator as well. This continues until the entire product is molten. Due to the cooling system surrounding the crucible, a thin shell of sintered solid material is formed. This causes the molten zirconia to remain contained within its own powder which prevents it from contamination from the crucible and reduces heat loss. The melt is left at high temperatures for some hours to ensure homogeneity and ensure all impurities have evaporated. Finally, the entire crucible is slowly removed from the RF coils to reduce the heating and let it slowly cool down (from bottom to top). The rate at which the crucible is removed from the RF coils is chosen as a function of the stability of crystallization dictated by the phase transition diagram. This provokes the crystallization process to begin and useful crystals begin to form. Once the crucible has been completely cooled to room temperature, the resulting crystals are multiple elongated-crystalline blocks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The reason behind this shape is dictated by a concept known as crystal degeneration according to Tiller. The size and diameter of the obtained crystals is a function of the cross-sectional area of the crucible, volume of the melt and composition of the melt.&lt;ref name="growth" /&gt; The diameter of the crystals is heavily influenced by the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;Y2O3&lt;/chem&gt;stabilizer.

=== Phase relations in zirconia solids solutions  ===
When observing the [[phase diagram]] the cubic phase will crystallize first as the solution is cooled down no matter the [[concentration]] of &lt;chem&gt;Y2O3&lt;/chem&gt;. If the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;Y2O3&lt;/chem&gt; isn’t high enough the cubic structure will start to break down into the tetragonal state which will then break down into a monoclinic phase. If the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;Y2O3&lt;/chem&gt; is between 2.5-5% the resulting product will be PSZ (partially stabilized zirconia) while monophasic cubic crystals will form from around 8-40%. It should be noted that below 14% at low growth rates tend to be opaque indicating partial phase separation in the solid solution (likely due to diffusion in the crystals remaining in the high temperature region for a longer time). Above this threshold crystals tend to remain clear at reasonable growth rates and maintains good annealing conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Doping ===
Because of cubic zirconia's isomorphic capacity it can be doped with several elements to change the color of the crystal. A list of specific dopants and colors produced by their addition can be seen below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Primary growth defects ===
The vast majority of YCZ (yttrium bearing cubic zirconia) crystals clear with high optical perfection and with gradients of the refractive index lower than &lt;math&gt;5\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However some samples contain defects with the most characteristic and common ones listed below.

* Growth striations: These are located perpendicular to the growth direction of the crystal and is caused mainly by either fluctuations in the crystal growth rate or the non-congruent nature of liquid-solid transition, thus leading to nonuniform distribution of &lt;chem display="inline"&gt;Y2O3&lt;/chem&gt;.

* Light scattering phase inclusions: Caused by contaminants in the crystal (primarily precipitates of silicates or aluminates of yttrium) typically of magnitude 0.03-10 μm.

* Mechanical stresses: Typically caused from the high temperature gradients of the growth and cooling processes causing the crystal to form with internal mechanical stresses acting on it. This causes refractive index values of up to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;8\times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; although the effect of this can be reduced by annealing at 2100&amp;nbsp;°C followed by a slow enough cooling process.

* Dislocations: Similar to mechanical stresses, dislocations can be greatly reduced by annealing.

== Uses outside jewelry ==
Due to its optical properties YCZ (yttrium cubic zirconia) has been used for window, lenses, prisms, filters and laser elements. Particularly in the chemical industry it is used as window material for the monitoring of corrosive liquids due to its chemical stability and mechanical toughness. YCZ has also been used as a substrate for semiconductor and superconductor films in similar industries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mechanical properties of partially stabilized zirconia (high hardness and shock resistance, low friction coefficient, high chemical and thermal resistance as well as high wear and tear resistance) allow it to be used as a very particular building material. Particularly in the bio-engineering industry, it has been used to make reliable super sharp medical scalpels for doctors that are compatible with bio tissues and contain an edge much smoother than one made of steel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Innovations==
In recent years manufacturers have sought ways of distinguishing their product by supposedly "improving" cubic zirconia. Coating finished cubic zirconia with a film of [[diamond-like carbon]] (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using [[chemical vapor deposition]]. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess [[Dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in gemology|fire]] of cubic zirconia, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, because of the high percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]].

Another technique first applied to [[quartz]] and [[topaz]] has also been adapted to cubic zirconia: vacuum-sputtering an extremely thin layer of a precious metal (typically [[gold]]) or even certain metal oxides or nitrides amongst other coatings onto the finished stones creates an [[iridescence|iridescent]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designer Enhanced Gemstones|url=http://azotic.us/gems.php|publisher=Azotic Coating Technology, Inc |accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material is marketed as "mystic" by many dealers. Unlike diamond-like carbon and other hard synthetic ceramic coatings, the effect is not durable with decorative precious metal coatings due to their extremely low hardness compared to the substrate along with poor abrasion wear properties.

==Cubic zirconia versus diamond==
There are a few key features of cubic zirconia which distinguish it from diamond:

[[File:Diamond face trigons scale.jpg|thumb|alt=A triangular facet of a crystal having triangular etch pits with the largest having a base length of about 0.2 mm|One face of an uncut octahedral diamond, showing trigons (of positive and negative relief) formed by natural [[Chemical milling|chemical etching]]]]

*Hardness: cubic zirconia has a rating of approximately 8 on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]] vs. a rating of 10 for diamond.&lt;ref name="Mohs' Hardness of Abrasives"/&gt; This causes sharp edges in cut crystals to dull and round off in CZ, while with diamond the edges remain sharp. Furthermore, when polished, diamond will rarely show polish marks and those seen will travel in different directions on adjoining facets while CZ will show polishing marks along the same direction of the polish.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*[[Specific gravity]]: the density of cubic zirconia is about 1.7 times that of diamond. This difference allows skilled gem identifiers to tell the difference between the two by weight. This property can also be exploited by dropping the stones in heavy liquids and compare their relative sink times (diamond will sink more slowly than CZ).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   
*[[Refractive index]]: cubic zirconia has a refractive index of 2.15–2.18, compared to a diamond's 2.42. This led to the development of immersion techniques of identification. In this method, stones with refractive indices higher than that of the liquid used will have dark borders around the girdle and light facet edges while those with indices lower than the liquid will have light borders around the girdle and dark facet junctions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*[[dispersion (optics)|Dispersion]] is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding a diamond's 0.044.
*Cut: cubic zirconia gemstones may be cut differently from diamonds. The facet edges can be rounded or "smooth".
*Color: only the rarest of diamonds are truly colorless, most having a tinge of yellow or brown to some extent. A cubic zirconia is often entirely colorless: equivalent to a perfect "D" on [[Diamond color|diamond's color]] grading scale. Other desirable colors of cubic zirconia can be produced including near colorless, yellow, pink, purple, green, and even multicolored.
* Thermal conductivity: Cubic zirconia is a thermal insulator whereas diamond is a very good thermal conductor. This provided the basis for Wenckus’ identification method (currently the most successful identification method)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cubic zirconia and the diamond market ==
Cubic zirconia, as a diamond substituent and jewel competitor, has been seen as a potential solution against conflict diamonds and the controversy surrounding the rarity and value of diamonds.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://priceonomics.com/post/45768546804/diamonds-are-bullshit|title=Diamonds Are Bullshit|last=Dhar|first=Robin|date=19 March 2013|website=Priceonomics|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/03/why-smart-people-buy-cubic-zirconia-engagement-rings/#70ca7ca7594f|title=Why Smart People Buy Cubic Zirconia Engagement Rings|last=Muller|first=Richard|date=3 July 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the latter, the main argument presented being that the paradigm where diamonds were seen as rare due to their visual beauty is no longer the case and instead has been replaced by an artificially rarity reflected in their price.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is attributed to confirmed evidence that there were price-fixing practices taken by the major producers of rough diamonds, in majority attributed to [[De Beers|De Beers Company]] known as to holding a monopoly on the market from the 1870s to early 2000s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/2921462|title=The Diamond Cartel|last=Johannesburg|first=|last2=Windhoek|date=15 July 2004|website=The Economist|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company plead guilty to these charges in an Ohio court in 13 July 2004 .&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, De Beers and Co do not have as much power over the market, the price of diamonds continues to increase due to the increased demand in emerging markets such as India and China.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, with the emergence of artificial stones, such as cubic zirconia, that have optic properties highly similar to that of diamonds (see section above), it has been presented that these could be a better alternative for jewelry buyers given their lower price and unconvoluted history.

A closely related issue to this monopoly was the emergence of conflict diamonds. The [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberley Process]] was established in order to deter the illicit trade of diamonds to fund civil wars in [[Angola]] and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/blood-diamonds/|title=Blood Diamonds|last=Baker|first=Aryn|date=|website=Time|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been shown that KP is not as effective in decreasing the number of [[Blood diamond|conflict diamonds]] reaching the European and American markets. The main problem being its definition is too narrow and does not properly include forced labor conditions or human right violations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brilliantearth.com/news/how-to-beat-the-smugglers-and-stop-blood-diamonds/|title=A Simple Way To Stop Blood Diamonds|last=k.|first=Greg|date=2 December 2014|website=Brilliant Earth|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study from the [[Enough Project]], showed that groups in the Central African Republic have reaped between US$3 millions and US$6 millions annually from blood diamonds .&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2043572/why-illicit-diamond-trade-almost-gone-not-yet-forgotten|title=Why the illicit diamond trade is (almost) gone, but not yet forgotten|last=|first=|date=21 February 2017|website=SCMP|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN reports shows that more than US$24 millions in conflict diamonds have been smuggled since the establishment of the KP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-un-panel/gold-diamonds-fuelling-conflict-in-central-african-republic-u-n-panel-idUSKBN0IO21420141105|title=Gold, diamonds fuelling conflict in Central African Republic: U.N. panel|last=Flynn|first=Daniel|date=5 November 2014|website=Reuters|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond substituents therefore have become an alternative to boycott altogether the funding of such unethical practices.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cubic-zirconia-cz-platinum-/blog/tag/blood-diamonds/|title=Blood Diamonds|last=|first=|date=8 May 2013|website=Cubic Zirconia Platinum Jewelry|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms have emerged for these artificial stones such as “Eco-friendly Jewelry” that define them as conflict free origin and environmentally sustainable .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brides.com/gallery/moissanite-engagement-rings|title=15 Moissanite Engagement Rings for the Eco-Friendly Bride|last=Hoffower|first=Hillary|date=21 April 2018|website=Brides|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, concerns from mining countries such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] are that a boycott in purchases of diamonds would only worsen their economy. According to the Ministry of Mines in Congo, 10% of its population relies in the income from diamonds.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Therefore, it is argued that in the short term diamonds substituents could be an alternative to reduce conflict around the market of diamond mining but a long term solution would be establish a more rigorous system of identifying the origin of these stones.

[[Tornado intensity and damage|Tornado damage]] to human-made structures is a result of the high wind velocity and windblown debris.  [[Tornado|Tornadic]] winds have been measured in excess of 300&amp;nbsp;mph (480&amp;nbsp;km/h).  Tornadoes are a serious hazard to life and limb.  As such, people in tornado-prone areas often adopt plans of action in case a tornado approaches.

== Tornadoes in society ==
[[Image:OZ5-2-94.JPG|thumb|250px|Cyclone as metaphor for political change in the [[United States House elections, 1894|1894 United States elections]]; the farm woman taking shelter is labeled 'Democratic Party'.  ''Puck'' magazine (1894)]]
[[Storm cellar]]s are often used as a means of shelter in case of tornadoes or [[tropical cyclone]]s.  Common in tornado-prone areas, they have been around for more than 100 years&amp;mdash;even referenced in the famous 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Consisting either of a simple underground room, or an elaborate above-ground bunker, they are usually small rooms, designed to keep debris from entering and causing injury.  When properly constructed, they can survive an '''[[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF5]]''' tornado.  While it is unknown how many lives have been saved by storm cellars, the number is undoubtedly high.&lt;ref name="USA Today storm cellar"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/safety/saferoom.htm | work=USA Today | title=Shelter weathers deadly Okla. tornadoes | date=2005-05-20 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals and [[hobbyist]]s, known as [[storm chasing|storm chasers]], enjoy pursuing thunderstorms and tornadoes to explore their many visual and scientific aspects.  Attempts have been made by some storm chasers from educational and scientific institutions to drop probes in the path of oncoming tornadoes in an effort to analyze the interior of the storms, but only about five drops have been successful since around 1990. 

Due to the relative rarity and large scale of destructive power that tornadoes possess, their occurrence or the possibility that they may occur can often create what could be considered [[sensationalistic|sensationalism]] in their reporting.  This results in so-called [[weather wars]], in which competing local media outlets, particularly TV news stations, engage in continually escalating technological one-upsmanship and drama in order to increase their market share.  This is especially evident in tornado-prone markets, such as those in the [[Great Plains]].

According to [[Environment Canada]], the chances of being ''killed'' by a tornado are 12 million to 1 (12,000,000:1). One may revise this yearly and/or regionally, but the probability may be factually stated to be low. Regardless, tornadoes cause millions of dollars in damage, both economic and physical, many deaths, and hundreds of injuries every year.&lt;ref name="severe plot"&gt;Data from the [[Storm Prediction Center]] archives, which are accessible through [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/software/svrplot2/ SeverePlot], free software created and maintained by [[John Hart (meteorologist)|John Hart]], lead forecaster for the SPC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Environment Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/air/summersevere/ae00s02.en.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309011307/http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/air/summersevere/ae00s02.en.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-03-09 |title=Tornadoes |accessdate=2007-01-17 |author=[[Environment Canada]] |year=2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The tornado has been used by [[cartoonist]]s for over 100 years as a [[metaphor]] for political upheaval.  The [[storm cellar]] has also been used as a metaphor for seeking safety, as shown in the cartoon from 1894 at right.

According to [[political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|political interpretations]] of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the tornado takes [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] to a [[utopia]], the [[Land of Oz]], and kills the [[Wicked Witch of the East]], who had oppressed "the little people", the [[Munchkin]]s.&lt;ref name="MoneyPoliticsOz"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Money and Politics in the Land of Oz  | author = Quentin P.

A 1960s [[advertising campaign]] for the [[detergent|household cleaner]], [[Ajax cleanser|Ajax]], claimed the product "Cleans like a white tornado".&lt;ref name="Ajaxad"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.tvparty.com/g2c/whttornado.ram| title = Ajax washing liquid| accessdate = 2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous athletic teams across the United States employ a tornado for their mascot.  There are 124 high schools, colleges, and professional sports teams that use "Tornadoes," or a variant, as their team nicknames. Another 68 teams use "Cyclones" (a common colloquialism for "tornado" in parts of the U.S.) or a form thereof.&lt;ref name="Team Nicknames"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.mascotdb.com/| title = Team Mascots| accessdate = February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2010, an extratropical disturbance developed in the western [[Gulf of Alaska]], along a [[stationary front]].&lt;ref name="December 2010 Aleutian Low forms"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/05/2010&amp;selmap=2010120506&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few days, the system rapidly intensified, while channeling smaller winter storms and moisture from the [[Pineapple Express]] [[atmospheric river]] in the west coast of North America, before approaching the North American west coast itself on December 8.&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm nears North American coast"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/08/2010&amp;selmap=2010120800&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, a new low pressure area formed to the south of [[Alaska]] in the storm system's circulation,&lt;ref name="New Aleutian Low develops"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/09/2010&amp;selmap=2010120912&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the dominant low of the storm on December 11, when the original low pressure center dissipated over the coast of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/11/2010&amp;selmap=2010121109&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; During the next few days, the storm system slowly looped back westward while slowly strengthening,&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm executes a loop in the Gulf of Alaska"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/12/2010&amp;selmap=2010121200&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; before moving back towards the West Coast on December 13.&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm returns to Alaska"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/13/2010&amp;selmap=2010121303&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the storm system channeled more moisture into the Pacific Northwest and other neighboring regions, triggering flooding in some areas. After stalling for a day, on December 14, the central circulation split again, with the original center of circulation intensifying and moving ashore,&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm circulation splits"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/14/2010&amp;selmap=2010121412&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; while the new low stalled in the northern Gulf of Alaska became the dominant low of the storm.&lt;ref name="New low in Gulf of Alaska takes over"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/15/2010&amp;selmap=2010121506&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, the Aleutian Low opened up a large [[atmospheric river]] (the [[Pineapple Express]]) again, over California, which fed the storm system moisture, allowing it to strengthen significantly. This in turn brought torrents of rain and occasional gusts of wind, while the main storm itself slowly strengthened while stalling in the Gulf of Alaska.&lt;ref name="Aleutian low opens up another atmospheric river"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/15/2010&amp;selmap=2010121512&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; By December 15, a powerful [[Kona low]] (which would later become [[Tropical Storm Omeka]]) had also set up near [[Hawaii]], feeding additional moisture into the Pineapple Express, which in turn strengthened the storm system even further. The favorable weather pattern allowed the storm to retain its intensity, even while it slowly moved down towards the West Coast. The massive storm complex slowly looped westward and then southward towards the West Coast, undergoing explosive intensification once more on December 19.&lt;ref name="Aleutian Low finally moves to the Pacific Northwest"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/19/2010&amp;selmap=2010121900&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; The system stalled off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and weakened slightly. However, the system fully opened up the Pineapple Express over California beginning on December 19,&lt;ref name="Pineapple Express onslaught reaches full force"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/19/2010&amp;selmap=2010121918&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; triggering flash floods, mudslides, and landslides across much of the Western States, particularly in California. The Pineapple Express system channeled large amounts of moisture into California, ravaging much of the state from December 15 through December 22, bringing with it as much as 20 inches of rain to the San Gabriel Mountains and San bernardinos and over 13 feet of snow in the Southern California mountains and  [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Although the entire state was affected, the Southern California counties of San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, and Los Angeles bore the brunt of the system of storms as coastal and hillside areas were impacted by mudslides and major flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/12/22/S-Calif-storm-unleashes-torrent-of-rain/UPI-41611293008400/ |title=Pineapple Express blamed for S.

On December 21, the storm complex's central circulation fell apart, as it began to interact with another storm in the Gulf of Alaska.&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm loses main circulation"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/22/2010&amp;selmap=2010122200&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, after stalling off the West Coast for 5 days, the weakened system finally approached [[Southern California]] and began moving ashore,&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm begins to move ashore in Southern California"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/22/2010&amp;selmap=2010122212&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; making landfall early on December 23, which finally put a temporary end to the Pineapple Express event.&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm makes landfall"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/23/2010&amp;selmap=2010122300&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm weakens into a small winter storm"/&gt; Later the same day, the winter storm weakened into a small, 1011 mbar storm, after moving eastward into the [[Four Corners|Four Corners region]].&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm weakens into a small winter storm"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/23/2010&amp;selmap=2010122315&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, the winter storm interacted with another frontal system, causing the storm to weaken even further, to the point where the storm lost its circulation.&lt;ref name="December 2010's circulation collapses"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/24/2010&amp;selmap=2010122400&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the winter storm reached southern [[Texas]] later in December 2010, almost all of the system's convection had dissipated.&lt;ref name="storm nearly loses all of its convection"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/24/2010&amp;selmap=2010122409&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dec10noreaster.png|thumb|right|250px|Infrared satellite image of the storm on Monday, December 27, 2010]]
Late on December 24, the winter storm began absorbing an ample amount of Gulf stream energy; as a result, the storm was able to reorganize.&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm reorganizes"&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=12/24/2010&amp;selmap=2010122421&amp;maptype=satsfcnps&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the storm eventually moved southeast into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] then abruptly turned sharply northeastward into the Florida panhandle and state of Georgia as it merged with an upper-level low pressure system located near Virginia. As it became a stacked low pressure system, the storm system began a period of [[rapid intensification]] off the North Carolina coast while tracking along the coast of the Northeast and Newfoundland.

The storm had many similarities to [[North American blizzard of 2006]]. The storm also generated a rare meteorological phenomenon known as [[thundersnow]] in which thunder and lightning occur concurrently with the falling snow. On December 27, 2010, the storm had deepened to {{convert|960|mbar|inHg}},&lt;ref name="December 2010 storm develops into powerful nor'easter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=summary /&gt; equal in pressure to that found in a [[Category 3 hurricane]].&lt;ref name=WashPost /&gt;  Several [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic factors]] contributed to the intensity of this blizzard.&lt;ref name=NYNWS&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/SOO/case_studies/12262010.html "December 26-27th&amp;nbsp;2010 Blizzard"], National Weather Service, New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

The global American and European weather models encountered exceptional difficulty in portraying the path of the storm. The main issue that the models were trying to resolve was whether or not the upper-level low pressure system from Central Canada was going to phase in time with the southern stream energy, thereby revealing if the resulting storm would come up the Eastern Seaboard or simply continue to move east out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The latter solution would have only caused the storm to affect the Mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina with a modest winter storm instead of the entire Eastern coastline up to Atlantic Canada. As such, it was only 24 hours prior to the storm's arrival in the Northeastern states when all the European and American models were in agreement that the storm would turn up the entire coastline. The National Weather Service's [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]] and many other private forecasters were skeptical of the storm impacting the Northeastern states until about 24 hours of the storm's arrival as well; although, some models depicted the storm delivering a full-blown blizzard to the New York City metropolitan area as early as a week in advance. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center even issued a statement on Christmas Eve, 48 hours prior to the storm, that they suspected the American models of having model initialization errors; thus, they believed these errors may have forced the storm to be erroneously modeled to come up the Northeastern coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/event_reviews/2010/December25_27_2010_Blizzard.pdf "HPC's Case Study of the December 25–27 Northeast Blizzard"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, the storm developed into a powerful [[nor'easter]] that buffeted the East Coast, reaching its peak intensity. On December 29, the storm weakened and left the United States. During the next several days, the system moved eastward over the Atlantic Ocean. On January 2, 2011, the storm began to re-intensify, but the system continued to drift in the eastern North Atlantic for another two days. On January 4, the system was named ''Windstorm Benjamin'' by the [[Free University of Berlin]],&lt;ref name="Windstorm Benjamin named"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20110104.gif&lt;/ref&gt; which names all Low and High-Pressure systems that affect Europe. Windstorm Benjamin continued to moved eastwards across the Atlantic, and the storm began to impact [[Western Europe]] on January 8.&lt;ref name="Windstorm Benjamin arrives at the British Isles"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20110108.gif&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, Windstorm Benjamin crossed the [[British Isles]] and turned to the northeast.&lt;ref name="Windstorm Benjamin exits the British Isles"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20110109.gif&lt;/ref&gt; For the next couple of days, Windstorm Benjamin held its intensity as it continued moving northeastward, before weakening on January 11, due to land interaction with the northern coast of [[Norway]]. On January 12, Windstorm Benjamin began to move inland into [[Central Russia|Western Russia]], while slowly weakening.&lt;ref name="Windstorm Benjamin begins to move into Russia"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20110112.gif&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, Benjamin accelerated eastward, while rapidly continuing to deteriortate. On January 15, Windstorm Benjamin was absorbed into the circulation of another approaching extratropical cyclone.&lt;ref name="Windstorm Benjamin absorbed"&gt;http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/de/wetter/maps/Analyse_20110115.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synoptic conditions==

===Snowfall===
[[WCAU-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] forecast a snowfall of between {{convert|10|and|20|in|cm}} in Philadelphia itself (which received {{convert|12.2|in|cm}}), while nearby [[Trenton, New Jersey]] and parts of southern [[New Jersey]] were expected to receive snowfalls of {{convert|20|in|cm}} or more. Wind gusts were expected to reach between {{convert|40|and|50|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/breaking/Major-Snowstorm-Sunday-After-Christmas-112452614.html "Heavy Snow Slams Region"]. Retrieved December 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Areas in eastern [[North Carolina]] and southeastern [[Virginia]] saw upwards of {{convert|12|in|cm}} of snow.

[[File:Madison Square 2010 blizzard.jpg|thumb|left|Broadway at end of snowfall]]
Areas in and around New York City, which were most impacted by the storm, reported between {{convert|12|and|32|in|cm}} of snowfall by Monday morning. Measurement was made difficult due to {{convert|4|ft|cm|adj=on}} snow drifts caused by the winds. Central Park's reported {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow from the storm is the sixth-largest snowfall on record for that location.

Areas to the east of New York City received 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;inches while 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;inches of snow fell across New York City, Northeast and Central New Jersey and the Lower Hudson Valley.&lt;ref name=NYNWS/&gt; Areas receiving the most snow are between [[Kendall Park, New Jersey|Kendall Park]] and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] and between [[Brick, New Jersey|Brick]] and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] in [[New Jersey]]. This was because multiple convective bands of heavy snow fed in off the ocean into the large stationary very heavy snow band (with occasional lightning) over the areas that received 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name=NYNWS/&gt;  These areas received snowfall totals over {{convert|24.0|in|cm|sp=us}}. A secondary heavy snow/rain band formed across Eastern Massachusetts the night of December 26.&lt;ref name=NYNWS/&gt; Southern [[New England]] including Boston saw more than {{convert|1|ft|cm}} of snow. Even areas of coastal Virginia saw more than {{convert|1|ft|cm}} of snow, and [[North Carolina]] received more than {{convert|6.0|in|cm|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="ncep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html|accessdate=December 28, 2010|title=National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Prediction Center Storm Summary Message|work=[[National Weather Service]]|date=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington, D.C. and [[Baltimore]] and their environs were largely spared this storm, receiving little accumulation despite large snowfall totals further east on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]].

===High winds===
Wind gusts routinely over {{convert|50|mph|sp=us}} were widespread during the blizzard in coastal areas. Hurricane-force wind gusts of {{convert|80|mph|sp=us}} were recorded along coastal portions of Eastern [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ncep"/&gt; A wind gust of {{convert|94.4|mph|sp=us}} was recorded in Grand Etang, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/CWZQ/2010/12/27/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&amp;req_state=NA&amp;req_statename=NA Weather station history for CWZQ, Grand Etang, NS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greater New York area had sustained winds of 30–45 MPH with gusts to over 60 MPH during the afternoon and night of December 26.&lt;ref name=NYNWS/&gt;  High winds caused near zero visibilities and treacherous travel conditions in many areas. The strong easterly winds also piled up water along the eastern coast of Massachusetts, leading to major coastal flood damage.

===New York City===
By the storm's end, weather stations in [[Central Park]] had recorded {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow. A combination of heavy snow and strong winds led to massive transportation lockdowns across the city. Nearly all roads in the city (with the exception of major arteries) were left impassable for many days because of the amount of snow. Hundreds of buses were stuck in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/nyregion/30response.html NYTimes, Dec 29, 2010] Hundreds of buses stranded&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400 passengers were stranded on the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A train]] on the [[IND Rockaway Line]] for seven hours starting shortly before 1&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTA ran on a limited schedule, even on Tuesday morning, with many above ground subway lines not functioning. By Wednesday, only the [[BMT Sea Beach Line|Sea Beach Line]], [[BMT Franklin Avenue Line|Franklin Avenue Line]], and [[Greenport Branch]] remained suspended. The subway resumed full service on Thursday, the LIRR Friday morning.

Residents of the city were complaining to Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] about the slowness of the snowplows attempting to reach their areas. By the late afternoon on Tuesday, snowplows had reached the minor streets in [[Brooklyn]]. Many residents of [[Staten Island]], however, had yet to see one. Many plows became stuck in the snow that had accumulated on the streets and several could not get through as many residents had simply abandoned their cars in the middle of roads once it became too hazardous or impossible to move. These cars became stuck as the snow accumulated around them, creating roadblocks for the plows.  Both Mayor Bloomberg and the chief of the sanitation department were urging residents to stay indoors and not shovel snow back onto the streets that had already been plowed. State Senator [[Carl Kruger]] called the response a "Colossal Failure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/weather/Slow-Cleanup-From-Blizzard-2010-20101228-APX "Slow Cleanup From Blizzard 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple explanations have been proposed for the relatively slow response of the snow cleanup in the New York City metropolitan area. For example, the local media did not fully alert the general public until Christmas Day about the impending storm due to the complexity and lateness of the forecast models predicting the storm; thus, public awareness was delayed. Another possible cause was that Mayor Bloomberg had previously laid off 400 New York City Sanitation workers due to budget cuts; therefore, fewer plows were at work. In addition, some city workers who are responsible for managing the snow removal process had taken the day off from work during the storm due to the Christmas holiday. Also, a [[snow emergency]] was not declared, contributing to the number of abandoned cars on the streets.

On December 30, the New York Post reported that several sanitation workers confessed that cleanup was intentionally slowed down to protest the aforementioned budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldenberg|first=Sally|title=Sanitation Department's slow snow cleanup was a budget protest|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sanit_filthy_snow_slow_mo_qH57MZwC53QKOJlekSSDJK|work=New York Post|accessdate=December 30, 2010|author2=Celona, Larry |author3=Margolin, Josh }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3, 2011, [[WCBS-TV]] reported that prosecutors had obtained a video of two sanitation trucks driving down 155th Street in [[Whitestone, Queens]] after the blizzard with their plows raised so as not to remove the snow. Allegations were also made that sanitation workers slept on the job, hung out at a doughnut shop for 11 straight hours while on the job, and drank beer for six or seven hours while on the job. Claims were also made that supervisors encouraged such work stoppages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/01/03/video-of-apparent-blizzard-clean-up-slow-down-surfaces/ Video Of Apparent Blizzard Clean-Up, Slow-Down Surfaces], WCBS-TV, January 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, a month later, the [[New York Times]] reported that the allegations of a slowdown remained unsubstantiated and that Councilman Daniel Halloran, who had originally reported the confessions, had not named his sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/nyregion/26snowman.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=nyregion Evidence Is Elusive on Charge of a Blizzard Slowdown], New York Times, January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Jersey ===
[[File:Snow in Journal Square 27 December 2010.jpg|Left|thumb|Snowing in [[Journal Square]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]]]
[[New Jersey]] declared a State of Emergency on Sunday, December 26.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.app.com/article/20101226/NEWS/12260364/State-of-emergency-declared-in-NJ Shore gets buried by blizzard, state of emergency declared] APP.com December 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were affected the hardest because of its high winds and snow. Over {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow was estimated in some counties such as [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]]. [[Interstate 78]], [[Interstate 80]], and [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|Interstate 280]] experienced congestion, closures, and accidents. [[New Jersey Transit]] suspended all bus service, [[North Jersey Coast Line]] service, and [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]] Service. [[River Line (New Jersey Transit)|River Line]] service had partial closures and the [[Newark Light Rail]] was delayed for 20–30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njtransit.com/sa/sa_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=[[Rahway, New Jersey]]TravelAlertsTo&amp;rel=Bus Travel Alerts] New Jersey Transit&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in the state were stranded on roadways and only emergency vehicles were allowed on the roads.

The highest amount recorded was in [[Brick, New Jersey]], where 36 inches of snow accumulated.&lt;ref name="ncep"/&gt; The visibility was near {{convert|0|miles}}.  Central and Northeastern New Jersey were hit the hardest with snow totals of {{convert|1|to|2.5|ft|cm}}. [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]] got {{convert|32.5|in|cm|sp=us}}, [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey|Lyndhurst]] got {{convert|29|in|cm|sp=us}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/news/122710_Blizzard_expected_to_set_North_Jersey_snowfall_records_for_Dec_27.html "Update: Lots of snow, but no records, meteorologist says"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] had one of the highest totals of snow of any city affected by this storm, {{convert|31.8|in|cm|sp=us}} of heavy snow. Blizzard Warnings were prompted for eastern New Jersey, while Winter Storm Warnings were issued in the western portion. Blowing and drifting snow was a big problem on December 26 and 27.

[[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] had received {{convert|7|in|cm}} of snowfall in about three hours, an instance of very heavy snow in a short time. Snow drifts as high as seven feet were spotted in portions of eastern New Jersey. The NJ Transit was shut down on late December 26 due to blizzard conditions occurring in the area. [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]] was one of many southern New Jersey towns that were affected by snow bands containing four-inch per hour snowfall rates. When the storm was off the coast of New Jersey, bands of heavy snow formed one after another, increasing already-hefty snowfall amounts even further. There were reports of snow plows getting stuck in the snow late at night on December 26 and the early morning of the 27th. On the 26th, visibilities in some towns were less than 0.1 miles. This caused [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions in towns along the [[Raritan River]] and the Atlantic coastline.

Cape May had reported nearly 15&amp;nbsp;inches of snow after the storm had moved out to sea. The town had lesser snow amounts due to a break in the southern half of the snow bands pivoting toward New Jersey. The snow totals were only expected to reach 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;inches at the highest. Instead, the highest amount was in [[Brick, New Jersey]] where 36 inches fell, nearly 3 feet of snow fell. I-95 Northbound was mostly covered in layers of snow, which was dangerous for some drivers.

The higher snowfall amounts occurred in central and northern coastal areas of New Jersey. The blustery winds in New Jersey gusted as high as 65&amp;nbsp;mph. The fact of the high winds caused the blizzard warnings to be issued by the [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]] ([[Philadelphia, PA]] area) National Weather Service officials.

Snow fell so fast that traffic came to a complete halt. Motorists had to be rescued the following day as snow continued to pile up and trap them on interstates and local streets, which themselves became completely impassable. Citizens began calling into news stations asking for help and giving reports, while plows and other emergency personnel became stuck everywhere. [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] Mayor [[Cory Booker]] notably used Twitter to help stranded residents and assure citizens.

===Connecticut===
Heavy snow and winds of up to {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} caused a gas station roof to collapse in [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]], and widespread tree damage and power outages throughout the state. Service on the [[Metro-North]] New Haven Line and its branches was suspended on Monday due to equipment and switch failures caused by the storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/winter_weather/blizzard-connecticut-dec-27-2010 Blizzard Warnings Remain in Effect, Thousands Without Power, WTNH-TV New Haven, CT, December 27, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/nyregion/28blizzard.html| date = December 26, 2010| title = After Blizzard Ends, a Slow Recovery| author = Liz Robbins|work=The New York Times| accessdate =December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest snow totals were in the western part of the state, with [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] receiving 18&amp;nbsp;inches of snow. [[North Canaan, Connecticut|North Canaan]] reported 16.1&amp;nbsp;inches, and 13.9&amp;nbsp;inches of snowfall was reported at [[Bradley International Airport]].

The blizzard was nicknamed Winter Storm "Adrienne" by [[WFSB-TV]] Channel 3. The local CBS affiliate has unofficially [https://web.archive.org/web/20100213002000/http://www.wfsb.com/stormnames/index.html named local winter storms] since 1971.

===Atlantic Canada===
In [[Atlantic Canada]], the nor'easter was the fourth major [[winter storm]] to hit the area in four weeks. Blizzard conditions forced numerous road closures and resulted in the death of a minivan driver on December 27 near [[Fredericton, Prince Edward Island]]. Wind gusts approached {{convert|150|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and up to {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow fell in [[New Brunswick]], while [[Nova Scotia]] was hit by heavy rain and unseasonably warm temperatures and rain continued in eastern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Tobi|title=Winter batters Atlantic Canada|url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Winter+batters+Atlantic+Canada/4031864/story.html|accessdate=December 28, 2010|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=December 28, 2010|author2=Mike Barber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=East Coast snowstorm pummels region|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2010/12/27/nb-maritimes-storm.html|accessdate=December 28, 2010|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diazenylium''' is the chemical N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an [[inorganic]] [[cation]] that was one of the first [[ion]]s to be observed in [[interstellar clouds]].  Since then, it has been observed for in several different types of [[interstellar medium|interstellar environments]], observations that have several different scientific uses.  It gives astronomers information about the fractional [[ionization]] of gas clouds, the chemistry that happens within those clouds, and it is often used as a tracer for molecules that are not as easily detected (such as [[Nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...455L..77C P. Caselli, P.C. Myers, and P. Thaddeus, ApJL, 455: L77 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its 1–0 rotational transition occurs at 93.174&amp;nbsp;GHz, a region of the spectrum where [[Earth's atmosphere]] is transparent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.submm.caltech.edu/cso/weather/atplot.shtml CSO Atmospheric Transmission Interactive Plotter]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has a significant [[optical depth]] in both cold and warm clouds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aa/abs/2003/26/aa3576/aa3576.html L. Pirogov, I. Zinchenko, P. Caselli, L.E.B. Johansson and P. C. Myers, A&amp;A, 405: 639-654 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; so it is relatively easy to observe with ground-based observatories.  The results of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; observations can be used not only for determining the chemistry of interstellar clouds, but also for mapping the density and velocity profiles of these clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was first observed in 1974 by B.E. Turner. He observed a previously unidentified triplet at 93.174&amp;nbsp;GHz using the NRAO 11&amp;nbsp;m telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1974ApJ...193L..83T B. Turner, ApJ, 193: L83 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this initial observation, Green et al. identified the triplet as the 1–0 rotational transition of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This was done using a combination of [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio molecular calculations]] and comparison of similar molecules, such as [[nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[hydrogen cyanide|HCN]], [[hydrogen isocyanide|HNC]], and HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which are all [[isoelectronic]] to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on these calculations, the observed rotational transition would be expected to have seven hyperfine components, but only three of these were observed, since the telescope's resolution was insufficient to distinguish the peaks caused by the hyperfine splitting of the inner Nitrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1974ApJ...193L..89G S. Green, J. Montgomery, and P. Thaddeus, ApJ, 193: L89 (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Just a year later, Thaddeus and Turner observed the same transition in the [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex|Orion Molecular Cloud 2]] (OMC-2) using the same telescope, but this time they integrated for 26 hours, which resulted in a resolution that was good enough to distinguish the smaller hyperfine components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...201L..25T P. Thaddeus and B.E. Turner, ApJ, 201: L25-L26 (1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past three decades, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been observed quite frequently, and the 1–0 rotational band is almost exclusively the one that astronomers look for. In 1995, the hyperfine structure of this septuplet was observed with an absolute precision of ~7&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was good enough to determine its molecular constants with an order of magnitude better precision than was possible in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...455L..77C P. Caselli, P. Myers, and P. Thaddeus, ApJL, 455: L77 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; This observation was done toward L1512 using the 37&amp;nbsp;m NEROC Haystack Telescope.  In the same year, Sage et al. observed the 1–0 transition of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in seven out of the nine nearby galaxies that they observed with the NRAO 12&amp;nbsp;m telescope at Kitt Peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...447..625S L. Sage and L. Ziurys, ApJ, 447: 625 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was one of the first few molecular ions to be observed in other galaxies, and its observation helped to show that the chemistry in other galaxies is quite similar to that which we see in our own galaxy.

N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is most often observed in dense molecular clouds, where it has proven useful as one of the last molecules to freeze out onto dust grains as the density of the cloud increases toward the center.  In 2002, Bergin et al. did a spatial survey of dense cores to see just how far toward the center N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could be observed and found that its abundance drops by at least two orders of magnitude when one moves from the outer edge of the core to the center.  This showed that even N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is not an ideal tracer for the chemistry of dense [[pre-stellar cores]], and concluded that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; may be the only good molecular probe of the innermost regions of pre-stellar cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Laboratory detections ==
[[Image:N2H+ Energy Levels.png|200px|thumb|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Energy Levels]]

Although N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is most often observed by astronomers because of its ease of detection, there have been some laboratory experiments that have observed it in a more controlled environment.  The first laboratory spectrum of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was of the 1–0 rotational band in the ground vibrational level, the same microwave transition that astronomers had recently discovered in space.&lt;ref&gt;R. Saykally, T. Dixon, T. Anderson, P. Szanto, and R. Woods, ApJ, 205: L101 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, Owrutsky et al. performed vibrational spectroscopy of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; by observing the plasma created by a discharge of a mixture nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon gas using a color center laser.  During the pulsed discharge, the poles were reversed on alternating pulses, so the ions were pulled back and forth through the discharge cell.  This caused the absorption features of the ions, but not the neutral molecules, to be shifted back and forth in frequency space, so a lock-in amplifier could be used to observe the spectra of just the ions in the discharge.  The lock-in combined with the velocity modulation gave &gt;99.9% discrimination between ions and neutrals.  The feed gas was optimized for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; production, and transitions up to ''J''&amp;nbsp;= 41 were observed for both the fundamental N–H stretching band and the bending hot band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JCPSA6000084000002000605000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes J. Owrutsky, C. Gudeman, C. Martner, L. Tack, N. Rosenbaum, and R. Saykally, JCP, 84: 605 (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Kabbadj et al. observed even more hot bands associated with the fundamental vibrational band using a difference frequency laser to observe a discharge of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium gases.  They used velocity modulation in the same way that Owrutsky et al. had, in order to discriminate ions from neutrals.  They combined this with a counterpropogating beam technique to aid in noise subtraction, and this greatly increased their sensitivity.  They had enough sensitivity to observe OH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that were formed from the minute O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O impurities in their helium tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022285284710162|doi=10.1006/jmsp.1994.1016|title=Infrared Spectroscopy of Highly Excited Vibrational Levels of Protonated Nitrogen, HN+2|journal=Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy|volume=163|issue=1|pages=180–205|year=1994|last1=Kabbadj|first1=Y|last2=Huet|first2=T.R|last3=Rehfuss|first3=B.D|last4=Gabrys|first4=C.M|last5=Oka|first5=T|bibcode=1994JMoSp.163..180K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:N2H+ Spectrum MHz.png|400px|left|thumb|Simulated N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Rotational Spectrum]]

By fitting all observed bands, the rotational constants for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; were determined to be ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.561928&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{val|2.746e-6|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which are the only constants needed to determine the rotational spectrum of this linear molecule in the ground vibrational state, with the exception of determining hyperfine splitting.  Given the [[selection rule]] Δ''J''&amp;nbsp;= ±1, the calculated rotational energy levels, along with their percent population at 30&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s, can be plotted. The frequencies of the peaks predicted by this method differ from those observed in the laboratory by at most 700&amp;nbsp;kHz.

== Chemistry ==
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is found mostly in dense molecular clouds, where its presence is closely related to that of many other nitrogen-containing compounds.&lt;ref name="Prasad&amp;Huntress1980"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980ApJS...43....1P S. Prasad and W. Huntress, ApJS, 43: 1-35 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly closely tied to the chemistry of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is more difficult to detect (since it lacks a dipole moment). This is why N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is commonly used to indirectly determine the abundance of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in molecular clouds.

The rates of the dominant formation and destruction reactions can be determined from known rate constants and fractional abundances (relative to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a typical dense molecular cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aas.aanda.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aas/abs/1997/01/ds1168/ds1168.html T.

Willacy, A\&amp;A Supp, 121: 139 (1997)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculated rates here were for early time (316,000 years) and a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;kelvins, which are typical conditions for a relatively young molecular cloud.

There are dozens more reactions possible, but these are the only ones that are fast enough to affect the abundance of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in dense molecular clouds. Diazenylium thus plays a critical role in the chemistry of many nitrogen-containing molecules.&lt;ref name="Prasad&amp;Huntress1980"/&gt; Although the actual electron density in so-called "dense clouds" is quite low, the destruction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is governed mostly by [[dissociative recombination]].

{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Equations}}
In [[particle physics]], the '''Dirac equation''' is a [[relativistic wave equation]] derived by British physicist [[Paul Dirac]] in 1928. In its [[Dirac equation#Covariant form and relativistic invariance|free form]], or including [[Dirac equation#Comparison with the Pauli theory|electromagnetic interactions]], it describes all [[spin-½|spin-{{sfrac|2}}]] [[massive particle]]s such as [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s for which [[P-symmetry|parity]] is a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]. It is consistent with both the principles of [[quantum mechanics]] and the theory of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Quanta: A handbook of concepts|author = P.W. Atkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=52|year = 1974|isbn = 0-19-855493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first theory to account fully for special relativity in the context of [[quantum mechanics]]. It was validated by accounting for the fine details of the [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen spectrum]] in a completely rigorous way.

The equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, ''[[antimatter]]'', previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed several years later. It also provided a ''theoretical'' justification for the introduction of several component wave functions in [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]]'s [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] theory of [[spin (physics)|spin]]; the wave functions in the Dirac theory are vectors of four [[complex number]]s (known as [[bispinor]]s), two of which resemble the Pauli wavefunction in the non-relativistic limit, in contrast to the [[Schrödinger equation]] which described wave functions of only one complex value. Moreover, in the limit of zero mass, the Dirac equation reduces to the [[Weyl equation]].

Although Dirac did not at first fully appreciate the importance of his results, the entailed explanation of spin as a consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and relativity—and the eventual discovery of the [[positron]]—represents one of the great triumphs of [[theoretical physics]]. This accomplishment has been described as fully on a par with the works of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Quantum Universe|author=T.Hey, P.Walters|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year=2009|page = 228|isbn = 978-0-521-56457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[quantum field theory]], the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin-{{sfrac|2}} particles.

== Mathematical formulation ==

The Dirac equation in the form originally proposed by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dirac|first= P.A.M.| title=Principles of Quantum Mechanics|edition= 4th| publisher=Oxford University Press|series=International Series of Monographs on Physics| orig-year = 1958 |year=1982|isbn=978-0-19-852011-5|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ''ψ''(''x'', ''t'')}} is the [[wave function]] for the electron of [[rest mass]] {{math|''m''}} with [[spacetime]] coordinates {{math|''x'', ''t''}}. The {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the components of the [[momentum]], understood to be the [[momentum operator]] in the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Also, {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[Planck constant]] divided by {{math|2π}}. These fundamental [[physical constant]]s reflect special relativity and quantum mechanics, respectively.

Dirac's purpose in casting this equation was to explain the behavior of the relativistically moving electron, and so to allow the atom to be treated in a manner consistent with relativity. His rather modest hope was that the corrections introduced this way might have a bearing on the problem of [[atomic spectra]]. Up until that time, attempts to make the old quantum theory of the atom compatible with the theory of relativity, attempts based on discretizing the [[angular momentum]] stored in the electron's possibly non-circular orbit of the [[atomic nucleus]], had failed – and the new quantum mechanics of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]], [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], and Dirac himself had not developed sufficiently to treat this problem. Although Dirac's original intentions were satisfied, his equation had far deeper implications for the structure of matter and introduced new mathematical classes of objects that are now essential elements of fundamental physics.

The new elements in this equation are the 4 × 4 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''β''}}, and the four-component [[wavefunction|wave function]] {{math|''ψ''}}. There are four components in {{math|''ψ''}} because the evaluation of it at any given point in configuration space is a [[bispinor]]. It is interpreted as a superposition of a [[Spin-½|spin-up]] electron, a spin-down electron, a spin-up positron, and a spin-down positron (see [[#Hole theory|below]] for further discussion).

The 4 × 4 matrices {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''β''}} are all [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] and have squares equal to the [[identity matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i^2=\beta^2=I_4&lt;/math&gt;

and they all mutually [[anticommute]] (if {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} are distinct):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i\alpha_j + \alpha_j\alpha_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i\beta + \beta\alpha_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The single symbolic equation thus unravels into four coupled linear first-order [[partial differential equation]]s for the four quantities that make up the wave function. These matrices and the form of the wave function have a deep mathematical significance. The algebraic structure represented by the [[gamma matrices]] had been created some 50 years earlier by the English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]].  In turn, Clifford's ideas had emerged from the mid-19th-century work of the German mathematician [[Hermann Grassmann]] in his ''Lineale Ausdehnungslehre'' (''Theory of Linear Extensions''). The latter had been regarded as well-nigh incomprehensible by most of his contemporaries. The appearance of something so seemingly abstract, at such a late date, and in such a direct physical manner, is one of the most remarkable chapters in the history of physics.{{Citation needed|reason=Historical perspective and author editorial|date=October 2018}}

=== Making the Schrödinger equation relativistic ===
The Dirac equation is superficially similar to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for a massive [[free particle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\phi = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The left side represents the square of the momentum operator divided by twice the mass, which is the non-relativistic kinetic energy.  Because relativity treats space and time as a whole, a relativistic generalization of this equation requires that space and time derivatives must enter symmetrically as they do in the [[Maxwell equation]]s that govern the behavior of light — the equations must be differentially of the ''same order'' in space and time. In relativity, the momentum and the energies are the space and time parts of a spacetime  vector, the [[four-momentum]], and they are related by the relativistically invariant relation

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = m^2c^4 + p^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

which says that the [[Four-momentum#Minkowski norm|length of this four-vector]] is proportional to the rest mass {{math|''m''}}. Substituting the operator equivalents of the energy and momentum from the Schrödinger theory, we get the [[Klein-Gordon Equation|Klein-Gordon equation]] describing the propagation of waves, constructed from relativistically invariant objects,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} + \nabla^2\right)\phi = \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

with the wave function {{math|''ϕ''}} being a relativistic scalar: a complex number which has the same numerical value in all frames of reference. Space and time derivatives both enter to second order. This has a telling consequence for the interpretation of the equation. Because the equation is second order in the time derivative, one must specify initial values both of the wave function itself and of its first time-derivative in order to solve definite problems. Since both may be specified more or less arbitrarily, the wave function cannot maintain its former role of determining the [[probability density function|probability density]] of finding the electron in a given state of motion. In the Schrödinger theory, the probability density is given by the positive definite expression

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\phi^*\phi\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this density is convected according to the probability current vector

:&lt;math&gt;J = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}(\phi^*\nabla\phi - \phi\nabla\phi^*)&lt;/math&gt;

with the conservation of probability current and density following from the continuity equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot J + \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The fact that the density is positive definite and convected according to this continuity equation implies that we may integrate the density over a certain domain and set the total to 1, and this condition will be maintained by the [[conservation law]]. A proper relativistic theory with a probability density current must also share this feature. Now, if we wish to maintain the notion of a convected density, then we must generalize the Schrödinger expression of the density and current so that space and time derivatives again enter symmetrically in relation to the scalar wave function. We are allowed to keep the Schrödinger expression for the current, but must replace the probability density by the symmetrically formed expression

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{i\hbar}{2mc^2}(\psi^*\partial_t\psi - \psi\partial_t\psi^*).&lt;/math&gt;

which now becomes the 4th component of a spacetime  vector, and the entire [[Probability four-current|probability 4-current density]] has the relativistically covariant expression

:&lt;math&gt;J^\mu = \frac{i\hbar}{2m}(\psi^*\partial^\mu\psi - \psi\partial^\mu\psi^*)&lt;/math&gt;

The continuity equation is as before. Everything is compatible with relativity now, but we see immediately that the expression for the density is no longer [[positive definite function|positive definite]] – the initial values of both {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;''ψ''}} may be freely chosen, and the density may thus become negative, something that is impossible for a legitimate probability density. Thus, we cannot get a simple generalization of the Schrödinger equation under the naive assumption that the wave function is a relativistic scalar, and the equation it satisfies, second order in time.

Although it is not a successful relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger equation, this equation is resurrected in the context of [[quantum field theory]], where it is known as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], and describes a spinless particle field (e.g. [[pi meson]] or [[Higgs boson]]). Historically, Schrödinger himself arrived at this equation before the one that bears his name but soon discarded it. In the context of quantum field theory, the indefinite density is understood to correspond to the ''charge'' density, which can be positive or negative, and not the probability density.

=== Dirac's coup ===
Dirac thus thought to try an equation that was ''first order'' in both space and time. One could, for example, formally (i.e. by [[abuse of notation]]) take the [[Energy–momentum relation|relativistic expression for the energy]]
:&lt;math&gt;E = c\sqrt{p^2 + m^2c^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
replace {{math|''p''}} by its operator equivalent, expand the square root in an [[infinite series]] of derivative operators, set up an eigenvalue problem, then solve the equation formally by iterations. Most physicists had little faith in such a process, even if it were technically possible.

As the story goes, Dirac was staring into the fireplace at Cambridge, pondering this problem, when he hit upon the idea of taking the square root of the wave operator thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = \left(A \partial_x + B \partial_y + C \partial_z + \frac{i}{c}D \partial_t\right)\left(A \partial_x + B \partial_y + C \partial_z + \frac{i}{c}D \partial_t\right).&lt;/math&gt;

On multiplying out the right side we see that, in order to get all the cross-terms such as {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to vanish, we must assume

:&lt;math&gt;AB + BA = 0, \;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;A^2 = B^2 = \ldots = 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Dirac, who had just then been intensely involved with working out the foundations of Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]], immediately understood that these conditions could be met if {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} are ''matrices'', with the implication that the wave function has ''multiple components''. This immediately explained the appearance of two-component wave functions in Pauli's phenomenological theory of [[Spin (physics)|spin]], something that up until then had been regarded as mysterious, even to Pauli himself. However, one needs at least 4 × 4 matrices to set up a system with the properties required — so the wave function had ''four'' components, not two, as in the Pauli theory, or one, as in the bare Schrödinger theory. The four-component wave function represents a new class of mathematical object in physical theories that makes its first appearance here.

Given the factorization in terms of these matrices, one can now write down immediately an equation

:&lt;math&gt;\left(A\partial_x + B\partial_y + C\partial_z + \frac{i}{c}D\partial_t\right)\psi = \kappa\psi&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''κ''}} to be determined. Applying again the matrix operator on both sides yields

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2}\partial_t^2\right)\psi = \kappa^2\psi.&lt;/math&gt;

On taking {{math|''κ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''mc''|''ħ''}}}} we find that all the components of the wave function ''individually'' satisfy the relativistic energy–momentum relation. Thus the sought-for equation that is first-order in both space and time is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(A\partial_x + B\partial_y + C\partial_z + \frac{i}{c}D\partial_t - \frac{mc}{\hbar}\right)\psi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting

:&lt;math&gt;A = i \beta \alpha_1 \, , \, B = i \beta \alpha_2 \, , \, C = i \beta \alpha_3 \, , \, D = \beta \, , &lt;/math&gt;

and because  &lt;math&gt;D^2=\beta^2=I_4 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

we get the Dirac equation as written above.

=== Covariant form and relativistic invariance ===

To demonstrate the [[Lorentz covariance|relativistic invariance]] of the equation, it is advantageous to cast it into a form in which the space and time derivatives appear on an equal footing. New matrices are introduced as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \gamma^0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = i \gamma^1 \, , \, B = i \gamma^2 \, , \, C = i \gamma^3 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

and the equation takes the form (remembering the definition of the covariant components of the [[4-gradient]] and especially that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{math|{{sfrac|''1''|''c''}}∂&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}} )

{{Equation box 1

where there is an [[Einstein notation|implied summation]] over the values of the twice-repeated index {{math|''μ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, 3}}, and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; }} is the 4-gradient. In practice one often writes the [[gamma matrices]] in terms of 2 × 2 sub-matrices taken from the [[Pauli matrices]] and the 2 × 2 [[identity matrix]]. Explicitly the [[gamma matrices#Dirac basis|standard representation]] is

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma^0 = \begin{pmatrix} I_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -I_2 \end{pmatrix},
\gamma^1 = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 0   &amp; \sigma_x \\ -\sigma_x &amp; 0    \end{array}\right),
\gamma^2 = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 0   &amp; \sigma_y \\ -\sigma_y &amp; 0    \end{array}\right),
\gamma^3 = \left(\begin{array}{cccc} 0   &amp; \sigma_z \\ -\sigma_z &amp; 0    \end{array}\right).
 \,&lt;/math&gt;

The complete system is summarized using the [[Minkowski metric]] on spacetime in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\} = 2 \eta^{\mu\nu}I_4 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the bracket expression

:&lt;math&gt;\{a, b\} = ab + ba&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[anticommutator]]. These are the defining relations of a [[Clifford algebra]] over a pseudo-orthogonal 4-dimensional space with [[metric signature]] {{math|(+ − − −)}}. The specific Clifford algebra employed in the Dirac equation is known today as the [[Dirac algebra]]. Although not recognized as such by Dirac at the time the equation was formulated, in hindsight the introduction of this ''[[geometric algebra]]'' represents an enormous stride forward in the development of quantum theory.

The Dirac equation may now be interpreted as an [[eigenvalue]] equation, where the rest mass is proportional to an eigenvalue of the [[4-momentum operator]], the [[proportionality constant]] being the speed of light:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{op}\psi = mc\psi. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Using   &lt;math&gt;{\partial\!\!\!/} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;{\partial\!\!\!\big /}&lt;/math&gt; is pronounced "d-slash"&lt;ref&gt;see for example Brian Pendleton: [http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~bjp/qt/rqt.pdf Quantum Theory 2012/2013, section 4.3 The Dirac Equation]&lt;/ref&gt;) , according to [[Feynman slash notation]], the Dirac equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;i \hbar {\partial\!\!\!\big /} \psi - m c \psi = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, physicists often use units of measure such that {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, known as [[natural units]]. The equation then takes the simple form

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Dirac equation''' ''(natural units)''

A fundamental theorem states that if two distinct sets of matrices are given that both satisfy the [[Clifford algebra|Clifford relations]], then they are connected to each other by a [[Matrix similarity|similarity transformation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\mu\prime} = S^{-1} \gamma^\mu S.&lt;/math&gt;

If in addition the matrices are all [[unitary transformation|unitary]], as are the Dirac set, then {{math|''S''}} itself is [[unitary matrix|unitary]];

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\mu\prime} = U^\dagger \gamma^\mu U.&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation {{math|''U''}} is unique up to a multiplicative factor of absolute value 1. Let us now imagine a [[Lorentz transformation]] to have been performed on the space and time coordinates, and on the derivative operators, which form a covariant vector. For the operator {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to remain invariant, the gammas must transform among themselves as a contravariant vector with respect to their spacetime index. These new gammas will themselves satisfy the Clifford relations, because of the orthogonality of the Lorentz transformation. By the fundamental theorem, we may replace the new set by the old set subject to a unitary transformation. In the new frame, remembering that the rest mass is a relativistic scalar, the Dirac equation will then take the form

:&lt;math&gt;( iU^\dagger \gamma^\mu U\partial_\mu^\prime - m)\psi(x^\prime,t^\prime) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U^\dagger(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu^\prime - m)U \psi(x^\prime,t^\prime) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If we now define the transformed spinor

:&lt;math&gt;\psi^\prime = U\psi&lt;/math&gt;

then we have the transformed Dirac equation in a way that demonstrates [[Manifest covariance|manifest relativistic invariance]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu^\prime - m)\psi^\prime(x^\prime,t^\prime) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, once we settle on any unitary representation of the gammas, it is final provided we transform the spinor according to the unitary transformation that corresponds to the given Lorentz transformation. The various representations of the Dirac matrices employed will bring into focus particular aspects of the physical content in the Dirac wave function (see below). The representation shown here is known as the ''standard'' representation – in it, the wave function's upper two components go over into Pauli's 2-spinor wave function in the limit of low energies and small velocities in comparison to light.

The considerations above reveal the origin of the gammas in ''geometry'', hearkening back to Grassmann's original motivation – they represent a fixed basis of unit vectors in spacetime. Similarly, products of the gammas such as {{math|''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;}} represent ''[[oriented surface]] elements'', and so on. With this in mind, we can find the form of the unit volume element on spacetime in terms of the gammas as follows. By definition, it is

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{4!}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu\gamma^\alpha\gamma^\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

For this to be an invariant, the [[Levi-Civita symbol|epsilon symbol]] must be a [[tensor]], and so must contain a factor of {{math|{{sqrt|''g''}}}}, where {{math|''g''}} is the [[determinant]] of the [[metric tensor]]. Since this is negative, that factor is ''imaginary''. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;V = i \gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3.\ &lt;/math&gt;

This matrix is given the special symbol {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}, owing to its importance when one is considering improper transformations of spacetime, that is, those that change the orientation of the basis vectors. In the standard representation, it is

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_5 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; I_{2} \\ I_{2} &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix will also be found to anticommute with the other four Dirac matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma^5 \gamma^\mu + \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

It takes a leading role when questions of ''[[Parity (physics)|parity]]'' arise because the volume element as a directed magnitude changes sign under a spacetime  reflection. Taking the positive square root above thus amounts to choosing a handedness convention on spacetime .

=== Conservation of probability current ===
By defining the [[Dirac adjoint|adjoint]] [[spinor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi} = \psi^\dagger\gamma^0&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ψ''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[conjugate transpose]] of {{math|''ψ''}}, and noticing that
:&lt;math&gt;(\gamma^\mu)^\dagger\gamma^0 = \gamma^0\gamma^\mu \,&lt;/math&gt;,
we obtain, by taking the Hermitian conjugate of the Dirac equation and multiplying from the right by {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the adjoint equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\psi}(-i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is understood to act to the left. Multiplying the Dirac equation by {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}}} from the left, and the adjoint equation by {{math|''ψ''}} from the right, and subtracting, produces the law of conservation of the Dirac current:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu \left( \bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\psi \right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we see the great advantage of the first-order equation over the one Schrödinger had tried – this is the conserved current density required by relativistic invariance, only now its 4th component is ''positive definite'' and thus suitable for the role of a probability density:

:&lt;math&gt;J^0 = \bar{\psi}\gamma^0\psi = \psi^\dagger\psi.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the probability density now appears as the fourth component of a relativistic vector and not a simple scalar as in the Schrödinger equation, it will be subject to the usual effects of the Lorentz transformations such as time dilation. Thus, for example, atomic processes that are observed as rates, will necessarily be adjusted in a way consistent with relativity, while those involving the measurement of energy and momentum, which themselves form a relativistic vector, will undergo parallel adjustment which preserves the relativistic covariance of the observed values.

=== Solutions ===

See [[Dirac spinor]] for details of solutions to the Dirac equation. Note that since the Dirac operator acts on 4-tuples of [[#square-integrable function|square-integrable functions]], its solutions should be members of the same [[Hilbert space]].  The fact that the energies of the solutions do not have a lower bound is unexpected – see the [[#Hole theory|hole theory]] section below for more details.

=== Comparison with the Pauli theory ===
{{See also|Pauli equation}}
The necessity of introducing half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] goes back experimentally to the results of the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]]. A beam of atoms is run through a strong [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|inhomogeneous]] [[magnetic field]], which then splits into {{math|''N''}} parts depending on the [[spin (physics)|intrinsic angular momentum]] of the atoms. It was found that for [[silver]] atoms, the beam was split in two—the [[ground state]] therefore could not be [[integer]], because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into three parts, corresponding to atoms with {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} −1, 0, +1}}. The conclusion is that silver atoms have net intrinsic angular momentum of {{frac|1|2}}. [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] set up a theory which explained this splitting by introducing a two-component wave function and a corresponding correction term in the [[Hamilton's Principle|Hamiltonian]], representing a semi-classical coupling of this wave function to an applied magnetic field, as so in [[SI units]]: (Note that bold faced characters imply [[Euclidean vectors]] in 3 [[dimensions]], where as the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[four-vector]] {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be defined as {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''Φ''/''c'', -'''A''')}}.)

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m}\left( \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right)\right)^2 + e\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|'''A'''}} and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; represent the components of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] in their standard SI units, and the three sigmas are the [[Pauli matrices]]. On squaring out the first term, a residual interaction with the magnetic field is found, along with the usual [[momentum#Particle in field|classical Hamiltonian of a charged particle]] interacting with an applied field in [[SI units]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m}\left(\mathbf{p}  - e \mathbf{A}\right)^2 + e\phi - \frac{e\hbar}{2m}\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

This Hamiltonian is now a 2 × 2 matrix, so the Schrödinger equation based on it must use a two-component wave function. On introducing the external electromagnetic 4-vector potential into the Dirac equation in a similar way, known as [[minimal coupling]], it takes the form :

:&lt;math&gt;(\gamma^\mu(i\hbar\partial_\mu - eA_\mu) - mc) \psi = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A second application of the Dirac operator will now reproduce the Pauli term exactly as before, because the spatial Dirac matrices multiplied by {{math|''i''}}, have the same squaring and commutation properties as the Pauli matrices. What is more, the value of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron, standing in front of Pauli's new term, is explained from first principles. This was a major achievement of the Dirac equation and gave physicists great faith in its overall correctness. There is more however. The Pauli theory may be seen as the low energy limit of the Dirac theory in the following manner. First the equation is written in the form of coupled equations for 2-spinors with the SI units restored:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} (mc^2 - E + e \phi) &amp; c\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right) \\ -c\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right) &amp; \left(mc^2 + E - e \phi\right) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_+ \\ \psi_- \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt; (E - e\phi) \psi_+ - c\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right) \psi_- = mc^2 \psi_+&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-(E - e\phi) \psi_- + c\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right) \psi_+ = mc^2 \psi_-&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the field is weak and the motion of the electron non-relativistic, we have the total energy of the electron approximately equal to its [[rest energy]], and the momentum going over to the classical value,

:&lt;math&gt;E - e\phi \approx mc^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \approx m \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

and so the second equation may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_- \approx  \frac{1}{2mc}  \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right) \psi_+&lt;/math&gt;

which is of order {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} – thus at typical energies and velocities, the bottom components of the Dirac spinor in the standard representation are much suppressed in comparison to the top components. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives after some rearrangement

:&lt;math&gt; (E - mc^2) \psi_+ = \frac{1}{2m} \left[\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \left(\mathbf{p} - e \mathbf{A}\right)\right]^2 \psi_+ + e\phi \psi_+&lt;/math&gt;

The operator on the left represents the particle energy reduced by its rest energy, which is just the classical energy, so we recover Pauli's theory if we identify his 2-spinor with the top components of the Dirac spinor in the non-relativistic approximation. A further approximation gives the Schrödinger equation as the limit of the Pauli theory. Thus, the Schrödinger equation may be seen as the far non-relativistic approximation of the Dirac equation when one may neglect spin and work only at low energies and velocities. This also was a great triumph for the new equation, as it traced the mysterious {{math|''i''}} that appears in it, and the necessity of a complex wave function, back to the geometry of spacetime  through the Dirac algebra. It also highlights why the Schrödinger equation, although superficially in the form of a [[diffusion equation]], actually represents the propagation of waves.

It should be strongly emphasized that this separation of the Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a low-energy approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an ''irreducible'' whole, and the components we have just neglected to arrive at the Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime – [[antimatter]] and the idea of [[Matter creation|creation]] and [[annihilation]] of particles.

=== Comparison with the Weyl theory ===

In the limit {{math|''m'' → 0}}, the Dirac equation reduces to the [[Weyl equation]], which describes relativistic massless spin-{{frac|2}} particles.&lt;ref name="Ohlsson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tommy Ohlsson|title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&amp;pg=PA86|date=22 September 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50432-4|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dirac Lagrangian ===

Both the Dirac equation and the Adjoint Dirac equation can be obtained from (varying) the action with a specific Lagrangian density that is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=i\hbar c\overline{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-mc^{2}\overline{\psi}\psi&lt;/math&gt;

If one varies this with respect to {{math|''ψ''}} one gets the Adjoint Dirac equation. Meanwhile, if one varies this with respect to {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}}} one gets the Dirac equation.

== Physical interpretation ==
=== Identification of observables ===
The critical physical question in a quantum theory is—what are the physically [[observable]] quantities defined by the theory? According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, such quantities are defined by [[Hermitian operator]]s that act on the [[Hilbert space]] of possible states of a system. The eigenvalues of these operators are then the possible results of [[Measurement problem|measuring]] the corresponding physical quantity. In the Schrödinger theory, the simplest such object is the overall Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of the system. If we wish to maintain this interpretation on passing to the Dirac theory, we must take the Hamiltonian to be

:&lt;math&gt;H = \gamma^0 \left[mc^2 + c \gamma^k \left(p_k-qA_k\right) \right] + qA^0.&lt;/math&gt;

where, as always, there is an [[Einstein notation|implied summation]] over the twice-repeated index {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}. This looks promising, because we see by inspection the rest energy of the particle and, in case {{math|''A'' {{=}} 0}}, the energy of a charge placed in an electric potential {{math|''qA''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}. What about the term involving the vector potential? In classical electrodynamics, the energy of a charge moving in an applied potential is

:&lt;math&gt;H = c\sqrt{\left(p - qA\right)^2 + m^2c^2} + qA^0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Dirac Hamiltonian is fundamentally distinguished from its classical counterpart, and we must take great care to correctly identify what is observable in this theory. Much of the apparently paradoxical behavior implied by the Dirac equation amounts to a misidentification of these observables.

=== Hole theory ===
The negative {{math|''E''}} solutions to the equation are problematic, for it was assumed that the particle has a positive energy. Mathematically speaking, however, there seems to be no reason for us to reject the negative-energy solutions. Since they exist, we cannot simply ignore them, for once we include the interaction between the electron and the electromagnetic field, any electron placed in a positive-energy eigenstate would decay into negative-energy eigenstates of successively lower energy. Real electrons obviously do not behave in this way, or they would disappear by emitting energy in the form of [[photon]]s.

To cope with this problem, Dirac introduced the hypothesis, known as '''hole theory''', that the [[vacuum]] is the many-body quantum state in which all the negative-energy electron eigenstates are occupied. This description of the vacuum as a "sea" of electrons is called the [[Dirac sea]]. Since the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] forbids electrons from occupying the same state, any additional electron would be forced to occupy a positive-energy eigenstate, and positive-energy electrons would be forbidden from decaying into negative-energy eigenstates.

If an electron is forbidden from simultaneously occupying positive-energy and negative-energy eigenstates, then the feature known as [[Zitterbewegung]], which arises from the interference of positive-energy and negative-energy states, would have to be considered to be an unphysical prediction of time-dependent Dirac theory.  This conclusion may be inferred from the explanation of hole theory given in the preceding paragraph. Recent results have been published in Nature [R. Gerritsma, G. Kirchmair, F. Zaehringer, E. Solano, R. Blatt, and C. Roos, Nature 463, 68-71 (2010)] in which the Zitterbewegung feature was simulated in a trapped-ion experiment. This experiment impacts the hole interpretation if one infers that the physics-laboratory experiment is not merely a check on the mathematical correctness of a Dirac-equation solution but the measurement of a real effect whose detectability in electron physics is still beyond reach.

Dirac further reasoned that if the negative-energy eigenstates are incompletely filled, each unoccupied eigenstate – called a '''hole''' – would behave like a positively charged particle. The hole possesses a ''positive'' energy since energy is required to create a particle–hole pair from the vacuum. As noted above, Dirac initially thought that the hole might be the proton, but [[Hermann Weyl]] pointed out that the hole should behave as if it had the same mass as an electron, whereas the proton is over 1800 times heavier. The hole was eventually identified as the [[positron]], experimentally discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]] in 1932.

It is not entirely satisfactory to describe the "vacuum" using an infinite sea of negative-energy electrons. The infinitely negative contributions from the sea of negative-energy electrons have to be canceled by an infinite positive "bare" energy and the contribution to the charge density and current coming from the sea of negative-energy electrons is exactly canceled by an infinite positive "[[jellium]]" background so that the net electric charge density of the vacuum is zero. In [[quantum field theory]], a [[Bogoliubov transformation]] on the [[creation and annihilation operators]] (turning an occupied negative-energy electron state into an unoccupied positive energy positron state and an unoccupied negative-energy electron state into an occupied positive energy positron state) allows us to bypass the Dirac sea formalism even though, formally, it is equivalent to it.

In certain applications of [[condensed matter physics]], however, the underlying concepts of "hole theory" are valid. The sea of [[conduction electron]]s in an [[electrical conductor]], called a [[Composite fermion#Fermi sea|Fermi sea]], contains electrons with energies up to the [[chemical potential]] of the system. An unfilled state in the Fermi sea behaves like a positively charged electron, though it is referred to as a "hole" rather than a "positron". The negative charge of the Fermi sea is balanced by the positively charged ionic lattice of the material.

=== In quantum field theory ===
{{See also|Fermionic field}}
In [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], the Dirac field is subject to a process of [[second quantization]], which resolves some of the paradoxical features of the equation.

== Other formulations ==

The Dirac equation can be formulated in a number of other ways.

=== As a differential equation in one real component ===

Generically (if a certain linear function of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), three out of four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one component. Furthermore, this remaining component can be made real by a gauge transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.3624336|title=One real function instead of the Dirac spinor function|year=2011|last1=Akhmeteli|first1=Andrey|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=52|issue=8|page=082303|arxiv = 1008.4828 |bibcode = 2011JMP....52h2303A |url=http://akhmeteli.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/JMAPAQ528082303_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curved spacetime ===

This article has developed the Dirac equation in flat spacetime according to special relativity. It is possible to formulate the [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime]].

=== The algebra of physical space ===

This article developed the Dirac equation using four vectors and Schrödinger operators. The [[Dirac equation in the algebra of physical space]] uses a Clifford algebra over the real numbers, a type of geometric algebra.

=== In polar form ===

For the Dirac spinor, it is possible to show that one can always find local Lorentz transformations for which the spinor is written in the so-called polar form, that is the form manifesting only two physical degrees of freedom, given by the scalar and pseudo-scalar bi-linear quantities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00006-017-0816-9|author=Luca Fabbri|title=General Dynamics of Spinors|year=2017|journal=Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras|volume=27|page=2901|arxiv=1707.03270}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the Dirac spinor field equation can always be written in the corresponding polar form, which is the form specifying all derivatives of the scalar and pseudo-scalar bi-linear quantities themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6260-8|author=Luca Fabbri|title=Covariant inertial forces for spinors|year=2018|journal=European Physical Journal C|volume=78|page=783|arxiv=1810.01290|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-018-6260-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this formulation, the Dirac spinor field equation (which are four complex equations, and so eight equations in total) is converted into an equivalent system of two real vector equations (which are two 4-dimensional equations, and so again eight equations in total). This is what is known as the [[polar form of the Dirac equation]].

'''Electric car use by country''' varies worldwide, as the adoption of [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s is affected by consumer demand, market prices and government incentives. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are generally divided into all-electric or [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), that run only on batteries, and [[plug-in hybrid]]s (PHEVs), that combine battery power with [[internal combustion engines]]. 
The popularity of electric vehicles has been expanding rapidly due to government subsidies, their increased range and lower battery costs, and environmental sensitivity. 
However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just about 1 out of every 300 [[motor vehicle]]s on the world's roads by September 2018.&lt;ref name=Global4mi_1/&gt;

===Government incentives===

California established a program to reduce [[motor vehicle emissions|air pollution]] in the 1980s. Under pressure from manufacturers, the program was revised to offer only modest support of zero-emission vehicles to promote research and development, and greater support for [[partial zero-emissions vehicle]]s (PZEVs). Many manufacturers then terminated their electric car programs.&lt;ref name="wctec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s2798who.html|title=DVD Savant Review:Who Killed the Electric Car?|last=Erickson|first=Glenn|date=10 January 2009|publisher=dvdtalk.com|accessdate=17 November 2009}}. See main article [[Who killed the electric car]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''February 2015 North American cold wave''' was an extreme weather event that affected most of [[Canada]] and the eastern half of the [[United States]]. Following [[November 2014 North American cold wave|an earlier cold wave]] in the winter, the period of below-average temperatures contributed to an already unusually cold winter for the Eastern U.S. Several places broke their records for their coldest February on record, while some areas came very close. The cause of the cold wave was due to the [[polar vortex]] advancing southwards into the eastern parts of the U.S, and even making it as far south as the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], where snow is rare. By the beginning of March, although the pattern did continue for the first week, it abated and retreated near the official end of the winter.

In addition to the extremely cold weather, multiple [[winter storm]]s affected nearly the entire United States, especially in the snow-weary Northeast, which had already seen nearly {{convert|3|ft|m}} of snow in the latter part of January; this was added to by roughly {{convert|3-4|ft|m}} more snow, leading to [[Boston]] having its highest seasonal snowfall on record. 

== Origins ==
Like most normal [[cold wave]]s, the cold wave was caused by the southwards movement of the [[polar vortex]] into the [[United States]] due to changes in the  [[jet stream]] in early February 2015. However, unlike most which last for a few days, this one remained for much of the entire month. This was partly due to the [[Ridiculously Resilient Ridge]], which persisted over parts of [[Alaska]] for much of the month, essentially keeping the jet stream pattern "locked" for several weeks. This allowed for bitterly cold air masses to migrate southwards into the eastern part of the country, leading to well-below average temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/synoptic/201502|title=Synoptic Discussion - February 2015 - State of the Climate -  National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)|first=|last=Heim|work=noaa.gov|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Record temperatures ==
The average temperature in Boston for January was {{convert|2.9|F-change}} below the 1981–2010 normal, and the average temperature in February was {{convert|19.0|°F|°C}}, which was {{convert|12.7|F-change}} below the 1981–2010 normal, making it the second-coldest month of any month all-time, behind February 1934. March was {{convert|5.2|F-change}} below average. By the end of a period spanning from the beginning of February to the end of December, Worcester, Massachusetts saw a record {{convert|101.4|in|cm}} of snowfall, breaking the {{convert|86.7|in|cm}} record set in 2004–05, which was {{convert|54.3|in|cm}} over the average. Hartford and Providence saw similar below-average temperatures for the two months, with Hartford's February finish of {{convert|16.1|°F|°C}} besting February 1934 to become the coldest month of any month all-time in record keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=David|title=Meteorological Winter, More Snow In The Forecast-Twice|url=http://www.boston.com/news/weather/weather_wisdom/2015/03/meteorolgical_winter_more_snow.html|website=boston.com|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=April Warmth Beckons|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/03/29/april-warmth-beckons/|website=CBS Boston|publisher=CBS Local Media|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature in Bangor, Maine for February was {{convert|6.2|°F|°C}}, about {{convert|15|F-change}} below normal, breaking the old record of {{convert|8.4|°F|°C}} set in January 1994. Portland, Maine also saw a record coldest average monthly temperature of {{convert|13.8|°F|°C}} in February. On February 24, the temperature at Dulles International Airport in Virginia fell to dipped down to {{convert|-4|°F|°C}}, breaking the previous record of {{convert|14|°F|°C}} set in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawrence|first1=John|title=Extreme Weather Watch: February 2015 Sets Records for Snow and Cold|url=http://sandiegofreepress.org/2015/03/extreme-weather-watch-february-2015-sets-records-for-snow-and-cold/|website=sandiegofreepress.org|publisher=SanDiegoFreePress.org|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutland, Vermont, saw a record averaged cold for February of {{convert|5.2|°F|°C}}, breaking its previous record of {{convert|7.4|°F|°C}} set in 1934. Montpelier, Vermont realized its coldest February with an average temperature of {{convert|5.1|°F|°C}}, {{convert|3.0|F-change}} below the 1979 record of {{convert|8.1|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Associated Press|title=Cities in Vermont, Maine set records for coldest February|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2015/03/01/february-brought-record-cold-snow-to-northeast/|website=pressherald.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average February temperature in Syracuse, New York, was {{convert|16.7|F-change}} degrees below normal at {{convert|9.1|°F|°C}}, breaking by 3 degrees the record set in February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nett|first1=Dennis|title=Frigid February 2015: CNY says goodbye and good riddance to one for the record books|url=http://www.syracuse.com/weather/index.ssf/2015/02/february_2015_weather_syracuse_coldest_month_on_record_northeast.html|website=syracuse.com|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature in Buffalo, New York set a record in February for its all-time coldest month with an average temperature of {{convert|10.9|°F|°C}}. breaking the prior record set in 1934 of {{convert|11.6|°F|°C}}.

==Related weather ==
Most of the northern half of the United States and even parts of [[Canada]] saw several [[winter storm]]s impact them; each of them had somewhat unique traits. At the start of the month, a major snowstorm was moving across the country, having previously brought [[blizzard]] conditions to the [[Midwest]], especially in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where more than a foot of snow was recorded. This storm continued to dump large amounts of snow as it progressed into the Northeast and New England, before finally exiting offshore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/event_reviews/2015/Southwest_Northeast_WinterStorm_Jan2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a week later, another winter storm struck New England, with up to nearly {{convert|2|ft|in}} of snow recorded in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] over a period of two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-marcus-reports-how-much-snow|title=Marcus Sets All-Time Snow Records: How Much Snow Has Fallen?|work=weather.com|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of a three-week streak of winter storms that would progress into the Northeast (with the expectation of one system which went further south).

Around the middle of the month, near [[Valentine's Day]], a powerful blizzard struck the Northeast again, bringing strong winds and more heavy snowfall. Afterwards, as the storm exited, it ushered in the coldest air to impact the Northeast in decades, with temperatures dipping as far as {{convert|30–40|F|C}} below average. Several places broke record lows for February, and temperatures even dipped below {{convert|0|F|C}} in a good part of the Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/winter_storm_summaries/event_reviews/2015/Northeast_US_WinterStorm_2_Feb2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-storm-neptune-blizzard-boston-snow-new-england|title=Winter Storm Neptune: Blowing Snow, Brutal Wind Chills in Wake of New England Blizzard|work=weather.com|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several more winter storms followed afterwards, but one of the more notable ones was the one that occurred from February 25–26. This particular storm took an unusual track into the [[Southeastern United States]] as the [[jet stream]] along with the polar vortex pushed even further southward, resulting in heavy snowfall in states that rarely see it at all, this included [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S state)|Georgia]], and the Carolinas. Up to {{convert|18|in|cm}} fell in the hardest hit areas, which was in [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/news/news/winter-storm-remus-minute-by-minute|title=Winter Storm Remus: One of Heaviest Snowstorms on Record in Parts of Mississippi and Alabama|work=weather.com|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''filling station''' is a facility that sells [[fuel]] and engine [[lubricant]]s for [[motor vehicle]]s. The most common fuels sold in the 2010s are [[gasoline]] (''gasoline'' or ''gas'' in the U.S. and Canada, generally ''petrol'' elsewhere) and [[diesel fuel]]. A filling station that sells only electric energy is also known as a [[charging station]], while a typical filling station can also be known as a &lt;!--alphabetical order--&gt;'''fuelling, '''gas station''' (United States and Canada), '''gasoline stand''' or '''SS'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[List of Japanese Latin alphabetic abbreviations|Latin alphabetic abbreviation]] for '''s'''ervice '''s'''tation&lt;/ref&gt; (Japan), '''petrol pump''' or '''petrol bunk''' (India), '''petrol garage''', '''petrol station''' (Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom and Ireland), '''service station''' (Australia, Japan, New Zealand and United Kingdom), '''a services''' (United Kingdom),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://think.direct.gov.uk/fatigue.html |title=Video reference: 0:09-0:15 "Before you feel too tired, pull off into a Services or other safe area." |work=United Kingdom road safety THINK program |accessdate=2014-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701093748/http://think.direct.gov.uk/fatigue.html |archivedate=2014-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''servo''' (Australia).

[[Fuel dispenser]]s are used to pump petrol/gasoline, diesel, [[compressed natural gas]], [[CGH2]], [[HCNG]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[liquid hydrogen]], [[kerosene]], [[alcohol fuel]] (like [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[butanol]], [[propanol]]), [[biofuel]]s (like [[straight vegetable oil]], [[biodiesel]]), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Fuel dispensers are also known as &lt;!--alpha by location--&gt;'''bowsers''' (in some parts of Australia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Ozwords | url = http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/pdfs/ozwords_oct05.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Australian National Dictionary Centre | date = October 2005 | author = Mark Gwynn | title = When people become words | quote = But one doesn't have to be an Australian to enter the Australian lexicon — take bowser 'petrol pump' (in Australia), which is [[namesake|named after]] a company established by US inventor and entrepreneur [[Sylvanus Bowser|S.F.

Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which is also found in filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a [[convenience store]], which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.

The convenience stores found in filling stations typically sell [[candy]], [[soft drink]]s, [[snack]]s and, in some cases, a small selection of [[grocery store|grocery]] items, such as milk. Some also sell [[propane]] or [[butane]] and have added shops to their primary business. Conversely, some [[chain store]]s, such as [[supermarkets]], [[discount store]]s, [[warehouse club]]s, or traditional convenience stores, have provided filling stations on the premises.

==Terminology==
The term "gas station" is widely used in the United States, Canada and the English-speaking Caribbean, where the fuel is known as "gasoline" or "gas" as in "gas pump". In some regions of Canada, the term ''gas bar'' is used. Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, mainly in the [[Commonwealth of nations|Commonwealth]], the fuel is known as "petrol", and the term "petrol station" or "petrol pump" is used. In the United Kingdom and South Africa "garage" is still commonly used. Similarly, in Australia, the term "service station" ("servo") describes any petrol station. In [[wasei-eigo|Japanese English]], a commonly used term is ''gasoline stand'', although the [[List of Japanese Latin alphabetic abbreviations|abbreviation]] ''SS'' (for ''s''ervice ''s''tation) is also used. In [[Indian English]], it is called a ''petrol pump'' or a ''petrol bunk''. In some regions of America and Australia, many filling stations have a mechanic on duty, but this is uncommon in other parts of the world.

==History==
[[File:WslErsteTanke.jpg|thumb|upright|The world's first "filling station", the City Pharmacy in [[Wiesloch]], Germany]]
The first filling station was the city [[Pharmacy#Community pharmacy|pharmacy]] in [[Wiesloch]], [[Germany]], where [[Bertha Benz]] refilled the tank of the first [[automobile]] on its maiden trip from [[Mannheim]] to [[Pforzheim]] back in 1888. Shortly thereafter other pharmacies sold gasoline as a side business. Since 2008 the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]] commemorates this event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rzK2QYQHl4 The Car is Born – A documentary about Carl and Bertha Benz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905182135/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rzK2QYQHl4&amp;feature=related |date=2012-09-05 }} (YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bertha-benz.de/indexen.php?sub=2&amp;col=b&amp;inhalt=pers_erstetankst|title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923183832/http://www.bertha-benz.de/indexen.php?sub=2&amp;col=b&amp;inhalt=pers_erstetankst|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The first "posto de gasolina" of South America was opened in Santos, Brazil, in 1920. It was located in the Ana Costa Ave., in front of the beach, in a corner that nowadays is located the Hotel Atlantico. It was an Esso Gas Station, brought by Antonio Duarte Moreira, a taxi entrepeneur. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.juicysantos.com.br/vida-caicara/nostalgia-santista/desde-que-gasolina-era-com-z/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===United States===
The increase in automobile ownership after [[Henry Ford]] started to sell [[Ford Model T|automobiles that the middle class could afford]] resulted in an increased demand for filling stations.  The world's first purpose-built gas station was constructed in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1905 at 420 S. Theresa Avenue. The second gas station was constructed in 1907 by [[Standard Oil of California]] (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) in Seattle, Washington, at what is now Pier 32. Reighard's Gas Station in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], claims that it dates from 1909 and is the oldest existing gas station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennsylvania-mountains-of-attractions.com/oldest-gasoline-station.html|title=America's Oldest Gasoline Station|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605194309/http://www.pennsylvania-mountains-of-attractions.com/oldest-gasoline-station.html|archivedate=5 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early on, they were known to motorists as "filling stations".

The [[Whitehill-Gleason Motors|first "drive-in"]] filling station, [[Gulf Refining Company]], opened to the motoring public in [[Pittsburgh]] on December 1, 1913, at Baum Blvd &amp; St Clair's Street (Walter's Automotive Shop was located here on the 100th anniversary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=364 First Drive-In Filling Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215050139/http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=364 |date=2010-12-15 }}, ExplorePAhistory.com&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, automobile drivers pulled into almost any general or hardware store, or even blacksmith shops in order to fill up their tanks. On its first day, the station sold 30 gallons of gasoline at 27 cents per gallon. This was also the first architect-designed station and the first to distribute free road maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacsonline.com/YourBusiness/FuelsReports/GasPrices_2011/Pages/100PlusYearsGasolineRetailing.aspx|title=The History of Gasoline Retailing - NACS Online – Your Business – NACS Retail Fuels Reports – 2011 NACS Retail Fuels Report|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611163521/http://www.nacsonline.com/YourBusiness/FuelsReports/GasPrices_2011/Pages/100PlusYearsGasolineRetailing.aspx|archivedate=11 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first alternative fuel station was opened in [[San Diego, California]], by [[Pearson Fuels]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2008/08/06/e85-station-opens-in-concord-california/|title=E85 Station Opens in Concord, California|work=Energy|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128210318/http://domesticfuel.com/2008/08/06/e85-station-opens-in-concord-california/|archivedate=28 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the first filling stations appeared in 1911, when the Imperial Automobile Society signed an agreement with the partnership "Br. Nobel". By 1914 about 440 filling stations functioned in major cities across the country.

In the mid-1960s in Moscow there were about 250 stations. A significant boost in retail network development occurred with the mass launch of the car "[[Zhiguli (car brand)|Zhiguli]]" at the [[AvtoVAZ|Volga Automobile Plant]], which was built in [[Tolyatti]] in 1970. Gasoline for other than non-private cars was sold for [[ration cards]] only. This type of payment system stopped in the midst of "[[Perestroika]]" in the early 1990s.

Today, since the saturation of automobile filling stations in Russia is insufficient and lags behind the leading countries of the world, today there is a need to accommodate new stations in the cities and along the roads of different levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinso-azs.ru/articles/istoriya-razvitiya-azs-v-rossii.html|title=The history of filling stations in Russia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204170707/http://vinso-azs.ru/articles/istoriya-razvitiya-azs-v-rossii.html|archivedate=2017-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and function==
[[File:Shellgasstationlosthills.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gas station near [[Lost Hills, California]], U.S.]]
[[File:Indian Oil Petrol Station.JPG|thumb|right|An Indian Oil filling station near [[Dera Bassi|Derabassi]], [[Punjab, India]].]]

Most filling stations are built in a similar manner, with most of the fueling installation underground, [[pump]] machines in the [[forecourt]] and a [[point of service]] inside a building. Single or multiple [[fuel tank]]s are usually deployed underground. Local regulations and environmental concerns may require a different method, with some stations storing their fuel in container tanks, entrenched surface tanks or unprotected fuel tanks deployed on the surface. Fuel is usually offloaded from a [[tanker truck]] into the tanks through a separate valve, located on the filling station's perimeter. Fuel from the tanks travels to the dispenser pumps through underground pipes. For every fuel tank, direct access must be available at all times. Most tanks can be accessed through a service canal directly from the forecourt.

Older stations tend to use a separate pipe for every kind of available fuel and for every dispenser. Newer stations may employ a single pipe for every dispenser. This pipe houses a number of smaller pipes for the individual fuel types. Fuel tanks, dispenser and nozzles used to fill car tanks employ [[vapor recovery]] systems, which prevents releases of vapor into the atmosphere with a system of pipes. The exhausts are placed as high as possible. A vapor recovery system may be employed at the exhaust pipe. This system collects the vapors, liquifies them and releases them back into the lowest grade fuel tank available.

The forecourt is the part of a filling station where vehicles are refueled. Fuel dispensers are placed on concrete plinths, as a precautionary measure. Additional elements may be employed, including metal barriers. The area around the fuel dispensers must have a drainage system. Since fuel sometimes spills on the ground, as little of it as possible should penetrate the soil. Any liquids present on the forecourt will flow into a [[channel drain]] before it enters a [[petrol interceptor]] which is designed to capture any [[hydrocarbon]] [[pollutants]] and filter these from rainwater which may then proceed to a [[foul sewer]], [[stormwater drain]] or to ground.

If a filling station allows customers to pay at the register, the data from the dispensers may be transmitted via [[RS232]], [[RS485]] or [[Ethernet]] to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. The cash register system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.

===Underground filling stations===
The underground modular filling station is a construction model for filling stations that was developed and patented by [[U-Cont Oy Ltd]] in Finland in 1993. Afterwards the same system was used in Florida, USA. Above-ground modular filling stations were built in the 1980s in eastern Europe and especially in Soviet Union, but they were not built in other parts of Europe due to the stations' lack of safety in case of fire.

The construction model for underground modular filling station makes the installation time shorter, designing easier and manufacturing less expensive. As a proof of the model's installation speed an unofficial world record of filling station installation was made by U-Cont Oy Ltd when a modular filling station was built in Helsinki, Finland in less than three days, including groundwork. The safety of modular filling stations has been tested in a filling station simulator, in [[Kuopio]], Finland. These tests have included for instance burning cars and explosions in the station simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erpecnews.com/fileadmin/pdf/erpecnews19_europe.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613214900/http://erpecnews.com/fileadmin/pdf/erpecnews19_europe.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://u-cont.com/index-en/products/filling_stations.html Ucont]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

===North America===
In the United States and Canada, there are generally two marketing types of filling stations: premium brands and discount brands.

====Premium brands====
[[File:Hydrogen fueling nozzle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hydrogen station|Hydrogen fueling nozzle]]]]
Filling stations with ''premium brands'' sell well-recognized and often international brands of gasoline, including [[Exxon]] and its [[Esso]] brand, [[Phillips 66|Phillips 66/Conoco/76]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Mobil]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], [[Husky Energy]], [[Sunoco]] (US), [[BP]], [[Valero Energy Corporation|Valero]] and [[Texaco]]. Non-international premium brands include [[Petrobras]], [[Petro-Canada]] (owned by Suncor Energy Canada), [[QuikTrip]], [[Hess Corporation|Hess]], [[Sinclair Oil|Sinclair]], and [[Pemex]]. Premium brand stations accept [[credit card]]s, often issue their own company cards (a.k.a. [[fuel cards]] or fleet cards) and may charge higher prices. In some cases, fuel cards for customers with a lower fuel consumption are ordered not directly from an oil company, but from an intermediary. Many premium brands have fully automated pay-at-the-pump facilities. Premium gas stations tend to be highly visible from [[highway]] and [[freeway]] exits, utilizing tall signs to display their brand logos.

====Discount brands====
''Discount brands'' are often smaller, regional chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers or from the major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some [[supermarket]]s ([[New Albertsons, Inc.|Albertsons]], [[Kroger]], [[Ingles]], [[Lowes Foods]], [[Giant-Carlisle|Giant]], [[Weis Markets]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], [[Hy-Vee]], [[Vons]], [[Meijer]], [[Loblaw Companies|Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore]], and [[Giant Eagle]]), [[convenience store]]s ([[7-Eleven]], [[Circle K]], [[Cumberland Farms]], [[Quick Chek]], [[Road Ranger]], [[Sheetz]] and [[Wawa Food Markets|Wawa]]), [[Discount store#Discount department store|discount stores]] ([[Walmart]], [[Canadian Tire]]) and [[warehouse club]]s ([[Costco]], [[Sam's Club]], and [[BJ's Wholesale Club]]). At some stations (such as [[Vons]], [[Costco]], [[BJ's Wholesale Club]], or [[Sam's Club]]), consumers are required to hold a special [[Loyalty program|membership card]] in order to be eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's [[gift card|cash card]], debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as [[7-Eleven]] and [[Circle K]], have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining [[Gulf Oil]] outlets in the United States.

===State-controlled stations===

[[File:Cambodia gas station.jpg|thumb|right|Gas station on the road from the Thai border to [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia]]

Some countries have only one brand of filling station. In Mexico, where the oil industry is state-owned and prices are regulated, the country's main operator of filling stations is [[Pemex]]. In Malaysia, Shell is the dominant player by number of stations, with government-owned [[Petronas]] coming in second. In Indonesia, the dominant player by number of stations is the government-owned [[Pertamina]], although other companies such as [[Total S.A.|Total]] and Shell are increasingly found in big cities such as the capital [[Jakarta]] or [[Surabaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migas.esdm.go.id/tracking/berita-kemigasan/detil/255662/April,-Peralihan-ke-SPBU-Asing-Makin-Marak |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317173619/http://www.migas.esdm.go.id/tracking/berita-kemigasan/detil/255662/April,-Peralihan-ke-SPBU-Asing-Makin-Marak |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global and local branding===
[[File:EneosGasStation.JPG|thumbnail|right|An ENEOS filling station near Mount Fuji in Japan]]
Some companies, such as Shell, use their brand worldwide, however, Chevron uses its inherited brand [[Caltex]] in Asia Pacific, Australia and Africa, and its [[Texaco]] brand in Europe and Latin America. [[ExxonMobil]] uses its [[Exxon]] and [[Mobil]] brands but is still known as [[Esso]] (the forerunner company name, Standard Oil or S. O.) in many places, most noticeably in Canada. In Brazil, the main operators are [[BR Distribuidora|Petrobras Distribuidora]] and [[Petroleo Ipiranga|Ipiranga]], but Esso and Shell are also present. In the United Kingdom, the two largest are [[BP]] and Shell. The "Big Four" supermarket chains, [[Morrisons]], [[Sainsburys]], [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]], all operate filling stations, as well as some of the smaller supermarkets such as [[The Co-operative Group]] and [[Waitrose]]. Indian Oil operates approximately 15,000 filling stations in India. In Japan, the main operators are [[Cosmo Oil Company|Cosmo Oil]], [[Idemitsu Kosan|Idemitsu]],
[[JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy]] (under the brand names ENEOS, Express and General) and [[Mitsubishi Group]] (operates self-service stations under the [[Lawson (store)|Lawson convenience store branding]]), although foreign brands such as Esso, Mobil (both operated by JXTG Nippon Oil under licence from ExxonMobil) and Shell ([[Showa Shell Sekiyu]]) are also present.

==Payment methods==

===Canada===
In British Columbia and Alberta, it is a legal requirement that customers either pre-pay for the fuel or pay at the pump.  The law is called "Grant's Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/10/04/grants-law.html |work=CBC News |title=B.C. to implement 'Grant's Law' to protect gas station workers |date=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143544/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/10/04/grants-law.html |archivedate=May 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is intended to prevent "gas-and-dash" crimes.
In other provinces payment after filling is permitted and widely available, though some stations may require either a prepayment or a payment at the pump at night hours.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, most filling stations allow customers to pump fuel before settling the bill. Some filling stations have pay-at-the-pump facilities.

===New Zealand===
Most service stations allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying; this is particularly the case in the smaller towns and cities in New Zealand. In recent years some service stations have required customers to purchase their fuel first. It is quite common for customers to hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if they are paying for a set amount of fuel and have no change. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay at the pump only. Customers at the supermarket will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries at the supermarket, but normally starts at 4 cents a litre.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Central Garage, High Street, Boston Spa.jpg|thumb|right|A small independent filling station in [[Boston Spa]], West Yorkshire, England. Stations like these in the United Kingdom are becoming rarer.]]
A large majority of stations allow customers to pay with a [[chip and pin]] payment card or pay in the shop. Many have a [[pay at the pump]] system, where customers can enter their [[personal identification number|PIN]] prior to filling.

===United States===
Pre-payment, most commonly at the pump, is the norm in the U.S. Customers may typically pay either at the pump or inside the gas station's shop/pay station. Modern gas stations have pay-at-the-pump capabilities: in most cases credit, [[debit card|debit]], [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] cards, [[fuel card]]s and [[fleet card]]s are accepted. Occasionally a station will have a pay-at-the-pump-only period per day, when attendants are not present, often at night, and some stations are pay-at-the-pump-only 24 hours a day.

==Types of service==
Filling stations typically offer one of three types of service to their customers: full service, minimum service or self-service.

;Full service
:An attendant ([[gas jockey]]) operates the pumps, often wipes the windshield, and sometimes checks the vehicle's oil level and tire pressure, then collects payment (and perhaps a small tip).
;Minimum service
:An attendant operates the pumps. This is often required due to legislation that prohibits customers from operating the pumps.
;Self service
:The customer performs all required service. Signs informing the customer of filling procedures and cautions are displayed on each pump. Customers can still enter a store or go to a booth to give payment to a person.
;Unmanned
:Using [[cardlock]] (or pay-at-the-pump) system, these are completely unstaffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhusky.ca/your_business/facilities/standalone_cardlock.html|title=Husky Cardlocks – MyHusky.ca|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523034909/http://www.myhusky.ca/your_business/facilities/standalone_cardlock.html|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
[[File:Postodegasolinafeiradesantana.jpg|thumb|right|'''Filling station''' of [[Royal Dutch Shell]] in [[Feira de Santana]], Brazil.]]

In Brazil, self-service fuel filling is illegal, due to a federal law enacted in 2000. The law was introduced by Federal Deputy [[Aldo Rebelo]], who claims it saved 300,000 [[Filling station attendant|fuel attendant]] jobs across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ministro Aldo Rebelo comenta artigo sobre baixo crescimento|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/paineldoleitor/2015/02/1593346-ministro-aldo-rebelo-comenta-artigo-sobre-baixo-crescimento.shtml|publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=2015-02-23|author=Aldo Rebelo|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226151143/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/paineldoleitor/2015/02/1593346-ministro-aldo-rebelo-comenta-artigo-sobre-baixo-crescimento.shtml|archivedate=2015-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Lawson Shingu Misaki3.JPG|thumb|A [[Lawson (store)|Lawson]] self-service station with attached convenience store in [[Shingū, Fukuoka|Shingū]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], Japan]]
Before 1998, filling stations in Japan were entirely full-service stations. Self-service filling stations were legalised in Japan in 1998 following the abolishment of the [[Special Petroleum Law]] which led to the deregulation of the petroleum industry in Japan. Under current safety regulations, while motorists are able to self-dispense fuel at self-service stations, generally identified in Japanese as {{Nihongo||セルフ|serufu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/gas-stations-in-japan/|title=Gas Stations in Japan - How to fill up|author=|date=|website=realestate-tokyo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least one fuel attendant must be on hand to keep watch over potential safety violations and to render assistance to motorists whenever necessary. 

===United States and Canada===
[[File:full service.svg|thumb|right|The states of Oregon and New Jersey (shown in red) prohibit self-service.]]
In the past, filling stations in the United States offered a choice between ''full service'' and ''self service''. Before 1970, full service was the norm, and self-service was rare. Today, few stations advertise or provide full service. Full service stations are more common in wealthy and upscale areas. The cost of full service is usually assessed as a fixed amount per U.S.&amp;nbsp;gallon.

The first self-service station in the United States was in [[Los Angeles]], opened in 1947 by [[Frank Urich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the first self-service station opened in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], in 1949. It was operated by the independent company [[Henderson Thriftway Petroleum]], owned by Bill Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/33017474.html |title=P is for Pump |website=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001170529/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/33017474.html |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All stations in New Jersey and Oregon offer only full service and mini service; attendants are required to pump gas since customers are prohibited by law in both states from pumping gas themselves. The only exceptions are at the filling stations next to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Wrightstown, New Jersey and next to the Indian reservation casinos in both Pendleton and Grand Ronde, Oregon where self-service is permitted at these three locations. New Jersey prohibited self-service gasoline in 1949 after lobbying by service station owners. Proponents of the prohibition cite safety and jobs as reasons to keep the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Genovese|first=Peter|contribution = Full-service gas stations|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of New Jersey|editor-last=Lurie|editor-first=Maxine N.|editor2-last=Mappen|editor2-first=Marc|pages=295|place=[[Piscataway, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=0-8135-3325-2|postscript=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, the 1951 Oregon statute prohibiting self-service gasoline lists 17 different justifications, including the [[flammability]] of gas, the risk of crime from customers leaving their vehicles, the toxic fumes emitted by gasoline, and the jobs created by requiring mini service.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oregon Revised Statutes|ORS]] 480.315. {{cite web | url =http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/480.html | title =Chapter 480 | work =Oregon Revised Statutes, 2007 edition | publisher =Legislative Counsel Committee of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] | accessdate =2008-06-24 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080613145858/http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/480.html | archivedate =2008-06-13 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ban on self-service gasoline is seen as part of Oregonian culture. One commentator noted, "The joke is when babies are born in Oregon, the doctor slaps their bottom, 'No self-serve and no sales tax'... It's as much a cultural issue as an economic issue. It's a way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David W. |last=Chen |title=New Jersey May Drop Ban on Self-Service Gas Stations |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/nyregion/28pump.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211140045/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/nyregion/28pump.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent years have shown that this opinion might be changing, as a 2014 Public Policy Poll showed that although self-serve was favored by a narrow margin of all Oregonians, Oregonians under 45 favored self-serve gas by 53 percent to 33 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2014/06/younger_oregon_voters_strongly.html |title=Younger Oregon Voters Strongly Favor Self-Service Gas Pumps |author=Jeff Mapes |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518173557/http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2014/06/younger_oregon_voters_strongly.html |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982 Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure sponsored by the service station owners, which would have legalized self-service gas.&lt;ref&gt;Ballot Measure 4 of 1982 was titled "Permits Self-Service Dispensing of Motor Vehicle Fuel at Retail" and failed with 440,824 votes in favor and 597,970 against. {{cite web |url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf |title=Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1980–1987 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |work=[[Oregon Blue Book]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon legislators passed a bill that was later signed into law by the Governor in May 2017 to allow self-service for counties with a total population of 40,000 or less beginning in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/12/many_central_oregon_gas_statio.html|title=Many central Oregon gas stations to pass on self-service|publisher=''Associated Press''|date=30 December 2017|accessdate=2 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231004542/http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2017/12/many_central_oregon_gas_statio.html|archivedate=31 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Huntington, New York]] prohibits gasoline self-service to save jobs. The ban came into effect in the early 1970s during a recession.

The constitutionality of the self-service bans has been disputed. The Oregon statute was brought into court in 1989 by [[ARCO]], and the New Jersey statute was challenged in court in 1950 by a small independent service station, Rein Motors. Both challenges failed. Former New Jersey governor [[Jon Corzine]] sought to lift the ban on self-service for New Jersey. He asserted that it would be able to lower gas prices, but some New Jerseyans argued that it could cause drawbacks, especially unemployment. However, Phil Murphy's plan on $15 minimum wage will increase expenses, may cause self service.

In New Jersey and Oregon, it is legal for customers to pump their own diesel (although not every station permits diesel customers to do so; [[truck stop]]s typically do). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In Oregon, "certain nonretail" customers may also pump their own fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oregon Revised Statutes|ORS]] 480.345. {{cite web | url =http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/480.html | title =Chapter 480 | work =Oregon Revised Statutes, 2007 edition | publisher =Legislative Counsel Committee of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] | accessdate =2009-06-13 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080613145858/http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/480.html | archivedate =2008-06-13 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other goods and services commonly available==
[[File:Spar Express Wattens.jpg|thumb|A [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]] express convenience store in a [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] filling station in [[Wattens]], Austria.]]

Many stations provide [[Public toilet|toilet facilities]] for customer use, as well as [[squeegee]]s and [[paper towel]]s for customers to clean their vehicle's windows. Discount stations may not provide these amenities in some countries.

Stations typically have an [[Gas compressor|air compressor]] (some with a built-in or provided handheld [[tire-pressure gauge]]) to inflate tires and a hose to add water to vehicle [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiators]]. Some air compressor machines are free of charge, while others charge a small fee to use (typically 50 cents to a dollar in North America). In many U.S. states, state law requires that paying customers must be provided with free air compressor service. In most cases, a token provided by the attendant is used in lieu of coins.

Many filling stations have integrated [[convenience store]]s which sell food, beverages, and often cigarettes, lottery tickets, motor oil, and auto parts. Prices for these items tend to be higher than they would be at a supermarket or discount store.

Many stations, particularly in the United States, have a [[fast food outlet]] inside. These are usually "express" versions with limited seating and limited menus, though some may be regular-sized and have spacious seating.  Larger restaurants are common at [[truck stop]]s and [[toll road]] [[service plaza]]s.

In some U.S. states, beer, wine, and liquor are sold in gas stations, though this practice varies according to state law (''see [[Alcohol laws of the United States by state]]''). [[Nevada]] also allows the operation of [[slot machines|slot]] and [[video poker]] machines without time restrictions.

[[Vacuum cleaner]]s, often coin-operated, are a common amenity to allow the cleaning of vehicle interiors, either by the customer or by an attendant.

Some stations are equipped with [[car wash]]es. Car washes are sometimes offered free of charge or at a discounted price with a certain amount of gas purchased. Conversely, some car washes operate filling stations to supplement their businesses.

From approximately 1920 to 1980, many service stations in the US provided free [[road maps]] affiliated with their parent oil companies to customers.  This practice fell out of favor due to the [[1970s energy crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/automobiles/collectibles/12MAPS.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Phil | last=Patton | title=When Maps Reflected Romance of the Road | date=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roadmaps.org/map-information/maps-by-the-decade/ |title=Maps by the Decade |accessdate=2013-01-02 |work=Road Map Collectors Association |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102031504/http://roadmaps.org/map-information/maps-by-the-decade/ |archivedate=2013-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel prices==

===Europe===
[[File:Preismast AVIA Walldorf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Price indicator display, in €/L, with implicit decimal]]
[[File:Morrisons filling station, Wetherby (1st February 2013) 003.JPG|thumb|right|Many supermarkets in Europe have branched into petrol retailing, as shown by this [[Morrisons]] filling station in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]], England]]
In [[European Union]] member states, petrol prices are much higher than in North America due to higher [[fuel excise]] or [[taxation]], although the base price is also higher than in the U.S. Occasionally, price rises trigger national protests. In the UK, a large-scale protest in August and September 2000, known as '[[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|The Fuel Crisis]]', caused widescale havoc not only across the UK, but also in some other EU countries. The [[First Blair ministry|UK Government]] eventually backed down by indefinitely postponing a planned increase in fuel duty. This was partially reversed during December 2006 when then-[[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] raised fuel duty by 1.25 pence per litre.

Since 2007, petrol prices in the UK rose by nearly 40 pence per litre, going from 97.3 pence per litre in 2007 to 136.8 pence per litre in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsandgarages.co.uk/news/31-Petrol-sales-fall-as-prices-soar|title=Cars and Garages: Diagnose Problems, Estimate Costs &amp; Find Garages|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611202631/http://www.carsandgarages.co.uk/news/31-Petrol-sales-fall-as-prices-soar|archivedate=11 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of Europe, including the UK, France and Germany, filling stations operated by large supermarket chains usually price fuel lower than stand-alone filling stations. In most of mainland Europe, sales tax is lower on diesel fuel than on petrol, and diesel is accordingly the cheaper fuel: in the UK and Switzerland, diesel has no tax advantage and retails at a higher price by quantity than petrol (offset by its higher energy yield).

In 2014, according to Eurostat, the mean EU28 price was 1.38 €/L for euro-super 95 (gazoline), 1.26 €/L for gazole (for diesel car)&lt;ref name="Consumer_prices" /&gt;.

===North America===
[[File:Gas-pump-Indiana-USA.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pay at the pump|Pay-at-the-pump]] gasoline pump]]
Nearly all filling stations in North America advertise their prices on large signs outside the stations.  Some locations have laws requiring such signage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Shortage at the Pump: Not of Gas, but of 4s | first = Ken | last = Belson | work = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/nyregion/15four.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin | date = 2008-07-15 | accessdate = 2008-07-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417103014/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/nyregion/15four.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin | archivedate = 2009-04-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada and the United States, federal, state or provincial, and local sales taxes are usually included in the price, although tax details are often posted at the pump and some stations may provide details on sales receipts. Gas taxes are often [[Ring Fenced|ring-fenced]] (dedicated) to fund transportation projects such as the maintenance of existing roads and the construction of new ones.

In the United States, the states of [[California]] and [[Hawaii]] typically have the highest gasoline prices, while the lowest prices are usually found in oil-producing states like [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. In Canada, prices are typically highest in the provinces of [[British Columbia]] and [[Quebec]], and the lowest in the oil-producing province of [[Alberta]]. The provinces of [[Prince Edward Island]] (PEI), [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]] have instituted gasoline price regulation, which is intended to protect small rural gas stations from low profits due to low sales volume.

Individual gas stations in the United States have little if any control over gasoline prices.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The wholesale price of gasoline is determined according to area by oil companies which supply the gasoline, and their prices are largely determined by the world markets for oil. Individual gas stations are unlikely to sell gasoline at a loss, and the profit margin—typically between 7 and 11 cents a U.S.&amp;nbsp;gallon—that they make from gasoline sales is limited by competitive pressures: a gas station which charges more than others will lose customers to them.  Most gas stations try to compensate by selling higher-margin food products in their [[convenience stores]].

Even with oil market fluctuations, prices for gasoline in the United States are among the lowest in the industrialized world; this is principally due to lower taxes. While the sales price of gasoline in Europe is more than twice that in the United States, the price of gas excluding taxes is nearly identical in the two areas. Some Canadians and Mexicans in communities close to the U.S. border drive into the United States to purchase cheaper gasoline.

Due to heavy fluctuations of gasoline price in the United States, some gas stations offer their customers the option to buy and store gas for future uses, such as the service provided by First Fuel Bank.

In order to save money, some consumers in Canada and the United States inform each other about low and high prices through the use of [[gasoline price website]]s. Such websites allow users to share prices advertised at filling stations with each other by posting them to a central server. Consumers then may check the prices listed in their geographic area in order to select the station with the lowest price available at the time. Some television and radio stations also compile pricing information via viewer and listener reports of pricing or reporter observations and present it as a regular segment of their newscasts, usually before or after traffic reports. These price observations must usually be made by reading the pricing signs outside stations, as many companies do not give their prices by telephone due to competitive concerns. In Canada, it is against federal law to provide any gas pricing from a gas station via phone. It is a criminal offence to have written or verbal arrangements with competitors, suppliers or customers for:

* fixing prices and exchanging information on prices or cost (including discounts and rebates),
* limiting or restraining competition unduly,
* engaging in misleading or deceptive practices.

Gas stations must never hold discussions with other competitors regarding pricing policies and methods, terms of sale, costs, allocation of markets or boycotts of our petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/home|title=Home|author=Competition Bureau Canada|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609000744/http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/home|archivedate=9 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of the world===
[[File:GasStationHiroshima.jpg|thumb|right|Like many gasoline stands in Japan, this [[Showa Shell Sekiyu|Shell]] filling station has hoses that hang from above.]]
In other energy-importing countries such as Japan, gasoline and petroleum product prices are higher than in the United States because of fuel transportation costs and taxes.

On the other hand, some of the major oil-producing countries such as the Gulf States, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela provide subsidized fuel at well-below world market prices. This practice tends to encourage heavy consumption.

Hong Kong has some of the highest pump prices in the world, but most customers are given discounts as card members.

In [[Western Australia]] a programme called [[Gas/petrol price website|Fuelwatch]] requires most WA filling stations to notify their "tomorrow prices" by 2{{nbsp}}pm each day; prices are changed at 6{{nbsp}}am each morning, and must be held for 24 hours. Each afternoon, the prices for the next day are released to the public and the media, allowing consumers to decide when to fill up.

==Service stations==
A service station or "servo" is the terminology predominantly used in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, a "servo" is commonly used to describe any facility where motorists can refuel their cars.

In New Zealand a filling station is often referred to as a service station, garage, or petrol station, even though the filling station may not offer mechanical repairs or assistance with dispensing fuel. Levels of service available include full service, for which assistance in dispensing fuel is offered, as well as offers to check tyre pressure or clean vehicle windscreens. This type of service is becoming uncommon in New Zealand, particularly Auckland. Further south of Auckland, many filling stations offer full service. There is also help service or assisted service, for which customers must request assistance before it is given, and self-service, for which no assistance is available.

[[File:ServiceStation.jpeg|thumb|right|U.S. service station (1950s)]]

In the U.S., a filling station that also offers services such as oil changes and mechanical repairs to automobiles is called a '''service station'''. Until the 1970s the vast majority of gas stations were service stations; now only a minority are. These stations typically offered free air for inflating tires, as compressed air was already on hand to operate the repair garage's pneumatic tools.

This kind of business provided the name for the U.S. comic strip ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'', where a number of the characters worked.

* [[List of filling stations in North America]]

In the UK, a 'service station' refers to much larger facilities, usually attached to motorways (see [[rest area]]) or major truck routes, which provide food outlets, large parking areas, and often other services such as hotels, arcade games, and shops in addition to 24-hour fuel supplies and a higher standard of restrooms. Fuel is typically more expensive from these outlets due to their premium locations. UK service stations do not usually repair automobiles.

==Highway service centre==
This arrangement occurs on many [[toll road]]s and some interstate freeways and is called an [[highway oasis|oasis]] or service plaza.  In many cases, these centres might have a food court or restaurants. In the United Kingdom these are called [[Motorway service area]]s.

Often, the state government maintains public [[rest area]]s directly connected to freeways, but does not rent out space to private businesses, as this is specifically prohibited by law via the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate Highway Act of 1956]] which created the national [[Interstate Highway System]], except sites on freeways built before January 1, 1960, and toll highways that are self-supporting but have Interstate designation, under a [[grandfather clause]].  As a result, such areas often provide only minimal services such as restrooms and vending machines.

Private entrepreneurs develop additional facilities, such as [[truck stop]]s or travel centers, restaurants, gas stations, and motels in clusters on private land adjacent to major interchanges.  In the U.S., [[Pilot Flying J]] and [[TravelCenters of America]] are two of the most common full-service chains of truck stops. Because these facilities are not directly connected to the freeway, they usually have huge signs on poles high enough to be visible by motorists in time to exit from the freeway. Sometimes, the state also posts small official signs (normally blue) indicating what types of gas stations, restaurants, and hotels are available at an upcoming exit; businesses may add their logos to these signs for a fee.

In [[Canada]] , the province of [[Ontario]] has stops along two of its 400-series highways, the 401 and the 400, traditionally referred to as "Service Centres" , but recently renamed "[[ONroute]]" as part of a full rebuild of the sites. Owned by the provincial government, but leased to private operator Host Kilmer Service Centres, they contain food courts, convenience stores, washrooms, and co-located gas and diesel bars with attached convenience stores. Food providers include [[Tim Hortons]] (at all sites), [[A&amp;W (Canada)|A&amp;W]], [[Wendy's]] and [[Pizza Pizza]]. At most sites fuel is sold by [[Canadian Tire]], with a few older [[Esso]] gas bars at earlier renovated locations.

==Octane==
{{Main|Octane rating}}
[[File:Florida Department of Agriculture Petroleum Inspection.jpg|thumb|right|A state petroleum inspector visiting a [[Mobil]] station in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]]]]
In Australia, gasoline is unleaded, and available in 91 (normally with up to 10% [[ethanol]]), 95, 98 and 100 [[octane]] (names of various petrols differ from brand to brand). Fuel additives for use in cars designed for leaded fuel are available at most filling stations.

In Canada, the most commonly found octane grades are 87 (regular), 89 (mid grade) and 91 (premium), using the same "(R+M)/2 Method" used in the U.S. (see below).

In China, the most commonly found octane grade is RON 91 (regular), 93 (mid grade) and 97 (premium).  Almost all of the fuel has been unleaded since 2000.  In some premium gas stations in large cities, such as Petrol China and SinoPec, RON 98 gas is sold for racing cars.

In Europe, gasoline is unleaded and available in 95 RON (''Eurosuper'') and, in nearly all countries, 98 RON (''Super Plus'') octanes; in some countries 91 RON octane gasoline is offered as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In addition, 100 RON petrol is offered in some countries in continental Europe (Shell markets this as ''[[V-Power]] Racing''). Some stations offer 98 RON with lead substitute (often called "Lead-Replacement Petrol, or LRP).

In New Zealand, gasoline is unleaded, and most commonly available in 91 RON ("Regular") and 95 RON ("Premium"). 98 RON is available at selected BP ("Ultimate") and Mobil ("Synergy 8000") service stations instead of the standard 95 RON. 96 RON was replaced by 95 RON, and subsequently abolished in 2006. Leaded fuel was abolished in 1996.

In the UK the most common gasoline grade (and lowest octane generally available) is 'Premium' 95 RON unleaded. 'Super' is widely available at 97 RON (for example ''[[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] [[V-Power]]'', ''[[BP]] Ultimate''). Leaded fuel is no longer available.
&lt;!-- add more octanes from other states, provinces, or countries --&gt;

In the United States all motor vehicle gasoline is [[tetraethyllead|unleaded]] and is available in several grades with different [[octane rating]]; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. The maximum octane rating in California is generally 91. At high altitudes in the [[Mountain States]] and the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]], regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice is now increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic engine controls standard in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/05/29/bad-gasoline-low-octane-too-much-ethanol/2369579/ |title=Vacationers, beware: Bad gas can damage your car |first=Mark |last=Phelan |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=September 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120013630/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/05/29/bad-gasoline-low-octane-too-much-ethanol/2369579/ |archivedate=November 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. gasoline is described in terms of its "pump octane", which is the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] of their "RON" (Research Octane Number) and "MON" (Motor Octane Number). Labels on gasoline pumps in the U.S. typically describe this as the "(R+M)/2 Method". Some nations describe fuels according to the traditional RON or MON ratings, so octane ratings cannot always be compared with the equivalent U.S. rating by the "(R+M)/2 method".

==Differences in fuel dispensers==
[[File:Asda self service petrol station, Middleton, Leeds (3rd May 2015).JPG|thumb|right|An unstaffed [[Asda]] self-service filling station where payment is made at the pump by credit or debit card. This one is in [[Middleton, Leeds]], England]]
{{Main|Fuel dispenser}}
In Europe and Australia, the customer selects one of several color-coded nozzles depending on the type of fuel required. The filler pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a [[catalytic converter]]. 
In most stations in Canada and the USA, the pump has a single nozzle and the customer selects the desired octane grade by pushing a button. Some pumps require the customer to pick up the nozzle first, then lift a lever underneath it; others are designed so that lifting the nozzle automatically releases a switch.  Some newer stations have separate nozzles for different types of fuel.  Where diesel fuel is provided, it is usually dispensed from a separate nozzle even if the various grades of gasoline share the same nozzle.

Motorists occasionally pump gasoline into a diesel car by accident.  The converse is almost impossible because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of {{convert|15/16|in|1}} which does not fit the {{convert|13/16|in|1|adj=on}} filler, and the nozzles are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to "thin" diesel fuel in winter.

It is prohibited to use open flames and, in some places, mobile phones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/3986509.stm|title=Mobile phones as fire risks|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2004-11-05|author=Spencer Kelly|work=[[Click (TV series)]]|accessdate=2010-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208222647/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/3986509.stm|archivedate=2009-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the forecourt of a filling station because of the risk of igniting gasoline [[vapor]]. In the U.S. the fire marshal is responsible for regulations at the gas pump. Most localities ban smoking, open flames and running engines. Since the increased occurrence of static-related fires many stations have warnings about leaving the refueling point.

Cars can build up [[static charge]] by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire compounds contain enough [[carbon black]] to provide an [[electrical ground]] which prevents charge build-up. Newer "high mileage" tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put into contact with the metallic filler neck of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b88DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "CarCare – Auto Clinic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215051554/https://books.google.com/books?id=b88DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=true |date=2017-02-15 }} ''Popular Mechanics'', April 2003, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the [[ullage]] (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The [[Petroleum Equipment Institute]] has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pei.org/static/ Petroleum Equipment Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719173853/http://www.pei.org/static/ |date=2008-07-19 }} Retrieved 2014-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[urban legend]]s persist that a mobile phone can cause sparks, this has not been duplicated under any controlled condition. Nevertheless, mobile phone manufacturers and gas stations ask users to switch off their phones. One suggested origin of this myth is said to have been started by gas station companies because the cell phone signal would interfere with the fuel counter on some older model fuel pumps causing it to give a lower reading. In the [[MythBusters]] episode "[[MythBusters (2003 season)#Episode 2 .E2.80.93 .22Cell Phone Destruction.2C Silicone Breasts.2C CD-ROM Shattering.22|Cell Phone Destruction]]", investigators concluded that explosions attributed to cell phones could be caused by static discharges from clothing instead and also observed that such incidents seem to involve women more often than men.

The U.S. [[National Fire Protection Association]] does most of the research and code writing to address the potential for explosions of gasoline vapor. The customer fueling area, up to {{convert|18|in|cm}} above the surface, normally does not have explosive concentrations of vapors, but may from time to time. Above this height, where most fuel filler necks are located, there is no expectation of an explosive concentration of gasoline vapor in normal operating conditions. [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|Electrical equipment]] in the fueling area may be specially certified for use around gasoline vapors.

'''Flame rectification''' is a phenomenon in which a [[flame]] can act as an electrical [[rectifier]]. The effect is commonly described as being caused by the greater mobility of [[electron]]s relative to that of positive [[ion]]s within the flame,&lt;ref name="isbn9780419148005"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 9780419148005 | title = The Application of Combustion Principles to Domestic Gas Burner Design | last1 = Jones | first1 = H.

This effect is used by '''rectification flame sensors''' to detect the presence of flame.&lt;ref name=isbn9780419148005/&gt; The rectifying effect of the flame on an AC voltage allows the presence of flame to be distinguished from a resistive leakage path.

One experimental study has suggested that the effect is caused by the ionization process occurring mostly at the base of the flame, making it more difficult for the electrode further from the base of the flame to attract positive ions from the burner,&lt;ref name=Mollberg20787&gt;{{citation|author=Möllberg, Andreas | title=Investigation of the principle of flame rectification in order to improve detection of the propane flame in absorption refrigerators|publisher=Linköping University, Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology|date=2005|page=41|url= http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:20787}}&lt;/ref&gt;  yet leaving the electron current largely unchanged with distance because of the greater mobility of the electron charge carriers.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}

A '''gyppo logger''' (sometimes spelled "gypo logger") is a [[Lumberjack|logger]] who runs or works for a small scale [[logging]] operation that is independent from an established [[sawmill]] or lumber company. The gyppo system is one of two main patterns of the organization of logging labor in the [[Pacific Northwest]], the other being the "company logger." Gyppo loggers were originally condemned by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) as [[strikebreaker]]s.

After the founding of a government-sponsored [[company union]], the [[Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen]], weakened the influence of the IWW on the logging industry, gyppos were seen as a component of the timber business in a less ideologically charged context.

==Etymology and context==
[[File:Gyppo logging crew.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Crew of gyppo logging outfit, Tillamook County, Oregon, October 1941]]
The term is specific to the Northwest. Its [[etymology]] is certainly unrecoverable at this date. According to E.B. Mittelman it "may be a derivation from the Greek word, signifying vulture,&lt;ref&gt;γύπας (gypas)&lt;/ref&gt; or may simply be a derivation or corruption of the word gypsy." In either case, notes Mittelman, "it has something of the cunning or predacious in it."&lt;ref name=mittelman&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=31|number=6|date=December 1923|title=The Gyppo System|author=E.B. Mittleman|pages=840–851|jstor=1822448|doi=10.1086/253566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek etymology is lent some plausibility by the fact that big lumber companies tried to use Greek workers, who wouldn't cooperate, to break a strike organized by the IWW in [[Everett, Washington]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=[[Industrial Worker]]|title=Lumber Strike Still Spreading|date=July 28, 1917|page=1|url=http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/laborpress/images/industrial_worker/1200w/Lumber%20Strike--July%2028,%201917--p.1.1200w.jpg|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "gyppo" was commonly prepended to form nicknames among loggers, e.g. "Gyppo Jake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=California Folklore Quarterly|volume=4|number=3|date=July 1945|title=Idaho Lumberjack Nicknames|author=Henry S. Kernan|pages=239–243|jstor=1495817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was introduced by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) to disparage&lt;ref name=oregon&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Speech|volume=25|number=2|date=May 1950|title=Oregon Speechways|author=Randall V. Mills|pages=81–90|jstor=453898|doi=10.2307/453898}}&lt;/ref&gt; strikebreakers and other loggers who thwarted their organizing efforts.&lt;ref name=mittelman/&gt;  The IWW currently uses the term to refer to "Any piece-work system; a job where the worker is paid by the volume they produce, rather than by their time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary|publisher=Industrial Workers of the World|title=IWW Union Dictionary|accessdate=August 29, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IYWAFaL?url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary|archivedate=October 9, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mittelman quotes an editorial from the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'' on the subject:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At present the master class of capitalists call it 'contract labor,' 'piece work,' and other fancy names...For us, the proletarians, it is 'gyppoing' and it means all that the name connotes.  The gyppo is a man who 'gyps' his fellow workers and finally himself, out of the fruits of all our organized victories in the class war."&lt;ref name=mittelman/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term lost most of its derisive connotation after the decline of the IWW's influence in the lumber industry.&lt;ref name="HughesBeckwith2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John C. Hughes|author2=Ryan Teague Beckwith|title=On the Harbor: From Black Friday to Nirvana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbg1nGp9UrIC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=30 September 2005|publisher=Stephens Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-932173-50-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gyppo system==
[[File:Tillamook gyppo logging.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loading logs onto truck for transportation to mill. Gyppo logging operations, Tillamook County, Oregon, October 1941]]
The term "gyppo logger" is opposed to the "company logger," who is employed by a lumber company or lumber mill at an hourly or daily wage and generally belongs to a union.  Gyppos, on the other hand, work for themselves, run economically marginal operations,&lt;ref name=ostrom&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=47|number=2|date=June 1953|title=State Administration of Natural Resources in the West|author=Vincent Ostrom|pages=478–493|jstor=1952034|doi=10.2307/1952034}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and employ a small crew on a fixed-price basis,&lt;ref name=effects&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=50|number=1|date=January 1977|pages=31–38|title=Some Effects of Social and Economic Changes on Gyppo Loggers|author=David H. Williamson|jstor=3317385|doi=10.2307/3317385}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they occasionally work for mills on a flat rate, contract,&lt;ref name=taming&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=10|number=2|date=April 1945|title=Taming the Lumberjack|author=Norman S. Hayner|pages=217–225|jstor=2085640|doi=10.2307/2085640}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[piecework]] basis.&lt;ref name=mittelman/&gt;

The IWW introduced the term "gyppo" during the unsuccessful 1917-8 Pacific Northwest strike for the [[eight-hour day]] for loggers, although undoubtedly gyppo loggers existed before 1917.  Because the strike was unsuccessful, after the loggers returned to work they called a [[slowdown]].  This tactic was so effective that in response the company owners instituted piecework or flat-rate pay scales.  The pine timber in the Pacific Northwest is comparatively small and a lot of it is on government land (disallowing the use of railways to transport logs). Thus the conditions facilitate logging with small crews and portable machinery.&lt;ref name=mittelman/&gt;

Technological developments after [[World War II]] made gyppo logging even more economically rewarding, especially the invention of gasoline powered [[chainsaws]] which were light enough to be used by a single person and the use of [[diesel engines]] to power "[[Steam donkey|donkeys]]" that had previously been powered by steam.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Western Historical Quarterly|volume=16|number=4|date=October 1985|title=The Social Context of Forestry: The Pacific Northwest in the Twentieth Century|author=William G. Robbins|pages=413–427|jstor=968606|doi=10.2307/968606}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These later gyppos also took advantage of the increased affordability of light industrial equipment, such as trucks and [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar tractors]] and typically employed family labor in order to keep their operations economically viable.&lt;ref name=lady&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lady loggers and gyppo wives: women and Northwest logging|author=Robert E. Walls|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=103|number=3|page=362ff|date=Fall 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Robbins, writing on the postwar timber boom in the [[Coos Bay]] region of [[Oregon]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The immediate postwar years in southwestern Oregon were the heyday of the storied gyppo logging and sawmill operator&amp;mdash;the hardy individual who worked on marginal capital, usually through subcontracts with a major company or broker, and whose equipment was invariably pieced together with baling wire.&lt;ref name=social/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the mid-1950s, overextraction of timber had begun to reduce the economic value of gyppo logging.&lt;ref name=social/&gt;  By the 1970s environmental regulation and other economic changes in the logging industry had driven many gyppo loggers out of business.&lt;ref name=effects/&gt; By the early 21st century gyppo loggers had been described as "an endangered species."&lt;ref name="Vaillant2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Vaillant|title=The Golden Spruce: A True Story of Myth, Madness and Greed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNyhLe1igkkC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=3 January 2006|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-676-97646-5|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical output [[Power (physics)|power]]s range from tens of [[kilowatt]]s to 1–2 [[megawatt]]s. Gyrotrons can be designed for pulsed or continuous operation.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Gyrotron plateforme.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|High-power 84–118 GHz gyrotron tubes for plasma heating in the [[Tokamak à configuration variable|TCV]] [[tokamak]] fusion reactor, Switzerland. The colored cylinders are the tops of the gyrotron tubes.]]
[[Image:Gyrotron.png|thumb|Diagram of a gyrotron]]

The gyrotron is a type of free-electron [[maser]] which generates high-frequency electromagnetic radiation by stimulated [[cyclotron resonance]] of electrons moving through a strong magnetic field.&lt;ref name="bridge12"&gt;{{cite web

This is unlike conventional microwave [[vacuum tube]]s such as [[klystron]]s and [[magnetron]]s, in which the wavelength is determined by a single-mode [[resonant cavity]], a ''slow-wave'' structure, and thus as operating frequencies increase, the resonant cavity structures must decrease in size, which limits their power-handling capability.

In the gyrotron a hot [[electrical filament|filament]] in an [[electron gun]] at one end of the tube emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of [[electron]]s, which is accelerated by a high-voltage [[anode]] and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial [[magnetic field]], usually created by a [[superconducting magnet]] around the tube.  The field causes the electrons to move [[helix|helically]] in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube.  At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their [[cyclotron resonance]] frequency.  The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended [[resonant cavity]], and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a [[waveguide]].  The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of the tube.

As in other linear-beam microwave tubes, the energy of the output electromagnetic waves comes from the [[kinetic energy]] of the electron beam, which is due to the accelerating anode voltage.  In the region before the resonant cavity where the magnetic field strength is increasing, it compresses the electron beam, converting the longitudinal drift velocity to transverse orbital velocity, in a process similar to that occurring in a [[magnetic mirror]] used in [[plasma confinement]].&lt;ref name="Borie" /&gt;  The orbital velocity of the electrons is 1.5 to 2 times their axial beam velocity.   Due to the standing waves in the resonant cavity, the electrons become "bunched"; that is, their phase becomes [[coherent radiation|coherent]] (synchronized) so they are all at the same point in their orbit at the same time.  Therefore, they emit [[coherent radiation]]. 
  
The electron speed in a gyrotron is slightly relativistic (comparable to but not close to the speed of light). This contrasts to the [[free-electron laser]] (and [[xaser]]) that work on different principles and whose electrons are highly relativistic.

==Applications==
Gyrotrons are used for many industrial and high-technology heating applications. For example, gyrotrons are used in [[nuclear fusion]] research experiments to heat [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and also in manufacturing industry as a rapid heating tool in processing glass, composites, and ceramics, as well as for annealing (solar and semiconductors). Military applications include the [[Active Denial System]].

==Types==
The output window of the tube from which the microwave beam emerges can be in two locations
*'''Transverse-output gyrotron''': The beam exits by a window in the side of the tube.  This requires a 45° mirror at the end of the cavity to reflect the microwave beam, positioned at one side so the electron beam misses it.  This type is shown in the diagram above.
*'''Axial-output gyrotron''': The beam exits by a window in the end of the tube, at the far end of the cylindrical collector electrode which collects the electrons. 

The original gyrotron described above, developed in 1964, was an oscillator, but since that time gyrotron [[amplifier]]s have been developed.  The helical gyrotron electron beam can amplify an applied microwave signal similarly to the way a straight electron beam amplifies in  classical microwave tubes such as the klystron, so there are a series of gyrotrons which function analogously to these tubes.  Their advantage is that they can operate at much higher frequencies: 
*'''Gyro-monotron''' or '''Gyro-oscillator''': Single-cavity gyrotron described above functions as an oscillator
*'''Gyro-klystron''': Amplifier that functions analogously to a [[klystron]] tube.  Has two [[microwave cavity|microwave cavities]] along the electron beam, an input cavity upstream to which the signal to be amplified is applied and an output cavity downstream from which the output is taken.
*'''Gyro-TWT''': Amplifier that functions analogously to a [[travelling wave tube]] (TWT).  Has a slow wave structure similar to a TWT paralleling the beam, with the input microwave signal applied to the upstream end and the amplified output signal taken from the downstream end.
*'''Gyro-BWO''': Oscillator that functions analogously to a [[backward wave oscillator]] (BWO). Generates oscillations traveling in an opposite direction to the electron beam, which are output at the upstream end of the tube.
*'''Gyro-twystron''': Amplifier that functions analogouly to a [[twystron]], a tube that combines a klystron and a TWT.  Like a klystron it has an input cavity at the upstream end followed by buncher cavities to bunch the electrons, which are followed by a TWT type slow-wave structure which develops the amplified output signal.  Like a TWT it can have a wide bandwidth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">The '''Hayes similitude principle''' enabled aerodynamicists to take the results of one series of tests or calculations and apply them to the design of an entire family of similar configurations where neither tests nor detailed calculations are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schultz|first1=Steven|title=Wallace Hayes, Pioneer of Supersonic Flight, Dies|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/01/q1/0308-hayes.htm|website=http://www.princeton.edu|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similitude principle was developed by [[Wallace D. Hayes]], a pioneer in [[hypersonic flow]], which is considered to begin at about five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5, and is described in his classic book [https://www.amazon.com/Hypersonic-Inviscid-Dover-Books-Physics/dp/0486432815 Hypersonic Flow Theory] co-written with [[Ronald Probstein]] and first published in 1959.

The behavior of the physical processes in actual problems is affected by so many physical quantities that a complete mathematical description thereof is usually very difficult and sometimes practically impossible due to the complicated nature of the phenomena. We know from experience that if two systems are geometrically similar there usually exists some kind of similarity under certain conditions, such as kinematic similarity, dynamic similarity, thermal similarity, and similarity  of concentration distribution, and that if similarity conditions are satisfied we can greatly reduce the number of independent variables required to describe the behavior of the process. In this way, we can systematically understand. describe, and even predict the behavior of physical processes in real problems in a relatively simple manner. This principle is known as principle of similitude. Dimensional analysis is a method of deducing logical groupings of the variables, through which we can describe similarity criteria of the processes.

Physical quantities such as length [L], mass [M], time [T],  and temperature are dimensional quantities and the magnitude of each quantity can be described by multiples of the unit of each dimension namely m, kg, s, and K, respectively. Through experience, we can select a certain number of fundamental dimensions, such as those mentioned above, and express all other dimensional quantities in terms of products of powers of these fundamental dimensions. Furthermore, in describing the behavior of physical processes, we know that there is an implicit principle that we cannot add or subtract physical quantities of different dimensions. This means that the equations governing physical processes must be dimensionally consistent and each term of the equation must have the same dimensions. This principle is known as the principle of dimensional homogeneity.

'''Huating Lake''' ({{zh|c=花亭湖|p=Huātíng Hú}}), also known as the Hualiangting Reservoir (花凉亭水库 ''Huāliángtíng Shuĭkù''), is a large scale reservoir in [[Taihu County]], Anqing City, [[Anhui]] Province, People's Republic of China, used for the purposes of flood control, [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric powe]]r generation, agricultural irrigation, transport and tourism. The lake is a National Scenic Area, National 4A Tourist Attraction and demonstration site for agro-tourism.

Damming of the lake to create a reservoir began in 1958 and continued until 1962. There was then an eight-year hiatus until 1970 when construction resumed. Fundamental infrastructure was in place by 1976 and the project completed in 2001.&lt;ref name="AWCB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ahsl.gov.cn/websites/style1/slnj_view.php?id=2153|title= Anqing City's Huating Lake Hydro-electric Power Station (安庆市花凉亭水电站)|language=Chinese|publisher=Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2009, a 2.1 billion [[Renminbi|RMB]], 23 month reinforcement program began at the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anqing.gov.cn/a/zhengwu/dongtai/jingji/2010/0701/18333.html|title=Hualiangting Reservoir Reinforcement Project (花凉亭水库除险加固工程开工建设)|language=Chinese|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate=March 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227052057/http://anqing.gov.cn/a/zhengwu/dongtai/jingji/2010/0701/18333.html|archivedate=December 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reservoir provides irrigation for [[Susong County]], [[Wangjiang County]], [[Huaining County]] and the eastern part of Taihu County, a total area of some 1.05 million Chinese acres.&lt;ref name="AWCB" /&gt;

Commonly one of these compounds is [[inorganic]] and the other one [[Organic compound|organic]] in nature. Thus, they differ from traditional composites where the constituents are at the macroscopic ([[micrometer]] to [[millimeter]]) level. Mixing at the microscopic scale leads to a more homogeneous material that either show characteristics in between the two original [[Phase (matter)|phases]] or even new properties.

==Introduction==

===Hybrid materials in nature===

Many natural materials consist of inorganic and organic building blocks distributed on the nanoscale. In most cases the inorganic part provides mechanical strength and an overall structure to the natural objects while the organic part delivers bonding between the inorganic building blocks and/or the soft tissue. Typical examples of such materials are [[bone]], or [[nacre]].

===Development of hybrid materials===

The first hybrid materials were the paints made from inorganic and organic components that were used thousands of years ago. [[Rubber]] is an example of the use of inorganic materials as fillers for organic [[polymers]]. The [[Sol-gel|sol–gel process]] developed in the 1930s was one of the major driving forces what has become the broad field of inorganic–organic hybrid materials.

===Classification===

Hybrid materials can be classified based on the possible interactions connecting the inorganic and organic species. ''Class I'' hybrid materials are those that show weak interactions between the two phases, such as [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]], [[hydrogen bonding]] or weak [[electrostatic]] interactions. ''Class II'' hybrid materials are those that show strong chemical interactions between the components such as [[covalent bonds]].

Structural properties can also be used to distinguish between various hybrid materials. An organic [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] containing a functional group that allows the attachment to an inorganic network, e.g. a trialkoxysilane group, can act as a ''network modifier'' because in the final structure the inorganic network is only modified by the organic group. Phenyltrialkoxysilanes are an example for such compounds; they modify the silica network in the sol–gel process via the reaction of the trialkoxysilane group without supplying additional functional groups intended to undergo further chemical reactions to the material formed. If a reactive functional group is incorporated the system is called a ''network functionalizer''. The situation is different if two or three of such anchor groups modify an organic segment; this leads to materials in which the inorganic group is afterwards an integral part of the hybrid network. The latter type of system is known as ''network builder''

Blends are formed if no strong chemical interactions exist between the inorganic and organic building blocks. One example for such a material is the combination of inorganic clusters or particles with organic polymers lacking a strong (e.g. covalent) interaction between the components. In this case a material is formed that consists for example of an organic polymer with entrapped discrete inorganic moieties in which, depending on the functionalities of the components, for example weak crosslinking occurs by the entrapped inorganic units through physical interactions or the inorganic components are entrapped in a crosslinked polymer matrix. If an inorganic and an organic network interpenetrate each other without strong chemical interactions, so called interpenetrating networks (IPNs) are formed, which is for example the case if a sol–gel material is formed in presence of an organic polymer or vice versa. Both materials described belong to class I hybrids. Class II hybrids are formed when the discrete inorganic building blocks, e.g. clusters, are covalently bonded to the organic polymers or inorganic and organic polymers are covalently connected with each other.

===Distinction between nanocomposites and hybrid materials===

The term [[nanocomposite]] is used if the combination of organic and inorganic structural units yield a material with composite properties. That is to say that the original properties of the separate organic and inorganic components are still present in the composite and are unchanged by mixing these materials. However, if a new property emerges from the intimate mixture, then the material becomes a hybrid. A macroscopic example is the mule, which is more suited for hard work than either of its parents, the horse and the donkey. The size of the individual components and the nature of their interaction (covalent, electrostatic, etc.) do not enter into the definition of a hybrid material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=G. L. Drisko, C. Sanchez, Hybridization in Materials Science – Evolution, Current State, and Future Aspirations, Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 5097–5105.|journal=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264763118_Hybridization_in_Materials_Science_-_Evolution_Current_State_and_Future_Aspirations|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of hybrid materials over traditional composites==

* Inorganic clusters or nanoparticles with specific optical, electronic or magnetic properties can be incorporated in organic polymer matrices.
* Contrary to pure solid state inorganic materials that often require a high temperature treatment for their processing, hybrid materials show a more polymer-like handling, either because of their large organic content or because of the formation of crosslinked inorganic networks from small molecular precursors just like in polymerization reactions.
* Light scattering in homogeneous hybrid material can be avoided and therefore optical transparency of the resulting hybrid materials and nanocomposites can be achieved.

==Synthesis==

Two different approaches can be used for the formation of hybrid materials: Either well-defined preformed building blocks are applied that react with each other to form the final hybrid material in which the precursors still at least partially keep their original integrity or one or both structural units are formed from the precursors that are transformed into a new (network) structure. It is important that the interface between the inorganic and
organic materials which has to be tailored to overcome serious problems in the preparation of hybrid materials. Different building blocks and approaches can be used for their preparation and these have to be adapted to bridge the differences of inorganic and organic materials.

===Building block approach===

Building blocks at least partially keep their molecular integrity throughout the material formation, which means that structural units that are present in these sources for materials formation can also be found in the final material. At the same time typical properties of these building blocks usually survive the matrix formation, which is not the case if material precursors are transferred into novel materials. Representative examples of such well-defined building blocks are modified inorganic clusters or nanoparticles with attached reactive organic groups.

Cluster compounds often consist of at least one functional group that allows an interaction with an organic matrix, for example by copolymerization. Depending on the number of groups that can interact, these building blocks are able to modify an organic matrix (one functional group) or form partially or fully crosslinked materials (more than one group). For instance, two reactive groups can lead to the formation of chain structures. If the building blocks contain at least three reactive groups they can be used without additional molecules for the formation of a crosslinked material.

Beside the molecular building blocks mentioned, nanosized building blocks, such as particles or nanorods, can also be used to form nanocomposites. The building block approach has one large advantage compared with the in situ formation of the inorganic or organic entities: because at least one structural unit (the building block) is well-defined and usually does not undergo significant structural changes during the matrix formation, better structure–property predictions are possible. Furthermore, the building blocks can be designed in such a way to give the best performance in the materials’ formation, for example good solubility of inorganic compounds in organic monomers by surface groups showing a similar polarity as the monomers.

In recent years many building blocks have been synthesized and used for the preparation of hybrid materials. Chemists can design these compounds on a
molecular scale with highly sophisticated methods and the resulting systems are used for the formation of functional hybrid materials. Many future applications, in particular in nanotechnology, focus on a bottom-up approach in which complex structures are hierarchically formed by these small building blocks. This idea is also one of the driving forces of the building block approach in hybrid materials.

===In situ formation of the components===

The in situ formation of the hybrid materials is based on the chemical transformation of the precursors used throughout materials’ preparation. Typically this is the case if organic polymers are formed but also if the sol–gel process is applied to produce the inorganic component. In these cases well-defined discrete molecules are transformed to multidimensional structures, which often show totally different properties from the original precursors. Generally simple, commercially available molecules are applied and the internal structure of the final material is determined by the composition of these precursors but also by the reaction conditions. Therefore, control over the latter is a crucial step in this process. Changing one parameter can often lead to two very different materials. If, for example, the inorganic species is a silica derivative formed by the sol–gel process, the change from base to acid catalysis makes a large difference because base catalysis leads to a more particle-like microstructure while acid catalysis leads to a polymer-like microstructure. Hence, the final performance of the derived materials is strongly dependent on their processing and its optimization.

====In situ formation of inorganic materials====

Many of the classical inorganic solid state materials are formed using solid precursors and high temperature processes, which are often not compatible with the presence of organic groups because they are decomposed at elevated temperatures. Hence, these high temperature processes are not suitable for the in situ formation of hybrid materials. Reactions that are employed should have more the character of classical covalent bond formation in solutions. One of the most prominent processes which fulfill these demands is the sol–gel process. However, such rather low temperature processes often do not lead to the thermodynamically most stable structure but to kinetic products, which has some implications for the structures obtained. For example, low temperature derived inorganic materials are often [[amorphous]] or [[crystallinity]] is only observed on a very small length scale, i.e. the nanometer range. An example of the latter is the formation of metal nanoparticles in organic or inorganic matrices by reduction of metal salts or organometallic precursors.

Some methods of in situ formation of inorganic materials are:

* [[Sol-gel|Sol-gel process]]
* Nonhydrolytic sol–gel process
* Sol–gel reactions of non-silicates

====Formation of organic polymers in presence of preformed inorganic materials====

If the organic polymerization occurs in the presence of an inorganic material to form the hybrid material one has to distinguish between several possibilities to overcome the incompatibility of the two species. The inorganic material can either have no surface functionalization but the bare material surface; it can be modified with nonreactive organic groups (e.g. alkyl chains); or it can contain reactive surface groups such as polymerizable functionalities. Depending on these prerequisites the material can be pretreated, for example a pure inorganic surface can be treated with surfactants or silane coupling agents to make it compatible with the organic monomers, or functional monomers can be added that react with the surface of the inorganic material. If the inorganic component has nonreactive organic groups attached to its surface and it can be dissolved in a monomer which is subsequently polymerized, the resulting material after the organic polymerization, is a blend. In this case the inorganic component interact only weakly or not at all with the organic polymer; hence, a class I material is formed. Homogeneous materials are only obtained in this case if agglomeration of the inorganic components in the organic environment is prevented. This can be achieved if the interactions between the inorganic components and the monomers are better or at least the same as between the inorganic components. However, if no strong chemical interactions are formed, the long-term stability of a once homogeneous material is questionable because of diffusion effects in the resulting hybrid material. The stronger the respective interaction between the components, the more stable is the final material. The strongest interaction is achieved if class II materials are formed, for example with covalent interactions.

====Hybrid materials by simultaneous formation of both components====

Simultaneous formation of the inorganic and organic polymers can result in the most homogeneous type of interpenetrating networks. Usually the precursors for the sol–gel process are mixed with monomers for the organic polymerization and both processes are carried out at the same time with or without solvent. Applying this method, three processes are competing with each other:

(a) the kinetics of the hydrolysis and condensation forming the inorganic phase,&lt;br /&gt;
(b) the kinetics of the polymerization of the organic phase, and&lt;br /&gt;
(c) the thermodynamics of the phase separation between the two phases.

By tailoring the kinetics of the two polymerizations in such a way that they occur simultaneously and rapidly enough, phase separation is avoided or minimized. Additional parameters such as attractive interactions between the two moieties, as described above can also be used to avoid phase separation.

One problem that also arises from the simultaneous formation of both networks is the sensitivity of many organic polymerization processes for sol–gel conditions or the composition of the materials formed. Ionic polymerizations, for example, often interact with the precursors or intermediates formed in the sol–gel process. Therefore, they are not usually applied in these reactions.

=== Conductivity ===

Under the right conditions, the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface is electrically conductive, like a metal. The angular dependence of [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect|Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations]] indicates that the conductivity is two-dimensional,&lt;ref name="2D"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caviglia |author2=Gariglio, Cancellieri |author3=Sacepe, Fete |author4=Reyren, Gabay |author5=Morpurgo, Triscone |title=Two-Dimensional Quantum Oscillations of the Conductance at LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Interfaces |journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1 December 2010 |volume=105 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.236802 |pmid=21231492 |arxiv = 1007.4941 |bibcode = 2010PhRvL.105w6802C |issue=23 |pages=236802 |first=A. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  leading many researchers to refer to it as a [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron gas]] (2DEG). Two-dimensional does not mean that the conductivity has zero thickness, but rather than the electrons are confined to only move in two directions. It is also sometimes called a two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) to emphasize the importance of inter-electron interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breitschaft|first=M |author2=V.

==== Conditions necessary for conductivity ====

Not all LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces are conductive. Typically, conductivity is achieved only when:

*The LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface is along the 001,110 and 111 [[Miller index|crystallographic direction]]

Conductivity can also be achieved when the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with oxygen vacancies; however, in that case, the interface is technically LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt; instead of LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Hypotheses for conductivity ====

The source of conductivity at the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface has been debated for years. SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a wide-band gap semiconductor that can be [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] in a variety of ways. Clarifying the mechanism behind the conductivity is a major goal of current research. Four leading hypotheses are:

*Polar gating
*Oxygen vacancies
*Intermixing
*Structural distortions

===== Polar gating =====

[[Image:LAOSTO Below Critical Thickness.png|thumb|alt=Before the critical thickness is reached, the STO band is flat and the LAO band slopes upward (away from the interface).|'''Below the critical thickness''': Further from the interface, the energy of electrons in the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rises, due to the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'s built-in electric field. (Not to scale)]]

[[Image:LAOSTO Above Critical Thickness.png|thumb|alt=A picture of the band edge diagram after the critical thickness is reached. Hard to describe in words quickly.|'''Above the critical thickness''': As the [[lanthanum aluminate|LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] grows thicker, the energy of electrons on the surface rises so high that they leave, leaving holes (or oxygen vacancies) behind. The positively charged holes (or oxygen vacancies) attract electrons to the lowest-energy empty states, located in the conduction band of the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. (Not to scale)]]

Polar gating was the first mechanism used to explain the conductivity at LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces.&lt;ref name="conductivity" /&gt; It postulates that the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is polar in the 001 direction (with alternating sheets of positive and negative charge), acts as an electrostatic [[MOSFET|gate]] on the semiconducting SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="conductivity" /&gt; When the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer grows thicker than three unit cells, its valence band energy rises above the [[Fermi level]], causing holes (or positively charged oxygen vacancies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=J.|author2=S. J. Clark |title=Limits to doping in oxides|journal=Physical Review B|date=28 Feb 2011|volume=83|issue=7|pages=075205|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.83.075205 |bibcode = 2011PhRvB..83g5205R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ) to form on the outer surface of the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The positive charge on the surface of the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; attracts negative charge to nearby available states. In the case of the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface, this means electrons accumulate in the surface of the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in the Ti d bands.

The strengths of the polar gating hypothesis are that it explains why conductivity requires a critical thickness of four unit cells of LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that it explains why conductivity requires the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to be TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-terminated. The polar gating hypothesis also explains why alloying the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases the critical thickness for conductivity.&lt;ref name="alloy" /&gt;

One weakness of the hypothesis is that it predicts that the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films should exhibit a built-in electric field; so far, [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy|x-ray photoemission]] experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berner|first=G. |author2=A.

===== Oxygen vacancies =====

Another hypothesis is that the conductivity comes from free electrons left by oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=vacancies&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalabukhov|first=Alexey|author2=Robert Gunnarsson |author3=Johan Börjesson |author4=Eva Olsson |author5=Tord Claeson |author6=Dag Winkler |title=Effect of oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3 substrate on the electrical properties of the LaAlO3∕SrTiO3 interface|journal=Physical Review B|year=1214|volume=75|issue=12|pages=121404|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.75.121404|arxiv = cond-mat/0603501 |bibcode = 2007PhRvB..75l1404K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is known to be easily [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] by oxygen vacancies, so this was initially considered a promising hypothesis.

An obvious difference between oxygen vacancies and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from oxygen vacancies are thermally activated as the donor level of oxygen vacancies is usually separated from the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Z.

===== Intermixing =====

[[Lanthanum]] is a known [[Doping (semiconductor)|dopant]] in SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederikse|first=H.P.R.|author2=W.R.

===== Structural distortions =====

A fourth hypothesis is that the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal structure undergoes octahedral rotations in response to the strain from the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These octahedral rotations in the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induce octahedral rotations in the SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, increasing the Ti d-band width enough so that electrons are no longer localized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoofs |author2=Carpenter |author3=Vickers |author4=Egilmez |author5=Fix |author6=Kleibeuker |author7=MacManus-Driscoll |author8=Blamire |title=Carrier density modulation by structural distortions at modified LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|date=8 April 2013 |volume=25 |issue=17 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/25/17/175005 |pmid=23567541 |bibcode = 2013JPCM...25q5005S |pages=175005 |first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetoresistance ===

[[Magnetoresistance]] measurements are a major experimental tool used to understand the electronic properties of materials. The magnetoresistance of LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces has been used to reveal the 2D nature of conduction, carrier concentrations (through the [[hall effect]]), electron mobilities, and more.&lt;ref name="2D" /&gt;

== Comparison to other 2D electron gases ==

The [[2DEG|2D electron gas]] that arises at the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface is notable for two main reasons. First, it has very high carrier concentration, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Second, if the polar gating hypothesis is true, the 2D electron gas has the potential to be totally free of [[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder]], unlike other 2D electron gases that require [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[MOSFET|gating]] to form. However, so far researchers have been unable to synthesize interfaces that realize the promise of low disorder.

== Synthesis methods ==

[[Image:Diagram of pulsed laser deposition.png|thumb|alt=The diagram shows the following: A laser beam is focused by a lens, enters a vacuum chamber, and hits a dot labeled target. A plasma plume is shown leaving the target and heading toward a heated substrate.|Interfaces are synthesized by shooting a laser at a LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; target. Ablated material flies off the target and lands onto a heated SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal.]]

Most LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces are synthesized using [[pulsed laser deposition]]. A high-power laser ablates a LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; target, and the plume of ejected material is deposited onto a heated SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substrate. Typical conditions used are:

*Laser wavelength of 248&amp;nbsp;nm
*Laser fluence of 0.5 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sato |author2=Bell |author3=Hikita |author4=Hwang |title=Stoichiometry control of the electronic properties of the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterointerface |arxiv=1304.7830 |date=25 June 2013 |doi=10.1063/1.4812353 |bibcode = 2013ApPhL.102y1602S |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=102 |issue=25 |pages=251602 |first=H. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Substrate temperature of 600&amp;nbsp;°C to 850&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name="magnetic effects" /&gt;
*Background oxygen pressure of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; Torr&lt;ref name="magnetic effects" /&gt;

Some LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces have also been synthesized by [[molecular beam epitaxy]], [[sputtering]], and [[atomic layer deposition]].&lt;ref name="ALD" /&gt;

== Similar interfaces ==

To better understand in the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface, researchers have synthesized a number of analogous interfaces between other polar [[perovskite]] films and SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Some of these analogues have properties similar to LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but some do not.

Irrotational flow occurs when the cross gradient of the velocity or [[shear (fluid)|shear]] is zero.

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times v = 0&lt;/math&gt;  
                        
The individual parcels of a frictionless [[incompressible fluid]] initially at rest cannot be caused to rotate. This can be visualized by considering an infinitesimal small volume of fluid in the shape of a sphere. Surface forces act normal to the surface, As the fluid is frictionless no friction occurs so they act through the center of the sphere hence, no [[torque]] can be exerted on the sphere so [[angular momentum]] remains constant and no change in angular velocity occurs. 
Rotation of a fluid parcel is defined as the average angular velocity of two elements originally at right angles to each other. Points A and B have an x-velocity which differs by ∂u/∂y dy over the time interval Δt. Points A and B will have a difference in x-displacements equal to

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta x_b + \Delta x_a = {\partial u\over \partial y} dy \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

and the associated angle change of side AB is

::&lt;math&gt;-\Delta\theta = {(\Delta x_b + \Delta x_a)\over \ dy} = {\partial u\over \partial y} \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;{d\theta\over dt} = -{\partial u\over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

The angular velocity of the element, about the z axis in this case, is defined as the average angular velocity of sides AB and AC.

::&lt;math&gt;\omega_z={1\over 2}\left({\partial v\over \partial x}-{\partial u\over \partial y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_x={1\over 2}\left({\partial w\over \partial y}-{\partial v\over \partial z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_y={1\over 2}\left({\partial u\over \partial z}-{\partial w\over \partial x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; 
 
Now  ∇×v=0 so,

::&lt;math&gt;{\partial v\over \partial x}={\partial u\over \partial y}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;{\partial w\over \partial y}={\partial v\over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;{\partial u\over \partial z}={\partial w\over \partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

These restrictions on the velocity must hold at every point. 
Let us consider a function ∅ which satisfies the condition 

::::&lt;math&gt;vdx+vdy=-d\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign is arbitrary it is a convention that causes the value of ∅ to decrease in the direction of the velocity.This proves the existence of a function ∅ such that its negative derivative with respect to any direction is the velocity component in that direction.

::&lt;math&gt;v=-\nabla\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption of a [[velocity potential]] is equivalent to the irrotational flow as

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (-\nabla\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever a velocity potential function exists then it must be an irrotational flow so they are equivalent to each other.
As we are considering ideal fluid so it must follow continuity equation 

::&lt;math&gt;{\partial u\over \partial x}+{\partial v\over \partial y}+{\partial w\over \partial z}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Yields,

::&lt;math&gt;{(\partial ^2\varnothing)\over (\partial x^2 )}+{(\partial ^2\varnothing)\over (\partial y^2 )}+{(\partial ^2\varnothing)\over (\partial z^2 )}=0&lt;/math&gt;

In vector form it can be written as       
       
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\varnothing=0&lt;/math&gt;

It is  called as the laplace equation.
Any function  ∅ that satisfies the [[laplace equation]] is a possible [[irrotational flow]] case.  As there are infinite number of solutions to the laplace equation each of which satisfies certain flow boundaries the main problem is the selection of the proper function for the particular flow case. As ∅ appears to the first power it is a linear equation, so the sum of two solutions is also a solution.

Importance of studying Irrotational flow;
*Many real world problems contain large regions of Irrotational flow.
*They can be studied analytically.
*They show us importance of [[Boundary layers]] and [[viscous forces]].
*They provide us tools for studying concepts of [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13124">[[File:NaCl-ionlattice-madelung.png|right|thumb|The Madelung constant being calculated for the NaCl ion labeled 0 in the expanding spheres method. Each number designates the order in which it is summed. Note that in this case, the sum is divergent, but there are methods for summing it which give a converging series.]]
The '''Madelung constant''' is used in determining the [[electrostatic potential]] of a single [[ion]] in a [[crystal]] by approximating the ions by [[point charge]]s. It is named after [[Erwin Madelung]], a German physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madelung E | year = 1918 | title = Das elektrische Feld in Systemen von regelmäßig angeordneten Punktladungen | url = | journal = Phys. Z. | volume = XIX | issue = | pages = 524–533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the [[anions]] and [[cations]] in an [[ionic compound|ionic solid]] are attracting each other by virtue of their opposing charges, separating the ions requires a certain amount of energy. This energy must be given to the system in order to break the anion-cation bonds. The energy required to break these bonds for one mole of an ionic solid under [[standard conditions]] is the [[lattice energy]].

== Formal expression ==
The Madelung constant allows for the calculation of the [[electric potential]] ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of all ions of the lattice felt by the ion at position ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''

:&lt;math&gt;V_i = \frac{e}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 } \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{z_j}{r_{ij}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' =|''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''| is the distance between the ''i''th and the ''j''th ion. In addition,
:''z&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = number of charges of the ''j''th ion
:''e'' = 1.6022{{e|&amp;minus;19}} [[coulomb|C]]
:4 &amp;pi; ϵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.112{{e|&amp;minus;10}} C²/(J m).

If the distances ''r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are normalized to the nearest neighbor distance ''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' the potential may be written

:&lt;math&gt;V_i = \frac{e}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_0 } \sum_{j} \frac{z_j r_0}{r_{ij}} = \frac{e}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_0 } M_i&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; being the (dimensionless) Madelung constant of the ''i''th ion

:&lt;math&gt;M_i = \sum_{j} \frac{z_j}{r_{ij}/r_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

The electrostatic energy of the ion at site &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; then is the product of its charge with the potential acting at its site
:&lt;math&gt;E_{el,i} = z_ieV_i = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_0 } z_i M_i.&lt;/math&gt;

There occur as many Madelung constants &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; in a [[crystal structure]] as ions occupy different lattice sites. For example, for the ionic crystal [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]], there arise two Madelung constants &amp;ndash; one for Na and another for Cl. Since both ions, however, occupy lattice sites of the same symmetry they both are of the same magnitude and differ only by sign. The electrical charge of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ion are assumed to be onefold positive and negative, respectively, &lt;math&gt;z_{Na}=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_{Cl}=-1&lt;/math&gt;. The nearest neighbour distance amounts to half the [[lattice parameter]] of the cubic [[unit cell]] &lt;math&gt;r_0=a/2&lt;/math&gt; and the Madelung constants become

:&lt;math&gt;M_\text{Na}=-M_\text{Cl} = {\sum_{j,k,\ell=-\infty}^\infty}^\prime {{(-1)^{j+k+\ell}} \over { (j^2 + k^2 + \ell^2)^{1/2}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:NaClMadelungConstant.png|thumb|alt=Madelung Constant for NaCl|This graph demonstrates the non-convergence of the expanding spheres method for calculating the Madelung constant for NaCl as compared to the expanding cubes method, which is convergent.]]

The prime indicates that the term &lt;math&gt;j=k=\ell=0&lt;/math&gt; is to be left out. Since this sum is [[conditionally convergent]] it is not suitable as definition of Madelung's constant unless the order of summation is also specified. There are two "obvious" methods of summing this series, by expanding cubes or expanding spheres. The latter, though devoid of a meaningful physical interpretation (there are no spherical crystals) is rather popular because of its simplicity. Thus, the following expansion is often found in the literature:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kittel: ''Introduction to Solid State Physics.'', Wiley 1995, {{ISBN|0-471-11181-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M = -6 +12/ \sqrt{2} -8/ \sqrt{3} +6/2 - 24/ \sqrt{5} + \dotsb = -1.74756\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is wrong as this series diverges as was shown by Emersleben in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Emersleben | first1 = O. | year = 1951 | title = Das Selbstpotential einer endlichen Reihe neutraler äquidistanter Punktepaare  | url = | journal = [[Mathematische Nachrichten]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3-4 | page = 468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borwein | first1 = D. | last2 = Borwein | first2 = J.

An unambiguous mathematical definition is given by [[David Borwein|Borwein]], [[Jonathan Borwein|Borwein]] and Taylor by means of [[analytic continuation]] of an absolutely convergent series.

There are many practical methods for calculating Madelung's constant using either direct summation (for example, the Evjen method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evjen | first1 = H.

== Formula ==

A fast converging formula for Madelung Constant is

&lt;math&gt;12 \, \pi \sum_{m, n \geq 1, \, \mathrm{odd}} \operatorname{sech}^2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}(m^2+n^2)^{1/2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=David|last2=Borwein|first2=Jonathan|last3=Kapoor|first3=Vishaal|last4=Weisstein|first4=Eric|title=Ten Problems in Experimental Mathematics|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=March 9, 2006|volume=113|issue=6|url=http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/tenproblems.pdf|doi=10.2307/27641975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization ==
It is assumed for the calculation of Madelung constants that an ion’s [[charge density]] may be approximated by a [[point charge]]. This is allowed, if the electron distribution of the ion is spherically symmetric. In particular cases, however, when the ions reside on lattice site of certain [[crystallographic point groups]], the inclusion of higher order moments, i.e. [[multipole moments]] of the charge density might be required. It is shown by [[electrostatics]] that the interaction between two point charges only accounts for the first term of a general [[Taylor series]] describing the interaction between two charge distributions of arbitrary shape. Accordingly, the Madelung constant only represents the [[Monopole (mathematics)|monopole]]-monopole term.

The electrostatic interaction model of ions in solids has thus been extended to a point multipole concept that also includes higher multipole moments like [[dipoles]], [[quadrupole]]s etc.&lt;ref name= Kana1955&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.

In their case, instead of the nearest neighbor distance &lt;math&gt; r_{0} &lt;/math&gt; another standard length like the cube root of the unit cell volume &lt;math&gt;w=\sqrt[3]{V}&lt;/math&gt; is appropriately used for purposes of normalization. For instance, the Madelung constant then reads

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{M}_i = \sum_{j} \frac{z_j}{r_{ij}/w}.&lt;/math&gt;

The proper calculation of electrostatic lattice constants has to consider the [[crystallographic point groups]] of ionic lattice sites; for instance, dipole moments may only arise on polar lattice sites, i. e. exhibiting a ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1''h''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''nv''&lt;/sub&gt;  site symmetry (''n'' = 2, 3, 4 or 6).&lt;ref name= ZPB1995a&gt;{{cite journal | author = M.

[[File:Takeoff weight diagram.svg|thumb|400px|right|Takeoff weight components]]

The '''maximum takeoff weight''' ('''MTOW''') or '''maximum gross takeoff weight''' ('''MGTOW''') or '''maximum takeoff mass''' ('''MTOM''') of an [[aircraft]] is the maximum weight at which the [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] is allowed to attempt to take off, due to structural or other limits. The analogous term for rockets is '''gross lift-off mass''', or '''GLOW'''. MTOW is usually specified in units of kilograms or pounds.

MTOW is the heaviest weight at which the aircraft has been shown to meet all the [[airworthiness]] requirements applicable to it. MTOW of an aircraft is fixed, and does not vary with altitude, air temperature or the length of the runway to be used for takeoff or landing. A different weight, the "maximum permissible takeoff weight" or "regulated takeoff weight", varies according to flap setting, altitude, air temperature, length of runway and other factors. It is different from one takeoff to the next, but can never be higher than the MTOW.

==Certification standards==
Certification standards applicable to the airworthiness of an aircraft contain many requirements. Some of these requirements can only be met by specifying a maximum weight for the aircraft, and demonstrating that the aircraft can meet the requirement at all weights up to, and including, the specified maximum.  These requirements include:
* structural requirements – to ensure the aircraft structure is capable of withstanding all the loads likely to be imposed on it during maneuvering by the pilot, and gusts experienced in turbulent atmospheric conditions.
* performance requirements – to ensure the aircraft is capable of climbing at an adequate gradient with all its engines operating; also with one engine inoperative.

At the MTOW, all aircraft of a type and model must be capable of complying with all these certification requirements.

==Multiple MTOW==
With several of the manufacturers of large aircraft, the same model of aircraft can have more than one MTOW. An operator can choose to have the aircraft certified for a reduced weight, often for a reduced cost with an option to later increase the MTOW for a fee and the cost of certification change. Some airlines which do not require a high MTOW choose to have a lower MTOW for that particular aircraft to reduce costs (Landing fees and air traffic control fees are MTOW based).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9082_cons_en.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2013|title=ICAO's Policies on Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other examples an increased MTOW option is achieved by reinforcement due to additional or stronger materials. For example, the [[Airbus A330]] 242 tonnes MTOW variant / [[Airbus A330neo|A330neo]] uses [[Aluminium alloy#Scandium.E2.80.93aluminium|Scandium–aluminium]] (scalmalloy) to avoid an [[Operating empty weight|empty weight]] increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/farnborough-airbus-outlines-a330neo-engineering-demands-401664/ FARNBOROUGH: Airbus outlines A330neo engineering demands]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technology-licensing.com/etl/int/en/What-we-offer/Technologies-for-licensing/Metallics-and-related-manufacturing-technologies/Scalmalloy.html Scalmalloy aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy] Airbus Technology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://3dprint.com/220033/scalmalloy-aircraft-material/ Metal 3D Printing Material Scalmalloy Could be the Aircraft Material of the Future.  3DPrint.com,  Sarah Saunders. Jul 20, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller aircraft like the [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] may have an option for a reinforced undercarriage to permit an increase in MTOW.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Maximum permissible takeoff weight or maximum allowed takeoff weight==
In many circumstances an aircraft may not be permitted to take off at its MTOW. In these circumstances the maximum weight permitted for takeoff will be determined taking account of the following:
* [[Flap (aircraft)|Wing flap]] setting. See the [[Spanair Flight 5022]] crash
* Airfield altitude (height above sea-level) – This affects air pressure which affects maximum engine power or thrust. 
* Air temperature – This affects air density which affects maximum engine power or thrust.
* Length of runway – A short runway means the aircraft has less distance to accelerate to takeoff speed.  The length for computation of maximum permitted takeoff weight may be adjusted if the runway has clearways and/or stopways.
* Runway wind component – The best condition is a strong headwind straight along the runway.  The worst condition is a tailwind.  If there is a crosswind it is the wind component along the runway which must be taken into account.
* Condition of runway – The best runway for taking off is a dry, paved runway.  An unpaved runway or one with traces of snow will provide more rolling friction which will cause the airplane to accelerate more slowly. See the [[Munich air disaster]]
* Obstacles – An airplane must be able to take off and gain enough height to clear all obstacles and terrain beyond the end of the runway.

The maximum weight at which a takeoff may be attempted, taking into account the above factors, is called the maximum permissible takeoff weight, maximum allowed takeoff weight or regulated takeoff weight.

Melissic acid gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[melissa]] meaning bee, since it was found in [[beeswax]].

==Synthesis==
''n''-Triacontanoic acid was synthesized by Bleyberg and Ulrich (1931) and by G.M. Robinson.&lt;ref name='Chibnall'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The isolation of n-triacontanol from lucerne wax | journal = Biochemical Journal | year = 1933 | first = Albert Charles | last = Chibnall |author2=Ernest Frank Williams |author3=Alfred Louis Latner |author4=Stephen Harvey Piper  | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 1885–1888| pmid = 16745314 | pmc = 1253114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6805">'''Nanotopography''' refers to specific surface features which form or are generated at the [[nanoscopic scale]].  While the term can be used to describe a broad range of applications ranging from [[integrated circuits]] to [[microfluidics]], in practice it typically applied to sub-micron textured surfaces as used in [[biomaterials]] research.

== In nature ==

Several functional nanotopographies have been identified in nature.  Certain surfaces like that of the  [[lotus effect|lotus leaf]]  have been understood to apply nanoscale textures for abiotic processes such as self-cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feng|first=L|title=Super-Hydrophobic Surfaces: From Natural to Artificial|journal=Advanced Materials|year=2002|volume=14|issue=24|pages=1857–1860|doi=10.1002/adma.200290020|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bio-mimetic applications of this discovery have since arrived in consumer products.  In 2012, it was recognized that nanotopographies in nature are also used for antibiotic purposes.  The wing of the [[cicada]], the surface of which is covered in nanoscale pillars, induces lysis of bacteria.  While the nano-pillars were not observed to prevent cell adhesion, they acted mechanistically to stretch microbial membranes to breakage.  In vitro testing of the cicada wing demonstrated its efficacy against a variety of bacterial strains.&lt;ref name="IvanovaHasan2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivanova|first1=Elena P.|last2=Hasan|first2=Jafar|last3=Webb|first3=Hayden K.|last4=Truong|first4=Vi Khanh|last5=Watson|first5=Gregory S.|last6=Watson|first6=Jolanta A.|last7=Baulin|first7=Vladimir A.|last8=Pogodin|first8=Sergey|last9=Wang|first9=James Y.|last10=Tobin|first10=Mark J.|last11=Löbbe|first11=Christian|last12=Crawford|first12=Russell J.|title=Natural Bactericidal Surfaces: Mechanical Rupture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cells by Cicada Wings|journal=Small|volume=8|issue=16|year=2012|pages=2489–2494|issn=1613-6810|doi=10.1002/smll.201200528|pmid=22674670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing ==
Numerous technologies are available for the production of nanotopography.  High-throughput techniques include [[plasma functionalization]], [[abrasive blasting]], and [[etching]].  Though low cost, these processes are limited in the control and replicability of feature size and geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=B|title=A review of materials, fabrication methods, and strategies used to enhance bone regeneration in engineered bone tissues|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials|year=2008|volume=85|issue=2|pages=573–582|doi=10.1002/jbm.b.30962|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Techniques enabling greater feature precision exist, among them [[electron beam lithography]] and [[particle deposition]], but are slower and more resource intensive by comparison.  Alternatively, processes such as [[molecular self-assembly]] can be utilized which provide an enhanced level of production speed and feature control.

== Applications to medicine ==

Though the effects of nanotopography on cell behavior have only been recognized since 1964, some of the first practical applications of the technology are being realized in the field of medicine.&lt;ref name=CurtisVarde&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=A.S.G.|author2=Varde M|title=Control of cell behavior: topological factors|journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute|year=1964|volume=33|issue=1|pages=15-26| pmid = 14202300 |doi=10.1093/jnci/33.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the few clinical applications is the functionalization of titanium [[implant (medicine)|implant]] surfaces with nanotopography, generated with submersion etching and sand blasting.  This technology has been the focal point of a diverse body of research aimed at improving post-operative integration of certain implant components.  The determinant of integration varies, but as most titanium implants are orthopedics-oriented, [[osseointegration]] is the dominant aim of the field.

== Applications to cell engineering ==
Nanotopography is readily applied to [[cell culture]] and has been shown to have a significant impact on cell behavior across different [[cell type|lineages]].&lt;ref name=CurtisVarde/&gt; Substrate features in the nanoscale regime down to the order of 9&amp;nbsp;nm are able to retain some effect.  Subjected solely to topographical cues, a wide variety of cells demonstrate responses including changes in [[cell growth]] and [[gene expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Guehennec|first=L|title=Surface treatments of titanium dental implants for rapid osseointegration|journal=Dental Materials|year=2007|volume=23|issue=7|pages=844–854|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2006.06.025|pmid=16904738|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain patterns are able to induce [[stem cells]] to [[cell differentiation|differentiate]] down specific pathways.&lt;ref name="McNamaraMcMurray2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=L.

[[File:Blizzard of 2005.JPG|thumb|300px|Abandoned cars line [[Massachusetts Route 6A|Route 6A]] in [[Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts|Yarmouth Port]], [[Massachusetts]], one of the harder hit areas, receiving as much as 30.5&amp;nbsp;inches (77.5&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow during the blizzard.]]

The '''North American blizzard of 2005''' was a three-day [[storm]] that affected large areas of the northern [[United States]], dropping more than 3&amp;nbsp;feet (0.9&amp;nbsp;m) of snow in parts of southeastern [[Massachusetts]], as well as much of the [[Boston]] metropolitan area.  While this was by far the hardest hit region, it was also a significant [[snowstorm]] for the [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]] areas, which both suffered occasional [[blizzard]] conditions and 12-15&amp;nbsp;inch (30–38&amp;nbsp;cm) snow accumulations. 

The storm began dropping snow on the upper [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] on Thursday, January 20, 2005. It slowly moved eastward affecting the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] region and the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] on Friday and Saturday, January 21 and January 22, 2005. On Saturday evening the storm entered the Southern [[New England]] area. The strength of the storm, coupled with the extreme Arctic temperatures, created a light, fluffy snow which increased the snowfall totals.

The storm shut down [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[T. F. Green Airport]] in [[Rhode Island]], while also impairing travel throughout much of [[Massachusetts]] due to the high amount of snow covering the roads.  Practically all schools in the Metrowest and South East regions of Massachusetts were closed for at least two days.  [[Cape Cod Community College]], as well as all public schools on [[Cape Cod]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket]] were closed for up to a week.

After traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, the storm system hit parts of Great Britain and Ireland and the Scandinavian peninsula, causing even more widespread blackouts and a small number of deaths in the region.

==Conditions==
Conditions throughout much of eastern [[Massachusetts]] were near-whiteout and, in some cases, were whiteout.  [[State Police]] in both [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts|Dartmouth]] and [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] suggested that residents travel as little as possible.  Major highways, such as [[Massachusetts State Highway 24|Route 24]], [[US 6|Route 6]] and [[Massachusetts State Highway 140|Route 140]], could not be properly cleared because of the heavy snowfall and high winds.  Secondary highways, such as [[Massachusetts State Highway 79|Route 79]] were nearly impassable in some areas.

Many Boston-area [[anchorman|newscasters]] credit the [[New England Patriots]] football game on January 23 for keeping most travellers indoors, avoiding the pile-ups and endless lines of stuck cars that were the hallmark of the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of 1978]].  The fact that the storm fell on a weekend when many people did not have to go to work or school also helped to this effect.

==Aftermath==
With much of the snow cleared from the roads by the evening of January 24, snowpiles on street corners were in excess of ten feet high in some locations.  Roads were severely narrowed in most congested areas, due to parked cars that were not towed and instead simply plowed in.  Most schools in eastern [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]] remained closed for an extended period of time to allow for clean-up of the [[road debris]].

'''Pentamethylarsenic''' (or '''pentamethylarsorane'''&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;)is an [[organometalllic compound]] containing five [[methyl group]]s bound to an [[arsenic]] atom with formula As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is an example of a [[hypervalent]] compound. The molecular shape is [[trigonal bipyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Tim M.|last2=Downs|first2=Anthony J.|last3=Pulham|first3=Colin R.|last4=Haaland|first4=Arne|last5=Verne|first5=Hans Peter|last6=Volden|first6=Hans Vidar|last7=Timofeeva|first7=Tatjana V.|title=Molecular Structures of Pentamethylarsenic(V) and Trimethyldichloroarsenic(V) by Gas Electron Diffraction and ab Initio Calculations:?

==History==
The first claim to make pentamethylarsenic was in 1862 in a reaction of tetramethylarsonium iodide with dimethylzinc by A. Cahours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cahours|first1=A.|journal=Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie|date=1862|volume=122|pages=329–347|title=Untersuchungen über die metallhaltigen organischen Radicale|issue=3|doi=10.1002/jlac.18621220305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=P.|title=Principles of Organometallic Chemistry|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789400911970|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MG3sCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135|language=en|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years all the reproductions of this proved fruitless, so the production proved not to be genuine.&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wittig|first1=G.|last2=Torssell|first2=K.|last3=Vister|first3=Thor|title=Über Pentamethyl-arsen und Pentamethyl-antimon|journal=Acta Chemica Scandinavica|date=1953|volume=7|pages=1293–1301|doi=10.3891/acta.chem.scand.07-1293}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was actually discovered by [[Karl-Heinz Mitschke]] and [[Hubert Schmidbaur]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=mit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitschke|first1=Karl-Heinz|last2=Schmidbaur|first2=Hubert|title=Pentamethylarsen|journal=Chemische Berichte|date=November 1973|volume=106|issue=11|pages=3645–3651|doi=10.1002/cber.19731061124|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[Trimethylarsine]] is chlorinated to [[trimethylarsine dichloride]], which then reacts with [[methyl lithium]] to yield pentamethylarsenic.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt;

:As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
:As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2LiCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 2LiCl

Side products include As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubert Schmidbaur|title=Advances in Organometallic Chemistry|date=1976|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080580159|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rhM8auhrK5MC&amp;pg=PA230|pages=229–230|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentamethylarsenic is not produced by biological organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornils|first1=Boy|last2=Herrmann|first2=Wolfgang A.|title=Aqueous-Phase Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Applications|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527605460|page=331|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1zBDlJVYLUC&amp;pg=PA331|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Pentamethylarsenic smells the same as [[pentamethylantimony]], but is otherwise unique.&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;

The bond lengths in the molecule are for the three equatorial As−C bonds 1.975&amp;nbsp;Å and the two axial As−C bonds 2.073&amp;nbsp;Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Tim M.|last2=Downs|first2=Anthony J.|last3=Pulham|first3=Colin R.|last4=Haaland|first4=Arne|last5=Verne|first5=Hans Peter|last6=Volden|first6=Hans Vidar|last7=Timofeeva|first7=Tatjana V.|title=Molecular Structures of Pentamethylarsenic(V) and Trimethyldichloroarsenic(V) by Gas Electron Diffraction and ab Initio Calculations:  Molecular Mechanics Calculations on Pentamethylarsenic(V), Pentaphenylarsenic(V), and Related Compounds|journal=Organometallics|date=November 1998|volume=17|issue=24|pages=5287–5293|doi=10.1021/om980520r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infrared spectrum of pentamethylarsenic shows strong bands at 582 and 358&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; due to axial C-As vibration, and weaker bands at 265 and 297&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; due to equatorial C-As vibration.&lt;ref name=spion&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenwood|first1=N. N.|title=Spectroscopic Properties of Inorganic and Organometallic Compounds|date=1974|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=9780851860633|page=294|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0EWPdSk2PucC&amp;pg=PA294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raman spectrum shows a strong feature at 519, 388, and 113&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and weak lines at 570 and 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=spion/&gt;

==Reactions==
Pentamethylarsenic reacts slowly with weak acids.  With water it forms tetramethylarsonium hydroxide As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH and trimethylarsenic oxide As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O. With methanol, tetramethylmethoxyarsorane As(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is produced. Hydrogen halides react resulting in the formation of tetramethylarsonium halide salts.&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;

When pentamethylarsenic is heated to 100° it decomposes forming [[trimethylarsine]], [[methane]], and [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aylett|first1=B. J.|title=Organometallic Compounds: Volume One The Main Group Elements Part Two Groups IV and V|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400957299|page=401|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DpnuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[trimethylindium]] reacts with pentamethylarsenic in benzene solution, a salt precipitates: tetramethylarsenic(V)tetramethylindate(III).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science of Synthesis: Houben-Weyl Methods of Molecular Transformations Vol. 7: Compounds of Groups 13 and 2 (Al, Ga, In, Tl, Be...Ba)|date=2014|publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag|isbn=9783131779618|page=258|chapter=7.3.6.3|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xpm2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polycrystalline silicon''', also called '''polysilicon''' or '''poly-Si''', is a high purity, [[polycrystalline]] form of [[silicon]], used as a raw material by the solar [[photovoltaic]] and [[electronics industry]].

Polysilicon is produced from [[Silicon#Metallurgical grade|metallurgical grade silicon]] by a chemical purification process, called the Siemens process. This process involves [[distillation]] of volatile silicon compounds, and their [[chemical decomposition|decomposition]] into silicon at high temperatures. An emerging, alternative process of refinement uses a [[fluidized bed reactor]]. The photovoltaic industry also produces upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si), using metallurgical instead of chemical purification processes. When produced for the electronics industry, polysilicon contains impurity levels of less than one [[Parts-per notation|part per billion]] (ppb), while polycrystalline solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) is generally less pure. A few companies from China, Germany, Japan, Korea and the United States, such as [[GCL-Poly]], [[Wacker Chemie AG|Wacker Chemie]], [[OCI (company)|OCI]], and [[Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation|Hemlock Semiconductor]], as well as the Norwegian headquartered [[Renewable Energy Corporation|REC]], accounted for most of the worldwide production of about 230,000 tonnes in 2013.&lt;ref name="BNEF polysilicon-production-2013" /&gt;

The polysilicon feedstock – large rods, usually broken into chunks of specific sizes and packaged in clean rooms before shipment – is directly cast into multicrystalline [[ingots]] or submitted to a [[Czochralski process|recrystallization process]] to grow single crystal [[Boule (crystal)|boules]]. The products are then sliced into thin silicon [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] and used for the production of [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]] and other [[semiconductor devices]].

Polysilicon consists of small [[crystal]]s, also known as [[crystallites]], giving the material its typical [[Grain boundary|metal flake effect]]. While polysilicon and multisilicon are often used as synonyms, multicrystalline usually refers to crystals larger than 1 [[millimetre|mm]]. Multicrystalline solar cells are the most common type of solar cells in the [[Growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing PV market]] and consume most of the worldwide produced polysilicon. About 5 tons of polysilicon is required to manufacture 1 [[megawatt]] (MW) of conventional solar modules.&lt;ref name="polysilicon-marketrealist" /&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=link broken, archived 2015 article listed no references anyway|date=August 2018}} Polysilicon is distinct from [[monocrystalline silicon]] and [[amorphous silicon]].

== Polycrystalline vs monocrystalline silicon ==
[[File:Comparison solar cell poly-Si vs mono-Si.png|thumb|Comparing polycrystalline (left) to monocrystalline (right) solar cells]]

In [[monocrystalline silicon|single crystal silicon]], also known as monocrystalline silicon, the crystalline framework is homogenous, which can be recognized by an even external colouring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarworld.de/Solar-ABC.123.0.html?&amp;L=1|title=Solar ABC|author=|date=|website=solarworld.de|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire sample is one single, continuous and unbroken crystal as its [[Crystal structure|structure]] contains no [[grain boundaries]]. Large single crystals are rare in nature and can also be difficult to produce in the laboratory (see also [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallisation]]). In contrast, in an amorphous structure the order in atomic positions is limited to short range.

[[Polycrystalline]] and [[paracrystalline]] phases are composed of a number of smaller crystals or ''[[crystallite]]s.'' Polycrystalline silicon (or semi-crystalline silicon, polysilicon, poly-Si, or simply "poly") is a material consisting of multiple small [[silicon]] [[crystal]]s. Polycrystalline cells can be recognized by a visible grain, a "metal flake effect". Semiconductor grade (also solar grade) polycrystalline silicon is converted to "single crystal" silicon – meaning that the randomly associated crystallites of silicon in "polycrystalline silicon" are converted to a large "single" crystal. Single crystal silicon is used to manufacture most Si-based [[microelectronic]] devices. Polycrystalline silicon can be as much as 99.9999% pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0040-6090(94)05644-S|title=Electron powder ribbon polycrystalline silicon plates used for porous layer fabrication|year=1995|last1=Kolic|first1=Y|journal=Thin Solid Films|volume=255|page=159|bibcode = 1995TSF...255..159K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-pure poly is used in the [[semiconductor]] industry, starting from poly rods that are two to three meters in length. In [[microelectronic]] industry (semiconductor industry), poly is used both at the macro-scale and micro-scale (component) level. [[Single crystal]]s are grown using the [[Czochralski process]], [[Float-zone silicon|float-zone]] and [[Bridgman technique]]s.

== Polycrystalline silicon components ==

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

[[Image:Leo Tie Rodsedit.jpg|thumb|A rod of semiconductor-grade polysilicon.]]

At the component level, polysilicon has long been used as the conducting gate material in [[MOSFET]] and [[CMOS]] processing technologies. For these technologies it is deposited using low-pressure chemical-vapour deposition ([[Chemical Vapor Deposition|LPCVD]]) reactors at high temperatures and is usually heavily doped [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]].

More recently, intrinsic and doped polysilicon is being used in [[large-area electronics]] as the active and/or doped layers in [[thin-film transistor]]s. Although it can be deposited by [[Chemical Vapor Deposition|LPCVD]], plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition ([[Chemical Vapor Deposition|PECVD]]), or solid-phase crystallization of [[amorphous silicon]] in certain processing regimes, these processes still require relatively high temperatures of at least 300&amp;nbsp;°C. These temperatures make deposition of polysilicon possible for [[glass]] substrates but not for [[plastic]] substrates.

The deposition of polycrystalline silicon on plastic substrates is motivated by the desire to be able to manufacture digital displays on flexible screens. Therefore, a relatively new technique called laser crystallization has been devised to crystallize a precursor [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si) material on a plastic substrate without melting or damaging the plastic. Short, high-intensity [[ultraviolet]] [[laser]] pulses are used to heat the deposited a-Si material to above the melting point of silicon, without melting the entire substrate.

[[Image:Silicon poly 640x480.jpg|thumb|left|Polycrystalline silicon (used to produce silicon [[monocrystal]]s by [[Czochralski process]])]]

The molten silicon will then crystallize as it cools. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, researchers have been able to grow very large grains, of up to hundreds of micrometers in size in the extreme case, although grain sizes of 10 [[nanometer]]s to 1 [[micrometer]] are also common. In order to create devices on polysilicon over large-areas however, a crystal grain size smaller than the device feature size is needed for homogeneity of the devices. Another method to produce poly-Si at low temperatures is [[metal-induced crystallization]] where an amorphous-Si thin film can be crystallized at temperatures as low as 150&amp;nbsp;°C if annealed while in contact of another metal film such as [[aluminium]], [[gold]], or [[silver]].

Polysilicon has many applications in [[VLSI]] manufacturing. One of its primary uses is as gate electrode material for MOS devices. A polysilicon gate's electrical conductivity may be increased by depositing a metal (such as tungsten) or a metal silicide (such as tungsten silicide) over the gate. Polysilicon may also be employed as a resistor, a conductor, or as an ohmic contact for shallow junctions, with the desired electrical conductivity attained by doping the polysilicon material.

One major difference between polysilicon and a-Si is that the mobility of the [[charge carrier]]s of the polysilicon can be orders of magnitude larger and the material also shows greater stability under [[electric field]] and light-induced stress. This allows more complex, high-speed circuity to be created on the glass substrate along with the a-Si devices, which are still needed for their low-[[Leakage (electronics)|leakage]] characteristics. When polysilicon and a-Si devices are used in the same process this is called hybrid processing. A complete polysilicon active layer process is also used in some cases where a small pixel size is required, such as in [[Liquid crystal on silicon|projection displays]].

=== Feedstock for PV industry ===

{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}

Polycrystalline silicon is the key feedstock in the crystalline silicon based photovoltaic industry and used for the production of conventional [[solar cell]]s. For the first time, in 2006, over half of the world's supply of polysilicon was being used by PV manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyecospaces.com/2007/09/photovoltaics-getting-cheaper.html|title=Photovoltaics: Getting Cheaper|author=|date=|website=nyecospaces.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar industry was severely hindered by a [[Growth of photovoltaics#Silicon shortage (2005–2008)|shortage]] in supply of polysilicon feedstock and was forced to idle about a quarter of its cell and module manufacturing capacity in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114624912379938991 The Wall Street Journal, ''A Shortage Hits Solar Power''. April 29, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only twelve factories were known to produce solar-grade polysilicon in 2008; however, by 2013 the number increased to over 100 manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfsolar.com/directory/material/polysilicon|title=ENF Ltd.|first=ENF|last=Ltd.|date=|website=www.enfsolar.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monocrystalline silicon is higher priced and a more efficient semiconductor than polycrystalline as it went through the additional recrystallization by the [[Czochralski process]].

== Deposition methods ==

Polysilicon deposition, or the process of depositing a layer of polycrystalline silicon on a semiconductor wafer, is achieved by the [[chemical decomposition]] of [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) at high temperatures of 580 to 650&amp;nbsp;°C. This [[pyrolysis]] process releases hydrogen.
:{{chem|SiH|4}}(g) → Si(s) + 2 {{chem|H|2}}(g) [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] at 500-800&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;ref name="Morgan&amp;Board"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=D. V.|last2=Board|first2=K.|title=An Introduction To Semiconductor Microtechnology|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=0471924784|page=27|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polysilicon layers can be deposited using 100% silane at a pressure of {{convert|25|-|130|Pa|Torr|abbr=on}} or with 20–30% silane (diluted in nitrogen) at the same total pressure. Both of these processes can deposit polysilicon on 10–200 wafers per run, at a rate of 10–20&amp;nbsp;nm/min and with thickness uniformities of ±5%. Critical process variables for polysilicon deposition include temperature, pressure, silane concentration, and dopant concentration. Wafer spacing and load size have been shown to have only minor effects on the deposition process. The rate of polysilicon deposition increases rapidly with temperature, since it follows [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius]] behavior, that is deposition rate = A·exp(–qE&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/kT) where q is electron charge and k is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. The activation energy (E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) for polysilicon deposition is about 1.7&amp;nbsp;eV. Based on this equation, the rate of polysilicon deposition increases as the deposition temperature increases. There will be a minimum temperature, however, wherein the rate of deposition becomes faster than the rate at which unreacted silane arrives at the surface. Beyond this temperature, the deposition rate can no longer increase with temperature, since it is now being hampered by lack of silane from which the polysilicon will be generated. Such a reaction is then said to be 'mass-transport-limited.' When a polysilicon deposition process becomes mass-transport-limited, the reaction rate becomes dependent primarily on reactant concentration, reactor geometry, and gas flow.

When the rate at which polysilicon deposition occurs is slower than the rate at which unreacted silane arrives, then it is said to be surface-reaction-limited. A deposition process that is surface-reaction-limited is primarily dependent on reactant concentration and reaction temperature. Deposition processes must be surface-reaction-limited because they result in excellent thickness uniformity and step coverage. A plot of the logarithm of the deposition rate against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature in the surface-reaction-limited region results in a straight line whose slope is equal to –qE&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/k.

At reduced pressure levels for VLSI manufacturing, polysilicon deposition rate below 575&amp;nbsp;°C is too slow to be practical. Above 650&amp;nbsp;°C, poor deposition uniformity and excessive roughness will be encountered due to unwanted gas-phase reactions and silane depletion. Pressure can be varied inside a low-pressure reactor either by changing the pumping speed or changing the inlet gas flow into the reactor. If the inlet gas is composed of both silane and nitrogen, the inlet gas flow, and hence the reactor pressure, may be varied either by changing the nitrogen flow at constant silane flow, or changing both the nitrogen and silane flow to change the total gas flow while keeping the gas ratio constant. Recent investigations have shown that e-beam evaporation, followed by SPC (if needed) can be a cost effective and faster alternative for producing solar grade poly-Si thin films.&lt;ref&gt;C.Becker, Microstructure and photovoltaic performance of polycrystalline silicon thin films on temperature-stable ZnO:Al layers. ''J. Appl. Phys.'' 106, 084506 (2009), [[DOI:10.1063/1.3240343]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modules produced by such method are shown to have a photovoltaic efficiency of ~6%.&lt;ref&gt;[35th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference , 614 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polysilicon doping, if needed, is also done during the deposition process, usually by adding phosphine, arsine, or diborane. Adding phosphine or arsine results in slower deposition, while adding diborane increases the deposition rate. The deposition thickness uniformity usually degrades when dopants are added during deposition.

== Upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon ==

[[File:Silicon purification processes.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of the traditional Siemens and the [[Fluidized bed reactor]] purification process.]]

Upgraded [[Silicon#Metallurgical grade|metallurgical-grade]] (UMG) silicon (also known as UMG-Si) [[solar cell]] is being produced as a low cost alternative to polysilicon created by the [[Siemens process]]. UMG-Si greatly reduces impurities in a variety of ways that require less equipment and energy than the Siemens process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glgroup.com/News/Is-Upgraded-Metallurgical-Grade-Silicon-The-Only-Hope-For-Manufacturers-of-Photovoltaic-Solar-Cells--24814.html Is Upgraded Metallurgical Grade Silicon The Only Hope For Manufacturers of Photovoltaic Solar Cells? – GLG News].

== Potential for use of polycrystalline silicon ==

[[File:grain boundary diagram.jpg|frame|right|A picture of grain boundaries for polysilicon. Each grain is crystalline over the width of the grain. The grain boundary separates the grains where the adjoining grain is at a different orientation from its neighbor.

Currently, polysilicon is commonly used for the conducting gate materials in semiconductor devices such as [[MOSFET]]s; however, it has potential for large-scale photovoltaic devices.&lt;ref name="streetman"&gt;{{Citation |last=Streetman |first=B.

Solar cell efficiency increases with grain size. This effect is due to reduced recombination in the solar cell. Recombination, which is a limiting factor for current in a solar cell, occurs more prevalently at grain boundaries, see figure 1.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt;

The resistivity, mobility, and free-carrier concentration in monocrystalline silicon vary with doping concentration of the single crystal silicon. Whereas the doping of polycrystalline silicon does have an effect on the resistivity, mobility, and free-carrier concentration, these properties strongly depend on the polycrystalline grain size, which is a physical parameter that the material scientist can manipulate.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Through the methods of crystallization to form polycrystalline silicon, an engineer can control the size of the polycrystalline grains which will vary the physical properties of the material.

== Novel ideas for polycrystalline silicon ==

The use of polycrystalline silicon in the production of solar cells requires less material and therefore provides higher profits and increased manufacturing throughput. Polycrystalline silicon does not need to be deposited on a silicon wafer to form a solar cell, rather it can be deposited on other-cheaper materials, thus reducing the cost. Not requiring a silicon wafer alleviates the silicon shortages occasionally faced by the microelectronics industry.&lt;ref name="Basore"&gt;{{Citation |last=Basore |first=P. A. |title=CSG-2: Expanding the production of a new polycrystalline silicon PV technology |work=Proceedings of the 21st European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference |year=2006 |url=http://www.csgsolar.com/downloads/CSG-2%20Basore.pdf }}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of not using a silicon wafer is crystalline silicon on glass (CSG) materials &lt;ref name ="Basore"/&gt;

A primary concern in the photovoltaics industry is cell efficiency. However, sufficient cost savings from cell manufacturing can be suitable to offset reduced efficiency in the field, such as the use of larger solar cell arrays compared with more compact/higher efficiency designs. Designs such as CSG are attractive because of a low cost of production even with reduced efficiency.&lt;ref name="Basore"/&gt; Higher efficiency devices yield modules that occupy less space and are more compact; however, the 5–10% efficiency of typical CSG devices still makes them attractive for installation in large central-service stations, such as a power station.&lt;ref name="Basore"/&gt; The issue of efficiency versus cost is a value decision of whether one requires an “energy dense” solar cell or sufficient area is available for the installation of less expensive alternatives. For instance, a solar cell used for power generation in a remote location might require a more highly efficient solar cell than one used for low-power applications, such as solar [[accent lighting]] or pocket calculators, or near established power grids.

The polysilicon manufacturing market is growing rapidly. According to [[Digitimes]], in July 2011, the total polysilicon production in 2010 was 209,000 tons. First-tier suppliers account for 64% of the market while China-based polysilicon firms have 30% of market share. The total production is likely to increase 37.4% to 281,000 tons by end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110718PD215.html|title=Login to DIGITIMES archive &amp; research|first=|last=DIGITIMES|date=|website=www.digitimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2012, [[EETimes]] Asia predicts 328,000 tons production with only 196,000 tons of demand, with spot prices expected to fall 56%. While good for renewable energy prospects, the subsequent drop in price could be brutal for manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800665769_765245_NT_5e271e8d.HTM|title=Polysilicon surplus seen to erode prices, says analyst|author=|date=|website=www.eetasia.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2012, SolarIndustryMag reports a capacity of 385,000 tons will be reached by yearend 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarindustrymag.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.11295|title=Solar Polysilicon Manufacturers Cranking Out Supply Despite Losses - Solar Industry|author=|date=2 October 2012|website=solarindustrymag.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But as established producers (mentioned below) expand their capacities, additional newcomers – many from Asia – are moving into the market.

=== Price ===

[[File:Polysilicon prices history since 2004.svg|thumb|left|History of polysilicon spot prices]]

Prices of polysilicon are often divided into two categories, contract and spot prices, and higher purity commands higher prices. While in booming installation times, price rally occurs in polysilicon. Not only spot prices surpass contract prices in the market; but it is also hard to acquire enough polysilicon. Buyers will accept down payment and long term agreements to acquire a large enough volume of polysilicon. On the contrary, spot prices will be below contract prices once the solar PV installation is in a down trend. In late 2010, booming installation brought up the spot prices of polysilicon. In the first half of 2011, prices of polysilicon kept strong owing to the FIT policies of Italy. The solar PV price survey and market research firm, PVinsights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvinsights.com|title=PVinsights|author=|date=|website=www.pvinsights.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the prices of polysilicon might be dragged down by lack of installation in the second half of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr-inside.com/price-cut-of-solar-pv-supply-r2597183.htm''[Price cut of solar PV supply chain spreads and the price of poly-silicon might be dragged down by others'']&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2008 prices were over $400/kg spiking from levels around $200/kg, while seen falling to $15/kg in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20121123PD204.html|title=Login to DIGITIMES archive &amp; research|first=|last=DIGITIMES|date=|website=www.digitimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government accused United States and [[South Korea]]n manufacturers of [[predatory pricing]] or [[Dumping (pricing policy)|"dumping"]]. As a consequence, in 2013 it imposed [[import tariffs]] of as much as 57 percent on polysilicon shipped from these two countries in order to stop the product from being sold below cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Imposes Duties on Polysilicon From U.S., S. Korea|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/china-imposes-duties-on-polysilicon-from-u-s-to-korea.html|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Waste ====

Due to the rapid growth in manufacturing in China and the lack of regulatory controls, there have been reports of the dumping of waste silicon tetrachloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar Energy Firms Leave Waste Behind in China|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595_3.html|accessdate=8 March 2015|newspaper=Washington Post|date=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the waste silicon tetrachloride is recycled but this adds to the cost of manufacture as it needs to be heated to {{convert|1800|F|C}}.

'''Savandurga''' is a hill located in [[Ramanagara|Ramnagara]] District ([[Karnataka]], [[India]]) 60&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Bengaluru]]  off the Magadi road {{coord|12.919654|N|77.292881|E|region:IN_type:landmark}}, in [[India]]. The hill is considered to be among the largest [[monolith]] hills in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bengaloorutourism.com/savandurga.php|title=Savandurga |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill rises to 1227 m above mean sea level and forms a part of the [[Deccan plateau]]. It consists of peninsular gneiss, granites, basic dykes and laterites. The Arkavathi river passes nearby through the Thippagondanahalli reservoir and on towards Manchanabele dam.

==History==
[[File:SavandurgaMap.jpg|thumb|Map of the Savandurga area]]
===Early history===
Savandurga is formed by two hills known locally as Karigudda (black hill) and Biligudda (white hill). The earliest record of the name of the hill is from 1340 AD by Hoysala Ballala III from Madabalu where it is called ''Savandi''. Another view is that the name is originated from ''Samantadurga'' attributed to a ''Samantharaya'', a governor under Ahchutaraya at Magadi, although there is no inscription confirming this. This was the secondary capital of the Magadi rulers such as Kempegowda.

===Anglo-Mysore wars===
{{main article|Siege of Savendroog}}
From 1638 to 1728, Mysore took over this place and Dalavayi Devaraja occupied this place with the palace at Nelapattana. In 1791 [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] [[Siege of Savendroog|captured it]] from [[Tipu Sultan]]'s forces during the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, Mark.

==Megalithic settlements==
[[File:Savandurga megaliths.jpg|thumb|Branwell's excavations in 1881]]
The area was known for megalithic settlements, the remains of one structure was described while a grave was excavated by Col. Branwell in 1881 and was described in details. It included the skeleton of a man who may have sustained injuries to his skull and died from it. It also included iron spear heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Branfill, B.R. |title=On the Savandurga rude stone cemetery, Central Maisur|journal=Indian Antiquary |year=1881| volume=10| pages=1-12| url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.117418/page/n5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==

The hills are home to the endangered [[yellow-throated bulbul]]s and were once home to [[long-billed vulture]]s and [[Gyps bengalensis|white-backed vulture]]s. Other wildlife include [[sloth bear]] and [[leopard]]. The rocks with trees growing in the cracks and valleys serve are the favoured habitat of the yellow-throated bulbuls.

A '''soap shaker''' is a box entirely made from wire metal [[mesh]] with a handle. The box may be opened so as to be able to place in this box a piece or pieces of [[bar soap]]. These may be pieces that have become too small to be used as hand soap.

The box may now be securely closed. Held by its handle the box may be vigorously shaken in a water filled [[bucket]] or other container. The shaking will move the water through the box. The result is that the water will become soapy, rich with [[Foam|suds]] to be used for all kinds of cleaning purposes. This way even small pieces of bar soap could be re-used and are not wasted.

The use of a soap shaker was common early to mid 20th century. The invention and sale of powdered or liquid soap diminished its use.

&lt;!-- [[File:sonicbm2.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Aircraft sonic boom. {{deletable image-caption|Monday, 21 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
A '''sonic boom''' is the sound associated with the [[shock wave]]s created whenever an object travelling through the air travels faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of [[sound]] energy, sounding similar to an [[explosion]] or a [[thunder]]clap to the human ear. The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/9/crackin-good-mathematics Mike May, ''Crackin' Good Mathematics'', American Scientist, Volume 90, Number 5, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.

A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it only affects observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.

==Causes==
When an aircraft passes through the air it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.

In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the "smooth flight" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin( \alpha) =\frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt; \frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt; is the inverse &lt;math&gt;\Big(\frac{1}{Ma}\Big)&lt;/math&gt; of the plane's [[Mach number]] (&lt;math&gt;Ma = \frac{v_\text{object}}{v_\text{sound}}&lt;/math&gt;).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.

There is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This "[[overpressure]] profile" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The "boom" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms – one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive "double boom" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.

Since the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

For today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage — shattered glass, for example — will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The "length" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore "spread out" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.&lt;ref name=seebass&gt;[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].

The later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the "rise time" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be "softer". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.

==Measurement and examples==
The [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often are a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.

==Abatement==
[[File:Large-Scale Low-Boom Supersonic Inlet Model.jpg|thumb|New research is being performed at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] that could help alleviate the sonic boom produced by supersonic aircraft. Testing was recently completed of a Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model with micro-array flow control. A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]

In the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American B-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&amp;nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.

Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a "[[figure of merit]]" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment mixed with politics eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

Seebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&amp;nbsp;m to 18,000&amp;nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]
This remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&amp;nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.

As a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.

There are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

NASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Perception, noise and other concerns==
The sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double "boom" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. However, as those who have witnessed landings of [[space shuttle]]s have heard, when the aircraft is nearby the sonic boom is a sharper "bang" or "crack". The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, "You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane - it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship - it's behind us.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.

Sonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the "torching" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.

There has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom "N" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the overpressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the snapping of one's fingers in which the "perceived" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.

The energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1–100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the overpressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Overpressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some manoeuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other manoeuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Depending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&amp;nbsp;°C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (−45&amp;nbsp;°C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the overpressure of a sonic boom.

Currently there are no industry accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom.  Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.

==Bullwhip==
[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]
The cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''"cracker"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"/&gt; The whip is probably the first human invention to break the [[sound barrier]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.  Goriely and McMillen showed that the physical explanation is complex, involving the way that a loop travels down a tapered filament under tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alain Goriely and Tyler McMillen | title = Shape of a Cracking Whip | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | year = 2002 | pages = 244301-1–244301-4 | url = http://www.e-kaczor.net/keiko/whip.pdf|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.88.244301 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88x4301G | pmid=12059302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASER)''' refers to a device that emits acoustic radiation.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pump up the volume |journal=New Scientist |date=27 March 1999 |last=Watson |first=Andrew |pages=36–41 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16121794-700-pump-up-the-volume/ |accessdate=2016-02-19 |quote=What lasers do for light, sasers promise to do for sound. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses sound waves in a way that they can serve as accurate and high-speed carriers of information in many kinds of applications—similar to uses of [[laser]] light.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Acoustic radiation ([[sound wave]]s) can be emitted by using the process of sound amplification based on [[stimulated emission]] of [[phonon]]s. Sound (or lattice vibration) can be described by a phonon just as light can be considered as [[photon]]s, and therefore one can state that SASER is the acoustic analogue of the laser.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In a SASER device, a source (e.g., an electric field as a pump) produces sound waves (lattice vibrations, phonons) that travel through an active medium. In this active medium, a stimulated emission of phonons leads to amplification of the sound waves, resulting in a sound beam coming out of the device. The sound wave beams emitted from such devices are highly [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]].

The first successful SASERs were developed in 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Terminology==
Instead of a feedback-built wave of electromagnetic radiation (i.e., a [[laser]] beam), a SASER delivers a sound wave. SASER may also be referred to as ''phonon laser'', ''acoustic laser'' or ''sound laser''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Uses and applications==
SASERs could have wide applications. Apart from facilitating the investigation of terahertz-frequency ultrasound, the SASER is also likely to find uses in [[optoelectronics]] (electronic devices that detect and control light—as a method of transmitting a signal from an end to the other of, for instance, fiber optics), as a method of signal modulation and/or transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/779.html |author1=Phil Schewe |author2=Ben Stein |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP) |work=Physics News Update |title=A New Kind of Acoustic Laser |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625182240/http://www.aip.org/pnu/2006/779.html |archivedate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such devices could be high precision measurement instruments and they could lead to high energy focused sound.

Using SASERs to manipulate electrons inside semiconductors could theoretically result in terahertz-frequency computer processors, much faster than the current chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/the-sound-laser-nanoparticles/12057/], Dario Borghino article, June 23, 2009 ; retrieved 30 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept can be more conceivable by imagining it in analogy to laser theory. [[Theodore Maiman]] operated the first functioning LASER on May 16, 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California,&lt;ref&gt;Maiman T.H, Stimulated Optical Radiation in Ruby, Nature 187,493-494|(1960) {{doi|10.1038/187493a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A device that operates according to the central idea of the "sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation" theory is the ''thermoacoustic laser''.  This is a half-open pipe with a heat differential across a special porous material inserted in the pipe. Much like a light laser, a thermoacoustic SASER has a high-Q cavity and uses a gain medium to amplify coherent waves. For further explanation see [[thermoacoustic heat engine]].

The possibility of phonon laser action had been proposed in a wide range of physical systems such as nanomechanics, [[semiconductor]]s, nanomagnets and paramagnetic ions in a lattice.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wallentowitz, W. Vogel, I. Siemers, P.E. Toschek, Phys. Rev. A 54, 943|(1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Camps, S.S. Makler, H.M. Pastawski, L.E.F.F. Torres, Phys. Rev., B 64, 125311|(2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding materials that stimulate emission was needed for the development of the SASER. The generation of coherent [[phonon]]s in a double-barrier semiconductor [[heterostructure]] was first proposed around 1990.&lt;ref&gt;E.V.Anda, S.S.Makler, H.M.Pastawski, R.G.Barrera, Braz.J. Phys. 24| 1994 330.&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of the electric potential energy in a vibrational mode of the lattice is remarkably facilitated by the electronic confinement in a double-barrier structure. On this basis, physicists were searching for materials in which stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission, is the dominant decay process. A device was first experimentally demonstrated in the Gigahertz range in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-17912_3-10267528-72.html Sonic lasers--a shot heard 'round the world] . [[CNET]].com News . By Candace Lombardi | June 18, 2009 9:02 AM PDT; retrieved 29 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Announced in 2010, two independent groups came up with two different devices that produce coherent phonons at any frequency in the range megahertz to terahertz. One group from the [[University of Nottingham]] consisted of A.J. Kent and his colleagues R.P. Beardsley, A.V. Akimov, W. Maryam and M. Henini. The other group from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) consisted of Ivan S. Grudinin, Hansuek Lee, O. Painter and Kerry J. Vahala from [[Caltech]] implemented a study on Phonon Laser Action in a tunable two-level system. The University of Nottingham device operates at about 440&amp;nbsp;GHz, while the Caltech device operates in the megahertz range.  According to a member of the Nottingham group, the two approaches are complementary and it should be possible to use one device or the other to create coherent phonons at any frequency in the megahertz to terahertz range.&lt;ref&gt;[[PhysicsWorld]] News: [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41857 Hail the first sound ‘lasers’], Feb 25, 2010; retrieved 29 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  A significant result rises from the operating frequency of these devices. The differences between the two devices suggest that SASERs could be made to operate over a wide range of frequencies.

Work on the SASER continues at the University of Nottingham, the ''Lashkarev Institute of Semiconductor Physics'' at the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], and Caltech.

==Design==

SASER's central idea is based on sound waves. The set-up needed for the implement of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is similar to an oscillator. An oscillator can produce [[oscillation]]s without any external feed-mechanism. An example is a common sound amplification system with a microphone, amplifier and speaker. When the microphone is in front of the speaker, we hear an annoying whistle. This whistle is generated without extra contribution from the sound source, and is self-reinforced and self-sufficient while the microphone is somewhere in front of the speaker.  This phenomenon, known as the [[Larsen effect]], is the result of a positive feedback.
[[File:Laser.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The analogy between a [[laser]] and a SASER device should be considered. Components of a typical laser: {{ordered list |Gain medium |Laser pumping energy |High reflector |[[Output coupler]] |Laser beam}}]]
In general, every oscillator consists of three main parts. These are the power source or pump, the amplifier and the positive feedback leading to the output. The corresponding parts in a SASER device are the excitation or pumping mechanism, the active (amplifying) medium, and the feedback leading to acoustic radiation.  Pumping can be performed, for instance, with an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators. The active medium should be a material in which sound amplification can be induced. An example of a feedback mechanism into the active medium is the existence of [[superlattice]] layers that reflect the phonons back and force them to bounce repeatedly to amplify sound.

Therefore, to proceed to an understanding of a SASER design we need to imagine it in analogy with a [[laser]] device. In a laser, the active medium is placed between two mirror surfaces (reflectors)of a [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]]. A spontaneously emitted [[photon]] inside this [[interferometer]] can force excited atoms to decay a photon of same frequency, same momentum, same polarization and same phase.  Because the momentum (as a vector) of the photon is nearly parallel to the axes of the mirrors, it is possible for photons to repeat multiple reflections and force more and more photons to follow them producing an avalanche effect. The number of photons of this coherent laser beam increases and competes the number of photons perished due to losses.  The basic necessary condition for the generation of a laser radiation is the [[population inversion]], which can be achieved either by exciting atoms and inducing percussion or by external radiation absorption. 
A SASER device mimics this procedure using a source-pump to induce a sound beam of phonons. This sound beam propagates not in an optical cavity, but in a different active medium. An example of an active medium is the superlattice. A superlattice can consist of multiple ultra-thin lattices of two different [[semiconductor]]s. These two semiconductor materials have different [[band gap]]s, and form [[quantum well]]s—which are [[potential well]]s  that confine particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In the superlattice, a new set of [[selection rules]] is composed that affects the flow-conditions of charges through the structure. When this set-up is excited by a source, the phonons start to multiply while they reflect on the lattice levels, until they escape from the lattice structure in a form of an ultrahigh frequency-phonon beam. 
 
[[File:Superlattice of semiconductor AlAs and GaAs layers.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The structure of a superlattice of semiconductor layers (AlAs, GaAs). Acoustic waves undergo amplification]]

Namely, a concerted emission of phonons can lead to coherent sound and an example of concerted phonon emission is the emission coming from quantum wells. This stands in similar paths with the laser where a coherent light can build up by the concerted stimulated emission of light from a lot of [[atom]]s. A SASER device transforms the electric potential energy in a single vibrational mode of the lattice (phonon).&lt;ref&gt;A.Watson, New Sci. 161| 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium where the amplification takes place, consists of stacks of thin layers of semiconductors that together form quantum wells. In these wells, electrons can be excited by parcels of ultrasound of milli[[electronvolts]] of energy. This amount of energy is equivalent to a frequency of 0.1 to 1 THz.

==Physics==

[[File:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Normal modes]] of [[vibration]] progression through a [[crystal]] in 1D. The amplitude of the motion has been exaggerated for ease of viewing; in an actual crystal, it is typically much smaller than the [[lattice spacing]]. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this "excitation packages" is called [[phonon]].]]

Just as light is a [[wave]] motion that is considered as composed of particles called photons, we can think of the normal modes of vibration in a solid as being particle-like. The [[quantum]] of lattice vibration is called [[phonon]]. In lattice dynamics we want to find the normal modes of vibration of a crystal. In other words, we need to calculate the energies (or frequencies ) of the phonons as a function of their wave vector's ''k'' . The relationship between [[frequency]] ''ω'' and [[wave vector]] ''k'' is called phonon dispersion.

[[Light]] and sound are similar in various ways. They both can be thought of in terms of waves, and they both come in quantum mechanical units. In the case of light we have photons while in sound we have phonons. Both sound and light can be produced as random collections of quanta (e.g. light emitted by a light bulb) or orderly waves that travel in a coordinated form (e.g. [[laser]] light). This parallelism implies that lasers should be as feasible with sound as they are with light. In the 21st century, it is easy to produce low frequency sound in the range that humans can hear (~20&amp;nbsp;kHz), in either a random or orderly form. However, at the terahertz frequencies in the regime of phonon laser applications, more difficulties arise. The problem stems from the fact that sound travels much slower than light. This means that the [[wavelength]] of sound is much shorter than light at a given frequency. Instead of resulting in orderly, coherent phonon laser structures that can produce terahertz sound, tend to emit phonons randomly. Researchers have overcome the problem of terahertz frequencies by following various approaches.  Scientists in [[Caltech]] have overcome this problem by assembling a pair of microscopic cavities that only permit specific frequencies of phonons to be emitted. This system can be also tuned to emit phonons of different frequencies by changing the relative separation of the microcavities.  On the other hand, the group from the [[University of Nottingham]] took a different approach. They have built their device out of electrons moving through a series of structures known as quantum wells. Briefly, as an electron hops from one [[quantum well]] to another neighbouring well it produces a phonon.

External energy pumping (e.g. a light beam or voltage) can help to the excitation of an electron. Relaxation of an electron from one of the upper states may occur by emission of either a photon or a phonon. This is determined by the [[density of states]] of phonons and photons. Density of states is the number of states per volume unit in an interval of energy (E, E+dE) that are available to be occupied by [[electron]]s. Both phonons and photons are [[boson]]s and thus, they obey [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]. This means that, since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, phonons and photons are [[force carrier]] particles and they have integer spins. There are more allowed states available for occupancy in a phonon field than in a photon field. Therefore, since the density of terminal states in the phonon field exceeds that in a photon field (by up to ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), phonon emission is by far the more likely event.&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Bron and W. Grill, Phys. Rev. V 40, 22, (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Glavin, V. A. Kochelap, T. L. Linnik, P. Walker, A. Kent and M. Henini, Journal of physics, con. series 92, PHONONS 012010, {{doi|10.1088/1742-6596/92/1/012010}} (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; We could also imagine a concept where the excitation of an electron briefly leads to vibration of the lattice and thus to phonon generation. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this "excitation packages" is called phonon. An electron does not stay in an excited state for too long. It readily releases energy to return to its stable low energy state. The electrons release energy in any random direction and at any time (after their excitation). At some particular times, some electrons get excited while others lose energy in a way that the average energy of system is the lowest possible.
[[File:GaAs-AlAs SL.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|GaAs/AlAs superlattice and potential profile of conduction and valence bands along the growth direction (z).]]

By pumping energy into the system we can achieve a population inversion. This means that there are more excited electrons than electrons in the lowest energy state in the system. As electron releases energy (e.g. phonon) it interacts with another excited electron to release its energy too. Therefore, we have a stimulated emission, which means a lot of energy (e.g., acoustic radiation, phonons) is released at the same time. One can mention that the stimulated emission is a procedure where we have a spontaneous and an induced emission at the same time. The induced emission comes from the pumping procedure and then is added to the spontaneous emission.

A SASER device should consist of a pumping mechanism and an active medium. The pumping procedure can be induced for example by an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators, followed by acoustic amplification in the active medium. The fact that a SASER operates on principles remarkably similar to a laser, can lead to an easier way of understanding the relevant operation circumstances. Instead of a feedback-built potent wave of electromagnetic radiation, a SASER delivers a potent sound wave. Some methods for sound amplification of GHz-THz have been proposed so far. Some have been explored only theoretically&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Komirenko, K.W. Kim, A.A. Demidenco, V.A. Kochelap, M.A. Stroscio, Phys. Rev. B 62, 7459 | (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Makler, M.I. Vasilevsky, E.V. Anda, D.E.Tuyarot, J.Weberszpil, H.M. Pastawski, J. Phys. Condens. Matter 10, 5905 |(1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and others have been explored in non-coherent experiments.

We note that acoustic waves of 100&amp;nbsp;GHz to 1 THz have wavelengths in [[nanometre]] range. Sound amplification according to the experiment taken in the [[University of Nottingham]] could be based on an induced cascade of electrons in [[semiconductor]] [[superlattice]]s. The energy levels of electrons are confined in the superlattice layers. As the electrons hop between [[gallium arsenide]] quantum wells in the superlattice they emit phonons.  Then, one phonon going in, produces two phonons coming out of the superlattice. This process can be stimulated by other phonons and then give rise to an acoustic amplification. Upon the addition of electrons, short-wavelength (in the terahertz range) phonons are produced. Since the electrons are confined to the quantum wells existing within the lattice, the transmission of their energy depends upon the phonons they generate. As these phonons strike other layers in the lattice, they excite electrons, which produce further phonons, which go on to excite more electrons, and so on. Eventually, a very narrow beam of high-frequency [[ultrasound]] exits the device. Semiconductor superlattices are used as acoustic mirrors. These superlattice structures must be in the right size obeying the theory of multilayer [[distributed Bragg reflector]], in similarity with multilayer [[dielectric mirror]]s in optics.

==Proposed schemes and devices==
Basic understanding of the SASER development requires the evaluation of some proposed examples of SASER devices and SASER theoretical schemes.

===Liquid with gas bubbles as the active medium===

In this proposed theoretical scheme,&lt;ref&gt;S.T. Zavtrak and I. V. Volkov, Zh. Tekh. Fiz. 67, 92−100(April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; the active medium is a [[liquid dielectric]] (e.g. ordinary distilled water) in which dispersed particles are uniformly distributed. Means of [[electrolysis]] cause gas bubbles that serve as the dispersed particles.   A pumped wave excited in the active medium produces a periodic variation of the volumes of the dispersed particles (gas bubbles). Since, the initial spatial distribution of the particles is uniform, the waves emitted by the particles are added with different phases and give zero on the average.  Nevertheless, if the active medium is located in a resonator, then a standing mode can be excited in it. Particles then bunch under the action of the acoustic radiation forces.  In this case, the oscillations of the bubbles are self-synchronized and the useful mode amplifies.&lt;ref&gt;K. A. Naugolnykh and L. A. Ostrovskii, ''Nonlinear Processes in Acoustics'', Nauka, Moscow, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of this with the [[Free-electron laser]] is useful to understand the theoretical concepts of the scheme.  In a FEL, electrons move through magnetic periodic systems producing electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Marshall, ''Free Electron Lasers'', Macmillan, N. Y.,(1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The radiation of the electrons is initially incoherent but then on account of the interaction with the useful electromagnetic wave they start to bunch according to phase and they become coherent. Thus, the electromagnetic field is amplified.

[[File:Electr.pumped.saser diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of an electrically pumped SASER −
The active medium is limited in a resonator by solid walls. An electromagnetic system produces a periodic electric field inducing useful acoustic mode and acoustic radiation.]]

We note that, in the case of the piezoelectric radiators usually used to generate [[ultrasound]], only the working surface radiates and therefore the working system is two-dimensional. On the other hand, a sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation device is a three-dimensional system, since the entire volume of the active medium radiates.

The active medium gas-liquid mixture fills the resonator. The bubble density in the liquid is initially distributed uniformly in space. Since the wave propagates in such a medium, the pump wave leads to the appearance of an additional quasi-periodic wave. This wave is coupled with the spatial variation of the bubble density under the action of radiation pressure forces. Hence, the wave amplitude and the bubble density vary slowly compared with the period of the oscillations.

In the theoretical scheme where the usage of resonators is essential, the SASER radiation passes through the resonator walls, which are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the pump wave. According to an example of an electrically pumped SASER,&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, ''Electrodynamics of Continuous Media'', Pergamon Press, N. Y. Russian Original, Nauka, Moscow (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; the active medium is confined between two planes, which are defined by the solid walls of the resonator. The radiation then, propagates along an axis parallel to the plane defined by the two resonator walls. The static electric field acting on the liquid with gas bubbles results in the deformation of dielectrics and therefore leads to a change in the volumes of the particles.   We note that, the electromagnetic waves in the medium propagate with a velocity much greater than the velocity of sound in the same medium. This results to the assumption that the effective pump wave acting on the bubbles does not depend on the spatial coordinates. The pressure of a wave pump in the system leads to both the appearance of a backward wave and a dynamical instability of the system.

Mathematical analyses have shown that two types of losses must be overcome for generation of oscillations to start.&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Kino, ''Acoustic Waves: Devices, Imaging and Analog Signal Processing'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Losses of the first type are associated with the dispersion of energy inside the active medium and second type losses are due to radiation losses at the ends of the resonator. These types of losses are inversely proportional to the amount of energy stored in the resonator. 
In general, the disparity of the radiators does not play a role in any attempt of a mathematical calculation of the starting conditions. Bubbles with resonance frequencies close to the pump frequency make the main contribution to the gain of the useful mode.  In contrast, the determination of the starting pressure in ordinary lasers is independent from the number of radiators.  The useful mode grows with the number of particles but sound absorption increases at the same time. Both these factors neutralize each other. Bubbles play the main role in the energy dispersion in a SASER.

A relevant suggested scheme of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation using gas bubbles as the active medium was introduced around 1995&lt;ref&gt;S.T Zavtrak, I.V. Volkov, Ultrasonics 34, Elsevier, p. 691−694, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The pumping is created by mechanical oscillations of a cylindrical resonator and the phase bunching of bubbles is realized by acoustic radiation forces. A notable fact is that gas bubbles can only oscillate under an external action, but not spontaneously. According to other proposed schemes, the [[electrostriction]] oscillations of the dispersed particle volumes in the cylindrical resonator are realized by an alternating electromagnetic field. However, a SASER scheme with an alternating electric field as the pump has a limitation. A very large amplitude of electric field (up to tens of kV/cm) is required to realize the amplification. Such values approach the electric puncture intensity of liquid dielectrics. Hence, a study proposes a SASER scheme without this limitation. The pumping is created by radial mechanical pulsations of a cylinder. This cylinder contains an active medium—a liquid dielectric with gas bubbles. The radiation emits through the faces of the cylinder.

===Narrow-gap indirect semiconductors and excitons in coupled quantum wells===

A proposal for the development of a phonon laser on resonant phonon transitions has been introduced&lt;ref&gt;Yu. E. Lozovik, S. P. Merkulova, I. V. Ovchinnikov, ''Sasers: resonant transitions in narrow-gap semiconductors and in exciton system in coupled quantum wells'', Phys. Lett. A 282, 407-414, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; from a group in Institute of Spectroscopy in Moscow, Russia.
Two schemes for steady stimulated phonon generation were mentioned. The first scheme exploits a narrow - gap indirect semiconductor or analogous indirect gap semiconductor heterostructure where the tuning into resonance of one-phonon transition of electron - hole recombination can be carried out by external pressure, magnetic or electric fields. The second scheme uses one-phonon transition between direct and indirect [[exciton]] levels in coupled [[quantum well]]s. We note that an exciton is an electrically neutral [[quasiparticle]] that describes an elementary excitation of condensed matter. It can transport energy without transporting net electric charge. The tuning into the resonance of this transition can be accomplished by engineering of dispersion of indirect exciton by external in-plane magnetic and normal electric fields. 
[[File:Brillouin zone.svg|thumb|Brillouin zones, a) in a square lattice, and b) in a hexagonal lattice]]The magnitude of phonon wave vector in the second proposed scheme, is supposed to be determined by magnitude of in-plane [[magnetic field]]. Therefore, such kind of SASER is tunable (i.e. its wavelength of operation can be altered in a controlled manner).

Common [[semiconductor]] lasers can be realised only in direct gap semiconductors. The reasoning behind that is that a pair of electron and hole near minima of their bands in an indirect gap semiconductor can recombine only with production of a phonon and a photon, due to [[energy]] and [[momentum]] [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s. This kind of process is weak in comparison with electron-hole recombination in a direct semiconductor. Consequently, the pumping of these transitions has to be very intense so as to obtain a steady laser generation. Hence, the lasing transition with production of only one particle – photon – must be resonant. This means that the lasing transition must be allowed by momentum and energy conservation laws to generate in a steady form. Photons have negligible [[wave vector]]s and therefore the band extremes have to be in the same position of the [[Brillouin zone]] . On the other hand, for devices such as SASERs, acoustic phonons have a considerable dispersion. According to dynamics, this leads to the statement that the levels on which the laser should operate, must be in the k-space relatively to each other. K-space refers to a space where things are in terms of momentum and [[frequency]] instead of position and time. The conversion between real space and k-space is a mathematical transformation called the [[Fourier transform]] and thus k-space can be also called Fourier space.

We note that, the difference in energy of the photon lasing levels has to be at least smaller than the Debye energy in the semiconductor. Here we can think of the Debye energy as the maximum energy associated with the vibrational modes of the lattice. Such levels can be formed by conduction and valence bands in narrow gap indirect semiconductors.

====Narrow-gap indirect semiconductor as a SASER system====
The energy gap in a [[semiconductor]] under the influence of pressure or magnetic field slightly varies and thus does not deserve any consideration.  On the other hand, in narrow-gap semiconductors this variation of energy is considerable and therefore external pressure or magnetic field may serve the purpose of tuning into the resonance of one-phonon interband transition. Note that interband transition is the transition between the conduction and valence band.  This scheme considers of indirect semiconductors instead of direct semiconductors.  The reasoning behind that comes from the fact that, due to the k-selection rule in semiconductors, interband transitions with the production of only one phonon can be only those that produce an optical phonon. However, optical phonons have a short life-time (they split into two due to anharmonicity) and therefore they add some important complications. Here we can note that even in the case of multi-stage process of acoustic phonon creation it is possible to create SASER.&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Makler, I. Camps, J. Weberszpil, D.E. Tuyarot, J. Phys. Cond. Matter 12, 3149, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Fokker, R. S. Meltzer, Y. P. Wang, J. I. Dijkhuis, H. W. de Wijn, Phys. Rev. B55, 2934 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Phonon dispersion relations in GaAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Dispersion relation &amp;omega;=&amp;omega;(''k'') for some waves corresponding to lattice vibrations in GaAs.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Y. Yu, Manuel Cardona, ''Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;]] Examples of narrow-gap indirect semiconductors that can be used are chalcogenides PbTe, PbSe and PbS with energy gap 0.15 – 0.3 eV. For the same scheme, the usage of a semiconductor heterostructure (layers of different semiconductors) with narrow gap indirect in momentum space between valence and conduction bands  may be more effective. This could be more promising since the spatial separation of the layers provides a possibility of tuning the interband transition into resonance by an external electric field. An essential statement here is that this proposed phonon laser can operate only if the temperature is much lower than the energy gap in the semiconductor.

During the analysis of this theoretical scheme several assumptions were introduced for simplicity reasons. The method of the pumping keeps the system electro-neutral and the dispersion laws of electrons and holes are assumed to be parabolic and isotropic. Also phonon dispersion law is required to be linear and isotropic too.&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Butov, A. V. Minstev, Yu. E. Lozovik, K. L. Campman, A. C. Gossard, Phys. Rev. B 62, 1548 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the entire system is electro-neutral, the process of pumping creates electrons and holes with the same rate. A mathematical analysis, leads to an equation for the average number of electron-hole pairs per one phonon mode per unit volume. For a low loss limit, this equation gives us a pumping rate for the SASER that is rather moderate in comparison with usual phonon [[laser]]s on a p-n transition.

====Tunable exciton transition in coupled quantum wells====
It has been mentioned that a [[quantum well]] is basically a potential well that confines particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In coupled [[quantum well]]s there are two possible ways for electrons and holes to be bound into an [[exciton]]: indirect exciton and direct exciton. In indirect exciton, electrons and holes are in different quantum wells, in contrast with direct exciton where electrons and holes are located in the same well. In a case where the quantum wells are identical, both levels have a two-fold degeneracy. Direct exciton level is lower than the level of indirect exciton because of greater Coulomb interaction. Also, indirect exciton has an electric dipole momentum normal to coupled quantum well and thus a moving indirect exciton has an in-plane magnetic momentum perpendicular to its velocity.  Any interactions of its electric dipole with normal electric field, lowers one of indirect exciton sub-levels and in sufficiently strong electric fields the moving indirect exciton becomes the ground excitonic level. Having in mind these procedures, one can select velocity to have an interaction between magnetic dipole and in-plane magnetic field. This displaces the minimum of the dispersion law away from the radiation zone. The importance of this, lies on the fact that electric and in-plane magnetic fields normal to coupled quantum wells, can control the dispersion of indirect exciton. Normal electric field is needed for tuning the transition: direct exciton --&gt; indirect exciton + phonon into resonance and its magnitude can form a linear function with the magnitude of in-plane magnetic field. 
We note that the mathematical analysis of this scheme considers of longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons instead of transverse acoustic (TA) phonons. This aims to more simple numerical estimations. Generally, the preference in transverse acoustic (TA) phonons is better because TA phonons have lower energy and the greater life-time than LA phonons. Therefore, their interaction with the electronic subsystem is weak. In addition, simpler quantitative evaluations require a pumping of direct exciton level performed by a [[laser]] [[irradiation]].

A further analysis of the scheme can help us to establish differential equations for direct exciton, indirect exciton and phonon modes. The solution of these equations gives that separately phonon and indirect exciton modes have no definite phase and only the sum of their phases is defined. The aim here is to check if the operation of this scheme with a rather moderate pumping rate can hold against the fact that excitons in coupled quantum wells have low dimensionality in comparison to phonons. Hence, phonons not confined in the coupled quantum well are considered. An example is longitudinal optical (LO) phonons that are in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Jacob, D. M. Kim, A. Bouchalkha, J. J. Sony, J. F. Klem, H. Hou, C. W. Tu, H. Morkoc, ''Solid State Commun.'' 91, 721 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus, phonons presented in this proposed system are three-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. E. Lozovik, I. V. Ovchinnikov, JETP Lett. 72 (8), 431 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in dimensionalities of phonons and excitons cause upper level to  transform into many states of phonon field. By applying this information to specific equations we can conclude to a desired result. There is no additional requirement for the laser pumping despite the difference in phonon and exciton dimensionalities.

===A tunable two-level system===

Phonon laser action has been stated in a wide range of physical systems (e.g. [[semiconductor]]s). A 2012 publication from the Department of Applied Physics in California Institute of Technology ([[Caltech]]), introduces a demonstration of a compound micro-cavity system, coupled with a radio-frequency mechanical mode, which operates in close analogy to a two level-laser system.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan S. Grudinin, Hansuek Lee, O. Painter, and Kerry J. Vahala, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 083901 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

This compound micro-cavity system can also be called "''photonic molecule''".&lt;ref&gt;M. Bayer, T. Gutbrod, J. P. Reithmaier, A. Forchel, T. L. Reinecke, P. A. Knipp, A. A. Dremin and V. D. Kulakovskii, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2582 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Barnes, S. M. Mahurin, A. Mehta, B. G. Sumpter and D. W. Noid, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 015508 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Hybridized orbitals of an electrical system are replaced by optical supermodes of this photonic molecule while the transitions between their corresponding energy levels are induced by a phonon field. For typical conditions of the optical micro-resonators, the photonic molecule behaves as a two-level laser system. Nevertheless, there is a bizarre inversion between the roles of the active medium and the cavity modes (laser field). The medium becomes purely optical and the laser field is provided by the material as a phonon mode.

An inversion produces gain, causing phonon laser action above a pump power threshold of around 7 μW. The proposed device is characterized from a continuously tunable gain [[spectrum]] that selectively amplifies mechanical modes from [[radio frequency]] to [[microwave]] rates. Viewed as Brillouin process, the system accesses a regime in which the phonon plays the role of [[Stokes wave]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. R. Shen and N. Blombergen, Phys. Rev. 137, A1787 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  Stokes wave refers to a [[non-linear]] and periodic [[surface wave]] on an [[inviscid fluid]] (ideal fluid assumed to have no viscosity) layer of constant mean depth. For this reason it should be also possible to controllably switch between phonon and phonon laser regimes.

Compound [[optical microcavity]] systems provide beneficial spectral controls. These controls impact both phonon laser action and cooling and define some finely spaced optical levels whose transition energies are proportional to phonon energies. These level spacings are continuously tunable by a significant adjustment of optical coupling. Therefore, amplification and cooling occur around a tunable line center, in contrast with some cavity optomechanical phenomena. The creation of these finely spaced levels does not require increasing the optical microcavity dimensions. Hence, these finely spaced levels do not affect the optomechanical interaction strength in a significant degree.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Dobrindt and T. J. Kippenberg, arXiv:0903.1013v1&lt;/ref&gt;  
The approach uses intermodal coupling, induced by [[radiation pressure]]&lt;ref&gt;V. B. Braginsky, S. E. Strygin and S. P. Vyatchanin, Phys. Rev. Lett. A 287, 331 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and can also provide a spectrally selective mean to detect phonons. Moreover, some evidences of intermodal cooling are observed in this kind of experiments and thus, there is an interest in optomechanical cooling.&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Kippenberg and K. J. Vahala, ''Science'' 321, 1172(2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, an extension to multilevel systems using multiple coupled resonators is possible.

[[File:Two level system.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A representation of the two level system. We can see the induced absorption, the spontaneous emission and the induced emission]]

====Two-level system====

In a two level system, the particles have only two available energy levels, separated by some energy difference:         ''ΔΕ = E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = hv'' where ''ν'' is the [[frequency]] of the associated electromagnetic wave of the photon emitted and ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. Also note: ''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''. These two levels are the excited (upper) and ground (lower) states. When a particle in the upper state interacts with a photon matching the energy separation of the levels, the particle may decay, emitting another photon with the same phase and frequency as the incident photon. Therefore, by pumping energy into the system we can have a stimulated emission of radiation—which means that the pump forces the system to release a big amount of energy at a specific time. A fundamental characteristic of lasing, like the population inversion, is not actually possible in a two-level system and therefore a two level-laser is not possible. In a two-level atom the pump is, in a way, the laser itself.

===Coherent terahertz amplification in a Stark ladder superlattice ===

The amplification of coherent terahertz sound in a Wannier-Stark ladder [[superlattice]] has been achieved in 2009 according to a paper&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Beardsley, A.V. Akimov, M. Henini and A.J. Kent, "Coherent Terahertz Sound Amplification and Spectral Line Narrowing in a Stark Ladder Superlattice", PRL 104, 085501,(2010)&lt;/ref&gt; publication from the School of Physics and Astronomy in the [[University of Nottingham]]. Wannier-Stark effect, exists in superlattices. Electron states in [[quantum well]]s respond sensitively to moderate [[electric field]]s either by the quantum confined [[Stark effect]] in the case of wide barriers or by Wannier-Stark localization in the case of a superlattice. Both effects lead to large changes of the optical properties near the absorption edge, which are useful for intensity modulation and optical switching. Namely, in a mathematical point of view, if an electric field is applied to a superlattice the relevant Hamiltonian exhibits an additional scalar potential. If an [[eigenstate]] exists, then the states corresponding to wave functions are [[eigenstates]] of the Hamiltonian as well. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier-Stark ladder.&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Glavin, V. A. Kochelap, T. L. Linnik, K. W. Kim and M. A. Stroscio, Phys. Rev. B 65, 085303 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Glavin, V. A. Kochelap and T. L. Linnik, Appl. Phys. Lett. 74, 3525 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Stimulated emission of phonons. The acoustic amplification.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Stimulated emission of phonons. As the electrons hop between GaAs and AlAs quantum wells in the superlattice they emit phonons. This process is stimulated by other phonons giving rise to the acoustic amplification]]
In the proposed scheme, an application of an electrical bias to a semiconductor superlattice is increasing the amplitude of coherent folded phonons generated by an optical pulse. This increase of the amplitude is observed for those biases in which the energy drop per period of the superlattice is greater than the phonon energy. If the superlattice is biased such that the energy drop per period of the superlattice exceeds the width of electronic minibands (Wannier-Stark regime), the electrons become localized in the quantum wells and vertical electron transport takes place via hopping between neighboring quantum wells, which may be phonon assisted.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tsu and G. Dohler, Phys. Rev. B 12, 680 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; As it had been shown previously, under these conditions stimulated phonon emission can become the dominant phonon-assisted hoping process for phonons of an energy value close to the Stark splitting.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Kini, A. J. Kent, N. M. Stanton and M. Henini, J. Appl. Phys. 98, 033514 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, coherent phonon amplification is theoretically possible in this type of system. Together with the increase in amplitude, the spectrum of the bias-induced oscillations is narrower than the spectrum of the coherent phonons at zero bias.  This shows that coherent amplification of phonons due to stimulated emission takes place in the structure under electrical pumping.

A bias voltage is applied to a weakly coupled n-doped GaAs/AlAs superlattice and increases the amplitude of the coherent hypersound oscillations generated by a femtosecond optical pulse.&lt;ref&gt;E. Makarona, B. Daly, J.-S. Im, H. Maris, A. Nurmikko and J. Han, Appl. Phys. Lett. 81, 2791 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; An evidence of hypersound amplification by stimulated emission of phonons emerges, in a system where the inversion of the electron populations for phonon-assisted transitions exists. This evidence is provided by the bias-induced amplitude increase and experimentally observer spectral narrowing of the superlattice phonon mode with a frequency of 441&amp;nbsp;GHz.

The main target of this type of experiments is to highlight the realization probability of a coherent amplification of THz sound.  The THz stimulated phonon induced transitions between the electron superlattice states lead to this coherent amplification while processing a [[population inversion]].

An essential step towards coherent generation ("sasing") of THz sound and other active hypersound devices has been provided by this achievement of THz sound amplification. Generally, in a device where the threshold for "sasing" is achieved, the technique described by this proposed scheme could be used to measure the coherence time of the emitted hypersound.

{{Infobox tennessine}}

'''Tennessine''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ts''' and [[atomic number]] 117. It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] of the [[periodic table]].

The discovery of tennessine was officially announced in [[Dubna]], Russia, by a Russian–American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element {{As of|2018|lc=y}}. One of its [[daughter isotope]]s was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the results of the experiment. The experiment itself was repeated successfully by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German–American team in May 2014. In December 2015, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party|Joint Working Party]] of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]], which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements, recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian–American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers had suggested the name ''tennessine'' after [[Tennessee]], United States&lt;!--PLEASE, IF YOU MEAN TO WRITE "THE U.S. STATE OF TENNESSEE", DON'T. THE IUPAC AND THE DISCOVERERS WANT TO NAME IT AFTER THE REGION, NOT THE STATE (WHICH, DESPITE HAVING SAME GEOGRAPHICAL BORDERS, ARE NOT THE SAME, CHECK OUT DEFINITIONS OF BOTH "STATE" AND "REGION"). THE NOTE HERE IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT AS WELL; IF YOU CAN SUGGEST A BETTER WAY TO DO SO, PLEASE DO.--&gt;.{{efn|The declaration by the IUPAC mentioned "the contribution of the Tennessee ''region'' (emphasis added), including [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], [[Vanderbilt University]], and the [[University of Tennessee]] at [[Knoxville]], to superheavy element research, including the production and chemical separation of unique actinide target materials for superheavy element synthesis at ORNL’s [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) and Radiochemical Engineering Development Center (REDC)".|name=fn1}} In November 2016&lt;!-- not "November 28": keep date formatting throughout the article consistent (currently "month year"; there's no real need for the exact dates) --&gt;, they officially adopted the name "tennessine".&lt;!-- no refs needed here. The refs can be, should be and are located in the appropriate section. --&gt;

Tennessine may be located in the "[[island of stability]]", a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable compared to an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of [[millisecond]]s. In the periodic table, tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17, all other members of which are [[halogens]].{{efn|The term "[[group (periodic table)|group]] 17" refers to a column in the periodic table starting with [[fluorine]] and is distinct from "halogen", which relates to a common set of chemical and physical properties shared by fluorine, [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]], all of which precede tennessine in group 17. Unlike the other group 17 members, tennessine may not be a halogen.&lt;ref name="notgonnabeahalogen"/&gt;}} Some of its properties may significantly differ from those of the halogens due to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]]. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile [[metal]] that neither forms [[anion]]s nor achieves high [[oxidation state]]s. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first [[ionization energy]], are nevertheless expected to follow the [[periodic trends]] of the halogens.

{{see also|Timeline of chemical element discoveries}}

===Pre-discovery===
In December 2004, the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) team in [[Dubna]], [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia, proposed a joint experiment with the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]], United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 [[proton]]s in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Their proposal involved [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] a [[berkelium]] (element 97) target and a [[calcium]] (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei:&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite web |title = International team discovers element 117|date = 2010|last = Cabage|first = B.|publisher = [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]|url = http://web.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v43_2_10/article02.shtml|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175349/http://web.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v43_2_10/article02.shtml|archive-date=2015-09-23|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of [[actinide]] targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements [[nihonium|113]]–[[livermorium|116]] and [[oganesson|118]]. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production,&lt;ref name="elements" /&gt; and re-initiating it would be too costly.&lt;ref name="vanderbilt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2010/04/vanderbilt-physicist-plays-pivotal-role-in-discovery-of-new-super-heavy-element-112107/|title=Vanderbilt physicist plays pivotal role in discovery of new super-heavy element|publisher=Vanderbilt University|year=2010|accessdate=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a [[californium]] target with calcium.&lt;ref name="pp2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Utyonkov|first2=V.

Ts.|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: it would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which berkelium could be extracted.&lt;ref name="vanderbilt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InsideScience"/&gt;

The JINR team sought to use berkelium because [[calcium-48]], the [[isotopes of calcium|isotope of calcium]] used in the beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; and it is the lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, [[palladium-110]] (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after [[island of stability]].{{efn|Although stable isotopes of the lightest elements usually have a neutron–proton ratio close or equal to one (for example, the only stable isotope of [[aluminium]] has 13 protons and 14 neutrons,&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt; making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.077), stable isotopes of heavier elements have higher neutron–proton ratios, increasing with the number of protons. For example, [[iodine]]'s only stable isotope has 53 protons and 74 neutrons, giving neutron–proton ratio of 1.396, [[gold]]'s only stable isotope has 79 protons and 118 neutrons, yielding a neutron–proton ratio of 1.494, and [[plutonium]]'s most stable isotope has 94 protons and 150 neutrons, and a neutron–proton ratio of 1.596.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"/&gt; This trend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00047-3_6|chapter=Superheavy Nuclei: Decay and Stability|title=Exciting Interdisciplinary Physics|series=FIAS Interdisciplinary Science Series|pages=69|year=2013|last1=Karpov|first1=A.

In February 2005, the leader of the JINR team—[[Yuri Oganessian]]—presented a colloquium at ORNL. Also in attendance were representatives of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who had previously worked with JINR on the discovery of elements 113–116 and 118, and Joseph Hamilton of [[Vanderbilt University]], a collaborator of Oganessian.&lt;ref name=Oganessian/&gt;

Hamilton checked if the ORNL high-flux reactor produced californium for a commercial order: the required berkelium could be obtained as a by-product. He learned that it did not and there was no expectation for such an order in the immediate future. Hamilton kept monitoring the situation, making the checks once in a while. (Later, Oganessian referred to Hamilton as "the father of 117" for doing this work.)&lt;ref name=Oganessian&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/what-it-takes-to-make-a-new-element/1017677.article|title=What it takes to make a new element|newspaper=Chemistry World|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
ORNL resumed californium production in spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart during the summer and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/deleted-scenes/backstory-behind-new-element|title=The backstory behind a new element|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|year=2010|website=Science News|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a September 2008 symposium at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL).&lt;ref name="symposiumintro"&gt;{{cite report|title=How Scientists Plan To Enshrine Tennessee On The Periodic Table Of Elements|url=http://nashvillepublicradio.org/post/how-scientists-plan-enshrine-tennessee-periodic-table-elements|author=Emily Siner|publisher=National Public Radio|year=2016|accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt;&lt;ref name="InsideScience" /&gt; the team at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) in [[Livermore, California|Livermore]], [[California]], U.S., was soon invited to join.&lt;ref name="discoveryornl"&gt;{{cite report|title=The Discovery of Element 117|url=http://www.fornl.info/Presentations/Discovery%20of%20Element%20117%20final.pdf|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021230058/http://www.fornl.info/Presentations/Discovery%20of%20Element%20117%20final.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-21|author=James Roberto|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|year=2010|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Berkelium.jpg|thumb|left|The berkelium target used for the synthesis (in solution)|alt=A very small sample of a blue liquid in a plastic pipette held by a hand wearing heavy protection equipment]]
In November 2008, the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]], which had oversight over the [[High Flux Isotope Reactor|reactor in Oak Ridge]], allowed the scientific use of the extracted berkelium.&lt;ref name="discoveryornl" /&gt; The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008,&lt;ref name="forthepress"/&gt; resulting in 22&amp;nbsp;milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment.&lt;ref name="eurekalert" /&gt; In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor;&lt;ref name="discoveryornl" /&gt; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days.&lt;ref name="InsideScience" /&gt; Its [[half-life]] is only 330&amp;nbsp;days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have [[radioactive decay|decayed]]. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, it had to be completed within six months of its departure from the United States.&lt;ref name="InsideScience"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Atom at the End of the Material World |year=2010 |first=J.

In May 2016, [[Lund University]] ([[Lund]], [[Scania]], Sweden) and GSI cast some doubt on the syntheses of elements 115 and 117. The decay chains assigned to &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;115, the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of elements 115 and 117, were found to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability. The reported &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;117 decay chains approved as such by the JWP were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different isotopes of element 117. It was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;117 and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;115 probably did not exist. (On the other hand, the chains from the non-approved isotope &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;117 were found to be [[wikt:congruent|congruent]].) The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even–even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticized the JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and noted that the fact that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of elements 115 and 117 was an almost certainly non-existent link was "problematic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forsberg |first=U. |last2=Rudolph |first2=D. |first3=C. |last3=Fahlander |first4=P. |last4=Golubev |first5=L.

On June 8, 2017, two members of the Dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms, analysing their data on the nuclides &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;117 and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;115 with widely accepted statistical methods, noted that the 2016 studies indicating non-congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay: they excluded from the 90% confidence interval both average and extreme decay times, and the decay chains that would be excluded from the 90% confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included. The 2017 reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;117 and &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;115 were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain, although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Am+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zlokazov |first1=V.

=== Naming ===
[[File:CorneliusVanderbiltStatue.JPG|thumb|left|Main campus of Hamilton's workplace of Vanderbilt University, one of the institutions named as co-discoverers of tennessine]]
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], element 117 should be known as ''eka-[[astatine]]''. Using the 1979 [[systematic element name|recommendations]] by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), the element was [[placeholder name|temporarily called]] ''ununseptium'' (symbol ''Uus'') until its discovery was confirmed and a permanent name chosen; the temporary name was formed from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots "one", "one", and "seven", a reference to the element's atomic number of 117.&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl.

After the original synthesis in 2010, [[Dawn Shaughnessy]] of LLNL and Oganessian declared that naming was a sensitive question, and it was avoided as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientists Discover Heavy New Element|author = Glanz, J. |url = http://chemistry.oregonstate.edu/courses/ch121-3/ch123/ch123latestnews/ch123ln.htm|publisher = [[Oregon State University]], Department of Chemistry|year=2010|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hamilton declared that year, "I was crucial in getting the group together and in getting the &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk target essential for the discovery. As a result of that, I’m going to get to name the element. I can’t tell you the name, but it will bring distinction to the region."&lt;ref name="vanderbilt.edu"/&gt; (Hamilton teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.)

=== Nuclear stability and isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of tennessine}}
{{see also|Island of stability}}

The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after [[curium]], element 96, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above [[mendelevium|101]] undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after [[lead]]) have stable isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Marcillac |first1=P. |last2=Coron |first2=N. |last3=Dambier |first3=G. |last4=Leblanc |first4=J. |last5=Moalic |first5=J.-P. |displayauthors=3 |date=2003 |title=Experimental detection of α-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth |journal=Nature |volume=422 |pages=876–878 |pmid=12712201 |doi=10.1038/nature01541 |issue=6934 |bibcode=2003Natur.422..876D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the [[strong nuclear force]] cannot hold the nucleus together against [[spontaneous fission]] for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than [[lawrencium|103 protons]] should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]] around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an "[[island of stability]]" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the [[superheavy element]]s (including tennessine) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Van Nostrand's scientific encyclopedia |first1=G.

It has been calculated that the isotope &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Ts would have a half-life of about 18 [[millisecond]]s, and it may be possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts.

Tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below the five halogens; [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and astatine, each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of {{Nowrap|''n''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sterling Dictionary Of Chemistry|url = https://books.google.ru/books?id=SvSmSYC6lW0C|publisher = Sterling Publishers Pvt.

Hence the notation {{Nowrap|''n''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}} means that the valence shells of lighter group 17 elements are composed of two s electrons and five p electrons, all located in the outermost electron energy level.}} For tennessine, being in the seventh [[period (chemistry)|period]] (row) of the periodic table, continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of {{Nowrap|7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state. However, going down group 17, the metallicity of the elements increases; for example, iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state, and astatine is often classified as a [[metalloid]] due to its properties being quite far from those of the four previous halogens. As such, an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict tennessine to be a rather volatile [[post-transition metal]].&lt;ref name=GSI/&gt;

Calculations have confirmed the accuracy of this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short.&lt;ref name=GSI/&gt; Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to [[spin–orbit interaction]]&amp;nbsp;— the mutual interaction between the motion and [[spin (physics)|spin]] of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster&amp;nbsp;— at velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]]&amp;nbsp;— than those in lighter atoms.{{sfn|Thayer|2010|pp=63–64}} In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels,&lt;!-- |level is an important word. Lv has no 8s electrons but they've been shown to affect its chemistry--&gt; stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four.&lt;ref name="Faegri"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fægri Jr. | first1 = K. | last2 = Saue | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1063/1.1385366 | title = Diatomic molecules between very heavy elements of group 13 and group 17: A study of relativistic effects on bonding | journal = The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 2456 | year = 2001|bibcode = 2001JChPh.115.2456F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the [[inert pair effect]]; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second ([[azimuthal quantum number|azimuthal]]) [[quantum number]] ''l'' from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively.{{sfn|Thayer|2010|pp=63–67}}{{efn|The quantum number corresponds to the letter in the electron orbital name: 0 to s, 1 to p, 2 to d, etc. See [[azimuthal quantum number]] for more information.}} For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as {{Nowrap|7s{{su|p=2|w=70%}}7p{{su|b=1/2|p=2|w=70%}}7p{{su|b=3/2|p=3|w=70%}}}}.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt;

Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; and six being 6d&lt;sub&gt;5/2&lt;/sub&gt;) are both raised, so they are close in energy to the 7s ones,&lt;ref name="Faegri" /&gt; although no 6d electron chemistry has been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; levels is abnormally high; 9.8&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]].&lt;ref name="Faegri" /&gt; Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8&amp;nbsp;eV,&lt;ref name="Faegri" /&gt; and its 6p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; chemistry has already been called "limited".{{sfn|Thayer|2010|p=79}} These effects cause tennessine's chemistry to differ from those of its upper neighbors (see [[#Chemical|below]]).

Tennessine's first [[ionization energy]]—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 7.7&amp;nbsp;eV, lower than those of the halogens, again following the trend.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt;  Like its neighbors in the periodic table, tennessine is expected to have the lowest [[electron affinity]]—energy released when an electron is added to the atom—in its group; 2.6 or 1.8&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; The electron of the hypothetical [[hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like]] tennessine atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts&lt;sup&gt;116+&lt;/sup&gt;—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.9 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature attributable to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]]. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08.{{sfn|Thayer|2010|p=64}} Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of [[atomic radius]].{{sfn|Thayer|2010|p=64}} Advanced calculations show that the radius of an tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], while that of astatine would be 147&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pyykkö | first1 = P.  | last2 = Atsumi | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1002/chem.200800987 | title = Molecular Single-Bond Covalent Radii for Elements 1-118 | journal = Chemistry: A European Journal | volume = 15 | pages = 186–197 | date = 2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seven outermost electrons removed, tennessine is finally smaller; 57&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; for tennessine and 61&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;ref name="India" /&gt; for astatine.

The known isotopes of tennessine, &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Ts and &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts, are too short-lived to allow for chemical experimentation at present. Nevertheless, many chemical properties of tennessine have been calculated.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior common to the halogens.&lt;ref name="notgonnabeahalogen"&gt;{{Cite web|author=&lt;!--no author; by design--&gt;|title = Superheavy Element 117 Confirmed - On the Way to the "Island of Stability"|url =https://www.superheavies.de/english/research_program/highlights_element_117.htm#Is%20Element%20117%20a%20Metal|publisher= GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable [[electronic configuration]] of a [[noble gas]], obtaining eight electrons ([[octet rule|octet]]) in their valence shells instead of seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bader |first=R. F. W. |url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/ |title=An introduction to the electronic structure of atoms and molecules |publisher=McMaster University |accessdate=2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing group 17 element to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 is expected to be the least common.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; The [[standard reduction potential]] of the Ts/Ts&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; couple is predicted to be −0.25&amp;nbsp;V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should not be reduced to the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all the previous halogens.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt;

There is another opportunity for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a [[covalent bond]]. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet they are expected to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a [[diatomic molecule]]. Such molecules are commonly bound via single [[sigma bond]]s between the atoms; these are different from [[pi bond]]s, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great [[antibonding]] character in the At&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt;{{sfn|Pershina|2010|p=504}} The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.{{sfn|Pershina|2010|p=504}}

Aside from the unstable −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration;&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; astatine shows similar effects.{{sfn|Thayer|2010|p=84}} The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons.&lt;ref name="Seaborg" /&gt; The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons are oppositely stabilized.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized,&lt;!-- While the inert pair effect is the one working here, we can go without it. The whole thing is just a part of the SO interactions the text is mostly talking about. In the contexts not requiring advanced SO talks (indium, lead), the mention of the more obvious inert pair is really enough. Here the context is different than those. We do mention that before --&gt; it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.&lt;ref name="trifluoride" /&gt;

The simplest possible tennessine compound would be the monohydride, TsH. The bonding is expected to be provided by a 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; [[spinor]] is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds.&lt;ref name="117H" /&gt; Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; spinor is responsible for bonding.{{sfn|Stysziński|2010|pp=144–146}} This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17&amp;nbsp;picometers compared with the overall length of 195&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="117H"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |title=Spin-orbit effects on the transactinide p-block element monohydrides MH (M=element 113-118) |display-authors=3 |last=Han |first=Y.-K. |last2=Bae |first2=Cheolbeom |last3=Son |first3=Sang-Kil |last4=Lee |first4=Yoon Sup |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=2684–2691 |date=2000 |bibcode=2000JChPh.112.2684H |doi=10.1063/1.480842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions.&lt;ref name="117H" /&gt; The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH.&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; The molecules [[thallium|Tl]]Ts and [[Nihonium|Nh]]Ts may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element's p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small [[electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67&amp;nbsp;[[debye (unit)|D]],{{efn|For comparison, the values for the ClF, HCl, SO, HF, and HI molecules are 0.89&amp;nbsp;D, 1.11&amp;nbsp;D, 1.55&amp;nbsp;D, 1.83&amp;nbsp;D, and 1.95&amp;nbsp;D. Values for molecules which do not form at [[standard conditions]], namely GeSe, SnS, TlF, BaO, and NaCl, are 1.65&amp;nbsp;D, ~3.2&amp;nbsp;D, 4.23&amp;nbsp;D, 7.95&amp;nbsp;D, and 9.00&amp;nbsp;D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D.

For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80&amp;nbsp;D.{{sfn|Stysziński|2010|pp=139–146}} The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more [[ionic bond|ionic]] character.&lt;ref name="117H" /&gt; Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.&lt;ref name="117H" /&gt;

[[VSEPR theory]] predicts a [[T-shaped molecular geometry|bent-T-shaped]] [[molecular geometry]] for the group 17 trifluorides. All known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—a central atom, denoted A, surrounded by three [[ligand]]s, X, and two unshared [[electron pair]]s, E. If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; should follow its lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, predicting instead a [[trigonal planar molecular geometry]] (AX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). This shows that VSEPR theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements.&lt;ref name="trifluoride"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bae | first1 = Ch.| last2 = Han | first2 = Y.-K. | last3 = Lee | first3 = Yo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17631">The '''toric code''' is a [[topological order|topological]] [[quantum error correction|quantum error correcting code]], and an example of a [[stabilizer code]], defined on a two-dimensional [[Spin (physics)|spin]] [[Planar graph|lattice]] &lt;ref&gt;A. Y. Kitaev, Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference of Quantum Communication and Measurement, Ed. O. Hirota, [[Alexander Holevo|A. S. Holevo]], and C. M. Caves (New York, Plenum, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest and most well studied of the quantum double models.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kitaev, Ann. Phys. '''321''', 2 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also the simplest example of [[topological order]]—''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; topological order
(first studied in the context of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[spin liquid]] in 1991).&lt;ref&gt;N. Read and Subir Sachdev, Large-N expansion for frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, [http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.1773, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 1773 (1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Xiao-Gang Wen]], Mean Field Theory of Spin Liquid States with Finite Energy Gaps and Topological Orders, [http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.44.2664 Phys. Rev. B44, 2664 (1991)].&lt;/ref&gt;  The toric code can also be considered to be a ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[lattice gauge theory]] in a particular limit.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fradkin and S. Shenker, Phys. Rev. D 19, 3682–3697 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Alexei Kitaev]].

The toric code gets its name from its periodic boundary conditions, giving it the shape of a [[torus]]. These conditions give the model translational invariance, which is useful for analytic study. However, experimental realization requires open boundary conditions, allowing the system to be embedded on a 2D surface. The resulting code is typically known as the planar code. This has identical behaviour to the toric code in most, but not all, cases.

==Error correction and computation==

The toric code is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, usually chosen to be the [[square lattice]], with a [[spin-½]] degree of freedom located on each edge. They are chosen to be periodic. [[Stabilizer code|Stabilizer]] operators are defined on the spins around each vertex &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; and plaquette{{definition needed|date=June 2018}} (or face){{clarify|date=June 2018}} &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; of the lattice as follows,

&lt;math&gt;
A_v = \prod_{i \in v} \sigma^x_i, \,\, B_p = \prod_{i \in p} \sigma^z_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

Where here we use &lt;math&gt; i \in v &lt;/math&gt; to denote the edges touching the vertex &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; i \in p &lt;/math&gt; to denote the edges surrounding the plaquette &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;. The stabilizer space of the code is that for which all stabilizers act trivially, hence,

&lt;math&gt;
A_v | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle, \,\, \forall v, \,\, B_p | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle, \,\, \forall p,
&lt;/math&gt;

for any state &lt;math&gt; | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. For the toric code, this space is four-dimensional, and so can be used to store two [[qubits]] of [[quantum information]]. This can be proven by considering the number of independent stabilizer operators. The occurrence of errors will move the state out of the stabilizer space, resulting in vertices and plaquettes for which the above condition does not hold. The positions of these violations is the [[Syndrome decoding|syndrome]] of the code, which can be used for error correction.

[[File:ToricCodeLattice.png|thumb|250px|A section of the toric code. A vertex and plaquette are highlighted, along with the spins used in the definition of their stabilizers.]]

The unique nature of the topological codes, such as the toric code, is that stabilizer violations can be interpreted as [[quasiparticles]]. Specifically, if the code is in a state &lt;math&gt; | \phi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; such that,

&lt;math&gt; A_v | \phi \rangle = - | \phi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;,

a quasiparticle known as an &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; [[anyon]] can be said to exist on the vertex &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt;. Similarly violations of the &lt;math&gt;B_p&lt;/math&gt; are associated with so called &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; anyons on the plaquettes. The stabilizer space therefore corresponds to the anyonic vacuum. Single spin errors cause pairs of anyons to be created and transported around the lattice.

When errors create an anyon pair and move the anyons, one can imagine a path connecting the two composed of all links acted upon. If the anyons then meet and are annihilated, this path describes a loop. If the loop is topologically trivial, it has no effect on the stored information. The annihilation of the anyons, in this case, corrects all of the errors involved in their creation and transport. However, if the loop is topologically non-trivial, though re-annihilation of the anyons returns the state to the stabilizer space it also implements a logical operation on the stored information. The errors, in this case, are therefore not corrected but consolidated.

[[File:ToricCodeTorus.png|thumb|250px|The topologically nontrivial loops of the torus. Moving anyons along these implement logical Pauli operators on the stored qubits.]]

Let us consider the noise model for which bit and phase errors occur independently on each spin, both with probability ''p''. When ''p'' is low, this will create sparsely distributed pairs of anyons which have not moved far from their point of creation. Correction can be achieved by identifying the pairs that the anyons were created in (up to an equivalence class), and then re-annihilating them to remove the errors. As ''p'' increases, however, it becomes more ambiguous as to how the anyons may be paired without risking the formation of topologically non-trivial loops. This gives a threshold probability, under which the error correction will almost certainly succeed. Through a mapping to the random-bond Ising model, this critical probability has been found to be around 11%.&lt;ref&gt;E. Dennis, A. Kitaev, A. Landahl, J. Preskill, J. Math. Phys. '''43''', 4452 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other error models may also be considered, and thresholds found. In all cases studied so far, the code has been found to saturate the [[Hashing bound]]. For some error models, such as biased errors where bit errors occur more often than phase errors or vice versa, lattices other than the square lattice must be used to achieve the optimal thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;B. Roethlisberger, et al. Phys. Rev. A '''85''', 022313 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Bombin, et al. Phys. Rev. X '''2''', 021004 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

These thresholds are upper limits and are useless unless efficient algorithms are found to achieve them. The most well-used algorithm is  [[Edmonds's matching algorithm|minimum weight perfect matching]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, Jack (1965). "Paths, trees, and flowers". Can. J. Math. '''17''': 449–467.&lt;/ref&gt; When applied to the noise model with independent bit and flip errors, a threshold of around 10.5% is achieved. This falls only a little short of the 11% maximum. However, matching does not work so well when there are correlations between the bit and phase errors, such as with depolarizing noise.

The means to perform [[quantum computation]] on logical information stored within the toric code has been considered, with the properties of the code providing fault-tolerance.  It has been shown that extending the stabilizer space using 'holes', vertices or plaquettes on which stabilizers are not enforced, allows many qubits to be encoded into the code.  However, a universal set of unitary [[Quantum gate|gates]] cannot be fault-tolerantly implemented by unitary operations and so additional techniques are required to achieve quantum computing.  For example, universal quantum computing can be achieved by preparing magic states via encoded quantum stubs called tidBits used to teleport in the required additional gates when replaced as a qubit.  Furthermore, preparation of magic states must be fault tolerant, which can be achieved by magic state distillation on noisy magic states.  A [[One-way quantum computer|measurement based]] scheme for quantum computation based upon this principle has been found, whose error threshold is the highest known for a two-dimensional architecture.&lt;ref&gt;R. Raussendorf, J. Harrington, Phys. Rev. Lett. '''98''', 190504 (2007); R. Raussendorf, J. Harrington and K. Goyal, New J. Phys. '''9''', 199, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamiltonian and self-correction==

Since the stabilizer operators of the toric code are quasilocal, acting only on spins located near each other on a two-dimensional lattice, it is not unrealistic to define the following Hamiltonian,

&lt;math&gt;
H_{TC} = - J\sum_v A_v - J\sum_p B_p, \,\,\, J&gt;0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The ground state space of this Hamiltonian is the stabilizer space of the code. Excited states correspond to those of anyons, with the energy proportional to their number. Local errors are therefore energetically suppressed by the gap, which has been shown to be stable against local perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bravyi, M. Hastings and S. Michalakis, J. Math. Phys. '''51''', 093512 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dynamic effects of such perturbations can still cause problems for the code.&lt;ref&gt;F. Pastawski, A. Kay, N. Schuch, I. Cirac, arXiv:0911.3843 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Freeman, C. M. Herdman, D. M. Gorman, K. B. Whaley, Phys. Rev. B '''90''', 134302 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The gap also gives the code a certain resilience against thermal errors, allowing it to be correctable almost surely for a certain critical time. This time increases with &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt;, but since arbitrary increases of this coupling are unrealistic, the protection given by the Hamiltonian still has its limits.

The means to make the toric code, or the planar code, into a fully self-correcting quantum memory is often considered. Self-correction means that the Hamiltonian will naturally suppress errors indefinitely, leading to a lifetime that diverges in the thermodynamic limit. It has been found that this is possible in the toric code only if long range interactions are present between anyons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hamma, C. Castelnovo, C. Chamon, Phys. Rev. B '''79''', 245122 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Chesi, B. Rothlisberger, D. Loss, Phys. Rev. A '''82''', 022305 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals have been made for realization of these in the lab &lt;ref&gt;F. Pedrocchi, et al., Phys. Rev. B '''83''', 115415 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the generalization of the model to higher dimensions, with self-correction possible in 4D with only quasi-local interactions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Alicki, et al., Open Syst. Inf. Dyn. '''17''', 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anyon model==

As mentioned above, so called &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; quasiparticles are associated with the vertices and plaquettes of the model, respectively. These quasiparticles can be described as [[anyons]], due to the non-trivial effect of their braiding. Specifically, though both species of anyons are bosonic with respect to themselves, the braiding of two &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt;'s or &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt;'s having no effect, a full monodromy of an &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; will yield a phase of &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Such a result is not consistent with either [[bosonic]] or [[fermionic]] [[spin-statistics theorem|statistics]], and hence is anyonic.

The anyonic mutual statistics of the quasiparticles demonstrate the logical operations performed by topologically non-trivial loops. Consider the creation of a pair of &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; anyons followed by the transport of one around a topologically nontrivial loop, such as that shown on the torus in blue on the figure above, before the pair are reannhilated. The state is returned to the stabilizer space, but the loop implements a logical operation on one of the stored qubits. If &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; anyons are similarly moved through the red loop above a logical operation will also result. The phase of &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt;/math&gt; resulting when braiding the anyons shows that these operations do not commute, but rather anticommute. They may therefore be interpreted as logical &lt;math&gt; Z &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; Pauli operators on one of the stored qubits. The corresponding logical Pauli's on the other qubit correspond to an &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; anyon following the blue loop and an &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; anyon following the red. No braiding occurs when &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; pass through parallel paths, the phase of &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt;/math&gt; therefore does not arise and the corresponding logical operations commute. This is as should be expected since these form operations acting on different qubits.

Due to the fact that both &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; anyons can be created in pairs, it is clear to see that both these quasiparticles are their own antiparticles. A composite particle composed of two &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; anyons is therefore equivalent to the vacuum, since the vacuum can yield such a pair and such a pair will annihilate to the vacuum. Accordingly, these composites have bosonic statistics, since their braiding is always completely trivial. A composite of two &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; anyons is similarly equivalent to the vacuum. The creation of such composites is known as the fusion of anyons, and the results can be written in terms of fusion rules. In this case, these take the form,

&lt;math&gt;
e \times e = 1, \,\,\, m \times m = 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; denotes the vacuum. A composite of an &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; is not trivial. This therefore constitutes another quasiparticle in the model, sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;, with fusion rule,

&lt;math&gt;
e \times m = \psi.
&lt;/math&gt;

From the braiding statistics of the anyons we see that, since any single exchange of two &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;'s will involve a full monodromy of a constituent &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt;, a phase of &lt;math&gt; -1 &lt;/math&gt; will result. This implies fermionic self-statistics for the &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;'s.

==Generalizations==

The use of a torus is not required to form an error correcting code. Other surfaces may also be used, with their topological properties determining the degeneracy of the stabilizer space. In general, quantum error correcting codes defined on two-dimensional spin lattices according to the principles above are known as surface codes.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ghosh, A. G. Fowler and M. R. Geller, [http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062318 Phys. Rev. A '''86''', 062318 (2012)].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to define similar codes using higher-dimensional spins. These are the quantum double models&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Bullock and G. K. Brennen, J. Phys. A '''40''', 3481-3505 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[string-net liquid|string-net]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levin, Michael A. and Xiao-Gang Wen |title=String-net condensation: A physical mechanism for topological phases |journal=Physical Review B |volume=71 |issue=45110 |pages=21 |date=12 January 2005|arxiv=cond-mat/0404617 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.71.045110 |bibcode=2005PhRvB..71d5110L }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow a greater richness in the behaviour of anyons, and so may be used for more advanced quantum computation and error correction proposals.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Wootton, V. Lahtinen, B. Doucot and J. K. Pachos, arXiv:0908.0708 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; These not only include models with Abelian anyons, but also those with non-Abelian statistics.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aguado, G. K. Brennen, F. Verstraete and J. I. Cirac, Rev. Lett. '''101''', 260501 (2008); G. K. Brennen, M. Aguado, and J. I. Cirac, New J. Phys. '''11''', 053009 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental progress==

The most explicit demonstration of the properties of the toric code has been in state based approaches. Rather than attempting to realize the
Hamiltonian, these simply prepare the code in the stabilizer space. Using this technique, experiments have been able to demonstrate the creation, transport and statistics of the anyons.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Pachos, W. Wieczorek, et al., New J. Phys. '''11''', 083010 (2009); C.-Y. Lu, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. '''102''', 030502 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent experiments have also been able to demonstrate the error correction properties of the code.&lt;ref&gt;Xing-Can Yao et al., Nature '''482''', 489-494 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

For realizations of the toric code and its generalizations with a Hamiltonian, much progress has been made using [[Josephson junctions]]. The theory of how the Hamiltonians may be implemented has been developed for a wide class of topological codes.&lt;ref&gt;B. Doucot, L. B. Ioffe and J. Vidal, Phys. Rev. B '''69''', 214501 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment has also been performed, realizing the toric code Hamiltonian for a small lattice, and demonstrating the quantum memory provided by its degenerate ground state.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gladchenko, D. Olaya, E. Dupont-Ferrier, B. Doucot, L. B. Ioffe, M. E. Gershenson, Nat. Phys. '''5''', 48 - 53 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theoretical work towards experimental realizations is based on cold atoms. A toolkit of methods that may be used to realize topological codes with optical lattices has been explored, 
&lt;ref&gt;A. Micheli, G. K. Brennen and P. Zoller, Nat. Phys. '''2''', 341 - 347 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; as have experiments concerning minimal instances of topological order.&lt;ref&gt;B. Paredes and I. Bloch, Phys. Rev. A, '''77''', 023603 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Progress is also being made into simulations of the toric model with [[Rydberg atoms]], in which the Hamiltonian and the effects of dissipative noise can be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;H, Weimer, M. Müller, I. Lesanovsky, P. Zoller and H. P. Büchler, Nat. Phys. '''6''', 382 - 388 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''Trespa''' is the brand name of a type of high-pressure [[laminate]] (HPL) plate manufactured by Trespa International BV, based in [[Weert]], the Netherlands. Their panels are used for exterior cladding, decorative facades and interior surfaces. It is composed of woodbased fibres or [[Kraft paper]] with [[phenolic resin]] applied.

==History==
The company was founded by Hermann Krages (1909-1992), the son of a [[Bremen]] merchant in wood and [[fibreboard]] and the brother of the racer [[Louis Krages]]. He is known mostly today for his speculation on the German stock market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45140359.html Hermann Krages, with photo] in [[Der Spiegel]]&lt;/ref&gt; Krages initially was given a fiberboard plant in the [[Ore Mountains]] of [[East Prussia]] by his father, which he lost at the end of WWII. He then moved to [[Scheuerfeld]] where he acquired the Berger paper mill and began the "Deutsche Duroleum Gesellschaft", making fiberboard plates again. He expanded with new factories in [[Etzbach]], [[Höxter an der Weser]], [[Leutkirch im Allgäu]] and in Bremen. The company in Weert was founded in 1960.

Initially the company focused mainly on the sale and storage of panels produced in the German plant at Leutkirch. Gradually it switched to the production of hardboard for mattresses. This activity was later incorporated into the company Thermopal after Krages sold his holdings due to his stock market speculation in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45124285.html Krages losses on the stock market in 1962] in Der Spiegel&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 the name changed to "Weerter Plastics Industry" (“Weerter Kunststoffen Fabrieken”, or WKF). In 1967, the company was acquired by [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]], which used its product for surfaces in its laboratories. In 1991 the company passed to HAL Holding NV.

==Manufacture==
Trespa plate is made by compressing impregnated paper or wood fibers and epoxy, phenolic or polypropylene resin at high pressure and high temperature. A special surface made with [[Electronic Beam Curing]], a coating technique developed by Trespa, ensures durability and scratch resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipexl.com/en/patents/CA/trespa-international/van-der-hoeven-johannes-cw/CAZZUCZZ1243271.html Trespa patent for scratch resistance], 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ability to add colored pigments to the surface during curing, a variety of colors are possible. The production technique for the plates, which are made of wood, is also called "Dry Forming" technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.tue.nl/535773 paper on the Dry-forming process] from the Technical University of Delft&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, cheaper [[pre-preg]]s instead of the more expensive impregnated paper layers in the production of fiber boards is applied. These prepregs consist of wood fibers and thermosetting resins. This technique was applied for the first time in 1984. Because the surface of Trespa Plate has a dense molecular coating, it is virtually impervious to weather (temperature, UV radiation and humidity). Also, any contamination, such as graffiti, can be removed quite easily. Because of these advantages, the material has been popular since the 1980s in the production of laboratory surfaces and outdoor signage, but also for shower stalls and toilet cubicles in educational, hospital, and campground facilities.

Today Trespa brings HPL Trespa panels under various brand names, with different qualities for indoor and outdoor applications. Other names are used for furniture Trespa Athlon, Trespa Virtuon for indoor applications, Trespa TopLabPLUS, Toplab, for laboratory and Trespa Meteon for outdoor applications.

'''Uncontrolled waste''' is a group of [[waste types]] that do not fall into either the controlled, special or [[hazardous waste]] categories, such as specific [[mining]] wastes and [[agricultural]] wastes. This should not be confused with an alternative definition of uncontrolled waste that refers to improper waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alemayehu|first=Tamiru|date=2001-01-01|title=The impact of uncontrolled waste disposal on surface water quality in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sinet/article/view/18177|journal=SINET: Ethiopian Journal of Science|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=93–104|doi=10.4314/sinet.v24i1.18177|issn=0379-2897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncontrolled waste has significant impacts on the environment. In certain areas of Germany, it was found that industrial waste such as from ore smelting and waste products produced from petrochemical plants were found near population centers. Main effects of waste such as these lead to contamination of groundwater from toxic chemicals, and acidification of oceans as result of Co2 emissions from mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreck|first=P.|date=1998-07-01|title=Environmental impact of uncontrolled waste disposal in mining and industrial areas in Central Germany|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002540050293|journal=Environmental Geology|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=66–72|doi=10.1007/s002540050293|issn=0943-0105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uranium hexafluoride''' ('''{{uranium}}{{fluorine|6}}'''), colloquially known as "'''hex'''" in the nuclear industry, is a compound used in the process of [[Enriched uranium|enriching uranium]], which produces fuel for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. Hex forms solid grey crystals at [[standard temperature and pressure]], is highly toxic, reacts with water, and is corrosive to most metals. The compound reacts mildly with [[aluminium]], forming a thin surface layer of [[Aluminium fluoride|AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] that resists any further reaction from the compound.

== Preparation ==
Milled uranium ore—U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; or "[[yellowcake]]"—is dissolved in [[nitric acid]], yielding a solution of [[uranyl nitrate]] UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Pure uranyl nitrate is obtained by [[solvent extraction]], then treated with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium diuranate]] ("ADU", (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;). Reduction with [[hydrogen]] gives UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is converted with [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to [[uranium tetrafluoride]], UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Oxidation with [[fluorine]] yields UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

During [[Nuclear reprocessing#Fluoride volatility|nuclear reprocessing]], uranium is reacted with [[chlorine trifluoride]] to give UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;:

:U + 2 ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → UF&lt;SUB&gt;6&lt;/SUB&gt; + Cl&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

== Application in the nuclear fuel cycle ==
[[File:Uranium hexafluoride phase diagram.gif|thumb|left|250px|[[Phase diagram]] of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.]]
&lt;!-- please explain why its triple point makes it useful in these methods. --&gt;UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is used in both of the main uranium [[nuclear enrichment|enrichment]] methods — [[gaseous diffusion]] and the [[gas centrifuge]] method — because its [[triple point]] is at temperature 64.05&amp;nbsp;°C (147&amp;nbsp;°F, 337 K) and only slightly higher than normal atmospheric pressure. Fluorine has only a single naturally occurring stable isotope, so [[isotopologue]]s of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; differ in their molecular weight based solely on the uranium [[isotope]] present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Uranium Enrichment and the Gaseous Diffusion Process | publisher = USEC Inc | url = http://www.usec.com/v2001_02/HTML/Aboutusec_enrichment.asp | accessdate = 2007-09-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019081831/http://www.usec.com/v2001_02/HTML/Aboutusec_enrichment.asp | archive-date = 2007-10-19 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the other uranium fluorides are nonvolatile solids that are [[coordination polymer]]s.

Gaseous diffusion requires about 60 times as much energy as the gas centrifuge process: gaseous diffusion-produced nuclear fuel produces 25 times more energy than is used in the diffusion process, while centrifuge-produced fuel produces 1,500 times more energy than is used in the centrifuge process.

In addition to its use in enrichment, uranium hexafluoride has been used in an advanced reprocessing method ([[fluoride volatility]]), which was developed in the [[Czech Republic]]. In this process, used [[oxide]] [[nuclear fuel]] is treated with fluorine gas to form a mixture of fluorides. This mixture is then distilled to separate the different classes of material.

== Storage in cylinders ==
[[File:Corroded DUF6 cylinder.jpg|thumb|500px|right
|DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cylinders: painted (left) and corroded (right)]]&lt;!--The left image is available on commons, have to find the right image and then can make it look better as currently the images are not sized correctly--&gt;
In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]]; [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]; and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; FAQs | title = How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? | url = http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq16.cfm | publisher = [[Argonne National Laboratory]] }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm Documents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air to produce UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[uranyl fluoride]]) and HF ([[hydrogen fluoride]]) both of which are highly corrosive and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Institute for Energy and Environmental Research | date = 2007-09-24 | title = What is DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;?

'''William Grylls Adams [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society A,B,C|FRS]]''' (18 February 1836 in [[Laneast]], [[Cornwall]] – 10 April 1915) was professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at [[King's College, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Adams, William Grylls|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Grylls Adams was a younger brother of [[John Couch Adams]] (1819–1892). He graduated from [[St. John's College, Cambridge]] as [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|11th Wrangler]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ADMS855WG|name=Adams, William Grylls}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/s2_14/1/xxxv|title=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society - Oxford Academic|website=OUP Academic|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a teaching post at [[Highgate School]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ed. Boreham|first1=J.Y.|title=Highgate School Register 1838-1938|page=xxvi|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] (1820–1891) had discovered that illumination of one of two metal plates in a dilute acid changed the electromotive force (EMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P0910.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529022632/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P0910.html# |archive-date=29 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1876, Adams and [[Richard Evans Day]] discovered that illuminating a junction between selenium and platinum has a [[photovoltaic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Adams,_William_Grylls|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=Eoearth.org|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OlA-fN3Bd4QC&amp;pg=PA155|title=Renewable and Alternative Energy Resources: A Reference Handbook|first1=Zachary Alden|last1=Smith|first2=Katrina D.|last2=Taylor|date=28 July 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=28 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first demonstrated that electricity could be produced from light without moving parts and led to the modern solar cell.

From 1878 to 1880 he was President of the Physical Society of London. In June 1872 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and in 1875 delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=7&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27adams%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was president of the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]] and of the mathematical and physical section of the [[British Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Adams, William Grylls|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Xi double-charm baryon''', denoted as &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{\rm{cc}}^{{++}}&lt;/math&gt;, is a [[Xi baryon|Xi]] baryon [[List of particles#Composite particles|composed]] of two [[charm quark]]s and one [[up quark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://press.cern/press-releases/2017/07/lhcb-experiment-charmed-announce-observation-new-particle-two-heavy-quarks|author=Sébastien Gavois (Nextinpact.com)|date=2017-07-10|title=Retour en douceur sur la découverte d'une nouvelle particule, avec deux quarks " charmés "|accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its discovery by the [[LHCb experiment|LHCb Collaboration]] was announced on 6 July 2017 in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], at the [[European Physical Society]] Conference on [[Particle physics|High Energy Physics]]. &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{\rm{cc}}^{{++}}&lt;/math&gt; is the first baryon discovered with two heavy quarks (charm and/or bottom) and a light quark. Its mass is 3621 MeV, nearly four times that of the [[proton]].&lt;ref&gt;(CERN, European Organization for Nuclear Research 2017)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

It was identified when it disintegrated into a &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{\rm{c}}^{{+}}&lt;/math&gt; [[Lambda baryon|baryon]] and three lighter [[meson]]s, [[Kaon|K{{Sup|–}}]], [[Pion|π{{Sup|+}}]] and π{{Sup|+}}.
