The '''1872 California-Nevada State Boundary Marker''' marks the initial point for the 1872 survey delineation of the state line between [[California]] and [[Nevada]]. It is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[File:Oregon-California Side.JPG|thumb|left|The California side of the marker]]
When California attained statehood in 1850, it adopted [[120th meridian west|120 degrees west]] longitude as its eastern border.&lt;ref name="CA v. NV"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=California v. Nevada |vol=44 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=125 |pinpoint= |court=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |date=1980 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/125/case.html |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |quote=The two straight-line segments that make up the boundary between California and Nevada were initially defined in California's Constitution of 1849. The first, the "north-south" segment, commences on the Oregon border at the intersection of the 42d parallel and the 120th meridian and runs south along that meridian to the 39th parallel. And the second, the "oblique" segment, begins at that parallel and runs in a southeasterly direction to the point where the Colorado River crosses the 35th parallel. Cal.Const., Art. XII (1849). In 1850, when California was admitted to the Union, Congress approved the 1849 Constitution, and with it California's eastern boundary. Act of Sept. 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 452.

On the same day that it admitted California, Congress established a territorial government in the area immediately to the east. The organic Act for that new Territory -- which was then called Utah -- stated that it was to be "bounded on the west by the State of California." Act of Sept. 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 453. Eleven years later, the Territory of Nevada was created out of Utah. Congress indicated in the organic Act that Nevada might include portions of what was then California, but with the proviso that

"so much of the Territory within the present limits of the State of California shall not be included within this Territory until the State of California shall assent to the same by an act irrevocable without the consent of the United States. . . ."

Act of Mar. 2, 1861, 12 Stat. 210. No assent was ever given by California. Accordingly, when Nevada was admitted as a State in 1864, its western boundary and California's eastern one remained congruent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brean |first=Henery |date=May 2, 2009 |title=Nevada and California have a border dispute going back to 1850 |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/ |dead-url= |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |location= |archive-url=http://www.boitano.net/history/california/Nevada%20and%20California%20have%20a%20border%20dispute%20going%20back%20to%201850%20%20www_rgj_com%20%20Reno%20Gazette-Journal.htm |archive-date= March 2009 |access-date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1855 and 1900 there were six surveys to locate 120 degrees, with each locating 120 degrees of longitude differently.&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus.nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=81000387}}|author=Abbe, Donald|title=1872 California-Nevada State Boundary Marker|work=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form|publisher=National Park Service|year=1979|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, Alexey Von Schmidt undertook the survey of the state line. He marked his survey line with stones, wood, and iron markers; the only one who placed such markers&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus.nps.gov"/&gt; A new survey in 1893 showed that the Von Schmidt line was 1,600 to 1,800 feet west of the actual 120 degrees. However, California and Nevada both recognize the 1872 Von Schmidt survey and the 1893 survey as the state line.&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus.nps.gov"/&gt;

The 1872 marker near [[Verdi, Nevada]] is a four-sided cast iron pylon eight feet tall. It includes the words "CALIFORNIA" on the west face of the pylon, "NEVADA" on the east face, "1872, LONGITUDE 120 WEST OF GREENWICH, A.W. VON SCHMIDT, U.S." on the south face, and "170 MILES 47 CHAINS TO OREGON" on the north face.&lt;ref name="pdfhost.focus.nps.gov"/&gt; The marker is surrounded by a wrought iron fence.

The marker was listed in the National Register of Historic Places because it represents the initial point of survey for the California-Nevada border, and is a remnant of this survey.

NGS gives current [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=mv0393 data] for another 1872 marker that may still exist at the northeast corner of California.

'''Alexander Keith Johnston''' [[FRSE]] FRGS FGS FEGS LLD (28 December 1804{{snd}}9 July 1871) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[geographer]] and [[cartographer]].

==Biography==
He was born at Kirkhill near [[Penicuik]], south of [[Edinburgh]]. He was the son of Andrew Johnston and Isabel Keith. His brother was [[Thomas Brumby Johnston]] FRSE.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

After an education at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|High School]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to the Edinburgh engraver and mapmaker, [[James Kirkwood (Church of Scotland)|James Kirkwood]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} and [[William Home Lizars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past|author=Jeremy Black |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780300086935|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, he joined his brother William (who would become [[Sir William Johnston]], [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]]) in a printing and engraving business, forming the well-known [[cartographical]] firm of W. and A. K. Johnston{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} with offices based at 4 St Andrew Square in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]] (demolished 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1870-71&lt;/ref&gt; and their printworks based at Edina Works, off Easter Road. The firm used the clan motto of "Ready Aye Ready" as their logo. Early hikes in the West Highlands had led Johnston to despair at the accuracy of maps, and inspired a deire to rectify this.&lt;ref&gt;http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/thematic-maps/landmark-thematic-atlases/landmark-thematic-atlases.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rest of Johnston's life was devoted to geography, his later years to its educational aspects especially. His services were recognised by the leading scientific societies of Europe and [[United States|America]].

In October 1849, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposer being Robert Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh |isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 he was a founding member of the Meteorological Society of Scotland. He was awarded an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1865.

His Edinburgh address in later years was 16 Grosvenor Crescent in the affluent West End.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1870-71&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at [[Ben Rhydding]], [[Yorkshire]], in 1871.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He is buried in the north-west section of [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] in Edinburgh.

Johnston combined cartography with a painstaking and scholarly approach to map production. He went on to establish a reputation for scope and accuracy. Thematic atlases became the hallmark of the company he had founded and W &amp; A K Johnston were appointed engravers to [[King William IV]] in 1834. In 1835 he constructed the first English language physical globe of the world incorporating its geology, hydrography and meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies, Volume 26|authors=Charles W. J. Withers, Hayden Lorimer |publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2015 |isbn=9781474227049|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843 Johnston published ''The National Atlas of General Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Volume 4: Professionalism and Diversity 1880-2000|author=David Finkelstein |publisher= Edinburgh University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780748628841|pages=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston was the first to bring the study of [[physical geography]] into competent notice in England. His attention had been called to the subject by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. In 1848 Johnston published ''The Physical Atlas'', followed by a second and enlarged edition in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Geographies of Nineteenth-Century Science|authors=David N. Livingstone &amp; Charles W. J. Withers |publisher= University of Chicago Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780226487267|pages=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atlas contained maps and descriptive [[letterpress]] to illustrates the [[geology]], [[hydrography]], [[meteorology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[ethnology]] of the globe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} ''The Physical Atlas'' was partly based on [[Heinrich Berghaus]]'s German language ''Physikalischer Atlas'' and reflected the increased interest in the mapping of zoological and biological distributions. 18th century thinkers such as [[Montesquieu]] had stressed the importance of geography and climate as determining factors in history, and the concept of ''natural frontiers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past|author=Jeremy Black |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780300086935|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atlas was a visual representation of [[Humboldtian science]], which became popular in the 19th century and was preoccupied with the measurement of environmental parameters on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Geographies of Nineteenth-Century Science|authors=David N. Livingstone &amp; Charles W. J.

Livingstone &amp; Charles W. J. Withers |publisher= University of Chicago Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780226487267|pages=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston published a ''Dictionary of Geography'' in 1850, with many later editions. ''The Royal Atlas of Modern Geography'' was first published in 1855 and served as an atlas of [[military geography]] to accompany [[Sir Archibald Alison, 1st Baronet|Alison]]'s ''History of Europe'' published in 1848. A variety of other [[atlas]]es and [[map]]s for educational or scientific purposes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1856 Johnston published the "School Atlas of Astronomy".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1861 Johnston published the first edition of the ''Royal Atlas of Modern Geography'' with 48 maps. By 1914 the atlas had gone through 12 editions and morphed into the ''Johnston's Handy Royal Atlas of Modern Geography'' with 61 colour lithographed maps and an index of 84 pages. While the [[Collins Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]'s ''Citizen's Atlas'' sold more copies, being half the price, the ''Royal Altlas''became the standard library atlas throughout the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Volume 4: Professionalism and Diversity 1880-2000|author=David Finkelstein |publisher= Edinburgh University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780748628841|pages=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 Johnston produced a new edition of his ''School Atlas of Classical Geography''. It contained a series of new maps that reflected the results of the most recent research into the [[classical antiquity]]. The ''Map of the Outer Geography of the Odyssey'' and two maps of ancient Greece were based on the scholarly work of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who had also revised the map plates and text of the atlas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past|author=Jeremy Black |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780300086935|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Johnston published the ''Half-Crown Atlas of British History'' for the price sensitive educational market. It was designed as a connected series of maps for teachers and students and illustrated leading events of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past|author=Jeremy Black |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2000 |isbn=9780300086935|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Margaret Gray in 1837. She was thereafter known as Margaret Keith Johnston.

His eldest son, also named [[Alexander Keith Johnston (1844-1879)|Alexander Keith Johnston]] (1844–1879), was also the author of various geographical works and papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1543">The following numbers characterize the '''area of [[Poland]]'''
* Area of Polish territory - {{convert|322575|km2|sqmi}} ([[land area]], [[internal waters]] area and [[territorial sea]] area)
* Administrative area of Poland - {{convert|312679|km2|sqmi}}. This is calculated according to the official definition of the coastline. Some of Polish [[administrative unit]]s include area of internal waters (8 [[Gmina|commune]]s in [[voivodeship zachodniopomorskie]], 2 communes in [[Pomerania Voivodeship]] and 3 communes in [[Warmia-Mazuria Voivodeship]]). In Poland, there are {{convert|2005|km2|sqmi}} of internal waters, but only {{convert|791|km2|sqmi}} of it are included in administrative units according to the coast line definition. That is why the administrative area of Poland isn’t the same as the area of Poland. By common convention {{convert|312679|km2|sqmi}} is called the (total) area of Poland in encyclopedias and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/nations/Poland Encyclopædia Britannica], &lt;br&gt;[http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=4169123 Encyklopedia PWN (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Area of Poland (land area of Poland) - {{convert|311888|km2|sqmi}}. Land area includes land waters ([[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[canal]]s) and this figure is normally used when comparing the area of Poland with the area of other countries.

The Atlantic Northeast region is noted for its cultural unity, stark climate, landscape of dense forests, and a shared economic history in the exploitation of [[logging]] and the regional [[fishery]]. Further uniting this area is the "Gray Zone" which is an area of land and sea which is claimed by both Canada and the United States. It is located off the coasts of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Maine]]. The only land within this area are two islands, [[Machias Seal Island]] and [[North Rock]]. The "Gray Zone" is one of [[List of areas disputed by Canada and the United States|four areas between the two countries whose sovereignty is still in dispute]], but is the only one of the disputed areas containing land. In 1979, both countries filed a joint application to the [[International Court of Justice]] to avoid having the dispute settled when oceanic boundaries in the area were set for mineral and fishing rights. Canadians have had a continuous presence in the area since 1832 when a lighthouse was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/23/machias-seal-island-canada-us_n_2354580.html|title=The Border Isn't As Clear As You Think|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Atlantic Northeast is such a large region, it is home to many different types of wildlife, sports teams, and geographical locations. The Atlantic Northeast is home to the Boston Celtics, Boston Bruins, New England Patriots, Halifax Hurricanes, Boston Red Sox and many more. It also includes many notable species including the [[Bald eagle|Bald Eagle]], [[Atlantic salmon|Atlantic Salmon]], and the [[Helonias|Swamp Pink]]. Lastly, the Atlantic Northeast includes many geographical places of interest including the [[Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts]], home of the Salem Witch Trials.

Though cross-border connections are widely acknowledged, the area has rarely been given a single name. "Atlantic Northeast" is a term that has been used most prominently in discussions of regional [[folk culture]], another name that is used is Atlantica."

These names are often tied to various proposals for greater economic or political integration of the region

According to [[archeologists]] humans first settled in the Atlantic Northeast during the last ice age roughly 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoxie|first1=Fredrick|title=The Oxford Handbook of American Indian History|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199858897|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IK6NCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=Atlantic+northeast+trading+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ccl2K80uiO&amp;sig=c7P1MMSEXg8Floo853KFIfCTpkE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJobDHmfvPAhVGbD4KHWPSBaMQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The pro-dominate tribes in the Atlantic Northeast 11,000 years ago where the [[Wabanakis]], [[Penobscots]], and [[Mi'kmaqs]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;  These tribes mainly inhabited the soon to be Maritimes Provinces like [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Massachusetts]]. Before 1620 the conflicts between Native American tribes and English settlers started due to the alienation of tribes, they also kidnapped members of the tribes through violence.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;  The violence among the Natives, French, and English confused the Native American tribes because they also traded with proper settlers but this left the tribes resentful of the European nations.  With the presence of the French and English in the Atlantic Northeast attracted the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] to begin trading on the hudson river with different tribes. The new presence of these traders also brought unwanted microbes, viruses, and bacteria that took heavy toll on the Native American population.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;  When [[smallpox]] swept the New England area in 1610 the Native American population hit an all time low since they were trying to fight off a virus that was not indigenous to the area.  Eventually the population recovered but not completely, after the outbreak settlers became highly interested in there beaver pelts which the Natives would trade for glass, metal, and weapons.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

[[File:Barranquilla,_el_mar_desde_las_Bocas_de_Cenizas-20050625.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Sunset in Bocas de Ceniza.]]

'''Bocas de Ceniza''' (Spanish for: ''Ash Mouths'') is the mouth of the [[Magdalena River]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It owes its name to the dusky color ocean waters take to receive the river. At present, the river flows into the sea through an artificial canal built in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puertodebarranquilla.com/?page_id%3D191 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407022117/http://www.puertodebarranquilla.com/?page_id=191 |archivedate=2016-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bocas de Ceniza was discovered by [[Rodrigo de Bastidas]] on 1 April 1501. In 1824 the river navigation steamships began, raising local interest in the use of Bocas de Ceniza. The railway construction between [[Barranquilla]] and [[Puerto Colombia]] in 1872 and the transfer of Aduana Nacional to Barranquilla increased the desire to enable the sector of Bocas de Ceniza for international maritime trade.

The '''Center for Geospatial Research''' at the [[University of Georgia]] focuses on Remote Sensing and Climate Science. The center is a regional NASA DEVELOP node and was recognized by [[NASA]] in 1998 for its outstanding achievements relating to applied climate and environmental sciences, being named a NASA Center of Excellence.&lt;ref name="UGA Center Geospatial Research History"&gt;[http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=435 History of the UGA Center Geospatial Research ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and History== 
The [[University of Georgia]]'s Center for Geospatial Research, CGR, was founded in 1985 as the Laboratory for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science. In 1989 the lab was renamed the Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science. This Center was founded by Dr. Roy Welch, who served as director from its founding in 1985 until 2003. The Center is now directed by Dr. Marguerite Madden and in 2012 the center was renamed Center for Geospatial Research to better reflect its internal goals. In 2016 the center helped found the UGA [[Small Satellite Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="UGA Center Geospatial Research History"&gt;[http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=435 History of the UGA Center Geospatial Research ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UGA Center Geospatial Research Faculty"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=2962# |title=Faculty of the UGA Center Geospatial Research  |access-date=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920125211/http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=2962# |archive-date=2016-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant Research==

===Publications and Presentations===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:US Coastal counties at risk of climate change due to sea level rise.jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of the severity of United States county populations that are at risk of 0.9m sea level rise due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions projected to be at risk from sea-level rise in the continental United States|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n7/full/nclimate2961.html|publisher=Nature|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
In 2016 research from the Center was used to identify the coastal regions of the United States that were most at risk from sea-level rise due to climate change. This study was one of the first studies to have accounted for ongoing population growth when assessing the potential magnitude of future impacts. Minimally 4.2 million people at risk of inundation were projected to be at risk from sea-level rise in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions projected to be at risk from sea-level rise in the continental United States|url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n7/full/nclimate2961.html|publisher=Nature|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the Center for Geospatial Research have helped students at the UGA [[Small Satellite Research Laboratory]] receive grants to build 2 satellites. These satellites will be the first satellites built, designed, and operated by the University of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Selects Proposals for Student Flight Research Opportunities|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-proposals-for-student-flight-research-opportunities|publisher=NASA|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UGA team selected by NASA, Air Force to build and launch two cube satellites|url=http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/cubesat-nasa-air-force-build-launch-two-cube-satellites-0516/|publisher=UGA|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASA DEVELOP===
The Center for Geospatial Research is a regional node for the NASA DEVELOP national program and contributes significantly to climate change research.&lt;ref name="UGA Center Geospatial Research and NASA DEVELOP"&gt;[http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=2389 NASA DEVELOP at UGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The center was published in the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]s World Conservation Congress Publication. The study focused on ecological forecasting, reforestation and conservation efforts, and the Colombian primate [[Cotton-top tamarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Satellite Observations for Conservation|url=http://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/system/files/docs/NASA_2016_IUCN_WCC.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's DEVELOP program helps identify key issues regarding [[Atlanta]] and its suburbs. Using data from the [[Landsat 8]] and [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] satellites the center is able to model water flow in the region and help the area build better infrastructure as it grows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

===Small Satellites===
The Center is also aiding the undergraduates of the [[Small Satellite Research Laboratory]] with technical knowledge. Faculty members, such as Dr. David Cotten, have given presentations on the possibilities of [[structure from motion]] in [[low Earth orbit]] and how the Small Satellite Research Laboratory could build the first satellite to perform this technology in orbit.&lt;ref name="Presentations relating to MOCI and SfM"&gt;[http://www.crms.uga.edu/wordpress/?page_id=3363 MOCI and SfM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOCI and the UGA SSRL"&gt;[http://www.smallsat.uga.edu/research MOCI and the UGA SSRL]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''city''' is a large [[human settlement]].&lt;ref name="Goodall"&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuper and Kuper"&gt;Kuper, A. and Kuper, J., eds (1996) ''The Social Science Encyclopedia''. 2nd edition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities generally have extensive systems for [[housing]], [[transportation]], [[sanitation]], [[Public utilities|utilities]], [[land use]], and [[communication]]. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process.

Historically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid [[urbanization]], roughly half of the [[world population]] now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day cities usually form the core of larger [[metropolitan area]]s and [[urban area]]s—creating numerous [[commuter]]s traveling towards [[city center]]s for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a world of intensifying [[globalization]], all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions.

The [[List of largest cities|most populated]] [[city proper]] is [[Chongqing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20180317/56813362_0.shtml|title=2017年重庆市国民经济和社会发展统计公报|website=news.ifeng.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan areas]] are the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], the Shanghai area, and [[Jabodetabek]] ([[Jakarta]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Demographia World Urban Areas'' [http://demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf 13th Annual Edition], April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Faiyum]],&lt;ref&gt;Nick Compton, "What is the oldest city in the world?", ''The Guardian'', 16 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damascus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=Middle East and Africa: International Dictionary of Historic Places|date=2014|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Varanasi]]&lt;ref&gt;Jhimli Mukherjee Pandeyl, "Varanasi is as old as Indus valley civilization, finds IIT-KGP study", ''Times of India'' 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; are among those laying claim to [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|longest continual inhabitation]].

== Meaning ==
[[File:Sheth Motisha Tonk 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Palitana]] represents the city's symbolic function in the extreme, devoted as it is to [[Palitana temples|Jain temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy (1968), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively great size, but also by its functions and its [[city status|special symbolic status]], which may be conferred by a central authority. The term can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of the city or to the collection of people who dwell there, and can be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural territory.&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynch2008p678&gt;Kevin A. Lynch, "What Is the Form of a City, and How is It Made?"; in Marzluff et al. (2008), p. 678. "The city may be looked on as a story, a pattern of relations between human groups, a production and distribution space, a field of physical force, a set of linked decisions, or an arena of conflict. Values are embedded in these metaphors: historic continuity, stable equilibrium, productive efficiency, capable decision and management, maximum interaction, or the progress of political struggle. Certain actors become the decisive elements of transformation in each view: political leaders, families and ethnic groups, major investors, the technicians of transport, the decision elite, the revolutionary classes."&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of definitions, invoking [[population]], [[population density]], number of [[dwelling]]s, economic function, and [[infrastructure]], are used in national [[census]]es to classify populations as urban. Common population definitions for a city range between 1,500 and 50,000 people, with most U.S. states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2015/notes/notes06.pdf Table 6]" in [[United Nations Demographic Yearbook]] ([https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2015.htm 2015]), the 1988 version of which is quoted in Carter (1995), pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HugoEtAl2003 /&gt;  However, some jurisdictions set no such minimums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx|title=How NC Municipalities Work – North Carolina League of Municipalities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nclm.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516211303/http://www.nclm.org/resource-center/Pages/How-Municipalities-Work.aspx|archive-date=2010-05-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[city status in the United Kingdom|In the United Kingdom]], city status is awarded on local criteria. According to the "functional definition" a city is not distinguished by size alone, but also by the role it plays within a larger political context. Cities serve as administrative, commercial, religious, and cultural hubs for their larger surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=Smith2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marshall14&gt;Marshall (1989), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of settlements called city which may not meet any of the traditional criteria to be named such include [[Broad Top City, Pennsylvania]] (pop 452) and [[City Dulas]], [[Anglesey]], a hamlet.

The presence of a [[Intelligentsia|literate elite]] is sometimes included in the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical city has professional [[Management|administrators]], regulations, and some form of [[taxation]] (food and other necessities or means to trade for them) to feed the [[Civil service|government workers]]. (This arrangement contrasts with the more typically [[egalitarianism|horizontal]] relationships in a [[tribe]] or [[village]] accomplishing common goals through informal agreements between neighbors, or through leadership of a chief.) The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work projects such as canal building, food distribution, land ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a combination of these. Societies that live in cities are often called [[civilization]]s.

The word ''city'' and the related ''[[civilization]]'' come, via Old French, from the Latin root ''[[wikt:civitas|civitas]]'', originally meaning citizenship or community member and eventually coming to correspond with [[wikt:urbs|urbs]], meaning city in a more physical sense.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"city, n.", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman ''civitas'' was closely linked with the Greek "[[polis]]"—another common root appearing in English words such as ''[[metropolis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Yi Jianping, "'Civilization' and 'State': An Etymological Perspective"; ''Social Sciences in China'' 33(2), 2012; {{doi|10.1080/02529203.2012.677292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urban geography]] deals both with cities in their larger context and with their internal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Carter (1995), pp. 5–7. "[...] the two main themes of study introduced at the outset: the town as a distributed feature and the town as a feature with internal structure, or in other words, the town in area and the town as area."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Site ===
Town siting has varied through history according to natural, technological, economic, and military contexts. Access to water has long been a major factor in city placement and growth, and despite exceptions enabled by the advent of [[rail transport]] in the nineteenth century, through the present most of the world's urban population lives near the coast or on a river.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1989), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban areas as a rule cannot [[Subsistence agriculture|produce their own food]] and therefore must develop some [[city region|relationship]] with a [[hinterland]] which sustains them.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2004p155&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in special cases such as [[mining town]]s which play a vital role in long-distance trade, are cities disconnected from the countryside which feeds them.&lt;ref name=Marshall1989p15&gt;Marshall (1989), p. 15. "The mutual interdependence of town and country has one consequence so obvious that it is easily overlooked: at the global scale, cities are generally confined to areas capable of supporting a permanent agricultural population. Moreover, within any area possessing a broadly uniform level of agricultural productivity, there is a rough but definite association between the density of the rural population and the average spacing of cities above any chosen minimum size."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, centrality within a productive region influences siting, as economic forces would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually reachable locations.&lt;ref name=Latham2009p18 /&gt;

=== Center ===
{{Main|City centre}}
The vast majority of cities have a central area containing buildings with special economic, political, and religious significance. Archaeologists refer to this area by the Greek term [[temenos]] or if fortified as a [[citadel]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 34–35. "In the center of the city, an elite compound or temenos was situated. Study of the very earliest cities show this compound to be largely composed of a temple and supporting structures. The temple rose some 40 feet above the ground and would have presented a formidable profile to those far away. The temple contained the priestly class, scribes, and record keepers, as well as granaries, schools, crafts—almost all non-agricultural aspects of society.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces historically reflect and amplify the city's centrality and importance to its wider [[city region|sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name=Latham2009p18&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 18. "From the simplest forms of exchange, when peasant farmers literally brought their produce from the fields into the densest point of interaction—giving us market towns—the significance of central places to surrounding territories began to be asserted. As cities grew in complexity, the major civic institutions, from seats of government to religious buildings, would also come to dominate these points of convergence. Large central squares or open spaces reflected the importance of collective gatherings in city life, such as Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the Zócalo in Mexico City, the Piazza Navona in Rome and Trafalgar Square in London.&lt;/ref&gt; Today cities have a [[city center]] or [[downtown]], sometimes coincident with a [[central business district]].

=== Public space ===
Cities typically have [[public space]]s where anyone can go. These include [[privately owned public space|privately owned spaces open to the public]] as well as forms of public land such as [[Public domain (land)|public domain]] and the [[common land|commons]]. [[Western philosophy]] since the time of the Greek [[agora]] has considered physical public space as the substrate of the symbolic [[public sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), pp. 177–179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Mitchell, "[https://www.academia.edu/download/33133088/the-end-of-public-space-mitchell.pdf The End of Public Space? People's Park, Definitions of the Public, and Democracy]";{{dead link|date=October 2017|fix-attempted=yes}} ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 85(1), March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public art]] adorns (or disfigures) public spaces. [[Park]]s and other [[Incorporation of nature within a city|natural sites within cities]] provide residents with relief from the hardness and regularity of typical [[built environment]]s.

=== Internal structure ===
[[Urban structure]] generally follows one or more basic patterns: geomorphic, radial, concentric, rectilinear, and curvilinear. Physical environment generally constrains the form in which a city is built. If located on a mountainside, urban structure may rely on terraces and winding roads. It may be adapted to its means of subsistence (e.g. agriculture or fishing). And it may be set up for optimal defense given the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy (1968), 21–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these "geomorphic" features, cities can develop internal patterns, due to natural growth or to [[urban planning|city planning]].

In a radial structure, main roads converge on a central point. This form could evolve from successive growth over a long time, with concentric traces of [[town wall]]s and [[citadel]]s marking older city boundaries. In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by [[ring road]]s moving traffic around the outskirts of a town. Dutch cities such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]] are structured as a central square surrounded by concentric canals marking every expansion. In cities such as and also [[Moscow]], this pattern is still clearly visible.

A system of rectilinear city streets and land plots, known as the [[grid plan]], has been used for millennia in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.  The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] built [[Mohenjo-Daro]], [[Harappa]] and other cities on a grid pattern, using ancient principles described by [[Kautilya]], and aligned with the [[compass points]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Pant and Shjui Fumo, "[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jaabe/4/1/4_1_51/_pdf The Grid and Modular Measures in The Town Planning of Mohenjodaro and Kathmandu Valley: A Study on Modular Measures in Block and Plot Divisions in the Planning of Mohenjodaro and Sirkap (Pakistan), and Thimi (Kathmandu Valley)]"; ''Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering'' 59, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2002&gt;Smith, "[http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/1-CompleteSet/MES-02-EarlyCities.pdf Earliest Cities]", in Gmelch &amp; Zenner (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Danino, "[http://www.iisc.ernet.in/prasthu/pages/PP_data/paper2.pdf New Insights into Harappan Town-Planning, Proportions and Units, with Special Reference to Dholavira]", "Man and Environment 33(1), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane McIntosh, ''The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives'' ; ABC-CLIO, 2008; {{ISBN|978-1576079072}}  pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA231 231], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;pg=PA346 346].&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek city of [[Priene]] exemplifies a grid plan with specialized districts used across the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic Mediterranean]].

=== Urban areas ===
Urban-type settlement extends far beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[city proper]]&lt;ref&gt;Carter (1995), p. 15. "In the underbound city the administratively defined area is smaller than the physical extent of settlement. In the overbound city the administrative area is greater than the physical extent. The 'truebound' city is one where the administrative bound is nearly coincidental with the physical extent."&lt;/ref&gt; in a form of development sometimes described critically as [[urban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 |author1=Paul James |author2=Meg Holden |author3=Mary Lewin |author4=Lyndsay Neilson |author5=Christine Oakley |author6=Art Truter |author7=David Wilmoth | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development |editor1=Harald Mieg |editor2=Klaus Töpfer | chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756 | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decentralization and dispersal of city functions (commercial, industrial, residential, cultural, political) has transformed the very meaning of the term and has challenged geographers seeking to classify territories according to an urban-rural binary.&lt;ref name=HugoEtAl2003 /&gt;

[[Metropolitan areas]] include [[suburbs]] and [[exurbs]] organized around the needs of [[commuting|commuters]], and sometimes [[edge city|edge cities]] characterized by a degree of economic and political independence. (In the US these are grouped into [[metropolitan statistical areas]] for purposes of [[demography]] and [[marketing]].) Some cities are now part of a continuous urban landscape called [[urban agglomeration]], [[conurbation]], or [[megalopolis]] (exemplified by the [[northeast megalopolis|BosWash]] corridor of the Northeastern United States.)&lt;ref&gt;Chaunglin Fang &amp; Danlin Yu, "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204617300439 Urban agglomeration: An evolving concept of an emerging phenomenon]"; ''Landscape and Urban Planning'' 162, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities, characterized by [[population density]], [[symbol]]ic function, and [[urban planning]], have existed for thousands of years. In the conventional view, civilization and the city both followed from the [[Neolithic Revolution|development of agriculture]], which enabled production of surplus food, and thus a social [[division of labour]] (with concomitant [[social stratification]]) and [[trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Pacione|2001| p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early cities often featured [[granary|granaries]], sometimes within a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 26. "Early cities also reflected these preconditions in that they served as places where agricultural surpluses were stored and distributed. Cities functioned economically as centers of extraction and redistribution from countryside to granaries to the urban population. One of the main functions of this central authority was to extract, store, and redistribute the grain. It is no accident that granaries—storage areas for grain—were often found within the temples of early cities."&lt;/ref&gt; A minority viewpoint considers that cities may have arisen without agriculture, due to alternative means of subsistence (fishing),&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer R.

"The ancients fostered the spread of urban culture; their efforts were constant to bring their people within the complete influence of municipal life. The desire to create cities was the most striking characteristic of the people of antiquity, and ancient rulers and statesmen vied with one another in satisfying that desire."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient times===
{{Further|Cities of the Ancient Near East|Polis|City-state|Late Antiquity#Cities}}

[[Jericho]] and [[Çatalhöyük]], dated to the [[eighth millennium BC]], are among the [[proto-cities|earliest proto-cities]] known to archaeologists.&lt;ref name=Perlman16 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southall (1998), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[fourth millennium BC|fourth]] and [[third millennium BC]], complex civilizations flourished in the river valleys of [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[Egypt]]. Excavations in these areas have found the [[ruins]] of cities geared variously towards trade, politics, or religion. Some had large, [[Urban density|dense populations]], but others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Among the early Old World cities, [[Mohenjo-daro]] of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day [[Pakistan]], existing from about 2600 BC, was one of the largest, with a population of 50,000 or more and a [[Sanitation of the Indus Valley Civilisation|sophisticated sanitation system]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998) ''Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization''.

These sites appear planned in a highly regimented and [[social stratification|stratified]] fashion, with a minimalistic grid of rooms for the workers and increasingly more elaborate housing available for higher classes.&lt;ref&gt;Moholy-Nagy (1968), pp. 158–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mesopotamia, the civilization of [[Sumer]], followed by [[Assyria]] and [[Babylon]], gave rise to numerous cities, governed by kings and fostering multiple languages written in [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert McCormick Adams Jr.]], ''[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/heartland_of_cities.pdf Heartland of Cities: Surveys of Ancient Settlement and Land Use on the Central Floodplain of the Euphrates]''; University of Chicago Press, 1981; {{ISBN|0226005445}}; p. 2. "Southern Mesopotamia was a land of cities. It became one precociously, before the end of the fourth millennium B.C. Urban traditions remained strong and virtually continuous through the vicissitudes of conquest, internal upheaval accompanied by widespread economic breakdown, and massive linguistic and population replacement. The symbolic and material content of civilization obviously changed, but its cultural ambience remained tied to cities."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]n trading empire, flourishing around the turn of the [[first millennium BC]], encompassed [[List of Phoenician cities|numerous cities]] extending from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Cydon]], and [[Byblos]] to [[Carthage]] and [[Cádiz]].

The first thing that Romans did when they conquered new territories was to establish cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Americas, early urban traditions developed in the [[Andes]] and [[Mesoamerica]]. In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the [[Norte Chico civilization]], [[Chavín culture|Chavin]] and [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] cultures, followed by major cities in the [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Chimu]] and [[Inca]] cultures. The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico region]] of north-central coastal [[Peru]].

In the [[Fall of the Roman Empire|remnants of the Roman Empire]], [[Late Antiquity#Cities|cities of late antiquity]] gained independence but soon lost population and importance.

This urban heritage would continue despite the conquests of the Seljuk Turks and the later Crusades. China, the longest standing civilization, was in the midst of a golden age as the Tang dynasty gave way—after a short period of fragmentation—to the Song dynasty. This dynasty ruled two of the most impressive cities on the planet, Xian and Hangzhou. / In contrast, poor Western Europe had not recovered from the sacking of Rome and the collapse of the western half of the Roman Empire. For more than five centuries a steady process of deurbanization—whereby the population living in cities and the number of cities declined precipitously—had converted a prosperous landscape into a scary wilderness, overrun with bandits, warlords, and rude settlements."&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th through the end of the 12th century, [[Constantinople]], capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population approaching 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cameron|first=Averil|title=The Byzantines|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Byzantines.html?id=59c6PSa5JCAC|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-1405198332|ref=harv|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Laiou|first=Angeliki E.|title=The Economic History of Byzantium (Volume 1)|pages=130–131|year=2002|location=Washington, DC|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|editor=Angeliki E.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], beginning in the 12th. century, [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]] such as [[Nuremberg]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Zurich]], [[Nijmegen]] became a privileged elite among towns having won self-governance from their local lay or secular lord or having been granted self-governanace by the emperor and being placed under his immediate protection. By 1480, these cities, as far as still part of the empire,  became part of the [[Imperial Estates]] governing the empire with the emperor through the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/free-and-imperial-cities|title=Free and Imperial Cities – Dictionary definition of Free and Imperial Cities |author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, some cities become powerful states, taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires. In Italy [[medieval commune]]s developed into [[Italian city-states|city-states]] including the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]]. In Northern Europe, cities including [[Lübeck]] and [[Bruges]] formed the [[Hanseatic League]] for collective defense and commerce. Their power was later [[Dutch–Hanseatic War|challenged]] and eclipsed by the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Dutch]] commercial [[History of urban centers in the Low Countries|cities]] of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]], and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar phenomena existed elsewhere, as in the case of [[Sakai, Osaka|Sakai]], which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval Japan.

===Early modern===

In the West, nation-states became the dominant unit of political organization following the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2016), pp. 5–6. "In the modern international system, cities were subjugated and internalized by the state, and, with industrialization, became the great growth engines of national economies."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blomley2013 /&gt; Western Europe's larger capitals (London and Paris) benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade. However, most towns remained small.

During the Spanish colonization of the Americas the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws regarding administration, finances and urbanism.

===Industrial age===

The [[industrial revolution|growth of modern industry]] from the late 18th century onward led to massive [[urbanization]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. [[File:London slums Wellcome L0000877.jpg|thumb|[[19th-century London]] as capital of the world, crowded and thick with [[pea soup fog|its own variety of smog]].]] [[File:Szent Bertalan utca a Kossuth Lajos utca felé nézve. Fortepan 721.jpg|thumb|Small city [[Gyöngyös]] in Hungary in 1938.]] England led the way as [[London]] became the capital of a [[British empire|world empire]] and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for [[manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 53–54. "England was clearly at the center of these changes. London became the first truly global city by placing itself within the new global economy. English colonialism in North America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and later Africa and China helped to further fatten the wallets of many of its merchants. These colonies would later provide many of the raw materials for industrial production. England's hinterland was no longer confined to a portion of the world; it effectively became a global hinterland."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the [[History of rail transport|introduction of railroads]] reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, fueling migration from rural to city areas.

Industrialized cities became deadly places to live, due to health problems resulting from [[overcrowding]], [[occupational hazard]]s of industry, contaminated water and air, [[History of water supply and sanitation#Modern age|poor sanitation]], and communicable diseases such as [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]]. [[Factories]] and [[slum]]s emerged as regular features of the urban landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-industrial age===
In the second half of the twentieth century, [[deindustrialization]] (or "[[economic restructuring]]") in the West led to [[poverty]], [[homelessness]], and [[urban decay]] in formerly prosperous cities. America's "Steel Belt" became a "[[Rust Belt]]" and cities such as [[Decline of Detroit|Detroit]], Michigan, and [[Gary, Indiana]] began to [[Shrinking cities|shrink]], contrary to the global trend of massive urban expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Steven High, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AmNBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT5 Industrial Sunset: The Making of North America's Rust Belt, 1969–1984]''; University of Toronto Press, 2003; {{ISBN|0802085288}}. "It is now clear that the deindustrialization thesis is part myth and part fact. Robert Z. Lawrence, for example, uses aggregate economic data to show that manufacturing employment in the United States did not decline but actually increased from 16.8 million in 1960, to 20.1 million in 1973, and 20.3 million in 1980. However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries. John Cumbler submitted that 'depressions do not manifest themselves only at moments of national economic collapse' such as in the 1930s, but 'also recur in scattered sites across the nation in regions, in industries, and in communities.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Such cities have shifted with varying success into the [[service economy]] and [[public-private partnerships]], with concomitant [[gentrification]], uneven [[urban renewal|revitalization efforts]], and selective cultural development.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2004p164&gt;Kaplan (2004), pp. 160–165. "Entrepreneurial leadership became manifest through growth coalitions made up of builders, realtors, developers, the media, government actors such as mayors, and dominant corporations. For example, in St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch, Monsanto, and Ralston Purina played prominent roles. The leadership involved cooperation between public and private interests. The results were efforts at downtown revitalization; inner-city gentrification; the transformation of the CBD to advanced service employment; entetainment, museums, and cultural venues; the construction of sports stadiums and sport complexes; and waterfront development."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Great Leap Forward]] and subsequent [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plans]] continuing today, the [[People's Republic of China]] has undergone concomitant [[urbanization in China|urbanization]] and [[Chinese industrialization|industrialization]] and to become the world's leading [[manufacturing|manufacturer]].&lt;ref&gt;James Xiaohe Zhang, "Rapid urbanization in China and its impact on the world economy"; 16th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, "New Challenges for Global Trade in a Rapidly Changing World", Shanhai Institute of Foreign Trade, June 12–14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnson, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/world/asia/chinas-great-uprooting-moving-250-million-into-cities.html China's Great Uprooting: Moving 250 Million Into Cities]"; ''New York Times'', 15 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Urbanization]] is the process of migration from rural into urban areas, driven by various political, economic, and cultural factors. Until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the rural agricultural population and towns featuring [[Market (place)|markets]] and small-scale manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/26447633/The_Urbanization_and_Political_Development_of_the_World_System_A_comparative_quantitative_analysis The Urbanization and Political Development of the World System:A comparative quantitative analysis.

[[Megacities]], cities with population in the multi-millions, have proliferated into the dozens, arising especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 15. "Global cities need to be distinguished from megacities, defined here as cities with more than 8 million people. […] Only New York and London qualified as megacities 50 years ago. By 1990, just over 10 years ago, 20 megacities existed, 15 of which were in less economically developed regions of the world. In 2000, the number of megacities had increased to 26, again all except 6 are located in the less developed world regions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frauke Kraas &amp; Günter Mertins, "Megacities and Global Change"; in Kraas et al.

"&lt;/ref&gt; Economic globalization fuels the growth of these cities, as new torrents of foreign [[Financial capital|capital]] arrange for rapid industrialization, as well as [[offshoring|relocation of major businesses]] from Europe and North America, attracting [[immigrant]]s from near and far.&lt;ref&gt;Frauke Kraas &amp; Günter Mertins, "Megacities and Global Change"; in Kraas et al.

"Above all, globalisation processes were and are the motors that drive these enormous changes and are also the driving forces, together with transformation and liberalisation policies, behind the economic developments of the last c. 25 years (in China, especially the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics that started under Deng Xiaoping in 1978/1979, in India essentially during the course of the economic reform policies of the so-called New Economic Policy as of 1991; Cartier 2001; Nissel 1999). Especially in megacities, these reforms led to enormous influx of foreign direct investments, to intensive industrialization processes through international relocation of production locations and depending upon the location, partially to considerable expansion of the services sector with increasing demand for office space as well as to a reorientation of national support policies—with a not to be mistaken influence of transnationally acting conglomerates but also considerable transfer payments from overseas communities. In turn, these processes are flanked and intensified through, at times, massive migration movements of national and international migrants into the megacities (Baur et al. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A deep gulf divides rich and poor in these cities, with usually contain a super-wealthy elite living in [[gated community|gated communities]] and large masses of people living in substandard housing with inadequate infrastructure and otherwise poor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Shipra Narang Suri &amp; Günther Taube, "Governance in Megacities: Experiences, Challenges and Implications for International Cooperation"; in Kraas et al.

{{Further|Local government}}
[[File:City Council of Tehran, 17 September 2015.jpg|thumb|The [[city council]] of [[Tehran]] meets in September 2015.]]
[[Local government]] of cities takes different forms including prominently the [[municipality]] (especially [[local government in England|in England]], [[local government in the United States|in the United States]], [[municipal governance in India|in India]], and in other [[crown colonies|British colonies]]; legally, the [[municipal corporation]];&lt;ref&gt;Joan C. Williams, "[http://repository.uchastings.edu/faculty_scholarship/809/ The Invention of the Municipal Corporation: A Case Study in Legal Change]"; ''American University Law Review'' 34, 1985; pp. 369–438.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[municipio]]'' in [[Municipalities of Spain|Spain]] and [[Municipalities of Portugal|in Portugal]], and, along with ''[[municipalidad]]'', in most former parts of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires) and the ''commune'' ([[communes in France|in France]] and [[Communes of Chile|in Chile]]; or ''[[comune]]'' in Italy).

The chief official of the city has the title of [[mayor]]. Whatever their true degree of political authority, the mayor typically acts as the [[figurehead]] or personification of their city.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 146. "The figurehead of city leadership is, of course, the mayor. As 'first citizen', mayors are often associated with political parties, yet many of the most successful mayors are often those whoare able to speak 'for' their city. Rudy Giuliani, for example, while pursuing a neo-liberal political agenda, was often seen as being outside the mainstream of the national Republican party. Furthermore, mayors are often crucial in articulating the interests of their cities to external agents, be they national governments or major public and private investors."&lt;/ref&gt;

City governments have authority to make [[law]]s governing activity within cities, while its [[jurisdiction]] is generally considered [[conflict of laws|subordinate]] (in ascending order) to [[State government|state/provincial]], [[central government|national]], and perhaps [[international law]]. This hierarchy of law is not enforced rigidly in practice—for example in conflicts between municipal regulations and national principles such as [[constitutional right]]s and [[property rights]].&lt;ref name=Blomley2013&gt;Nicholas Blomley, "What Sort of a Legal Space is a City?" in Brighenti (2013), pp. 1–20. "Municipalities, within this frame, are understood as nested within the jurisdictional space of the provinces. Indeed, rather than freestanding legal sites, they are imagined as products (or 'creatures') of the provinces who may bring them into being or dissolve them as they choose. As with the provinces their powers are of a delegated form: they may only exercise jurisdiction over areas that have been expressly identified by enabling legislation. Municipal law may not conflict with provincial law, and may only be exercised within its defined territory. […] &lt;br&gt; Yet we are [in] danger [of] missing the reach of municipal law: '[e]ven in highly constitutionalized regimes, it has remained possible for municipalities to micro-manage space, time, and activities through police regulations that infringe both on constitutional rights and private property in often extreme ways' (Vaverde 2009: 150). While liberalism fears the encroachments of the state, it seems less worried about those of the municipality. Thus if a national government proposed a statute forbidding public gatherings or sporting events, a revolution would occur. Yet municipalities routinely enact sweeping by-laws directed at open ended (and ill-defined) offences such as loitering and obstruction, requiring permits for protests or requiring residents and homeowners to remove snow from the city's sidewalks."&lt;/ref&gt; Legal conflicts and issues arise more frequently in cities than elsewhere due to the bare fact of their greater density.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan (1937/1987), §1.63. "The problem of achieving equitable balance between the two freedoms is infinitely greater in urban, metropolitan and megalopolitan situations than in sparsely settled districts and rural areas. / In the latter, sheer intervening space acts as a buffer between the privacy and well-being of one resident and the potential encroachments thereon by his neighbors in the form of noise, air or water pollution, absence of sanitation, or whatever. In a congested urban situation, the individual is powerless to protect himself from the "free" (i.e., inconsiderate or invasionary) acts of others without himself being guilty of a form of encroachment."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern city governments thoroughly [[regulation|regulate]] [[everyday life]] in many dimensions, including [[public health|public]] and personal [[health]], [[transport]], [[burial]], [[resource]] use and [[resource extraction|extraction]], [[recreation]], and the nature and use of [[building]]s. Technologies, techniques, and laws governing these areas—developed in cities—have become ubiquitous in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan (1937/1987), §1.08.&lt;/ref&gt;
Municipal officials may be appointed from a higher level of government or elected locally.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan (1937/1987), §1.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Municipal services ===
[[File:Aftermath of a huge fire at Thomas McKenzie &amp; Sons Ltd. on Pearse Street, Dublin.jpg|thumb|The [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] pictured in April 1970, quenching a severe fire at a hardware store.]]

Cities typically provide [[municipal services]] such as [[education]], through [[school system]]s; [[police|policing]], through police departments; and [[firefighting]], through [[fire department]]s; as well as the city's basic infrastructure. These are provided more or less routinely, in a more or less equal fashion.&lt;ref name=JonesEtAl1980&gt;Bryan D. Jones, Saadia R. Greenbeg, Clifford Kaufman, &amp; Joseph Drew, "Service Delivery Rules and the Distribution of Local Government Services: Three Detroit Bureaucracies"; in Hahn &amp; Levine (1980). "Local government bureaucracies more or less explicitly accept the goal of implementing rational criteria for the delivery of services to citizens, even though compromises may have to be made in the establishment of these criteria. These production oriented criteria often give rise to "service deliver rules", regularized procedures for the delivery of services, which are attempts to codify the productivity goals of urban service bureaucracies. These rules have distinct, definable distributional consequences which often go unrecognized. That is, the decisions of governments to adopt rational service delivery rules can (and usually do) differentially benefit citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lineberry&gt;Robert L. Lineberry, "Mandating Urban Equality: The Distribution of Municipal Public Services"; in Hahn &amp; Levine (1980). See: [[Shaw, Mississippi|Hawkins v. Town of Shaw]] (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for administration usually falls on the city government, though some services may be operated by a higher level of government,&lt;ref&gt;George Nilson, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-state-control-police-20170228-story.html Baltimore police under state control for good reason]", ''Baltimore Sun'' 28 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; while others may be privately run.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jay Dilger, Randolph R. Moffett, &amp; Linda Stuyk, "Privatization of Municipal Services in America's Largest Cities", ''Public Administration Review'' 57(1), 1997; {{doi|10.2307/976688}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Armies may assume responsibility for policing cities in states of domestic turmoil such as America's [[King assassination riots]] of 1968.

=== Finance ===

The traditional basis for municipal finance is local [[property tax]] levied on [[real estate]] within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns.&lt;ref name=Gwilliam2013 /&gt; However, financing municipal services, as well as [[urban renewal]] and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as [[privatization]] (selling services into the [[private sector]]), [[corporatization]] (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and [[financialization]] (packaging city assets into tradable [[financial instrument]]s and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of [[city limits]] and therefore beyond the reach of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan (1937/1987), §§1.65–1.66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, "The New System of Intergovernmental Relations: Fiscal Relief and More Governmental Intrusions"; in Hahn &amp; Levine (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bart Voorn, Marieke L. van Genugten, &amp; Sandra van Thiel, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03003930.2017.1319360 The efficiency and effectiveness of municipally owned corporations: a systematic review]", ''Local Government Studies'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber2010 /&gt; Cities in search of [[cash and cash equivalents|ready cash]] increasingly resort to the [[municipal bond]], essentially a loan with [[Maturity (finance)|interest]] and a [[Maturity (finance)|repayment date]].&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Weber, "[https://www.academia.edu/download/33030948/09-Weber-Extracting-Value-from-the-City.pdf Extracting Value from the City: Neoliberalism and Urban Redevelopment]",{{dead link|date=October 2017}} ''Antipode'', July 2002; {{doi|10.1111/1467-8330.00253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; City governments have also begun to use [[tax increment financing]], in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield.&lt;ref name=Weber2010&gt;Rachel Weber, "Selling City Futures: The Financialization of Urban Redevelopment Policy"; ''Economic Geography'' 86(3), 2010; {{doi|10.1111/j.1944-8287.2010.01077.x}}. "TIF is an increasingly popular local redevelopment policy that allows municipalities to designate a 'blighted' area for redevelopment and use the expected increase in property (and occasionally sales) taxes there to pay for initial and ongoing redevelopment expenditures, such as land acquisition, demolition, construction, and project financing. Because developers require cash up-front, cities transform promises of future tax revenues into securities that far-flung buyers and sellers exchange through local markets."&lt;/ref&gt; Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city [[credit rating]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Pacewicz, "Tax increment financing, economic development professionals and the financialization of urban politics"; ''Socio-Economic Review'' 11, 2013; {{doi|10.1093/ser/mws019}}. "A city's credit rating not only influences its ability to sell bonds, but has become a general signal of fiscal health. Detroit's partial recovery in the early 1990s, for example, was reversed when Moody's downgraded the rating of the city's general obligation bonds, precipitating new rounds of capital flight (Hackworth, 2007). The need to maintain a high credit rating constrains municipal actors by making it difficult to finance discretionary projects in traditional ways."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Governance ===
[[Governance]] includes government but refers to a wider domain of [[social control]] functions implemented by many actors including [[nongovernmental organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta et al. (2015), pp. 4, 29. "We thereby understand urban governance as the multiple ways through which city governments, businesses and residents interact in managing their urban space and life, nested within the context of other government levels and actors who are managing their space, resulting in a variety of urban governance configurations (Peyroux et al. 2014)."&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of globalization and the role of [[multinational corporation]]s in local governments worldwide, has led to a shift in perspective on urban governance, away from the "urban regime theory" in which a coalition of local interests functionally govern, toward a theory of outside economic control, widely associated in academics with the philosophy of [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; In the neoliberal model of governance, public utilities are [[privatization|privatized]], industry is [[deregulation|deregulated]], and [[corporation]]s gain the status of governing actors—as indicated by the power they wield in [[public-private partnerships]] and over [[business improvement districts]], and in the expectation of self-regulation through [[corporate social responsibility]]. The biggest [[investor]]s and [[real estate developer]]s act as the city's [[de facto]] urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Verrest, and Jaffe, "Theorizing Governance", in Gupta et al. (2015), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The related concept of [[good governance]] places more emphasis on the state, with the purpose of assessing urban governments for their suitability for [[development assistance]].&lt;ref name=Gupta2015p33&gt;Gupta, Verrest, and Jaffe, "Theorizing Governance", in Gupta et al. (2015), pp. 31–33. "The concept of good governance itself was developed in the 1980s, primarily to guide donors in development aid (Doonbos 2001:93). It has been used both as a condition for aid and a development goal in its own right. Key terms in definitions of good governance include participation, accountability, transparency, equity, efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness, and rule of law (e.g. Ginther and de Waart 1995; UNDP 1997; Woods 1999; Weiss 2000). […] At the urban level, this normative model has been articulated through the idea of good urban governance, promoted by agencies such as UN Habitat. The Colombian city of Bogotá has sometimes been presented as a model city, given its rapid improvements in fiscal responsibility, provision of public services and infrastructure, public behavior, honesty of the administration, and civic pride."&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of governance and good governance are especially invoked in the emergent megacities, where international organizations consider existing governments inadequate for their large populations.&lt;ref&gt;Shipra Narang Suri &amp; Günther Taube, "Governance in Megacities: Experiences, Challenges and Implications for International Cooperation"; in Kraas et al. (2014), pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban planning ===
[[File:La Plata desde el aire.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[La Plata]], Argentina, based on a perfect square with 5196-meter sides, was designed in the 1880s as the new capital of [[Buenos Aires Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Alain Garnier, "[http://lasur.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lasur2/files/Images/stories/editions_du_lasur_pdf/AC/AC%20Vol%204%20No.1/GARNIER.pdf La Plata: la visionnaire trahie]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"; ''Architecture &amp; Comportment'' 4(1), 1988, pp. 59–79.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Urban planning|Urban design}}

[[Urban planning]], the application of forethought to city design, involves optimizing land use, transportation, utilities, and other basic systems, in order to achieve [[Technical aspects of urban planning|certain objectives]]. Urban planners and scholars have proposed overlapping [[theories of urban planning|theories]] as ideals for how plans should be formed. Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include [[public capital]] investment in infrastructure and [[Land-use planning|land-use controls]] such as [[zoning]]. The continuous process of [[comprehensive planning]] involves identifying general objectives as well as collecting data to evaluate progress and inform future decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2017), pp. 193–235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McQuillin1987planning /&gt;

Government, as the [[monopoly on violence|ultimate wielder of force]] is legally the final authority on planning but in practice the process involves both public and private elements. The legal principle of [[eminent domain]] is used by government to divest citizens of their property in cases where its use is required for a project.&lt;ref name=McQuillin1987planning&gt;McQuillin (1937/1987), §§1.75–179. "Zoning, a relatively recent development in the administration of local governmental units, concerns itself with the control of the use of land and structures, the size of buildings, and the use-intensity of building sites. Zoning being an exercise of the police power, it must be justified by such considerations as the protection of public health and safety, the preservation of taxable property values, and the enhancement of community welfare. […] Municipal powers to implement and effectuate city plans are usually ample. Among these is the power of eminent domain, which has been used effectively in connection with slum clearance and the rehabilitation of blighted areas. Also available to cities in their implementation of planning objectives are municipal powers of zoning, subdivision control and the regulation of building, housing and sanitation principles."&lt;/ref&gt; Planning often involves tradeoffs—decisions in which some stand to gain and some to lose—and thus is closely connected to the prevailing political situation.&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2017), p. 10. "Planning is a highly political activity. It is immersed in politics and inseparable from the law. [...] Planning decisions often involve large sums of money, both public and private. Even when little public expenditure is involved, planning decisions can deliver large benefits to some and large losses at others."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of urban planning]] dates to some of the earliest known cities, especially in the Indus Valley and Mesoamerican civilizations, which built their cities on grids and apparently zoned different areas for different purposes.&lt;ref name=Smith2002 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Hardoy, ''Urban Planning in Pre-Columbian America''; New York: George Braziller, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of planning, ubiquitous in today's world, can be seen most clearly in the layout of [[planned community|planned communities]], fully designed prior to construction, often with consideration for interlocking physical, economic, and cultural systems.

== Society ==

=== Social structure ===
[[Urban sociology|Urban society]] is typically [[social stratification|stratified]]. Spatially, cities are formally or informally [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] along ethnic, economic and racial lines. People living relatively close together may live, work, and play, in separate areas, and associate with different people, forming [[ethnic enclave|ethnic]] or [[lifestyle enclave|lifestyle]] enclaves or, in areas of concentrated poverty, [[ghetto]]es. While in the US and elsewhere poverty became associated with the [[inner city]], in France it has become associated with the ''[[banlieue]]s'', areas of urban development which surround the city proper. Meanwhile, across Europe and North America, the racially [[white people|white]] majority is empirically the most segregated group. [[Suburb]]s in the west, and, increasingly, [[gated communities]] and other forms of "privatopia" around the world, allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive [[neighborhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), pp. 131–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landless urban workers, contrasted with [[peasant]]s and known as the [[proletariat]], form a growing stratum of society in the age of urbanization. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, the proletariat will inevitably [[proletarian revolution|revolt]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] as their ranks swell with disenfranchised and disaffected people lacking all stake in the [[status quo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]], ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'' ([https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ online]), February 1848; translated from German to English by Samuel Moore. "But with the development of industry, the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level."&lt;/ref&gt; The global urban proletariat of today, however, generally lacks the status as factory workers which in the nineteenth century provided access to the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name=Davis2004&gt;Mike Davis, "The Urbanization of Empire: Megacities and the Laws of Chaos"; ''Social Text'' 22(4), Winter 2004. "Although studies of the so-called urban informal economy have shown myriad secret liaisons with outsourced multinational production systems, the larger fact is that hundreds of millions of new urbanites must further subdivide the peripheral economic niches of personal service, casual labor, street vending, rag picking, begging, and crime. &lt;br&gt; This outcast proletariat—perhaps 1.5 billion people today, 2.5 billion by 2030—is the fastest-growing and most novel social class on the planet. By and large, the urban informal working class is not a labor reserve army in the nineteenth-century sense: a backlog of strikebreakers during booms; to be expelled during busts; then reabsorbed again in the next expansion. On the contrary, this is a mass of humanity structurally and biologically redundant to the global accumulation and the corporate matrix.&lt;br&gt; It is ontologically both similar and dissimilar to the historical agency described in the ''Communist Manifesto''. Like the traditional working classes, it has radical chains in the sense of having little vested interest in the reproduction of private property. But it is not a socialized collectivity of labor and it lacks significant power to disrupt or seize the means of production. It does possess, however, yet unmeasured powers of subverting urban order."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===

Historically, cities rely on [[rural area]]s for [[intensive farming]] to [[crop yield|yield surplus crops]], in exchange for which they provide money, political administration, manufactured goods, and culture.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2004p155 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Marshall1989p15 /&gt; [[Urban economics]] tends to analyze larger agglomerations, stretching beyond city limits, in order to reach a more complete understanding of the local [[labor market]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1989), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Market in Taipei - DSC01062.JPG|thumb|People shopping for [[food]] at a marketplace in [[Taipei City]].]]

As hubs of trade cities have long been home to [[retail]] commerce and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] through the interface of [[shopping]]. In the 20th century, [[department store]]s using new techniques of [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[decorative arts|decoration]], and [[design]], transformed urban shopping areas into [[fantasy world]]s encouraging self-expression and escape through [[consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 160–164. "Indeed, the design of the buildings often revolves around the consumable fantasy experience, seen most markedly in the likes of Universal CityWalk, Disneyland and Las Vegas. Architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable (1997) names architectural structures built specifically as entertainment spaces as ‘Architainment’. These places are, of course, places to make money, but they are also stages of performance for an interactive consumer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leach (1993), pp. 173–176 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the density of cities expedites commerce and facilitates [[knowledge spillover]]s, helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/files/br/brq401gc.pdf |title=Knowledge Spillovers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CalderFreytas2009&gt;Kent E. Calder &amp; Mariko de Freytas, "[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/269254 Global Political Cities as Actors in Twenty-First Century International Affairs]; "SAIS Review of International Affairs" 29(1), Winter-Spring 2009; {{doi|10.1353/sais.0.0036}}. "Beneath state-to-state dealings, a flurry of activity occurs, with interpersonal networks forming policy communities involving embassies, think tanks, academic institutions, lobbying firms, politicians, congressional staff, research centers, NGOs, and intelligence agencies. This interaction at the level of 'technostructure'—heavily oriented toward information gathering and incremental policy modification—is too complex and voluminous to be monitored by top leadership, yet nevertheless often has important implications for policy."&lt;/ref&gt; A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals. Population density enables also sharing of common infrastructure and production facilities, however in very dense cities, increased crowding and waiting times may lead to some negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Borowiecki | first1 = Karol J.| title = Agglomeration Economies in Classical Music| journal = Papers in Regional Science |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=443–468| year = 2015| url = https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2013.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[manufacturing]] fueled the growth of cities, many now rely on a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary]] or [[service economy]]. The services in question range from [[tourism]], [[hospitality industry|hospitality]], [[entertainment]], [[housekeeping]] and [[prostitution]] to [[grey-collar]] work in [[legal outsourcing|law]], [[financial services|finance]], and [[management|administration]].&lt;ref name=Kaplan2004p164 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Saskia Sassen]], "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saskia_Sassen/publication/246326854_Global_Cities_and_Survival_Circuits/links/5411771c0cf29e4a2329630c.pdf Global Cities and Survival Circuits]"; in ''Global Woman: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy'' ed. [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]; New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture and communications ===
Cities are typically hubs for [[education]] and [[the arts]], supporting [[university|universities]], [[museum]]s, [[temple]]s, and other [[cultural institutions]].&lt;ref name=Marshall14 /&gt; They feature impressive displays of [[architecture]] ranging from small to enormous and ornate to [[Brutalist architecture|brutal]]; [[skyscrapers]], providing thousands of offices or homes within a small footprint, and visible from miles away, have become iconic urban features.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009) 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural elites tend to live in cities, bound together by shared [[cultural capital]], and themselves playing some role in governance.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Zheng, "Toward a new concept of the 'cultural elite state': Cultural capital and the urban sculpture planning authority in elite coalition in Shanghai"; ''Journal of Urban Affairs'' 39(4), 2017; {{doi|10.1080/07352166.2016.1255531}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of their status as centers of culture and literacy, cities can be described as the locus of [[civilization]], [[history of the world|world history]], and [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;McQuillan (1937/1987), §§1.04–1.05. "Almost by definition, cities have always provided the setting for great events and have been the focal points for social change and human development. All great cultures have been city-born. World history is basically the history of city dwellers."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Redfield &amp; Milton B. Singer, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1151661 The Cultural Role of Cities]"; ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 3(1), October 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

Density makes for effective [[mass communication]] and transmission of [[news]], through [[herald]]s, printed [[proclamation]]s, [[newspaper]]s, and digital media. These communication networks, though still using cities as hubs, penetrate extensively into all populated areas. In the age of rapid communication and transportation, commentators have described urban culture as nearly ubiquitous&lt;ref name=HugoEtAl2003 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson (2011), p. 21. "These statistics probably underestimate the degree to which the world has been urbanized, since they obscure the fact that rural areas have become so much more urban as a result of modern transportation and communication. A farmer in Europe or California who checks the markets every morning on the computer, negotiates with product brokers in distant cities, buys food at a supermarket, watches television every night, and takes vacations half a continent away is not exactly living a traditional rural life. In most respects such a farmer is an urbanite living in the countryside, albeit an urbanite who has many good reasons for perceiving himself or herself as a rural person."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mumford (1961), pp. 563–567. "Many of the original functions of the city, once natural monopolies, demanding the physical presence of all participants, have now been transposed into forms capable of swift transportation, mechanical manifolding, electronic transmission, worldwide distribution."&lt;/ref&gt; or as no longer meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Theall, ''The Virtual Marshall McLuhan''; McGill-Queen's University Press, 2001; {{ISBN|0773521194}}; p. 11. Quoting [[Marshall McLuhan]]: "The CITY no longer exists, except as a cultural ghost [...] The INSTANTANEOUS global coverage of radio-tv makes the city form meaningless, functionless."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a city's promotion of its cultural activities dovetails with [[place branding]] and [[city marketing]], [[public diplomacy]] techniques used to inform development strategy; to attract businesses, investors, residents, and tourists; and to create a [[collective identity|shared identity]]  and [[sense of place]] within the metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Kavaratzis, &amp; Warnaby, "The Need to Rethink Place Branding"; in Kavaratzis, Warnaby, &amp; Ashworth (2015), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wachsmuth2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Campelo, "Rethinking Sense of Place: Sense of One and Sense of Many"; in Kavaratzis, Warnaby, &amp; Ashworth (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KerrOliver2015&gt;Greg Kerr &amp; Jessica Oliver, "Rethinking Place Identities", in Kavaratzis, Warnaby, &amp; Ashworth (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Physical inscriptions, [[Historical marker|plaques,]] and [[monument]]s on display physically transmit a historical context for urban places.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), 186–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities, such as [[Jerusalem]], [[Mecca]], and [[Rome]] have indelible religious status and for hundreds of years have attracted [[pilgrim]]s. Patriotic tourists visit [[Agra]] to see the [[Taj Mahal]], or [[New York City]] to visit the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]]. [[Elvis]] lovers visit [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to pay their respects at [[Graceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham, et al. (2009), pp. 41, 189–192.&lt;/ref&gt; Place brands (which include place satisfaction and place loyalty) have great economic value (comparable to the value of commodity [[brand]]s) because of their influence on the [[decision-making process]] of people thinking about doing business in—"purchasing" (the brand of)—a city.&lt;ref name=KerrOliver2015 /&gt;

[[Bread and circuses]] among other forms of cultural appeal, attract and entertain [[commoner|the masses]].&lt;ref name=MoholyNagy1968p136&gt;Moholy-Nagy (1968), pp. 136–137. "Why do anonymous people—the poor, the underprivileged, the unconnected—frequently prefer life under miserable conditions in tenements to the healthy order and tranquility of small towns or the sanitary subdivisions of semirural developments? The imperial planners and architects knew the answer, which is as valid today as it was 2,000 years ago. Big cities were created as power images of a competitive society, conscious of its achievement potential. Those who came to live in them did so in order to participate and compete on any attainable level. Their aim was to share in public life, and they were willing to pay for this share with personal discomfort. 'Bread and games' was a cry for opportunity and entertainment still ranking foremost among urban objectives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred Coalter, "[http://storre.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/1742 The FIFA World Cup and Social Cohesion: Bread and Circuses or Bread and Butter?]"; International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education ''Bulletin'' [http://www.icsspe.org/content/no-53-cd-rom 53], May 2008 (Feature: Feature: "Mega Sport Events in Developing Countries").&lt;/ref&gt; Sports also play a major role in city branding and local [[Identity (social science)|identity]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly S Schimmel, "Assessing the sociology of sport: On sport and the city"; ''International Review for the Sociology for Sport'' 50(4–5), 2015; {{doi|10.1177/1012690214539484}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities go to considerable lengths in competing to host the [[Olympic Games]], which bring global attention and tourism.&lt;ref name=Ward2008&gt;Stephen V. Ward, "Promoting the Olympic City"; in John R. Gold &amp; Margaret M. Gold, eds., ''Olympic Cities: City Agendas, Planning and the World's Games, 1896–2016; London &amp; New York: Routledge (Taylor &amp; Francis), 2008/2011; {{ISBN|978-0203840740}}. "All this media exposure, provided it is reasonably positive, influences many tourist decisions at the time of the Games. This tourism impact will focus on, but extend beyond, the city to the country and the wider global region. More importantly, there is also huge long term potential for both tourism and investment (Kasimati, 2003). &lt;br&gt; No other city marketing opportunity achieves this global exposure. At the same time, provided it is carefully managed at the local level, it also gives a tremendous opportunity to heighten and mobilize the commitment of citizens to their own city. The competitive nature of sport and its unrivalled capacity to be enjoyed as a mass cultural activity gives it many advantages from the marketing point of view (S.V. Ward, 1998, pp. 231–232). In a more subtle way it also becomes a metaphor for the notion of cities having to compete in a global marketplace, a way of reconciling citizens and local institutions to the wider economic realities of the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warfare ===
[[File:The Second World War 1939-45- Victory and Aftermath IND5196.jpg|thumb|[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombing]] on August 6, 1945, devastated the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]].]]
Cities play a crucial strategic role in [[warfare]] due to their economic, demographic, symbolic, and political centrality. For the same reasons, they are targets in [[asymmetric warfare]]. Many cities throughout history were founded under military auspices, a great many have incorporated [[fortification]]s, and military principles continue to [[military urbanism|influence urban design]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, war may have served as the social rationale and economic basis for the very earliest cities.&lt;ref name=Mumfurd1961war&gt;Mumford (1961), pp. 39–46. "As the physical means increased, this one-sided power mythology, sterile, indeed hostile to life, pushed its way into every corner of the urban scene and found, in the ''new'' institution of organized war, its completest expression. […] Thus both the physical form and the institutional life of the city, from the very beginning to the urban implosion, were shaped in no small measure by the irrational and magical purposes of war. From this source sprang the elaborate system of fortifications, with walls, ramparts, towers, canals, ditches, that continued to characterize the chief historic cities, apart from certain special cases—as during the Pax Romana—down to the eighteenth century. […] War brought concentration of social leadership and political power in the hands of a weapons-bearing minority, abetted by a priesthood exercising sacred powers and possessing secret but valuable scientific and magical knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ashworth1991p12 /&gt;

Powers engaged in [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] conflict have established fortified settlements as part of military strategies, as in the case of [[garrison]] towns, America's [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and [[Israeli settlement]]s in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1991). "In more recent years, planned networks of defended settlements as part of military strategies can be found in the pacification programmes of what has become the conventional wisdom of anti-insurgency operations. Connected networks of protected settlements are inserted as islands of government control into insurgent areas—either defensively to separate existing populations from insurgents or aggressively as a means of extending control over areas—as used by the British in South Africa (1899–1902) and Malaya (1950–3) and by the Americans in Cuba (1898) and Vietnam (1965–75). These were generally small settlements and intended as much for local security as offensive operations. / The planned settlement policy of the State of Israel, however, has been both more comprehensive and has longer-term objectives. [...] These settlements provide a source of armed manpower, a defence in depth of a vulnerable frontier area and islands of cultural and political control in the midst of a potentially hostile population, thus continuing a tradition of the use of such settlements as part of similar policies in that area which is over 2,000 years old."&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Philippine–American War|occupying]] the [[Philippines]], the US Army ordered local people concentrated into cities and towns, in order to isolate committed insurgents and battle freely against them in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;See Brigadier General [[J. Franklin Bell]]'s telegraphic circular to all station commanders, 8 December 1901, in Robert D. Ramsey III, ''[http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/ramseyop25.pdf A Masterpiece of Counterguerrilla Warfare: BG J.

"Commanding officers will also see that orders are at once given and distributed to all the inhabitants within the jurisdiction of towns over which they exercise supervision, informing them of the danger of remaining outside of these limits and that unless they move by December 25th from outlying barrios and districts with all their movable food supplies, including rice, palay, chickens, live stock, etc., to within the limits of the zone established at their own or nearest town, their property (found outside of said zone at said date) will become liable to confiscation or destruction."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maj.

During [[World War II]], national governments on occasion declared certain cities [[open city|open]], effectively [[surrender (military)|surrendering]] them to an advancing enemy in order to avoid damage and bloodshed. Urban warfare proved decisive, however, in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where Soviet forces repulsed German occupiers, with extreme casualties and destruction. In an era of [[low-intensity conflict]] and rapid urbanization, cities have become sites of long-term conflict waged both by foreign occupiers and by local governments against [[insurgency]].&lt;ref name=Davis2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1991), p. 3. Citing L.C. Peltier and G.E. Pearcy, ''Military Geography'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Such warfare, known as [[counterinsurgency]], involves techniques of surveillance and [[psychological warfare]] as well as [[close combat]],&lt;ref&gt;R.D. McLaurin &amp; R. Miller. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA219359 Urban Counterinsurgency: Case Studies and Implications for U.S. Military Forces]''. Springfield, VA: Abbott Associates, October 1989. Produced for U.S. Army Human Engineering Laboratory at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]].&lt;/ref&gt; functionally extends modern urban [[crime prevention]], which already uses concepts such as [[defensible space theory|defensible space]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1991), pp. 91–93. "However, some specific sorts of crime, together with those antisocial activities which may or may not be treated as crime (such as vandalism, graffiti daubing, littering and even noisy or boisterous behavior), do play various roles in the process of insurgency. This leads in consequence to defensive reactions on the part of those responsible for public security, and by individual citizens concerned for their personal safety. The authorities react with situational crime prevention as part of the armoury of urban defense, and individuals fashion their behavior according to an 'urban geography of fear'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although capture is the more common objective, warfare has in some cases spelt complete destruction for a city. Mesopotamian [[Cuneiform script#List of major Cuneiform tablet discoveries|tablets]] and [[ruins]] attest to such destruction,&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1981), p. 132 "Physical destruction and ensuing decline of population were certain to be particularly severe in the case of cities that joined unsuccessful rebellions, or whose ruling dynasts were overcome by others in abbtle. The traditional lamentations provide eloquently stylized literary accounts of this, while in other cases the combinations of archaeological evidence with the testimony of a city's like Ur's victorious opponent as to its destruction grounds the world of metaphor in harsh reality (Brinkman 1969, pp. 311–312)."&lt;/ref&gt; as does the Latin motto ''[[Carthago delenda est]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fabien Limonier, "[http://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1999_num_101_3_4773 Rome et la destruction de Carthage: un crime gratuit?]" ''Revue des Études Anciennes'' 101(3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, "[http://gsp.yale.edu/sites/default/files/first_genocide.pdf The First Genocide: Carthage, 146 BC]"; ''Diogenes'' 203, 2004; {{doi|10.1177/0392192104043648}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and throughout the [[Cold War]], [[Nuclear strategy|nuclear strategists]] continued to contemplate the use of "[[countervalue]]" targeting: crippling an enemy by annihilating its valuable cities, rather than [[counterforce|aiming primarily at its military forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns H. Westou, "[http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/7673710-westou.pdf Nuclear Weapons Versus International Law: A Contextual Reassessment]"; ''McGill Law Journal'' 28, p. 577. "As noted above, nulcear weapons designed for countervalue or city-killing purposes tend to be of the strategic class, with known yields of deployed warheads averaging somewhere between two and three times and 1500 times the firepower of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dallas Boyd, "[http://www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/digital/pdf/Spring16/Boyd.pdf Revealed Preference and the Minimum Requirements of Nuclear Deterrence]"; ''Strategic Studies Quarterly'', Spring 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
Urban [[infrastructure]] involves various physical networks and spaces necessary for transportation, water use, energy, recreation, and public functions.&lt;ref name=Tarr&gt;[[Joel A. Tarr]], "The Evolution of the Urban Infrastructure in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries"; in Hanson (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure carries a high initial cost in [[fixed capital]] (pipes, wires, plants, vehicles, etc.) but lower [[marginal cost]]s and thus positive [[economies of scale]].&lt;ref name=WellmanSpiller2012&gt;Wellman &amp; Spiller, "Introduction", in Wellman &amp; Spiller (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the higher [[barriers to entry]], these networks have been classified as [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]], meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization, public or private.&lt;ref name=Bakker2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WellmanPretorius2012 /&gt;{{efn|In practice, utility companies and agencies do secure [[monopoly|monopolies]] over local service provision. Critics within the [[economics]] field have contested the inevitability of this outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas DiLorenzo, "[http://png.cdn.mises.org.468elmp01.blackmesh.com/sites/default/files/rae9_2_3_3.pdf The Myth of Natural Monopoly]"; ''Review of Australian Economics'' 9(2), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Guldmann, "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1985.tb00852.x/pdf Economies of Scale and Natural Monopoly in Urban Utilities: The Case of Natural Gas Distribution]"; ''Geographical Analysis'' 17(4), October 1985; {{doi|10.1111/j.1538-4632.1985.tb00852.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Infrastructure in general (if not every infrastructure project) plays a vital role in a city's capacity for economic activity and expansion, underpinning the very survival of the city's inhabitants, as well as technological, commercial, industrial, and social activities.&lt;ref name=Tarr /&gt;&lt;ref name=WellmanSpiller2012 /&gt; Structurally, many infrastructure systems take the form of [[network theory|networks]] with redundant links and multiple pathways, so that the system as a whole continue to operate even if parts of it fail.&lt;ref name=WellmanPretorius2012&gt;Kath Wellman &amp; Frederik Pretorius, "Urban Infrastructure: Productivity, Project Evaluation, and Finance"; in Wellman &amp; Spiller (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The particulars of a city's infrastructure systems have historical [[path dependence]] because new development must build from what exists already.&lt;ref name=WellmanSpiller2012 /&gt;

[[Megaproject]]s such as the construction of [[airport]]s, [[power plant]]s, and [[railway]]s require large upfront investments and thus tend to require funding from national government or the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WellmanPretorius2012 /&gt; Privatization may also extend to all levels of infrastructure construction and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Kath Wellman &amp; Frederik Pretorius, "Urban Infrastructure: Productivity, Project Evaluation, and Finance"; in Wellman &amp; Spiller (2012), pp. 73–74. "The NCP established a legislative regime at Federal and State levels to facilitate third-party access to provision and operation of infrastructure facilities, including electricity and telecommunications networks, gas and water pipelines, railroad terminals and networks, airports, and ports. Following these reforms, few countries embarked on a larger scale initiative than Australia to privatize delivery and management of public infrastructure at all levels of government."&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban infrastructure ideally serves all residents equally but in practice may prove uneven—with, in some cities, clear first-class and second-class alternatives.&lt;ref name=Lineberry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 75. "By the 1960s, however, this 'integrated ideal' was being challenged, public infrastructure entering into crisis. There is now a new orthodoxy in many branches of urban planning: 'The logic is now for planners to fight for the best possible networked infrastructures for their specialized district, in partnership with (often privatised and internationalised network) operators, rather than seeking to orchestrate how networks roll out through the city as a whole' (Graham and Marvin, 2001: 113).&lt;br&gt;In the context of development theory, these 'secessionary' infrastructures physically by-pass sectors of cities unable to afford the necessary cabling, pipe-laying, or streetscaping that underpins service provision. Cities such as Manila, Lagos or Mumbai are thus increasingly characterized by a two-speed mode of urbanisation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker2003 /&gt;

=== Utilities ===
[[Public utility|Public utilities]] (literally, useful things with general availability) include basic and essential infrastructure networks, chiefly concerned with the supply of water, electricity, and telecommunications capability to the populace.&lt;ref&gt;"public, adj. and n.", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanitation]], necessary for good health in crowded conditions, requires water supply and [[waste management]] as well as individual [[hygiene]]. Urban [[water]] systems include principally a [[water supply network]] and a network for [[wastewater]] including [[sewage]] and [[stormwater]]. [[History of water supply and sanitation|Historically]], either local governments or private companies have administered urban [[water supply]], with a tendency toward government water supply in the 20th century and a tendency toward private operation at the turn of the twenty-first.&lt;ref name=Bakker2003 /&gt;{{efn|Water resources in rapidly urbanizing areas are not merely ''privatized'' as they are in western countries; since the systems don't exist to begin with, private contracts also entail water [[Water industry|industrialization]] and [[wikt:enclosure|enclosure]].&lt;ref name=Bakker2003 /&gt; Also, there is a countervailing trend: 100 cities have ''re''-municipalized their water supply since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Lobina, David Hall, &amp; Vladimir Popov, "List of water remunicipalisations in Asia and worldwide – As of April 2014"; [[Public Services International Research Unit]], University of Greenwich.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The market for private water services is dominated by two French companies, [[Veolia Water]] (formerly [[Vivendi]]) and [[Engie]] (formerly [[Suez (company)|Suez]]), said to hold 70% of all water contracts worldwide.&lt;ref name=Bakker2003&gt;Karen Bakker, "Archipelagos and networks: urbanization and water privatization in the South"; ''The Geographical Journal'' 169(4), December 2003; {{doi|10.1111/j.0016-7398.2003.00097.x}}. "The diversity of water supply management systems worldwide—which operate along a continuum between fully public and fully private—bear witness to repeated shifts back and forth between private and public ownership and management of water systems."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Goldman8/publication/222173476_How_Water_for_All_policy_became_hegemonic_The_power_of_the_World_Bank_and_its_transnational_policy_networks/links/569d1e4408ae03384dd049c5/How-Water-for-All-policy-became-hegemonic-The-power-of-the-World-Bank-and-its-transnational-policy-networks.pdf How 'Water for All!' policy became hegemonic: The power of the World Bank and its transnational policy networks]"; ''Geoforum'' 38(5), September 2007; {{doi|10.1016/j.geoforum.2005.10.008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern urban life relies heavily on the [[energy]] transmitted through [[electricity]] for the operation of [[electric machines]] (from household [[Home appliance|appliances]] to [[outline of industrial machinery|industrial machines]] to now-ubiquitous [[electronics|electronic]] systems used in communications, business, and government) and for [[traffic lights]], [[streetlights]] and indoor [[lighting]]. Cities rely to a lesser extent on [[hydrocarbon fuel]]s such as [[gasoline]] and [[natural gas]] for transportation, [[heating]], and [[cooking]]. [[Telecommunications]] infrastructure such as [[telephone line]]s and [[coaxial cables]] also traverse cities, forming dense networks for [[mass communication|mass]] and [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communications.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===
{{See also|Public transport}}
Because cities rely on specialization and an [[economic system]] based on [[wage labour]], their inhabitants must have the ability to regularly travel between home, work, commerce, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Grava (2003), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Citydwellers travel foot or by wheel on [[road]]s and [[walkway]]s, or use special [[rapid transit]] systems based on [[tunnel|underground]], [[light rail|overground]], and [[Elevated railway|elevated]] rail. Cities also rely on long-distance transportation (truck, [[rail transport|rail]], and [[airplane]]) for economic connections with other cities and rural areas.&lt;ref name=Hart2001&gt;Tom Hart, "Transport and the City"; in Paddison (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:81-540.2K-541.2K Dnipro station.jpg|thumb|[[Train]] stopped at the [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro stop]] of the [[Kiev Metro]].]]

Historically, city streets were the domain of [[horse]]s and their riders and [[pedestrian]]s, who only sometimes had [[sidewalk]]s and [[transit mall|special walking areas]] reserved for them.&lt;ref&gt;Grava (2003), pp. 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, [[bicycle]]s or ([[velocipede]]s), efficient human-powered machines for short- and medium-distance travel,&lt;ref&gt;Grava (2003),&lt;/ref&gt; enjoyed a period of popularity at the beginning of the twentieth century before the rise of automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;Smethurst pp. 67–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, they gained a more lasting foothold in Asian and African cities under European influence.&lt;ref&gt;Smethurst pp. 105–171.&lt;/ref&gt; In western cities, industrializing, expanding, and [[electrification|electrifying]] at this time, [[public transit]] systems and especially [[streetcar]]s enabled urban expansion as new residential neighborhoods sprung up along transit lines and workers rode to and from work downtown.&lt;ref name=Hart2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WhittYago1985&gt;J.

Since the mid-twentieth century, cities have relied heavily on [[motor vehicle]] transportation, with major [[effects of the car on societies|implications]] for their layout, environment, and aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Borden&gt;Iain Borden, "Automobile Interstices: Driving and the In-Between Spaces of the City"; in Brighenti (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This transformation occurred most dramatically in the US—where corporate and governmental policies favored automobile transport systems—and to a lesser extent in Europe.)&lt;ref name=Hart2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WhittYago1985 /&gt; The rise of personal [[car]]s accompanied the expansion of urban economic areas into much larger [[metropolis]]es, subsequently creating ubiquitous [[traffic]] issues with accompanying construction of new [[highways]], wider streets, and alternative [[walkway]]s for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Safdie with Wendy Kohn, ''The City After the Automobile''; BasicBooks (Harper Collins), 1997; {{ISBN|0465098363}};  pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grava (2003), pp. 128–132, 152–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al.

[[File:Ggnm.jpg|thumb|[[Rapid Metro Gurgaon|Rapid metro]] on the move in [[Gurgaon|Gurugram]], [[India]]]]
The urban [[Public transport bus service|bus system]], the world's most common form of [[public transport]], uses a network of scheduled [[bus route|routes]] to move people through the city, alongside cars, on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;Grava (2003), 301–305. "There are a great many places where [buses] are the only public service mode offered; to the best of the author's knowledge, no city that has transit operates without a bus component. Leaving aside private cars, all indicators—passengers carried, vehicle kilometers accumulated, size of fleet, accidents recorded, pollution caused, workers employed, or whatever else—show the dominance of buses among all transit modes, in this country as well as anywhere else around the world. […] At the global scale, there are probably 8000 to 10,000 communities and cities that provide organized bus transit. The larger places have other modes as well, but the bulk of these cities offers buses as their sole public means of mobility."&lt;/ref&gt; Economic function itself also became more decentralized as concentration became impractical and employers relocated to more car-friendly locations (including [[edge city|edge cities]]).&lt;ref name=Hart2001 /&gt; Some cities have introduced [[bus rapid transit]] systems which include exclusive [[bus lanes]] and other methods for prioritizing bus traffic over private cars.&lt;ref name="Gwilliam2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S.

Rapid transit is widely used in Europe and has increased in Latin America and Asia.&lt;ref name="Gwilliam2013" /&gt;

[[Walking]] and [[cycling]] ("non-motorized transport") enjoy increasing favor (more [[pedestrian zone]]s and [[bike lane]]s) in American and Asian urban transportation planning, under the influence of such trends as the [[healthy city|Healthy Cities]] movement, the drive for [[sustainable development]], and the idea of a [[carfree city]].&lt;ref name="Gwilliam2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 3428861|year = 2012|last1 = Rydin|first1 = Y.|title = Shaping cities for health: Complexity and the planning of urban environments in the 21st century|journal = Lancet|volume = 379|issue = 9831|pages = 2079–2108|last2 = Bleahu|first2 = A.|last3 = Davies|first3 = M.|last4 = Dávila|first4 = J.D.|last5 = Friel|first5 = S.|last6 = De Grandis|first6 = G.|last7 = Groce|first7 = N.|last8 = Hallal|first8 = P.C.|last9 = Hamilton|first9 = I.|last10 = Howden-Chapman|first10 = P.|last11 = Lai|first11 = K.M.|last12 = Lim|first12 = C.J.|last13 = Martins|first13 = J.|last14 = Osrin|first14 = D.|last15 = Ridley|first15 = I.|last16 = Scott|first16 = I.|last17 = Taylor|first17 = M.|last18 = Wilkinson|first18 = P.|last19 = Wilson|first19 = J.|pmid = 22651973|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60435-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/17076734 |doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2004.09.036|title=Greenways: Multiplying and diversifying in the 21st century|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=76|issue=1–4|pages=252–290|last1=Walmsley|first1=Anthony|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[road space rationing]] and [[road pricing|road use charges]] have been introduced to limit urban car traffic.&lt;ref name="Gwilliam2013" /&gt;

=== Housing ===
[[Housing]] of residents presents one of the major challenges every city must face. Adequate housing entails not only physical [[Shelter (building)|shelters]] but also the physical systems necessary to sustain life and economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;McQuillin (1937/1987), §1.74. "It cannot be too strongly emphasized that no city begins to be well-planned until it has solved its housing problem. The problems of living and working are of primary importance. These include sanitation, sufficient sewers, clean, well lighted streets, rehabilitation of slum areas, and health protection through provision for pure water and wholesome food.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owner-occupancy|Home ownership]] represents status and a modicum of economic security, compared to [[renting]] which may consume much of the income of low-wage urban workers. [[Homelessness]], or lack of housing, is a challenged currently faced by millions of people in countries rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Forrest &amp; Peter Williams, Housing in the Twentieth Century"; in Paddison (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

{{Main|Urban ecology}}

Urban [[ecosystems]], influenced as they are by the density of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings. Anthropogenic [[buildings]] and [[waste]], as well as [[Agriculture|cultivation]] in [[gardens]], create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in [[wilderness]], in some cases enabling exceptional [[biodiversity]]. They provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for [[introduced species|immigrant plants]], bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other. They introduce frequent [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] (construction, walking) to plant and animal [[habitat]]s, creating opportunities for [[Secondary succession|recolonization]] and thus favoring [[ecological succession|young ecosystems]] with [[r/K selection theory|r-selected species]] dominant. On the whole, urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others, due to the diminished absolute amount of biological interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rebele, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2997649 Urban Ecology and Special Features of Urban Ecosystems]", ''Global Ecology and Biogeography Letters'' 4(6), November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Sukopp, "On the Early History of Urban Ecology in Europe"; in Marzluff et al.

Cities generate considerable [[ecological footprint]]s, locally and at longer distances, due to concentrated populations and technological activities. From one perspective, cities are not ecologically [[sustainable]] due to their resource needs. From another, proper management may be able to ameliorate a city's ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Campagni, Roberta Capello, &amp; Peter Nijamp, "Managing Sustainable Urban Environments"; in Paddison (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michellenijhuis.com/ |title=National Geographic Magazine; Special report 2008: Changing Climate: Village Green |publisher=Michelle Nijhuis |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air pollution]] arises from various forms of combustion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aklung.org/air-quality/indoor-air-quality/ |title=Indoor Air Quality&amp;nbsp;– American Lung Association of Alaska |publisher=Aklung.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including fireplaces, wood or coal-burning stoves, other heating systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsminer.com/news/2008/aug/20/epa-put-fairbanks-air-pollution-problem-list/ |title=Newsminer.com; EPA to put Fairbanks on air pollution problem list |publisher=Newsminer.com |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2009-02-07 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[internal combustion engine]]s.

Modern cities are known for creating their own [[microclimate]]s, due to [[concrete]], [[asphalt]], and other artificial surfaces, which heat up in [[sunlight]] and channel [[rainwater]] into [[storm sewer|underground ducts]]. The [[Geography of New York City#Climate|temperature in New York City]] exceeds [[Climate of New York|nearby rural temperatures]] by an average of 2–3&amp;nbsp;°C and at times 5–10&amp;nbsp;°C differences have been recorded.

Thus, urban areas experience unique climates, with earlier flowering and later leaf dropping than in nearby country.&lt;ref name=PickettEtAl2008 /&gt;

Poor and working-class people face disproportionate exposure to environmental risks (known as [[environmental racism]] when intersecting also with racial segregation). For example, within the urban microclimate, less-vegetated poor neighborhoods bear more of the heat (but have fewer means of coping with it).&lt;ref&gt;Sharon L. Harlan, Anthony J. Brazel, G.

== World city system ==
As the world becomes more closely linked through economics, politics, technology, and culture (a process called [[globalization]]), cities have come to play a leading role in transnational affairs, exceeding the limitations of [[international relations]] conducted by national governments.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamson (2004), pp. 2–4. "The linkages among cities cutting across nations became a global network. It is important to note here that the key nodes in the international system are (global) cities, not nations. [...] Once the linkages among cities became a global network, nations became dependent upon their major cities for connections to the rest of the world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HN2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta2015globalization&gt;Gupta et al. (2015), 5–11. "Current globalization, characterized by hyper capitalism and technological revolutions, is understood as the growing intensity of economic, demographic, social, political, cultural and environmental interactions worldwide, leading to increasing interdependence and homogenization of ideologies, production and consumption patterns and lifestyles (Pieterse 1994; Sassen 1998). […] Decentralization processes have increased city-level capacities of city authorities to develop and implement local social and developmental policies. Cities as homes of the rich, and of powerful businesses, banks, stock markets, UN agencies and NGOs, are the location from which global to local decision-making occurs (e.g. New York, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Hong Kong, São Paulo)."&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, resurgent today, can be traced back to the [[Silk Road]], [[Phoenicia]], and the Greek city-states, through the [[Hanseatic League]] and other alliances of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Herrschel &amp; Newman (2017), pp. 9–10. "The merchants of the Hanseatic League, for instance, enjoyed substantial trading privileges as a result of inter-city diplomacy and collective agreements within the networks (Lloyd 2002), as well as with larger powers, such as states. That way, the League could negotiate 'extra-territorial' legal spaces with special privileges, such as the 'German Steelyard' in the port of London (Schofield 2012). This special status was granted and guaranteed by the English king as part of an agreement between the state and a foreign city association."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CalderFreytas2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2016), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[information economy]] based on high-speed [[internet]] infrastructure enables instantaneous [[telecommunication]] around the world, effectively eliminating the distance between cities for the purposes of [[stock market]]s and other high-level elements of the world economy, as well as personal communications and [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2004), pp. 115–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global city ===
[[File:London Stock Exchange (13056321704).jpg|thumb|[[Stock exchange]]s, characteristic features of the top global cities, are interconnected hubs for capital. Here, a delegation from Australia is shown visiting the [[London Stock Exchange]].]]

A [[global city]], also known as a world city, is a prominent centre of trade, banking, finance, innovation, and markets. [[Saskia Sassen]] used the term "global city" in her 1991 work, ''The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo'' to refer to a city's [[Power (social and political)|power]], status, and cosmopolitanism, rather than to its size.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia (1991). ''[http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6943.html The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316103717/http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6943.html |date=16 March 2015 }} [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|0691070636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this view of cities, it is possible to [[Global city#GaWC study|rank the world's cities hierarchically]].&lt;ref name=ranking&gt;John Friedmann and Goetz Wolff, "World City Formation: An Agenda for Research and Action," ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'', 6, no. 3 (1982): 319&lt;/ref&gt; Global cities form the capstone of the global hierarchy, exerting [[command and control]] through their economic and political influence. Global cities may have reached their status due to early transition to [[post-industrial society|post-industrialism]]&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamson (2004), p. 4. "The formerly major industrial cities that were most able quickly and thoroughly to transform themselves into the new postindustrial mode became the leading global cities—the centers of the new global system."&lt;/ref&gt; or through inertia which has enabled them to maintain their dominance from the industrial era.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of ranking exemplifies an emerging [[discourse]] in which cities, considered variations on the same ideal type, ''must'' compete with each other globally to achieve prosperity.&lt;ref name=Ward2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wachsmuth2014 /&gt;

Critics of the notion point to the different realms of power and interchange. The term "global city" is heavily influenced by economic factors and, thus, may not account for places that are otherwise significant. [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], for example argues that the term is "reductive and skewed" in its focus on financial systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London | pages= 28, 30}} "Against those writers who, by emphasizing the importance of financial exchange systems, distinguish a few special cities as 'global cities'—commonly London, Paris, New York and Tokyo—we recognize the uneven global dimensions of all the cities that we study. Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood, is a globalizing city, though perhaps more significantly in cultural than economic terms. And so is Dili globalizing, the small and 'insignificant' capital of Timor Leste—except this time it is predominantly in political terms..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multinational corporation]]s and [[bank]]s make their headquarters in global cities and conduct much of their business within this context.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2004), 99–106.&lt;/ref&gt; American firms dominate the international markets for [[law firm|law]] and [[engineering]] and maintain branches in the biggest foreign global cities.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2004), pp. 91–95. "The United States is also dominant in providing high-quality, global engineering-design services, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the world's total exports. The disproportionate presence of these U.S.-headquartered firms is attributable to the U.S. role in overseas automobile production, the electronics and petroleum industries, and various kinds of construction, including work on the country's numerous overseas air and navy military bases."&lt;/ref&gt;

Global cities feature concentrations of extremely wealthy and extremely poor people.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2004), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Their economies are lubricated by their capacity (limited by the national government's immigration policy, which functionally defines the supply side of the labor market) to recruit low- and high-skilled immigrant workers from poorer areas.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Samers, "Immigration and the Global City Hypothesis: Towards an Alternative Research Agenda"; ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' 26(2), June 2002. "And not withstanding some major world cities that do not have comparatively high levels of immigration, like Tokyo, it may in fact be the presence of such large-scale immigrant economic 'communities' (with their attendant global financial remittances and their ability to incubate small business growth, rather than simply their complementarity to producer services employment) which partially distinguishes mega-cities from other more nationally oriented urban centres."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Willis, Kavita Datta, Yara Evans, Joanna Herbert, Jon May, &amp; Cathy McIlwane, ''Global Cities at Work: New Migrant Divisions of Labour''; London: Pluto Press, 2010; {{ISBN|978-0745327990}}; p. 29: "These apparently rather different takes on London's 'global city' status are of course not so far removed from one another as they may first appear. Holding them together is the figure of the migrant worker. The reliance of London's financial institutions and business services industries on the continuing flow of highly skilled labour from overseas is now well known (Beaverstock and Smith 1996). Less well known is the extent to which London's economy as a whole is now dependent upon the labour power of low-paid workers from across the world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattthew R. Sanderson, Ben Derudder, Michael Timberlake, &amp; Frank Witlox, "Are world cities also world immigrant cities?

(2009), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transnational activity ===
Cities increasingly participate in world political activities independently of their enclosing nation-states. Early examples of this phenomenon are the [[sister city]] relationship and the promotion of [[multi-level governance]] within the European Union as a technique for [[European integration]].&lt;ref name=HN2017&gt;Herrschel &amp; Newman (2017), pp. 3–4. "Instead, the picture is becoming more detailed and differentiated, with a growing number of sub-national entities, cities, city-regions and regions, becoming more visible in their own right, either individually, or collectively as networks, by, more or less tentatively, stepping out of the territorial canvas and hierarchical institutional hegemony of the state. Prominent and well-known cities, and those regions with a strong sense of identity and often a quest for more autonomy, have been the most enthusiastic, as they began to be represented beyond state borders by high-profile city mayors and some regional leaders with political courage and agency. […] This, then, became part of the much bigger political project of the European Union (EU), which has offered a particularly supportive environment for international engagement by—and among—subnational governments as part of its inherent integrationist agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Jeffery, "[http://aei.pitt.edu/2635/1/002803_1.PDF Sub-National Authorities and European Integration: Moving Beyond the Nation-State?]"  Presented at the Fifth Biennial International Conference of the European Community Studies Association, 29 May–1 June 1997, Seattle, US.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jing Pan, "[https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2086/11117/JING%20PAN%20PhD%20Thesis-Final-confirmed.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The Role of Local Government in Shaping and Influencing International Policy Frameworks]", PhD thesis accepted at De Montfort University, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities including [[Hamburg]], [[Prague]], [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], and [[City of London]] maintain their own embassies to [[Brussels and the European Union|the European Union at Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrschel &amp; Newman (2017), p. "In Europe, the EU provides incentives and institutional frameworks for multiple new forms of city and regional networking and lobbying, including at the international EU level. But a growing number of cities and regions also seek to 'go it alone' by establishing their own representations in Brussels, either individually or in shared accommodation, as the base for European lobbying."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marks]], Richard Haesly, Heather A.D. Mbaye, "[http://garymarks.web.unc.edu/files/2016/09/marks.haesly.mbaye_.subnational_offices_2002.pdf What Do Subnational Offices Think They're Doing in Brussels?]"; ''Regional and Federal Studies 12(3), Autumn 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carola Hein, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/12265934.2014.980304 Cities (and regions) within a city: subnational representations and the creation of European imaginaries in Brussels]"; ''International Journal of the Urban Sciences'' 19(1), 2015.

New urban dwellers may increasingly not simply as immigrants but as [[transmigrants]], keeping one foot each (through telecommunications if not travel) in their old and their new homes.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global governance ===
Cities participate in [[global governance]] by various means including membership in global networks which transmit norms and regulations. At the general, global level, [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) is a significant [[umbrella organization]] for cities; regionally and nationally, [[Eurocities]], [[Asian Network of Major Cities 21]], the [[Federation of Canadian Municipalities]] the [[National League of Cities]], and the [[United States Conference of Mayors]] play similar roles.&lt;ref name=Bouteligier2013&gt;Sofie Bouteligier, "[http://edepot.wur.nl/238650 Inequality in new global governance arrangements: the North–South divide in transnational municipal networks]"; ''Innovation: The European Journal of Social Science Research'' 26(3), 2013; {{doi|10.1080/13511610.2013.771890}}. "City networks are not a new phenomenon, but it was the 1990s that saw an explosion of such initiatives, especially in the environmental domain. This is mostly ascribed to (chapter 28 of) Agenda 21, which recognizes the role of local authorities in the promotion of sustainable development and stimulates exchange and cooperation between them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HN2017p82&gt;Herrschel &amp; Newman (2017), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; UCLG took responsibility for creating [[Agenda 21 for culture]], a program for [[cultural policy|cultural policies]] promoting sustainable development, and has organized various conferences and reports for its furtherance.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013&gt;Nancy Duxbury &amp; Sharon Jeannotte, "[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_Global_Cultural_Governance_Policy_Duxbury-Jeannotte_2013.pdf Global Cultural Governance Policy]"; Chapter 21 in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Planning and Culture''; London: Ashgate, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks have become especially prevalent in the arena of [[environmentalism]] and specifically [[climate change]] following the adoption of [[Agenda 21]]. Environmental city networks include the [[C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group]], [[World Association of Major Metropolises]] ("Metropolis"), the [[United Nations Global Compact#UN Global Compact – Cities Programme|United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme]], the [[Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance]] (CNCA), the [[Covenant of Mayors]] and the [[Compact of Mayors]],&lt;ref&gt;Now the [[Global Covenant of Mayors]]; see: {{cite web|url=https://www.compactofmayors.org/globalcovenantofmayors/|title=Global Covenant of Mayors – Compact of Mayors|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014062217/https://www.compactofmayors.org/globalcovenantofmayors/|archive-date=14 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICLEI|ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability]], and the [[Transition Towns (network)|Transition Towns network]].&lt;ref name=Bouteligier2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HN2017p82 /&gt;

Cities with world political status as meeting places for advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations, lobbyists, educational institutions, intelligence agencies, military contractors, information technology firms, and other groups with a stake in world policymaking. They are consequently also sites for symbolic protest.&lt;ref name=CalderFreytas2009 /&gt;{{efn|One important global political city, described at one time as a [[Caput Mundi|world capital]], is [[Washington, DC]] and [[Washington metropolitan area|its metropolitan area]] (including [[Tysons Corner]] and [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]] in the [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] and the various federal agencies found along the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]]). Beyond the prominent institutions of U.S. government on the national mall, this area contains [[List of diplomatic missions in Washington, DC|177 embassies]], [[The Pentagon]], the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|Central Intelligence Agency headquarters]], the World Bank headquarters, myriad [[think tank]]s and [[lobbyist|lobbying groups]], and corporate headquarters for [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Capital One]], [[Verisign]], [[Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems]], [[Gannett Company]] etc.&lt;ref name=CalderFreytas2009 /&gt;}}

=== United Nations System ===
The [[United Nations System]] has been involved in a series of events and declarations dealing with the development of cities during this period of rapid urbanization.
* The [[Habitat I]] conference in 1976 adopted the "Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements" which identifies urban management as a fundamental aspect of [[economic development|development]] and establishes various principles for maintaining urban [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20040915005846/http://habitat.igc.org/vancouver/vp-intr.htm The Vancouver Action Plan]"; Approved at Habitat: United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, Vancouver, Canada; 31 May to 11 June 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Citing the Vancouver Declaration, the UN General Assembly in December 1977 authorized the United Nations Commission Human Settlements and the HABITAT Centre for Human Settlements, intended to coordinate UN activities related to housing and settlements.&lt;ref name=Walker2005&gt;Peter R. Walker, "Human Settlements and Urban Life: A United Nations Perspective"; ''Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless'' 14, 2005; {{doi|10.1179/105307805807066329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] resulted in a set of international agreements including [[Agenda 21]] which establishes principles and plans for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;David Satterthwaite, "Editorial: A new urban agenda?"; ''[[Environment &amp; Urbanization]]'', 2016; {{doi|10.1177/0956247816637501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:X World Assembly of Mayors - Quito (01).jpg|thumb|World Assembly of Mayors at [[Habitat III]] conference in [[Quito]].]]
* The [[Habitat II]] conference in 1996 called for cities to play a leading role in this program, which subsequently advanced the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=Parnell /&gt;
* In January 2002 the UN Commission on Human Settlements became an umbrella agency called the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme]] or UN-Habitat, a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref name=Walker2005 /&gt;
* The [[Habitat III]] conference of 2016 focused on implementing these goals under the banner of a "New Urban Agenda". The four mechanisms envisio 14ned for effecting the New Urban Agenda are (1) national policies promoting integrated sustainable development, (2) stronger urban governance, (3) long-term integrated urban and territorial planning, and (4) effective financing frameworks.&lt;ref name=Watson2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/ New Urban Agenda]'', Habitat III Secretariat, 2017; A/RES/71/256*; {{ISBN|978-9211327311}}; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before this conference, the [[European Union]] concurrently approved an "Urban Agenda for the European Union" known as the [[Pact of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=Watson2016&gt;Vanessa Watson, "Locating planning in the New Urban Agenda of the urban sustainable development goal"; ''Planning Theory'' 15(4), 2016; {{doi|10.1177/1473095216660786}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

UN-Habitat coordinates the UN urban agenda, working with the [[UN Environmental Programme]], the [[UN Development Programme]], the [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=Walker2005 /&gt;

[[File:World Bank building at Washington.jpg|thumb|left|World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC.]]

The [[World Bank]], a United Nations [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency]], has been a primary force in promoting the Habitat conferences, and since the first Habitat conference has used their declarations as a framework for issuing loans for urban infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Parnell&gt;Susan Parnell, "Defining a Global Urban Development Agenda"; ''World Development'' 78, 2015; {{doi|10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.028}}; pp. 531–532: "Garnered by its interest in the urban poor the Bank, along with other international donors, became an active and influential participant in the Habitat deliberations, confirming both Habitat I and Habitat II's focus on 'development in cities' instead of the role of 'cities in development'."&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's [[structural adjustment]] programs contributed to urbanization in the [[Third World]] by creating incentives to move to cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Akin Mabogunje|Akin L. Mabogunje]], "A New Paradigm for Urban Development"; ''Proceedings of the World Bank Annual Conference on Development Economics 1991''. "Irrespective of the economic outcome, the regime of structural adjustment being adopted in most developing countries today is likely to spur urbanization. If structural adjustment actually succeeds in turning around economic performance, the enhanced gross domestic product is bound to attract more migrants to the cities; if it fails, the deepening misery—especially in the rural areas—is certain to push more migrants to the city."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs and Ian E.A. Yeboah, "[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/169/1/Briggs,J_33.pdf Structural adjustment and the contemporary sub-Saharan African city]"; ''Area'' 33(1), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the [[Cities Alliance]] (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and [[Grant (money)|grant]] distribution around the issue of urban poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Wanjiru Ngare, "[https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/22844/3/Wanjiru_Claire_2012_researchpaper.pdf Supporting Learning Cities: A Case Study of the Cities Alliance]"; master's thesis accepted at the University of Ottawa, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in evaluating the quality of a locality's governance.)&lt;ref name=Gupta2015p33 /&gt; The Bank's policies have tended to focus on bolstering [[real estate]] markets through credit and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Apsan Frediani, "[http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/urban/alexurbpov.pdf Amartya Sen, the World Bank, and the Redress of Urban Poverty: A Brazilian Case Study]"; in ''Journal of Human Development'' 8(1), March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, [[UNESCO]] has increasingly focused on cities as key sites for influencing [[cultural governance]]. It has developed various city networks including the International Coalition of Cities against Racism and the Creative Cities Network. UNESCO's capacity to select [[World Heritage Sites]] and maintain them through [[Public/social/private partnership]]s gives the organization significant influence over [[cultural capital]], [[tourism]], and [[historic preservation]] funding.&lt;ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /&gt;

== Representation in culture ==
[[File:The fall of Babylon; Cyrus the Great defeating the Chaldean Wellcome V0034440.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|[[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]'s ''The Fall of Babylon'' (1831), depicting chaos as the Persian army occupies Babylon, also symbolizes the ruin of decadent civilization in modern times. Lightning striking the [[Etemenanki|Babylonian ziggurat]] (also representing the [[Tower of Babel]]) indicates God's judgment against the city.]]

Cities figure prominently in traditional Western culture, appearing in the [[Bible]] in both evil and holy forms, symbolized by [[Babylon]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellul (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cain]] and [[Nimrod]] are the first city builders in the [[Book of Genesis]]. In Sumerian mythology [[Gilgamesh]] built the walls of [[Uruk]].

Cities can be perceived in terms of extremes or opposites: at once liberating and oppressive, wealthy and poor, organized and chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Bridge and Sophie Watson, "City Imaginaries", in Bridge &amp; Watson, eds. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The name [[anti-urbanism]] refers to various types of ideological opposition to cities, whether because of their culture or their political relationship with [[Rural area|the country]]. Such opposition may result from identification of cities with oppression and the ruling [[elite]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrschel &amp; Newman (2017), pp. 7–8. "Growing inequalities as a result of neo-liberal globalism, such as between the successful cities and the less successful, struggling, often peripheral, cities and regions, produce rising political discontent, such as we are now facing across Europe and in the United States as populist accusations of self-serving metropolitan elitism."&lt;/ref&gt; This and other political ideologies strongly influence narratives and themes in [[discourse]] about cities.&lt;ref name=Lynch2008p678 /&gt; In turn, cities symbolize their home societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.E. Cirlot]], "City"; ''A Dictionary of Symbols'', Second Edition, translated from Spanish to English by Jack Read; New York: Philosophical Library, 1971; pp. 48–49 ([https://archive.org/stream/DictionaryOfSymbols/Dictionary%20of%20Symbols#page/n103/mode/2up online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers, painters, and filmmakers have produced innumerable works of art concerning the urban experience. Classical and medieval literature includes a genre of ''[[List of literary descriptions of cities (before 1550)|descriptiones]]'' which treat of city features and history. Modern authors such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[James Joyce]] are famous for evocative descriptions of their home cities.&lt;ref&gt;Latham et al. (2009), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Lang]] conceived the idea for his influential 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' while visiting [[Times Square]] and marveling at the nighttime [[neon light]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;Leach (1993), p. 345. "The German film director Fritz Lang was inspired to 'make a film' about 'the sensations' he felt when he first saw Times Square in 1923; a place 'lit as if in full daylight by neon lights and topping them oversized luminous advertisements moving, turning, flashing on and off ... something completely new and nearly fairly-tale-like for a European ... a luxurious cloth hung from a dark sky to dazzle, distract, and hypnotize.' The film Lang made turned out to be ''The Metropolis'', an unremittingly dark vision of a modern industrial city.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early cinematic representations of cities in the twentieth century generally depicted them as technologically efficient spaces with smoothly functioning systems of automobile transport. By the 1960s, however, [[traffic congestion]] began to appear in such films as ''[[The Fast Lady]]'' (1962) and ''[[Playtime]]'' (1967).&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;

Literature, film, and other forms of popular culture have supplied visions of future cities both [[utopian]] and [[dystopian]]. The prospect of expanding, communicating, and increasingly interdependent world cities has given rise to images such as [[Nylonkong]] (NY, London, Hong Kong)&lt;ref&gt;Curtis (2016), pp. vii–x, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and visions of a single world-encompassing [[ecumenopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]], ''[http://www.doxiadis.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=14929 Ecumenopolis: Tomorrow's City]''; Brittanica Book of the Year, 1968. Chapter V: Ecumenopolis, the Real City of Man. "Ecumenopolis, which mankind will have built 150 years from now, can be the real city of man because, for the first time in history, man will have one city rather than many cities belonging to different national, racial, religious, or local groups, each ready to protect its own members but also ready to fight those from other cities, large and small, interconnected into a system of cities.

[[File:Dead-reckining.svg|right|thumb|200px|The navigator plots their 9am position, indicated by the triangle, and, using their course and speed, estimates their own position at 9:30am and 10am.]]

In [[navigation]], '''dead reckoning''' is the process of calculating one's current position by using a previously determined position, or [[Fix (position)|fix]], and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. The corresponding term in biology, used to describe the processes by which animals update their estimates of position or heading, is [[path integration]].

[[File:Wind drift.png|thumbnail|Drift is the angle between the heading of the airplane and the desired track. A is the last known position (fix, usually shown with a circle). B is the air position (usually shown with a plus sign). C is the DR position (usually shown with a triangle).]]

Dead reckoning is subject to cumulative errors. Advances in [[navigational aid]]s that give accurate information on position, in particular [[satellite navigation]] using the [[Global Positioning System]], have made simple dead reckoning by humans obsolete for most purposes. However, [[inertial navigation system]]s, which provide very accurate directional information, use dead reckoning and are very widely applied.

By analogy with their navigational use, the words ''dead reckoning'' are also used to mean the process of estimating the value of any variable quantity by using an earlier value and adding whatever changes have occurred in the meantime. Often, this usage implies that the changes are not known accurately. The earlier value and the changes may be measured or calculated quantities.

The term "dead reckoning" was not originally used to abbreviate "deduced reckoning," nor is it a misspelling of the term "ded reckoning."  The use of "ded" or "deduced reckoning" appeared much later in history, no earlier than 1931; in contrast to "dead reckoning" appearing as early as 1613 in the Oxford English Dictionary.  The original intention of "dead" in the term is not clear however.  Whether it is used to convey "absolute" as in "dead ahead," reckoning using other objects that are "dead in the water," or using reckoning properly "you’re dead if you don’t reckon right," is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is “dead reckoning” short for “deduced reckoning”?|url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2053/is-dead-reckoning-short-for-deduced-reckoning/|website = straightdope.com|accessdate = 2018-02-02|first = Cecil|last = Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Errors ==
Dead reckoning can give the best available information on position, but is subject to significant errors as both speed and direction must be accurately known at all instants for position to be determined accurately. For example, if displacement is measured by the number of rotations of a wheel, any discrepancy between the actual and assumed travelled distance per rotation, due perhaps to slippage or surface irregularities, will be a source of error. As each estimate of position is relative to the previous one, errors are [[Propagation of uncertainty|cumulative]], or compounding, multiplicatively or exponentially, if that is the co-relationship of the quanta.

The accuracy of dead reckoning can be increased significantly by using other, more reliable methods to get a new fix part way through the journey.  For example, if one was navigating on land in poor visibility, then dead reckoning could be used to get close enough to the known position of a landmark to be able to see it, before walking to the landmark itself — giving a precisely known start point — and then setting off again.

==Localization of mobile sensor nodes==
[[Location estimation in sensor networks|Localizing]] a static [[sensor node]] is not a difficult task because attaching a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device suffices the need of localization. But a [[mobile wireless sensor network|mobile sensor node]], which continuously change its geographical location with time is difficult to localize. Mostly mobile sensor nodes within some particular domain for data collection can be used, ''i.e'', sensor node attached to an animal within a grazing field or attached to a soldier on a battlefield. Within these scenarios a GPS device for each sensor node cannot be afforded. Some of the reasons for this include cost, size and battery drainage of constrained sensor nodes.
To overcome this problem a limited number of reference nodes (with GPS) within a field is employed. These nodes continuously broadcast their locations and other nodes in proximity receive these locations and calculate their position using some mathematical technique like [[trilateration]]. For localization, at least three known reference locations are necessary to localize. Several localization algorithms based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method have been proposed in literatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Localization for Mobile Sensor Networks|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1023720.1023726|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 10th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking|date = 2004-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 1-58113-868-7|pages = 45–57|series = MobiCom '04|doi = 10.1145/1023720.1023726|first = Lingxuan|last = Hu|first2 = David|last2 = Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Monte Carlo Localization of Mobile Sensor Networks Using the Position Information of Neighbor Nodes|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04383-3_20|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2009-09-22|isbn = 978-3-642-04382-6|pages = 270–283|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-04383-3_20|first = Hamid|last = Mirebrahim|first2 = Mehdi|last2 = Dehghan|editor-first = Pedro M.|editor-last = Ruiz|editor-first2 = Jose Joaquin|editor-last2 = Garcia-Luna-Aceves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a node at some places receives only two known locations and hence it becomes impossible to localize. To overcome this problem, dead reckoning technique is used. With this technique a sensor node uses its previous calculated location for localization at later time intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Haroon Rashid, Ashok Kumar Turuk, 'Dead reckoning localisation technique for mobile wireless sensor networks', IET Wireless Sensor Systems, 2015, 5, (2), p. 87-96, DOI: 10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043
IET Digital Library, http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at time instant 1 if node A calculates its  position as ''loca_1'' with the help of three known reference locations; then at time instant 2 it uses ''loca_1'' along with two other reference locations received from other two reference nodes.  This not only localizes a node in less time but also localizes in positions where it is difficult to get three reference locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IET Digital Library: Dead reckoning localisation technique for mobile wireless sensor networks|url = http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-wss.2014.0043|website = digital-library.theiet.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01|first = Haroon|last = Turuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal navigation==

{{main|Animal navigation}}

In studies of [[animal navigation]], dead reckoning is more commonly (though not exclusively) known as [[path integration]]. Animals use it to estimate their current location based on their movements from their last known location. Animals such as ants, rodents, and geese have been shown to track their locations continuously relative to a starting point and to return to it, an important skill for foragers with a fixed home.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistel. The Organization of Learning. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsinnamon.web.wesleyan.edu/wescourses/NSB-Psyc255/Readings/17.%20Spatial%20Limbic%20System/Whishaw.pdf Dead reckoning (path integration) requires the hippocampal formation: evidence from spontaneous exploration and spatial learning tasks in light (allothetic) and dark (idiothetic) tests, IQ Whishaw, DJ Hines, DG Wallace, Behavioural Brain Research 127 (2001) 49 – 69]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine navigation==
[[File:CYA Coastal Navigation With Dead Reckoning 2.jpg|thumb|Dead reckoning navigation tools in coastal navigation]]
In marine navigation a "dead" reckoning plot generally does not take into account the effect of [[Ocean current|current]]s or [[wind]]. Aboard ship a dead reckoning plot is considered important in evaluating position information and planning the movement of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/chapt07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313165051/http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/chapt07.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead reckoning begins with a known position, or [[Fix (position)|fix]], which is then advanced, mathematically or directly on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a [[chip log]]. More modern methods include [[pit log]] referencing engine speed (''e.g''. in [[revolutions per minute|rpm]]) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a [[pitot tube]]. This measurement is converted to an [[equivalent airspeed]] based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a [[pit sword]] (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can  then be adjusted resulting in an estimated  position by taking into account the current (known as [[set and drift]] in marine navigation). If there is  no positional information available, a new dead reckoning plot may start from an estimated position. In this case subsequent dead reckoning positions will have taken into account estimated set and drift.

Dead reckoning positions are calculated at predetermined intervals, and are maintained between fixes. The duration of the interval varies. Factors including one's speed made good and the nature of heading and other course changes, and the navigator's judgment determine when dead reckoning positions are calculated.

Before the 18th-century development of the [[marine chronometer]] by [[John Harrison]] and the [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance method]], dead reckoning was the primary method of determining [[longitude]] available to mariners such as [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[John Cabot]] on their trans-Atlantic voyages. Tools such as the [[traverse board]] were developed to enable even illiterate crew members to collect the data needed for dead reckoning. [[Polynesian navigation]], however, uses different [[wayfinding]] techniques.

== Air navigation ==
{{Main|Air navigation}}

[[File:RCAF DR Nav Tools 1940.JPG|thumb|British P10 Magnetic Compass with dead reckoning navigation tools]]
On May 21, 1927 [[Charles Lindbergh]] landed in [[Paris, France]] after a successful non-stop flight from the United States in the single-engined [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. This aircraft was equipped with very basic instruments. He used dead reckoning to find his way.

Dead reckoning in the air is similar to dead reckoning on the sea, but slightly more complicated. The density of the air the aircraft moves through affects its performance as well as winds, weight, and power settings.

The basic formula for DR is Distance = Speed x Time. An aircraft flying at 250 knots airspeed for 2 hours has flown 500 nautical miles through the air. The [[wind triangle]] is used to calculate the effects of wind on heading and airspeed to obtain a magnetic heading to steer and the speed over the ground (groundspeed). Printed tables, formulae, or an [[E6B]] flight computer are used to calculate the effects of air density on aircraft rate of climb, rate of fuel burn, and airspeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transport Canada TP13014E Sample Private Pilot Examination|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp13014-menu-5527.htm|publisher=Transport Canada|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A course line is drawn on the aeronautical chart along with estimated positions at fixed intervals (say every ½ hour). Visual observations of ground features are used to obtain fixes. By comparing the fix and the estimated position corrections are made to the aircraft's heading and groundspeed.

Dead reckoning is on the curriculum for VFR (visual flight rules - or basic level) pilots worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/de/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/111/icao_annex_1_personnellicensing.pdf.download.pdf/icao_annex_1_personnellicensing.pdf|title=ICAO Annex 1  Paragraph 2.3.4.2.1 h|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught regardless of whether the aircraft has navigation aids such as GPS, [[Automatic direction finder|ADF]] and [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] and is an [[ICAO]] Requirement. Many flying training schools will prevent a student from using electronic aids until they have mastered dead reckoning.

[[Inertial navigation system]]s (INSes), which are nearly universal on more advanced aircraft, use dead reckoning internally. The INS provides reliable navigation capability under virtually any conditions, without the need for external navigation references, although it is still prone to slight errors.

=={{anchor|ADR}}Automotive navigation==
{{main|Automatic vehicle location}}
Dead reckoning is today implemented in some high-end [[automotive navigation system]]s in order to overcome the limitations of [[GPS]]/[[GNSS]] technology alone. Satellite microwave signals are unavailable in [[parking garage]]s and tunnels, and often severely degraded in [[urban canyon]]s and near trees due to blocked lines of sight to the satellites or [[multipath propagation]]. In a dead-reckoning navigation system, the car is equipped with sensors that know the wheel circumference and record wheel rotations and steering direction. These sensors are often already present in cars for other purposes ([[anti-lock braking system]], [[electronic stability control]]) and can be read by the navigation system from the [[controller-area network]] bus. The navigation system then uses a [[Kalman filter]] to integrate the always-available sensor data with the accurate but occasionally unavailable position information from the satellite data into a combined position fix.

==Autonomous navigation in robotics==
Dead reckoning is utilized in some lower-end, non mission-critical, or tightly constrained by time or weight, robotic applications. It is usually used to reduce the need for sensing technology, such as [[ultrasonic sensor]]s, GPS, or placement of some [[linear encoder|linear]] and [[rotary encoder]]s, in an [[autonomous robot]], thus greatly reducing cost and complexity at the expense of performance and repeatability. The proper utilization of dead reckoning in this sense would be to supply a known percentage of electrical power or [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] pressure to the robot's drive motors over a given amount of time from a general starting point. Dead reckoning is not totally accurate, which can lead to errors in distance estimates ranging from a few millimeters (in [[Numerical control|CNC machining]]) to kilometers (in [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]]), based upon the duration of the run, the speed of the robot, the length of the run, and several other factors.

=={{anchor|PDR|UDR}}Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)==
With the increased sensor offering in [[smartphone]]s, built-in accelerometers can be used as a [[pedometer]] and built-in magnetometer as a compass heading provider. '''Pedestrian dead reckoning''' ('''PDR''') can be used to supplement other navigation methods in a similar way to automotive navigation, or to extend navigation into areas where other navigation systems are unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) Simplified|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQt5-LfqeZw|publisher=GT Silicon|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a simple implementation, the user holds their phone in front of them and each step causes position to move forward a fixed distance in the direction measured by the compass. Accuracy is limited by the sensor precision, magnetic disturbances inside structures, and unknown variables such as carrying position and stride length. Another challenge is differentiating walking from running, and recognizing movements like bicycling, climbing stairs, or riding an elevator.

Before phone-based systems existed, many custom PDR systems existed. While a [[pedometer]] can only be used to measure linear distance traveled, PDR systems have an embedded magnetometer for heading measurement. Custom PDR systems can take many forms including special boots, belts, and watches, where the variability of carrying position has been minimized to better utilize magnetometer heading. True dead reckoning is fairly complicated, as it is not only important to minimize basic drift, but also to handle different carrying scenarios and movements, as well as hardware differences across phone models.

==Directional dead reckoning==
{{main|South-pointing chariot}}
The south-pointing chariot was an ancient Chinese device consisting of a two-wheeled [[horse-drawn vehicle]] which carried a pointer that was intended always to aim to the south, no matter how the chariot turned. The chariot pre-dated the navigational use of the [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]], and could not ''detect'' the direction that was south. Instead it used a kind of '''directional dead reckoning''': at the start of a journey, the pointer was aimed southward by hand, using local knowledge or astronomical observations e.g. of the [[Pole Star]]. Then, as it traveled, a mechanism possibly containing [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears used the different rotational speeds of the two wheels to turn the pointer relative to the body of the chariot by the angle of turns made (subject to available mechanical accuracy), keeping the pointer aiming in its original direction, to the south. Errors, as always with dead reckoning, would accumulate as distance traveled increased.

Networked games and simulation tools routinely use dead reckoning to predict where an actor should be right now, using its last known kinematic state (position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity).&lt;ref name="Murphy2011"&gt;Murphy, Curtiss. ''Believable Dead Reckoning for Networked Games''. Published in Game Engine Gems 2, Lengyel, Eric. AK Peters, 2011, p 308-326.&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily needed because it is impractical to send network updates at the rate that most games run, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. The basic solution starts by projecting into the future using linear physics:&lt;ref&gt;Van Verth, James. ''Essential Mathematics for Games And Interactive Applications''. Second Edition. Morgan Kaufmann, 1971, p. 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
    P_t = P_0 + V_0T + \frac{1}{2}A_0T^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used to move the object until a new update is received over the network. At that point, the problem is that there are now two kinematic states: the currently estimated position and the just received, actual position. Resolving these two states in a believable way can be quite complex. One approach is to create a curve (ex cubic [[Bézier curve|Bézier splines]], [[centripetal Catmull–Rom spline]]s, and [[Cubic Hermite spline|Hermite curves]])&lt;ref&gt;Lengyel, Eric. ''Mathematics for 3D Game Programming And Computer Graphics''. Second Edition. Charles River Media, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; between the two states while still projecting into the future. Another technique is to use projective velocity blending, which is the blending of two projections (last known and current) where the current projection uses a blending between the last known and current velocity over a set time.&lt;ref name="Murphy2011"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    V_b = V_0 + \left (\acute{V}_0 - V_0 \right)\hat{T}  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    P_t = P_0 + V_bT_t + \frac{1}{2}\acute{A}_0T_t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    \acute{P}_t = \acute{P}_0 + \acute{V}_0T_t + \frac{1}{2}\acute{A}_0T_t^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;    Pos = P_t + \left (\acute{P}_t - P_t \right)\hat{T} &lt;/math&gt;

==Computer science==
In computer science, dead-reckoning refers to navigating an [[array data structure]] using indexes. Since every array element has the same size, it is possible to [[Random access|directly access]] one array element by knowing any position in the array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.objectlayout.org | title=org.ObjectLayout, A layout-optimized Java data structure package | publisher=objectlayout.org | accessdate=19 October 2015 | author=Gil Tene and Martin Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the following array:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A || B || C || D || E
|}

knowing the memory address where the array starts, it is easy to compute the memory address of &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{address}_\text{D} = \text{address}_\text{start of array} + ( \text{size}_\text{array element} * \text{arrayIndex}_\text{D} )&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, knowing &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;'s memory address, it is easy to compute the memory address of &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{address}_\text{B} = \text{address}_\text{D} - ( \text{size}_\text{array element} * ( \text{arrayIndex}_\text{D} - \text{arrayIndex}_\text{B} ) )&lt;/math&gt;

This property is particularly important for [[Program optimization|performance]] when used in conjunction with arrays of [[Record (computer science)|structures]] because data can be directly accessed, without going through a [[Dereference operator|pointer dereference]].

It is similar to [[deadheading (flowers)|deadheading]] but stricter, as deadheading refers to the removal of faded flowers. Deflowering is usually performed on fruit-forming and seed-forming shrubs and trees in their first year. The aim is to prevent the plants from spending energy and nutrients on [[seed development]] before they establish themselves. Leaving some flowers and fruits to develop may be necessary for [[plant identification|identification]] purposes.&lt;ref name="Bob"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bob |last=Flowerdew|author-link=Bob Flowerdew|title=Pruning, Training, and Tidying: Bob's Basics|volume=|publisher=	Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2012|isbn=1620872668|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander. (2004). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Flor/publication/276930253_Environmental_Communication_Principles_Approaches_and_Strategies_of_Communication_Applied_to_Environmental_Management/links/555c380908ae6aea081734c5/Environmental-Communication-Principles-Approaches-and-Strategies-of-Communication-Applied-to-Environmental-Management.pdf Environmental Communication]''. Diliman, Quezon City: University of the Philippines-Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic field ==
As an academic field, environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving [[communication studies|communication]], [[environmental studies]], [[environmental science]], [[risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and management, [[sociology]], and [[political ecology]].

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]
# [[Risk communication]]
# Representations of Nature in [[popular culture]] and [[green marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. Robert. (2010). ''Environmental Communication And The Public Sphere''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, pp.??{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Everglades'''  is a [[natural region]] of [[tropical climate|tropical]] [[wetland]]s in the southern portion of the U.S. state of [[Florida]], comprising the southern half of a large [[drainage basin]] and part of the [[neotropic ecozone]]. The system begins near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] with the [[Kissimmee River]], which discharges into the vast but shallow [[Lake Okeechobee]].  Water leaving the [[lake]] in the wet season forms a slow-moving [[river]] {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide and over {{convert|100|mi|km}} long, flowing southward across a [[limestone]] shelf to [[Florida Bay]] at the southern end of the state.  The Everglades experience a wide range of weather patterns, from frequent flooding in the wet season to drought in the dry season. The Seminole Tribe gave the large body of water the name Okeechobee meaning "'''River of Grass'''" to describe the sawgrass marshes, part of a complex system of interdependent [[ecosystem]]s that include [[Taxodium|cypress]] swamps, the [[estuary|estuarine]] [[mangrove]] forests of the [[Ten Thousand Islands]], tropical hardwood [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]], pine rockland, and the marine environment of Florida Bay.

Human habitation in the southern portion of the Florida peninsula dates to 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. Before European colonization, the region was dominated by the native [[Calusa]] and [[Tequesta]] tribes. With Spanish colonization, both tribes declined gradually during the following two centuries. The [[Seminole]] formed from mostly [[Creek (people)|Creek]] people who had been warring to the North; they assimilated other peoples and created a new culture. After being forced from northern Florida into the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]] of the early 19th century, they adapted to the region and were able to resist removal by the United States Army.

Migrants to the region who wanted to develop plantations first proposed draining the Everglades in 1848, but no work of this type was attempted until 1882. Canals were constructed throughout the first half of the 20th century, and spurred the South Florida economy, prompting land development. In 1947, Congress formed the [[Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project]], which built {{convert|1400|mi|km}} of canals, [[levee]]s, and water control devices.  The [[Miami metropolitan area]] grew substantially at this time and Everglades water was diverted to cities. Portions of the Everglades were transformed into farmland, where the primary crop was [[sugarcane]]. Approximately 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the original Everglades has been developed as agricultural or urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;

Following this period of rapid development and environmental degradation, the ecosystem began to receive notable attention from conservation groups in the 1970s. Internationally, [[UNESCO]] and the [[Ramsar Convention]] designated the Everglades a Wetland Area of Global Importance. The construction of a large airport {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of [[Everglades National Park]] was blocked when an environmental study found that it would severely damage the South Florida ecosystem.  With heightened awareness and appreciation of the region, restoration began in the 1980s with the removal of a canal that had straightened the Kissimmee River. However, development and sustainability concerns have remained pertinent in the region. The deterioration of the Everglades, including poor water quality in [[Lake Okeechobee]], was linked to the diminishing quality of life in South Florida's urban areas. In 2000 the [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] was approved by Congress to combat these problems. To date,{{when|date=December 2017}} it is the most expensive and comprehensive environmental restoration attempt in history, but its implementation has faced political complications.

[[File:1857 Everglades map.jpg|thumb|This map made by the U.S. military shows the term "Everglades" was in use by 1857.]]

The first written record of the Everglades was on Spanish maps made by [[cartographer]]s who had not seen the land. They named the unknown area between the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida ''Laguna del Espíritu Santo'' ("Lake of the Holy Spirit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.library.miami.edu/floridamaps/view_image.php?image_name=dlp00020000580001001&amp;group=english|title=Old Florida Maps|publisher=scholar.library.miami.edu|accessdate=2008-08-22|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was featured on maps for decades without having been explored. Writer John Grant Forbes stated in 1811, "The Indians represent [the Southern points] as impenetrable; and the [British] surveyors, wreckers, and coasters, had not the means of exploring beyond the borders of the sea coast, and the mouths of rivers".&lt;ref name="mcmullen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McMullen | first1 = Wallace | year = 1953 | title = The Origin of the Term Everglades | url = | journal = American Speech | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 26–34 | doi=10.2307/454403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British surveyor [[John William Gerard de Brahm|John Gerard de Brahm]], who mapped the coast of Florida in 1773, called the area "River Glades". Both Marjory Stoneman Douglas and linguist Wallace McMullen suggest that cartographers substituted "Ever" for "River".{{clarify|reason=Why?|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref name="mcmullen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglasname"/&gt; The name "Everglades" first appeared on a map in 1823, although it was also spelled as "Ever Glades" as late as 1851.&lt;ref name="dovell"/&gt; The [[Seminole]] call it ''Pahokee'', meaning "Grassy Water."&lt;ref name="Douglasname"&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The region was labeled "''Pa-hai-okee''" on a U.S. military map from 1839, although it had earlier been called "Ever Glades" throughout the [[Second Seminole War]].&lt;ref name="mcmullen"/&gt; The Everglades consist of multiple South Florida towns: Belle Glade, Clewiston, Wellington, Davie, Parts of Miami, Weston, Parts of Fort Lauderdale, Immokalee, Naples, and Everglades City. The everglades are the Florida national park.

A 2007 survey by geographers Ary J. Lamme and Raymond K. Oldakowski found that the "Glades" has emerged as a distinct vernacular [[List of regions of the United States#Florida|region]] of Florida. It comprises the interior areas and southernmost [[Gulf Coast]] of [[South Florida]], largely corresponding to the Everglades itself. It is one of the most sparsely populated areas of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lamme |first1= Ary J. |last2= Oldakowski |first2= Raymond K. |year= 2007 |title= Spinning a New Geography of Vernacular Regional Identity: Florida in the Twenty-First Century |journal= Southeastern Geographer |volume= 47 |issue= 2 |pages= 329 &amp; 334 |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |doi= 10.1353/sgo.2007.0029|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The [[geology]] of South Florida, together with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of porous and permeable limestone create [[aquifer|water-bearing rock]] and soil that affect the climate, weather, and [[hydrology]] of South Florida.&lt;ref&gt;

The properties of the rock underneath the Everglades can be explained by the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. About 300 million&amp;nbsp;years ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent [[sedimentary rock]] with [[igneous rock]]. Continental [[rift]]ing began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 million&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge. p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler [[Jurassic Period]], the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the [[Cretaceous Period]], most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.&lt;ref name="gleason"&gt;Gleason, Patrick, Peter Stone, "Age, Origins, and Landscape Evolution of the Everglades Peatland" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limestone and aquifers===
Fluctuating sea levels compressed numerous layers of [[calcium carbonate]], sand, and shells.  The resulting permeable [[limestone]] formations that developed between 25&amp;nbsp;million and 70&amp;nbsp;million years ago created the [[Floridan Aquifer]], which serves as the main source of fresh water for the northern portion of Florida. However, this aquifer lies beneath thousands of feet of impermeable sedimentary rock from Lake Okeechobee to the southern tip of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Everglades Geology.png|thumb|Limestone formations in South Florida. Source: [[U.S. Geological Survey]]]]

Five geologic formations make up the southern portion of Florida: the [[Tamiami Formation]], Caloosahatchee Formation, [[Anastasia Formation]], Miami Limestone (or Miami Oolite), and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Tamiami Formation is a compression of highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands and pockets of [[quartz]], {{convert|150|ft|m}} thick. It is named for the [[Tamiami Trail]] that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp, and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades. Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation, named for the river over it. Much less permeable, this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of sandy shell marl, clay, and sand. Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized. Both the Tamiami and Caloosahatchee Formations developed during the [[Pliocene Epoch]].&lt;ref&gt;

Surrounding the southern part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form ''solution holes''—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable.&lt;ref name="uf30-33"&gt;UF &amp; USDA (1948), p. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath the metropolitan areas of [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, [[coquina]], and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes.&lt;ref name="uf30-33"/&gt; The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the [[Sangamon]] interglacial period.&lt;ref name="Lodge, p. 10"&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt;

The geologic formations that have the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms the floor of the lower Everglades. The Miami Limestone is made up of [[ooids]]: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain of sand. The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite, which comprises [[facies]] of ooids and fossilized [[bryozoan]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;

The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] and Coot Bay.&lt;ref&gt;

The metropolitan areas of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], Fort Lauderdale, and [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] are located on a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation. Along the western border of the Big Cypress Swamp is the Immokolee Ridge (or Immokolee Rise), a slight rise of compressed sand that divides the runoff between the Caloosahatchee River and The Big Cypress.&lt;ref&gt;

Under both the Miami Limestone formation and the Fort Thompson limestone lies the [[Biscayne Aquifer]], a surface aquifer that serves as the [[Miami metropolitan area]]'s fresh water source. Rainfall and stored water in the Everglades replenish the Biscayne Aquifer directly.&lt;ref name="Lodge, p. 10"/&gt;

With the rise of sea levels that occurred during the [[Pleistocene]] approximately 17,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, the runoff of water from Lake Okeechobee slowed and created the vast marshland that is now known as the Everglades. Slower runoff also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet (5.5 m) of [[peat]] in the area. The presence of such peat deposits, dated to about 5,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hydrology===

[[File:Florida Everglades Hydrology.gif|thumb|Predevelopment flow direction of water from [[Lake Okeechobee]] to [[Florida Bay]] Source: U.S. Geological Survey]]

The consistent Everglades flooding is fed by the extensive [[Kissimmee River|Kissimmee]], [[Caloosahatchee River|Caloosahatchee]], [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami]], [[Myakka River|Myakka]], and [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace Rivers]] in central Florida. The Kissimmee River is a broad [[floodplain]] that empties directly into Lake Okeechobee, which at {{convert|730|sqmi|km2}} with an average depth of {{convert|9|ft|m}}, is a vast but shallow lake.&lt;ref&gt;

Calcium deposits are left behind when flooding is shorter. The deposits occur in areas where water rises and falls depending on rainfall, as opposed to water being stored in the rock from one year to the next. Calcium deposits are present where more limestone is exposed.&lt;ref&gt;

The area from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] to the tip of the Florida peninsula was at one point a single drainage unit. When rainfall exceeded the capacity of Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River floodplain, it spilled over and flowed in a southwestern direction to empty into [[Florida Bay]]. Prior to urban and agricultural development in Florida, the Everglades began at the southern edge of Lake Okeechobee and flowed for approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}}, emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. The limestone shelf is wide and slightly angled instead of having a narrow, deep channel characteristic of most rivers. The vertical gradient from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay is about {{convert|2|in|cm}} per mile, creating an almost {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} wide expanse of river that travels about half a mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km) a day.&lt;ref&gt;

Water leaving Lake Okeechobee may require months or years to reach its final destination, Florida Bay. The sheetflow travels so slowly that water is typically stored from one wet season to the next in the porous limestone substrate. The ebb and flow of water has shaped the land and every ecosystem in South Florida throughout the Everglades' estimated 5,000&amp;nbsp;years of existence.  The motion of water defines plant communities and how animals adapt to their habitats and food sources.&lt;ref&gt;

==Climate==
[[File:Hurricane Charley 13 aug 2004 1635Z.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Hurricane Charley]] in [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] moving ashore on South Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast]]

The climate of South Florida is located across the broad transition zone between subtropical and tropical climates (Koppen Cfa and Aw). Like most regions with this climate type, there are two basic seasons – a "dry season" (winter) which runs from November through April, and a "wet season" (summer) which runs from May through October. About 70% of the annual rainfall in south Florida occurs in the wet season – often as brief but intense tropical downpours. The dry season sees little rainfall and dew points and humidity are often quite low. The dry season can be severe at times, as wildfires and water restrictions are often in place.

The annual range of temperatures in south Florida and the Everglades is rather small (less than 20&amp;nbsp;°F [11&amp;nbsp;°C]) – ranging from a monthly mean temperature of around {{convert|65|F}} in January to {{convert|83|F}} in July. High temperatures in the hot and wet season (summer) typically exceed {{convert|90|F|C}} across inland south Florida (although coastal locations are cooled by winds from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean), while high temperatures in the dry winter season average from {{convert|70|to|79|F}}. Frost and freeze is rare across south Florida and the Everglades; annually coastal cities like Miami and Naples report zero days with frost, although a few times each decade low temperatures may fall between {{convert|30|and|40|F}} across South Florida. Annual rainfall averages approximately {{convert|62|in|cm}}, with the Eastern Coastal Ridge receiving the majority of precipitation and the area surrounding Lake Okeechobee receiving about {{convert|48|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="usgs climate"/&gt;

Unlike any other wetland system on earth, the Everglades are sustained primarily by the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge,&amp;nbsp;p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evapotranspiration]] – the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere – associated with thunderstorms, is the key mechanism by which water leaves the region. During a year unaffected by drought, the rate may reach {{convert|40|in|cm}} a year. When droughts take place, the rate may peak at over {{convert|50|in|cm}}, and exceed the amount of rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;

Evapotranspiration is responsible for approximately 70–90&amp;nbsp;percent of water entering undeveloped wetland regions in the Everglades.&lt;ref name="obeysekera"&gt;

Precipitation during the wet season is primarily caused by air mass thunderstorms and the easterly flow out of the subtropical high (Bermuda High). Intense daytime heating of the ground causes the warm moist tropical air to rise, creating the afternoon thundershowers typical of tropical climates. 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm is the mean time of daily thundershowers across South Florida and the Everglades. Late in the wet season (August and September),  precipitation levels reach their highest levels as  tropical depressions and lows add to daily rainfall. Occasionally, tropical lows can become severe tropical cyclones and cause significant damage when the make landfall across south Florida. Tropical storms average one a year, and major hurricanes about once every ten years. Between 1871 and 1981, 138&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclones struck directly over or close to the Everglades.&lt;ref name="usgs climate"&gt;

==Formative and sustaining processes==

{{Main|Geography and ecology of the Everglades}}

The Everglades are a complex system of interdependent ecosystems. [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] described the area as a "River of Grass"  in 1947, though that metaphor represents only a portion of the system. The area recognized as the Everglades, prior to drainage, was a web of marshes and prairies {{convert|4000|sqmi|km2}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Borders between ecosystems are subtle or imperceptible. These systems shift, grow and shrink, die, or reappear within years or decades. Geologic factors, climate, and the frequency of fire help to create, maintain, or replace the ecosystems in the Everglades.

===Water===
[[File:Storm at Shark River in Everglades.jpg|thumb|A storm over the [[Shark River (Florida)|Shark River]] in the Everglades, 1966&lt;br&gt;Photo:Charles Barron / State Library and Archives of Florida]]
Water is the dominant force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the [[last glacial maximum]], 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the [[water table]] to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[sinkhole]]s. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.&lt;ref name="McCally9-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UF &amp; USDA (1948), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

As rain continued to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater [[solution|dissolved]] the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater came into contact with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem.&lt;ref name="McCally9-10"&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the region appears flat, [[weathering]] of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock===
[[File:Everglades uneven limestone floor and sawgrass prairie.JPG|thumb|upright|Uneven limestone formations in an Everglades sawgrass prairie]]

The underlying bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin affects the ''hydroperiod'', or how long an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year.&lt;ref name="McCally9-10"/&gt; Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater for longer periods of time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous [[ooid]]s and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of [[periphyton]], a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, [[peat]] and [[marl]]. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–17&lt;/ref&gt; Where periphyton grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.

Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat were rapidly removed. In a process called soil [[subsidence]], [[oxidation]] of peat causes loss of volume.&lt;ref&gt;UF &amp; USDA (1948), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria decompose dead sawgrass slowly underwater without oxygen. When the water was drained in the 1920s and bacteria interacted with oxygen, an aerobic reaction occurred. Microorganisms degraded the peat into [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Some of the peat was burned by settlers to clear the land. Some homes built in the areas of early farms had to have their foundations moved to stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately {{convert|8|ft|m}} of soil depth.&lt;ref name="Lodge, p. 38"&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire===
Fire is an important element in the natural maintenance of the Everglades. The majority of fires are caused by [[lightning]] strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster specific plant growth: [[Cladium|sawgrass]] will burn above water, but the roots are preserved underneath. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name="lodgefire"&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas in the wet season, dead plant matter and the tips of grasses and trees are burned, in the dry season the fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems.&lt;ref name="lodgefire"/&gt; Fires are confined by existing water and rainfall. It takes approximately 225&amp;nbsp;years for one foot (.30 m) of peat to develop, but in some locations the peat is less dense than it should be for the 5,000&amp;nbsp;years of the Everglades' existence.&lt;ref name="mccallyfire"&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists indicate fire as the cause; it is also cited as the reason for the black color of Everglades muck. Layers of [[charcoal]] have been detected in the peat in portions of the Everglades that indicate the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence in 940 [[BCE]].&lt;ref name="mccallyfire"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==

===Sawgrass marshes and sloughs===

Several ecosystems are present in the Everglades, and boundaries between them are subtle or absent. The primary feature of the Everglades is the [[Cladium|sawgrass]] marsh. The iconic water and sawgrass combination in the shallow river {{convert|100|mi|km}} long and {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide that spans from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay is often referred to as the "true Everglades" or just "the Glades".&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905, the sheetflow occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula.&lt;ref name="McCally9-10"/&gt; Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water, but may die in unusually deep floods if oxygen is unable to reach its roots. It is particularly vulnerable immediately after a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt; The hydroperiod for the marsh is at least nine months, and can last longer.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Where sawgrass grows densely, few animals or other plants live, although [[alligator]]s choose these locations for nesting. Where there is more room, [[periphyton]] grows.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney,&amp;nbsp;p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; Periphyton supports larval insects and amphibians, which in turn are consumed as food by birds, fish, and reptiles. It also absorbs [[calcium]] from water, which adds to the calcitic composition of the marl.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloughs, or free-flowing channels of water, develop in between sawgrass prairies. Sloughs are about {{convert|3|ft|m}} deeper than sawgrass marshes, and may stay flooded for at least 11&amp;nbsp;months out of the year and sometimes multiple years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic animals such as turtles, alligators, snakes, and fish thrive in sloughs; they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Submerged and floating plants grow here, such as bladderwort (''[[Utricularia]]''), waterlily (''[[Nymphaeaceae]]''), and spatterdock (''[[Nuphar lutea]]''). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the [[Shark River (Florida)|Shark River]] Slough flowing out to Florida Bay, Lostmans River Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and [[Taylor Slough]] in the eastern Everglades.

Wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, but with greater plant diversity. The surface is covered in water only three to seven months of the year, and the water is, on average, shallow at only {{convert|4|in|cm}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt; When flooded, the marl can support a variety of water plants.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sinkhole|Solution holes]], or deep pits where the limestone has worn away, may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry, and they support aquatic invertebrates such as [[crayfish]] and snails, and larval amphibians which feed young wading birds.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt; These regions tend to border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes.

Alligators have created a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come to the hole.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tropical hardwood hammock===
[[File:Everglades Hammock Center.JPG|thumb|In a tropical hardwood hammock, trees are very dense and diverse.]]
{{main|Tropical hardwood hammock}}

Small islands of trees growing on land raised between {{convert|1|ft|m}} and {{convert|3|ft|m}} above sloughs and prairies are called tropical hardwood [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]].&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt; They may range from one (4,000&amp;nbsp;m²) to ten acres (40,000&amp;nbsp;m²) in area, and appear in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several inches above the surrounding peat, or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees, such as Southern live oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), gumbo limbo (''[[Bursera simaruba]]''), royal palm (''[[Roystonea]]''), and bustic (''[[Dipholis salicifolia]]'') that grow in very dense clumps.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the base, sharp saw palmettos (''[[Serenoa repens]]'') flourish, making the hammocks very difficult for people to penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat. Water in sloughs flows around the islands, creating [[moat]]s. Although some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover.  The moats around the hammocks protect the trees.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees are limited in height by weather factors such as frost, lightning, and wind; the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than {{convert|55|ft|m}}.

===Pineland===
Some of the driest land in the Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (''[[Pinus elliottii]]''). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire.&lt;ref name="fwspine"&gt;U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. "[http://www.fws.gov/southeast/vbpdfs/commun/pr.pdf South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan: Pine rockland]", Retrieved May 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds.&lt;ref&gt;George, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines.&lt;ref name="usgsfire"&gt;

The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain [[tuber]]s and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to urban development of the South Florida region, pine rocklands covered approximately {{convert|161660|acre|km2}} in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Within Everglades National Park, {{convert|19840|acre|km2}} of pine forests are protected, but outside the park, {{convert|1780|acre|km2}} of pine communities remained as of 1990, averaging {{convert|12.1|acre|m2}} in area.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt; The misunderstanding of the role of fire also played a part in the disappearance of pine forests in the area, as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks. [[Prescribed fire]]s occur in Everglades National Park in pine rocklands every three to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cypress===
[[File:Big cypress.jpg|thumb|A pond in The Big Cypress]]

Cypress swamps can be found throughout the Everglades, but the largest covers most of [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]]. The Big Cypress Swamp is located to the west of the sawgrass prairies and sloughs, and it is commonly called "The Big Cypress."&lt;ref name="George, p. 26"&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to its area rather than the height or diameter of the trees; at its most conservative estimate, the swamp measures {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2}}, but the [[Hydrography|hydrologic boundary]] of The Big Cypress can be calculated at over {{convert|2400|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thinner layer of limestone. The limestone underneath the Big Cypress contains [[quartz]], which creates sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation different from what is found in other areas of the Everglades.&lt;ref name="George, p. 26"/&gt; The basin for The Big Cypress receives on average {{convert|55|in|cm}} of water in the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, cypress swamps can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods, as well as in sawgrass marshes. Cypresses are deciduous [[conifer]]s that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called "knees".&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bald cypress]] trees grow in formations with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses grow smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a ridge of limestone bordered on either side by sloughs.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as [[Acer rubrum|red maple]], [[Persea|swamp bay]], and [[ash tree|pop ash]]. If cypresses are removed, the hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest.

===Mangrove and Coastal prairie===
[[File:Mangrove trees in Everglades.JPG|thumb|Red [[mangrove]] trees bordering a tidal [[estuary]] in the Everglades]]

Eventually the water from Lake Okeechobee and The Big Cypress makes its way to the ocean. Mangrove trees are well adapted to the transitional zone of [[brackish]] water where fresh and salt water meet.&lt;ref&gt;Katherisen, K. (2001). "Biology of Mangroves and Mangrove Ecosystems", ''Advances in Marine Biology'', Alan J. Southward (ed.) '''40''', pp.&amp;nbsp;18–251. {{ISBN|978-0-12-026140-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The estuarine ecosystem of the [[Ten Thousand Islands]], which is comprised almost completely of mangrove forests, covers almost {{convert|200000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Ripple"/&gt;  In the wet season fresh water pours out into Florida Bay, and sawgrass begins to grow closer to the coastline. In the dry season, and particularly in extended periods of drought, the salt water creeps inland into the coastal prairie, an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water. Mangrove trees begin to grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water goes far enough inland.&lt;ref&gt;George, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three species of trees that are considered mangroves: red (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''), black (''[[Avicennia germinans]]''), and white (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''), although all are from different families.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt; All grow in oxygen-poor soil, can survive drastic water level changes, and are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves have the farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms. All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and [[storm surge]]s. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for [[crustaceans]] and fish, and rookeries for birds. The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp (''[[Farfantepenaeus duorarum]]'') and stone crab (''[[Menippe mercenaria]]'') industries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Florida Bay===
{{Main|Florida Bay}}
[[File:Florida Bay at Flamingo.JPG|thumb|A clump of mangroves in the distance, [[Florida Bay]] at [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]]]]

Much of the coast and the inner estuaries are built of mangroves; there is no border between the coastal marshes and the bay. Thus the marine ecosystems in [[Florida Bay]] are considered to be a part of the Everglades watershed and one of the ecosystems connected to and affected by the Everglades as a whole. More than {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}} of Florida Bay is protected by [[Everglades National Park]], representing the largest body of water in the park boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Sea turtle]]s and [[manatee]]s eat the grass, while invertebrate animals, such as worms, clams and other mollusks eat the algae formations and microscopic plankton.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, pp.&amp;nbsp;313–316.&lt;/ref&gt; Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. Sea grasses also serve to stabilize the sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves.

==History==

===Native Americans===
{{Main|Indigenous people of the Everglades region}}

Humans arrived in the Florida peninsula approximately 15,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. [[Paleo-Indian]]s came to Florida probably following large game that included [[giant sloth]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[spectacled bear]]s. They found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, 6,500&amp;nbsp;years ago, climate changes brought a wetter landscape; large animals became extinct in Florida, and the Paleo-Indians slowly adapted and became the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic peoples]]. They conformed to the environmental changes, and created many tools with the various resources available.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Archaic period, the climate became wetter again, and approximately 3000 BCE the rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity. Florida Indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for the bodies of water near where they were located: [[Belle Glade culture|Okeechobee]], [[Caloosahatchee culture|Caloosahatchee]], and [[Glades culture|Glades]].&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calusa and Tequesta====
{{Main|Calusa|Tequesta}}

From the Glades peoples, two major nations emerged in the area: the [[Calusa]] and the [[Tequesta]]. The Calusa was the largest and most powerful nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the [[Florida Keys]]. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau (1968), pp.&amp;nbsp;38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, [[atlatl]]s, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.&lt;ref name="Griffin171"&gt;Griffin, p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimated numbers of Calusa at the beginning of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt; The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000.&lt;ref name="Griffin171"/&gt; In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the [[Yamasee]] to the north. They asked the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Soon they were relocated again to the Florida Keys.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second in power and number to the Calusa in South Florida were the [[Tequesta]]. They occupied the southeastern portion of the lower peninsula in modern-day [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward]] counties. Like the Calusa, the Tequesta societies centered on the mouths of rivers. Their main village was probably on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] or Little River. Spanish depictions of the Tequesta state that they were greatly feared by sailors, who suspected them of torturing and killing survivors of shipwrecks.&lt;ref name="goggintequesta"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goggin | first1 = John | year = 1940 | title = The Tekesta Indians of Southern Florida | url = | journal = The Florida Historical Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 274–285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing European presence in south Florida, Native Americans from the Keys and other areas began increasing their trips to Cuba. Official permission for the immigration of Native Americans from the Florida Keys was granted by Cuban officials in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;Worth, John E. ''A history of Southeastern Indians in Cuba, 1513–1823''. Florida Museum of Natural History, 2004. (Pages 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish priests attempted to set up missions in 1743, but noted that the Tequesta were under assault from a neighboring tribe. When only 30&amp;nbsp;members were left, they were removed to Havana. A British surveyor in 1770 described multiple deserted villages in the region where the Tequesta lived.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Common descriptions of Native Americans in Florida by 1820 used only the term "Seminoles".&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seminole====
{{Main|Seminole}}

[[File:Charley Cypress Seminole Everglades.jpg|thumb|upright|Seminoles made their home in the Everglades]]

Following the demise of the Calusa and Tequesta, Native Americans in southern Florida were referred to as "Spanish Indians" in the 1740s, probably due to their friendlier relations with Spain. The [[Creek (people)|Creek]] invaded the Florida peninsula; they conquered and assimilated what was left of pre-Columbian societies into the Creek Confederacy. They were joined by remnant Indian groups and formed the Seminole, a new tribe, by [[ethnogenesis]]. The Seminole originally settled in the northern portion of the territory. In addition, [[free people of color|free blacks]] and fugitive [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] made their way to Florida, where Spain had promised slaves freedom and arms if they converted to Catholicism and pledged loyalty to Spain. These African Americans gradually created communities near those of the Seminole, and became known as the [[Black Seminoles]]. The groups acted as allies.

In 1817, [[Andrew Jackson]] invaded Florida to hasten its annexation to the United States, in what became known as the [[First Seminole War]]. After Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, conflicts between settlers and the Seminole increased as the former tried to acquire lands. The [[Second Seminole War]] lasted from 1835 to 1842, and afterward, the US forcibly removed about 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole to [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. Many others died in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict broke out again in the [[Third Seminole War]] from 1855 to 1859, when a few hundred Seminole fought off US forces from the swamps of the Everglades. The US finally decided to leave them alone, as they could not dislodge them even after this protracted and expensive warfare.

By 1913, the Seminole in the Everglades numbered no more than 325.&lt;ref name="skinner"/&gt; They made a living by hunting and trading with white settlers, and raised domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau, pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminole made their villages in hardwood hammocks or pinelands, had diets of [[hominy]] and [[coontie]] roots, fish, turtles, venison, and small game.&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = Alanson | year = 1913 | title = Notes on the Florida Seminole | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 63–77 | doi=10.1525/aa.1913.15.1.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their villages were not large, due to the limited size of the hammocks. Between the end of the last Seminole War and 1930, the people lived in relative isolation  from the majority culture.

The construction of the [[Tamiami Trail]], beginning in 1928 and spanning the region from [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] to Miami, altered their ways of life. Some began to work in local farms, ranches, and souvenir stands.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the people who interacted more with European Americans began to move to reservations in the 1940s. These were their bases for reorganizing their government and they became federally recognized in 1957 as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]].

People who kept more traditional ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail and tended to speak the [[Mikasuki language]]. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]]. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, the two groups were closely associated with the Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by [[Alligator wrestling|wrestling alligators]] and selling craftworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridamemory.com/PhotographicCollection/photo_exhibits/seminoles/seminoles4.cfm|title=Images of Florida Seminoles in the Sunshine State|date=c. 1880|publisher=Florida Memory Project: Tourism|access-date=2008-06-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603073231/http://www.floridamemory.com/PhotographicCollection/photo_exhibits/seminoles/seminoles4.cfm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed [[casino]] gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;

===Exploration===
[[File:US War Department Everglades Map 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the Everglades in 1856: Military action during the [[Seminole Wars]] improved understanding of the features of the Everglades]]
{{Main|Draining and development of the Everglades}}

The military penetration of southern Florida offered the opportunity to map a poorly understood and largely unknown part of the country. An 1840 expedition into the Everglades  offered the first printed account for the general public to read about the Everglades. The anonymous writer described the terrain the party was crossing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No country that I have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them.&lt;ref&gt;Tebeau, pp.&amp;nbsp;66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of both wonder or hatred. During the Second Seminole War an army surgeon wrote, "It is in fact a most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile."&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, explorer Hugh Willoughby spent eight days canoeing with a party from the mouth of the [[Harney River]] to the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]]. He sent his observations to the ''New Orleans Times-Democrat''. Willoughby described the water as healthy and wholesome, with numerous [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and 10,000&amp;nbsp;[[alligator]]s "more or less" in Lake Okeechobee. The party encountered thousands of birds near the [[Shark River (Florida)|Shark River]], "killing hundreds, but they continued to return".&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Willoughby pointed out that much of the rest of the country had been explored and mapped except for this part of Florida, writing, "(w)e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of Africa."&lt;ref name="stephan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stephan | first1 = L. Lamar | year = 1942 | title = Geographic Role of the Everglades in the Early History of Florida | url = | journal = The Scientific Monthly | volume = 55 | issue = 6| pages = 515–526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drainage===
A national push for expansion and progress in the United States occurred in the later part of the 19th century, which stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use. According to historians, "From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned. Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do."&lt;ref name="meindl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = Christopher | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = | title = "(December, 2002).

Walker]] to request those with experience in the Everglades to give their opinion on the possibility of drainage. Many officers who had served in the Seminole Wars favored the idea.&lt;ref name="dovell"/&gt;  In 1850 Congress passed a law that gave several states [[wetland]]s within their state boundaries. The [[Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act]] ensured that the state would be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands.&lt;ref name="dovell1948"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dovell | first1 = Junius | year = 1948 | title = The Everglades: A Florida Frontier | url = | journal = Agricultural History | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 187–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for any attempts, though the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] halted progress until after 1877.

After the Civil War, a state agency called the [[Internal improvements|Internal Improvement Fund (IIF)]], whose purpose was to improve Florida's roads, canals, and rail lines, was discovered to be deeply in debt. The IIF found a Pennsylvania real estate developer named [[Hamilton Disston]] interested in implementing plans to drain the land for agriculture. Disston purchased {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of land for $1 million in 1881,&lt;ref name="davis2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = T. Frederick | year = 1939 | title = The Disston Land Purchase | url = | journal = The Florida Historical Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 201–211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he began constructing canals near [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]]. At first the canals seemed to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; They were effective in lowering the groundwater, but it became apparent that their capacity was insufficient for the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Disston's canals did not drain well, his purchase primed the economy of Florida. It made news and attracted tourists and land buyers. Within four years property values doubled, and the population increased significantly.&lt;ref name="davis2"/&gt;

The IIF was able to invest in development projects due to Disston's purchase, and an opportunity to improve transportation arose when oil tycoon [[Henry Flagler]] began purchasing land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida, as far south as [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Flagler," ''Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement'', Vol. 21. Gale Group, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations. The land bordering the rail lines was developed as citrus farms.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Morrison Flagler." ''Dictionary of American Biography'' Base Set. American Council of Learned Societies, 1928–1936.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1896 the rail line had been extended to [[Biscayne Bay]].&lt;ref name="bramson"&gt;Bramson, Seth (1998). "A Tale of Three Henrys", ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', '''23''', Florida Theme Issue, pp.&amp;nbsp;113–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months after the first train had arrived, the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town. Miami became a prime destination for extremely wealthy people after the [[Royal Palm Hotel (Miami)|Royal Palm Hotel]] was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bush | first1 = Gregory | year = 1999 | title = Playground of the USA | url = | journal = The Pacific Historical Review | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 153–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1904 [[gubernatorial]] race, the strongest candidate, [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], promoted draining the Everglades. He called the future of South Florida the "Empire of the Everglades". Soon after his successful election, he began work to "drain that abominable pestilence-ridden swamp",&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; and pushed the Florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands. In 1907 they established the Everglades Drainage District and began to study how to build the most effective canals, and how to fund them.&lt;ref name="dovell"/&gt; Governor Broward ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1908 but lost. Broward was paid by land developer [[Richard J. Bolles]] to tour the state to promote drainage. Elected to the Senate in 1910, Broward died before he could take office. Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them.&lt;ref name="bramson"/&gt;

===Growth of urban areas===
[[File:Canal in the Everglades Drainage District 1915.jpg|thumb|A canal lock in the Everglades Drainage District around 1915]]

With the construction of canals, newly reclaimed Everglades land was promoted throughout the United States. Land developers sold 20,000&amp;nbsp;lots in a few months in 1912. Advertisements promised within eight weeks of arrival, a farmer could be making a living, although for many it took at least two months to clear the land. Some tried burning off the sawgrass or other vegetation, only to learn that the peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing population in towns near the Everglades hunted in the area. Raccoons and otters were the most widely hunted for their skins. Hunting often went unchecked; in one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250&amp;nbsp;alligators and 172&amp;nbsp;otters.&lt;ref name="McCally117"/&gt; [[Water bird]]s were a particular target of [[plume hunting]]. Bird feathers were used in women's hats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 1886, 5&amp;nbsp;million birds were estimated to be killed for their feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or [[aigrette]]s, as they were called in the [[Hatmaking|millinery]] business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold.&lt;ref name="McCally117"&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Millinery was a $17&amp;nbsp;million a year industry&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;310.&lt;/ref&gt; that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of [[egret]]s and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve.&lt;ref name="McCally117"/&gt; Plumes from Everglades wading birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rum-runner]]s used the Everglades as a hiding spot during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]; it was so vast there were never enough law enforcement officers to patrol it.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;330.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like [[copper]] was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as [[Moore Haven, Florida|Moore Haven]], [[Clewiston, Florida|Clewiston]], and [[Belle Glade, Florida|Belle Glade]] sprouted like the crops.&lt;ref name="dovell"/&gt; [[Sugarcane]] became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150&amp;nbsp;million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;334.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over {{convert|7|lb|kg}}, most of it in real estate advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;179.&lt;/ref&gt; Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida [[slash pine]] were cleared. Some of the pine was for lumber, but most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.&lt;ref name="fwspine"/&gt;

===Flood control===
[[File:Army CoE sign Hoover Dike.jpg|thumb|A sign advertising the completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike]]
Two catastrophic hurricanes in [[1926 Miami Hurricane|1926]] and [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane|1928]] caused Lake Okeechobee to breach its levees, killing thousands of people. The government began to focus on the control of floods rather than drainage. The Okeechobee Flood Control District was created in 1929, financed by both state and federal funds. President [[Herbert Hoover]] toured the towns affected by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane and ordered the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to assist the communities surrounding the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;198–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1930 and 1937 a dike {{convert|66|mi|km}} long was built around the southern edge of the lake. Control of the [[Hoover Dike]] and the waters of [[Lake Okeechobee]] were delegated to federal powers: the United States declared legal limits of the lake to between {{convert|14|and|17|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="stephan"/&gt; A massive canal was also constructed {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep through the [[Caloosahatchee River]]; whenever the lake rose too high, the excess water left through the canal.&lt;ref name="stephan"/&gt; More than $20&amp;nbsp;million was spent on the entire project. Sugarcane production soared after the dike and canal were built. The populations of the small towns surrounding the lake jumped from 3,000 to 9,000 after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately the effects of the Hoover Dike were seen. An extended drought occurred in the 1930s; with the wall preventing water from leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust. Salt ocean water intruded into Miami's wells; when the city brought in an expert to explain why, he discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's [[groundwater]]—here, it appeared on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, a million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists who took soil samples before draining did not take into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades make it prone to soil [[subsidence]] when it becomes dry. Naturally occurring bacteria in Everglades peat and muck assist with the process of decomposition under water, which is generally very slow, partially due to the low levels of [[dissolved oxygen]]. When water levels became so low that peat and muck were at the surface, the bacteria interacted with much higher levels of oxygen in the air, rapidly breaking down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved to stilts and {{convert|8|ft|m}} of soil was lost.&lt;ref name="Lodge, p. 38"/&gt;

====Everglades National Park====
[[File:Harry Truman at Everglades National Park.jpg|thumb|President [[Harry Truman]] dedicating [[Everglades National Park]] on December 6, 1947.]]
{{Main|Everglades National Park}}

The idea of a national park for the Everglades was pitched in 1928, when a Miami land developer named [[Ernest F. Coe]] established the Everglades Tropical National Park Association. It had enough support to be declared a national park by Congress in 1934. It took another 13&amp;nbsp;years to be dedicated on December 6, 1947.&lt;ref name="enpsite"&gt;

 | accessdate = 2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month before the dedication of the park, a former editor from ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' and freelance writer named [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] released her first book titled ''[[The Everglades: River of Grass]]''. After researching the region for five years, she described the history and ecology of the South Florida in great detail. She characterized the Everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Jack | year = 2001 | title = Green Awakening: Social activism and the evolution of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's Environmental Consciousness | url = | journal = The Florida Historical Quarterly | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 43–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last chapter was titled, "The Eleventh Hour" and warned that the Everglades were dying, although it could be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p.&amp;nbsp;349.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project====

The same year the park was dedicated, two hurricanes and the wet season caused {{convert|100|in|cm}} to fall on South Florida. Although there were no human casualties, agricultural interests lost approximately $59&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Congress approved the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C&amp;SF), which divided the Everglades into basins. In the northern Everglades were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. In the southern Everglades was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, and released water in dryer times or removed it and pumped it to the ocean in times of flood. The WCAs took up approximately 37&amp;nbsp;percent of the original Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;224.&lt;/ref&gt; The C&amp;SF constructed over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. During the 1950s and 1960s the Miami metropolitan area grew four times as fast as the rest of the nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6&amp;nbsp;million people moved to South Florida: 1,000&amp;nbsp;people moved to Miami every week.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed areas between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas.&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Everglades Agricultural Area====
{{see also|Draining_and_development_of_the_Everglades#Everglades_Agricultural_Area}}
[[File:Everglades canal.jpg|thumb|A 2003 U.S. Geological Survey photo showing the border between Water Conservation Area 3 (bottom) with water, and [[Everglades National Park]], dry (top)]]

The C&amp;SF established {{convert|470000|acre|km2}} for the Everglades Agricultural Area—27&amp;nbsp;percent of the Everglades prior to development.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of [[manganese sulfate]] to Everglades muck produced a profitable harvest for vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though [[sod]], beans, lettuce, celery, and rice are also grown. Fields in the EAA are typically {{convert|40|acre|m2}}, bordered by canals on two sides, that are connected to larger canals where water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–226.&lt;/ref&gt; The fertilizers used on vegetables, along with high concentrations of [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] that are the byproduct of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production, were pumped into WCAs south of the EAA. The introduction of large amounts of these chemicals provided opportunities for exotic plants to take hold in the Everglades.&lt;ref&gt;McCally, pp.&amp;nbsp;172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the defining characteristics of natural Everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient-poor environment, and the introduction of fertilizers began to alter the plant life in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jetport proposition====
A turning point came for development in the Everglades at the proposal in the late 1960s for an expanded airport, after [[Miami International Airport]] outgrew its capacities. The new jetport was planned to be larger than [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]], and [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] airports combined,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and the chosen location was {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of Everglades National Park. The first sentence of the [[U.S. Department of Interior]] study of the [[Environmental Impact of the Big Cypress Swamp Jetport|environmental impact of the jetport]] read, "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities&amp;nbsp;... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park".&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald,&amp;nbsp;p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create {{convert|4000000|USgal|L}} of raw sewage a day and {{convert|10000|ST|MT}} of jet engine pollutants a year, the project met staunch opposition. ''The New York Times'' called it a "blueprint for disaster",&lt;ref&gt;

===Kissimmee River===
The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project's final construction project was straightening the [[Kissimmee River]], a meandering {{convert|90|mi|km|adj=on}}-long river that was drained to make way for grazing land and agriculture. The C&amp;SF started building the C-38 canal in 1962 and the effects were seen almost immediately. Waterfowl, wading birds, and fish disappeared, prompting conservationists and sport fishers to demand the region be restored before the canal was finished in 1971.&lt;ref name="usgs1134"&gt;

===Water quality===
[[File:Mercury warning sign in Everglades National Park.JPG|thumb|upright|Warnings are placed in Everglades National Park to dissuade people from eating fish due to high mercury content.]]

Further problems with the environment arose when a vast [[algal bloom]] appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year [[Typha|cattails]] were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in [[Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge]]. Scientists discovered that [[phosphorus]], used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;230.&lt;/ref&gt; When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered the water in the marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates on the bottom of the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Steven. "Phosphorus Inputs and Vegetation Sensitivity in the Everglades" in ''Everglades: The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. {{ISBN|0-9634030-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] was found in local fish at such high levels that consumption warnings were posted for fishermen. A [[Florida panther]] was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury"&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into [[methylmercury]], and it was [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulating]] through the food chain.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury" /&gt; Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though they continue to be a concern.&lt;ref name="lodgemercury" /&gt;

The [[Everglades Forever Act]], introduced by Governor [[Lawton Chiles]] in 1994, was an attempt to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the [[South Florida Water Management District]] (SFWMD) and the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10&amp;nbsp;parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500&amp;nbsp;ppb in the 1980s).&lt;ref name="efa"&gt;

===Invasive species===
{{Main|List of invasive species in the Everglades}}

[[File:ARS Lygodium microphyllum.jpg|thumb|upright|Climbing ferns overtake cypress trees in the Everglades. The ferns act as "fire ladders" that can destroy trees that would otherwise survive fires.]]

As a center for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is especially vulnerable to [[invasive species]], or species of plants and animals that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ferriter, et al (2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.&lt;ref name=invaders&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/ever/naturescience/upload/2008%20Florida%20Invaders%20For%20Web.pdf Florida Invaders], National Park Service and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Retrieved on February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic plant species actively reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, ''et al'', p. 9-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The melaleuca tree (''[[Melaleuca quinquenervia]]'') takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely in the Everglades than in their native Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–240.&lt;/ref&gt; They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2&amp;nbsp;million has been spent on keeping them out of Everglades National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Georgia (August 22, 1998). "Federal Experts Warn of Alien Plant Invasion", ''The Miami Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian pepper, or Florida holly (''[[Schinus terebinthifolius]]''), has also wreaked havoc on the Everglades, exhibiting a tendency to spread rapidly and to crowd out native species of plants as well as to create inhospitable environments for native animals. It is especially difficult to eradicate and is readily propagated by birds, which eat its small red berries.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian pepper problem is not exclusive to the Everglades; neither is the [[water hyacinth]] ''(Eichhornia crassipes)'', which is a widespread problem in Florida's waterways, a major threat to endemic species, and is difficult and costly to eradicate. The Old World climbing fern (''[[Lygodium microphyllum]]'') may be causing the most harm to restoration as it blankets areas thickly, making it impossible for animals to pass through. It also climbs up trees and creates "fire ladders", allowing parts of the trees to burn that would otherwise remain unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pets have escaped or been released into the Everglades from the surrounding urban areas. Some find the conditions quite favorable and have established self-sustaining populations, competing for food and space with native animals. Many tropical fish have been released, but blue tilapias (''[[Oreochromis aureus]]'') cause damage to shallow waterways by creating large nests and consuming aquatic plants that protect native young fish.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Native to southern Asia, the Burmese python (''[[Python molurus bivittatus]]'') is a relatively new invasive species in the Everglades. This species can grow up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} long, and they compete with alligators for the top of the food chain. Florida wildlife officials speculate that [[Burmese Pythons in Florida|escaped pythons]] have begun reproducing in an environment for which they are well-suited.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = | first = | title = Snake bursts after gobbling gator| publisher = BBC News| date = October 5, 2005| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4313978.stm| accessdate = 2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Everglades National Park alone, agents removed more than 2,000 Burmese pythons from the park {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/burmesepythonsintro.htm|title=Burmese Pythons – Everglades National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities banned four species of exotic snakes, including the Burmese python, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Kim (January 17, 2012).

The invasive species that causes the most damage to bird populations is the cat [[Cat|''(Felis catus)'']], both domestic and [[feral]]. Cats that are let outside live close to suburban populations and have been estimated to number 640&amp;nbsp;per square mile. In such close numbers in historic migratory areas, they have devastating effects on migratory bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan===
{{Main|Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan}}

Although scientists made headway in decreasing mercury and phosphorus levels in water, the natural environment of South Florida continued to decline in the 1990s, and life in nearby cities reflected this downturn. To address the deterioration of the Miami metropolitan area, Governor Lawton Chiles commissioned a report on the [[sustainability]] of the area. In 1995, Chiles published the commission's findings in a report that related the degradation of the Everglades ecosystems to the lower quality of life in urban areas. The report noted past environmental abuses that brought the state to a position to make a decision. Not acting to improve the South Florida ecosystem, the report predicted, would inevitably cause further and intolerable deterioration that would harm local tourism by 12,000&amp;nbsp;jobs and $200&amp;nbsp;million annually, and commercial fishing by 3,300&amp;nbsp;jobs and $52&amp;nbsp;million annually.&lt;ref name="sustainable"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas had grown beyond their capacities to sustain themselves. Crowded cities were facing problems such as high crime rates, traffic jams, severely overcrowded schools, and overtaxed public services; the report noted that water shortages were ironic, given the {{convert|53|in|cm}} of rain the region received annually.&lt;ref name="sustainable"/&gt;

In 1999, an evaluation of the C&amp;SF was submitted to Congress as part of the Water Development Act of 1992. The seven-year report, called the "Restudy", cited indicators of harm to the ecosystem: a 50&amp;nbsp;percent reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing of water releases from canals and pumping stations, an 85 to 90&amp;nbsp;percent decrease in wading bird populations over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of water including [[Lake Okeechobee]], the [[Caloosahatchee River]], [[St. Lucie River|St. Lucie]] estuary, [[Lake Worth Lagoon]], [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Florida Bay]] and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes, [[salinity|hypersalinity]], and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years was due to loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water.&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, p.&amp;nbsp;iii.&lt;/ref&gt; It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Water shortages would become common and some cities would have annual [[water restriction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, pp.&amp;nbsp;iv–v.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Future Drainage in South Florida.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Planned water recovery and storage implementation using CERP strategies]]

The Restudy came with a plan to stop the declining environmental quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Eric (October 20, 2000). "Everglades Restoration Plan Passes House, With Final Approval Seen", ''The New York Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan]] (CERP) proposed more than 60&amp;nbsp;construction projects over 30&amp;nbsp;years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the [[Tamiami Trail]] and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;US Army COE and SFWMD, pp.&amp;nbsp;vii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8&amp;nbsp;billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on December 11, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since its signing, the State of Florida reports that it has spent more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion on the various projects. More than {{convert|36000|acre|km2}} of Stormwater Treatment Areas have been constructed to filter {{convert|2500|ST|MT}} of phosphorus from Everglades waters. An STA spanning {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} was constructed in 2004, making it the largest manmade wetland in the world. Fifty-five percent of the land necessary to acquire for restoration has been purchased by the State of Florida, totaling {{convert|210167|acre|km2}}. A plan to hasten the construction and funding of projects was put into place, named "Acceler8", spurring the start of six of eight large construction projects, including that of three large reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to a story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', state officials say the restoration is lost in a maze of "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis'".&lt;ref&gt;Goodnough, Abby (November 2, 2007). "Vast Effort to Save Everglades Falters as U.S. Funds Dwindle",  ''The New York Times'', Section A, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; CERP still remains controversial as the projects slated for Acceler8, environmental activists note, are those that benefit urban areas, and regions in the Everglades in desperate need of water are still being neglected, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment.&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, Michael (October 14, 2004). "Fla. Steps In to Speed Up State-Federal Everglades Cleanup", ''The Washington Post'', p.&amp;nbsp;A03.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airboating 1, Everglades, FL, jjron 31.03.2012.jpg|thumb|[[Airboat]]ing has become a popular [[ecotourism]] attraction in the Everglades]]

A series of biennial reports from the U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little progress has been made in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council report Progress Toward Restoring the Everglades: The Fourth Biennial Review 2012, http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Progress-Toward-Restoring-Everglades/13422&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="dels"&gt;National Research Council Report-in-Brief, Progress Toward Restoring the Everglades: The Fourth Biennial Review 2012, http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4296-Everglades&lt;/ref&gt; To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction.&lt;ref name="dels" /&gt; Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.

===Air crashes===
At least three airplanes have crashed in the Everglades, including: [[Northwest Airlines Flight 705]] (in 1963), [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 401]] (1972), and [[ValuJet Flight 592]] (1996).

===Future of the Everglades===
In 2008, the State of Florida agreed to buy [[US Sugar Corporation|U.S. Sugar]] and all of its manufacturing and production facilities for an estimated $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=sugar&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida officials indicated they intended to allow U.S. Sugar to process for six more years before dismissing its employees and dismantling the plant. The area, which includes {{convert|187000|acre|km2}} of land, would then be rehabilitated and water flow from Lake Okeechobee would be restored.&lt;ref name=sugar/&gt; In November 2008, the agreement was revised to offer $1.34&amp;nbsp;billion, allowing sugar mills in Clewiston to remain in production.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Damien (November 12, 2008). "Everglades Deal Shrinks to Sale of Land, Not Assets", ''The New York Times'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the revised plan say that it ensures sugarcane will be grown in the Everglades for at least another decade.&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, Jane, Morgan, Curtis (November 16, 2008). "Land deal could lift U.S. Sugar's sagging fortunes: Is it a buyout or a bailout? Either way, a pending deal to sell land to the state for Everglades restoration could reverse Big Sugar's flagging finances", ''The Miami Herald'' (Florida).&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is being done to address the continuing production of sugarcane in the Everglades to minimize phosphorus runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Yao, Stephanie (March 24, 2010).

The '''flags of the [[States of Germany|German states]]''' may come in different variants. All states have a {{lang|de|Landesflagge}} (''[[State flag#Flag of a subnational state|flag of the state]]'', sometimes known as a ''[[civil flag]]''), that may be used by anyone. Some states have another variant, often showing the state [[Heraldry|coat of arms]], called the {{lang|de|Dienstflagge}} (''service flag'' or ''[[government flag]]'', sometimes known as a ''state flag''), normally for use by official government offices only. In addition to these flags, in a few states there are variants exclusively for the state senate, or for state-operated ships. In some cases there are specific flags for high-ranking officials, mainly used as car flags. Frequently, the flags are used in vertical variants.

'''''Following the Equator''''' (sometimes titled ''More Tramps Abroad'') is a non-fiction social commentary in the form of a [[travel literature|travelogue]] published by [[Mark Twain]] in 1897.

Twain was practically bankrupt in 1894 due to investing heavily into the failed [[Paige Compositor]]. In an attempt to extricate himself from debt of $100,000 (equivalent of about $2.5 million in 2010) he undertook a tour of the [[British Empire]] in 1895 at age 60, a route chosen to provide numerous opportunities for lectures in English.

American songwriter [[Jimmy Buffett]] mentions the book in his songs “Take Another Road” and “That’s What Living Is To Me”.

==Themes==
The book is a social commentary, critical of racism towards blacks, Asians, and Indigenous groups; oppressive imperialism in the British Empire; and religious intolerance through missionary efforts.

Although this social commentary is the great import of the book, it is notable that Twain also included a number of fictional stories in the body of what is otherwise a non-fiction work. In particular, the story of how [[Cecil Rhodes]] made his fortune -- by finding a newspaper in the belly of a shark -- and the story of how a man named Ed Jackson made good in life out of a fake letter of introduction to [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], were anthologized in Charles Neider (ed) ''The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain'', (Doubleday, 1957) where they are presented as fiction.

'''ISO 3166-2:MY''' is the entry for [[Malaysia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Malaysia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states and federal territories of Malaysia|3 federal territories and 13 states]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|MY}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Malaysia. The second part is two digits:
* 01&amp;ndash;13: states
* 14&amp;ndash;16: federal territories

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4851">[[File:Renat map.jpg|thumb|One of Renat's maps of [[Dzungaria]]]]

'''Johan Gustaf Renat''' (1682–1744) was a [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] [[Caroleans|soldier]] and cartographer. He is mainly known for his role in bringing detailed maps of [[Central Asia]] to Europe after several years in captivity.

==Early Career and Russian Captivity==

Renat was the son of [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] immigrants to Sweden, who took Swedish nationality in 1681, the year before his birth.

During the [[Great Northern War]] against [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], he served in the army of [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] as a warrant officer (''styckjunkare'') in the artillery. He was taken prisoner after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. In 1711 Renat was sent to [[Tobolsk]] where many Swedish officers were kept as prisoners of war. He entered Russian service on the condition of not fighting against Sweden. Renat helped produce maps of [[Siberia]] for the Russian government.

In 1716 Renat and other Swedish prisoners-of-war took part in [[:ru:Бухгольц, Иван Дмитриевич|Ivan Buchholz]]'s expedition to explore the gold deposits around Lake Yamysh on the [[Irtysh River]]. The expedition was ambushed by a [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] force, and Renat spent the following seventeen years in Dzungar captivity.

==Dzungarian captivity and return to Sweden==

In [[Dzungaria]], Renat helped the khans [[Tsewang Rabtan]] and [[Galdan Tseren]] to organize their campaigns against [[Qing]] rule in Central Asia. Among other things, he organized an artillery regiment and helped the Dzungars to cast cannons.

Renat also met a Swedish woman who was also a Dzungar captive. This was [[Brigitta Scherzenfeldt]], who hailed from [[Scania]]. Twice widowed, she had married a German prisoner who had taken Russian service and been assigned to Siberia. Their convoy was seized by Dzungar raiders in 1716, who killed her husband. She later married Renat.

In 1733, Renat and his wife were allowed to leave. They returned the following year to [[Stockholm]], accompanied with four Dzungar female servants, who were baptized when they arrived in Sweden. Renat's family bought a house in [[Gamla stan]] where they settled down. In 1739, Renat was promoted to the rank of captain in the Swedish army. The same year, he remarried the industrialist [[Elisabet Fritz]].

==Central Asian maps==

Renat brought two detailed maps of Central Asia back to Sweden. But these maps were left in relative obscurity for many years. In 1878, copies of the maps were discovered by the Swedish author [[August Strindberg]], then an assistant librarian at the [[Swedish Royal Library]]. He sponsored their republication in Russia in 1881. A decade later the originals were discovered in the library of [[Uppsala University]], where they are still held.

Strindberg remained interested in the maps for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strindbergsmuseet.se/verken/Tal/fejd6.html August Strindberg, "En svensk karta över Lop-nor och Tarimbäckenet" (in Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language geography''' is the branch of [[human geography]] that studies the geographic distribution of language(s) or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language: 
# "''geography of languages''", which deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or is concerned with 'the analysis of the distribution patterns and spatial structures of languages in contact'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C.H. (1980). ''Language contact and language change in Wales, 1901-1971: a study in historical geolinguistics.'' Welsh History Review 10, 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "''[[geolinguistics]]''" being, when used as a sub-discipline of geography, the study of the 'political, economic and cultural processes that affect the status and distribution of languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunnemark|first=Erik|year=1991|title=What is geolinguistics ?|trans-title=|url=|journal=Geolinguistics, journal of the American Society of geolinguistics.|publisher=American Society of Geolinguistics|volume=17|page=12|pages=|issn=0190-4671|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When perceived as a sub-discipline of linguistics which incorporates contact linguistics, one definition appearing has been 'the study of languages and dialects in contact and in conflict with various societal, economic, ideological, political and other contemporary trends with regard to a particular geographic location and on a planetary scale'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politlinguist.ru/announcements/17.doc|title=International Conference on multilingual perspectives in geolinguistics, April 11, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individ, familj och samhälle", Vaasan Yliopiston Julkaisuja: Vaasa/Vasa, 103-131.&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with regional linguistic variations within languages,&lt;ref&gt;Pei, M. (1966).

Linguistic geography can also refer to studies of how people talk about the landscape. For example, [[toponymy]] is the study of place names.&lt;ref name="Toponymy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadmon|first1=Naftali|title=Toponymy : the lore, laws, and language of geographical names|date=2000|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|isbn=0533135311|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ethnoecology, also known as ethnophysiography, is the study of landscape ontologies and how they are expressed in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=Leslie Main|editor2-last=Hunn|editor2-first=Eugene S.|title=Landscape Ethnoecology: Concepts of Biotic and Physical Space|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies in what is now called contact linguistics have researched the effect of [[language contact]],&lt;ref&gt;Weinrich, U. (1974). ''Languages in contact.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; as the languages or dialects (varieties) of peoples have interacted.&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; This territorial expansion of language groups has usually resulted in the overlaying of languages upon existing speech areas, rather than the replacement of one language by another. An example could be sought in the [[Norman Conquest of England]]: [[Old French]] became the language of the aristocracy but [[Middle English]] remained the language of the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic geography ==
Linguistic geography, as a field, is dominated by [[Linguistics|linguists]] rather than [[geographer]]s.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt; [[Charles W. J. Withers]] describes the difference as resulting from a focus on "elements of language, and only then with their geographical or social variation, as opposed to investigation of the processes making for change in the extent of language areas."&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; [[Peter Trudgill]] says, "linguistic geography has been geographical only in the sense that it has been concerned with the spatial distribution of linguistic phenomena."&lt;ref name=Trud2/&gt; Greater emphasis has been laid upon explanation rather than mere description of the patterns of linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; That move has paralleled similar concerns in [[geography]] and language studies.&lt;ref&gt;Withers, C.W.J. (1984). ''Gaelic in Scotland 1698-1981: the geographical history of a language.'' Edinburgh: John Donald; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some studies have paid attention to the social use&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; of language and to variations in dialect within languages in regard to [[social class]] or occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli, P.P. (1972). ''Language and social context.'' Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding such variations, lexicographer [[Robert Burchfield]] notes that their nature "is a matter of perpetual discussion and disagreement" and notes that "most professional linguistic scholars regard it as axiomatic that all varieties of English have a sufficiently large vocabulary for the expression of all the distinctions that are important in the society using it." He contrasts this with the view of the historian [[John Vincent (historian)|John Vincent]], who regards such a view as

{{quote|"a nasty little orthodoxy among the educational and linguistic establishment. However badly you need standard English, you will have the merits of non-standard English waved at you. The more extravagantly your disadvantages will be lauded as 'entirely adequate for the needs of their speakers', to cite the author of ''Sociolinguistics''. It may sound like a radical cry to support pidgin, patois, or dialect, but translated into social terms, it looks more like a ploy to keep Them (whoever Them may be) out of the middle-class suburbs."|John Vincent|The Times&lt;ref&gt;''The Times, 23 February 1983, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burchfield concludes, "Resolution of such opposite views is not possible.... future of dialect studies and the study of class-marked distinctions are likely to be of considerable interest to everyone."&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], linguistic geography has traditionally focused upon rural English,rather than urban English.&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, one could still say, "We still know far more about the distribution of ''byre/shippon/mistall/cow-stable/cow-house/cow-shed/neat-house/beast-house'' for 'cow-shed' than we do about urban synonyms  for pedestrian crossings, lollipop men, machines used to wash cars, forecourts of petrol stations, bollards, sleeping policemen, pay-out desks, supermarket trolleys, traffic wardens, telephone booths and hundreds of other items found in every city in the United Kingdom." Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common production of linguistic investigators of dialects is the shaded and dotted map showing to show where one linguistic feature ends and another begins or overlaps. Various compilations of these maps for England have been issued over the years, including Joseph Wright's ''English Dialect Dictionary'' (1896–1905), the ''[[Survey of English Dialects]]'' (1962-8), and ''The Linguistic Atlas of England'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geolinguistic organizations ==

Most [[geolinguistic organizations]] identify themselves as associations of linguists rather than of geographers. This includes the two oldest which both date to 1965 with "Amici Linguarum" (language friends) being founded by [http://www.kebi.se/erikgunnemark/engindex.html Erik V. Gunnemark] and The American Society of Geolinguistics by Prof. [[Mario A. Pei]]. The research in [[geolinguistics]] which these organizations and others, which are more geographically oriented, promote is often interdisciplinary, being at times simultaneously both linguistic and geographic, and also being at times linked to other sub-disciplines of linguistics as well as going beyond linguistics to connect to sociology, anthropology, ethnology, history, demographics, political science, studies of cognition and communication, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54857">This is a '''listing of live-action motion picture shorts produced by Walt Disney or [[The Walt Disney Company]]''', from 1921 to the present. This list only includes shorts which were initially released as individual shorts, which excludes the shorts that were originally released as part of Disney features in the 1950s and later re-released as individual shorts. This list also does not include shorts that do not contain any original stock footage. This list includes shorts with both live action and animation only if the majority of the short contains live action. This list does not include any trailers as they are usually edited from the features they are supposed to promote.

The '''Lomellina''' ([[Western Lombard dialect|Western Lombard]]: '''Ümlína'''/'''Lümelína''') is a geographical and [[historical region|historical area]] in the [[Pianura Padana]] ([[Po River]]'s valley) of northern Italy, located in south-western [[Lombardy]] between the [[Sesia]], Po and [[Ticino River|Ticino]] rivers. It is one of three areal divisions of the [[Province of Pavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.turismo.regione.lombardia.it/it/le-guide/cicloturismo/pedalare-in-relax-percorsi-su-due-ruote-facili/la-lomellina.htm Lomellina (Office of Tourism of Lombardy)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140114205304/http://www.turismo.regione.lombardia.it/it/le-guide/cicloturismo/pedalare-in-relax-percorsi-su-due-ruote-facili/la-lomellina.htm |date=14 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Lomellina includes 58 ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (municipalities), the most important today being [[Vigevano]] and [[Mortara, Lombardy|Mortara]]; the name however derives from its ancient capital [[Lomello]]. The area is particularly renowned for its [[rice paddies]]: [[rice|the crop]] has been cultivated here since the sixteenth century.

==History==
In ancient times Lomellina was inhabited by the [[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes of the [[Laevi]], and the [[Marici (Ligures)|Marici]] (co-founders of [[Ticinum]], the modern [[Pavia]]) and the [[Libici]] (founders of [[Vercelli]]). Later they were [[ancient Rome|Romanized]]. Although crossed by an important road connecting Ticinum to [[Augusta Taurinorum]] (the modern Turin), the region seems not to have been intensively urbanized under the Romans, with the exception of the area of Vigevano.

With the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the arrival of the [[Lombards]], who set their capital in [[Pavia]], Lomellina acquired importance, with a comital dynasty (''Conti di Lomello'') rising in Lomello. The city of Pavia conquered Lomello in 1146, and the area was later under the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]], as part of the [[Duchy of Milan]].

In 1707, after the [[War of Spanish Succession]], a part of Lomellina was conquered by the Piedmontese [[House of Savoy]] and made an autonomous province. The area of Vigevano and [[Robbio]], called ''Contado di Vigevano'' and which had been autonomous since 1532, was also acquired by Piedmont in 1743.

In 1859 the administrative reform promoted by [[Urbano Rattazzi]] annexed Lomellina to the [[province of Pavia]] just conquered from [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], becoming later part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

[[File:Plan mediaeval manor.jpg|thumb|300px|Conjectural map of a medieval manor. The method of "strip farming" was in use under the [[open field system]]. The mustard-colored areas are part of the '''[[demesne]]''', the [[hatching|hatched]] areas part of the '''[[glebe]]'''. The [[manor house]], residence of the [[Lord of the Manor|lord]] and location of the [[manorial court]], can be seen in the mid-southern part of the manor, near the parish church.]]

A '''manor''' in [[English law]] is an [[estate in land]] to which is incident the right to hold a [[court]] termed [[court baron]], that is to say a [[manorial court]]. The proper unit of tenure under the [[feudalism|feudal system]] is the [[fief|fee]] (or fief), on which the manor became established through the process of time, akin to the modern establishment of a "business" upon a freehold site. The manor is nevertheless often described as the basic feudal unit of tenure and is historically connected with the territorial divisions of the [[March (territorial entity)|march]], [[county]], [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]], [[parish]] and [[township]].

==Legal theory==
The legal theory of the origin of manors refers them to a grant from the [[The Crown|crown]] of a fee from the monarch's [[allodial title|allodial]] lands, as stated in the following extract from Perkins's ''Treatise'' on the laws of England:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The beginning of a manor was when the king gave a thousand acres of land, or greater or lesser parcel of land, unto one of his subjects and his heirs, which [[Feudal land tenure|tenure]] is [[knight service]] at the least. And the donee did perhaps build a [[Manor house|mansion house]] upon parcel of the same land, and of 20 acres, parcel of that which remained, or of a greater or lesser parcel, before the [[statute]] of [[Quia emptores]] did [[Enfeoffment|enfeoff]] a stranger to hold of him and his heirs to plough 10 acres of land, parcel of that which remained in his possession, and did enfeoff another of another parcel thereof to go to war with him [[Anglo-Scottish Wars| against the Scots]] etc., and so by continuance of time made a manor".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is still as the jurist Sir Joshua Williams terms it, a "fundamental rule" that all lands were originally derived from the crown and that the [[monarch]] is lord paramount mediate or immediate of all the land in the realm. A manor then arises when the holder of a parcel so granted or supposed to have been granted by the crown, and who is termed in relation thereto the [[Lord of the Manor]], has in turn granted portions thereof to others who stand to him in the relation of [[Leasehold estate|tenants]]. Of the portion reserved by the lord for his own use, termed the [[demesne]], part was occupied by [[villein]]s, with the duty of cultivating the rest for the lord's use. These were originally [[Leasehold estate|tenants at will]] and in a state of semi-[[serf]]dom but they became in course of time the [[copyhold]] tenants of the later law. It is of the essence of copyhold that it should be regulated by the custom of the manor, as evidenced in the [[manorial roll]] produced by the [[manorial court]]. Manors cannot be created at the present day because manorial courts cannot be established with any legal jurisdiction. Scriven stated:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/atreatiseoncopy00scrigoog Scriven, John, (Serjeant at law), A treatise on copyhold, customary freehold, and ancient demesne tenure: with the jurisdiction of Courts baron and Courts leet; also an appendix, containing rules for holding Customary courts, Courts baron and Courts leet, forms of court rolls, deputations, and copyhold assurances, and extracts from the relative acts of Parliament, 2 vols., 2nd. ed., London, 1823], vol.1, chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Length of time being of the very essence of a manor, such things as receive their perfection by the continuance of time come not within the compass of the king's prerogative"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effect of ''Quia Emptores''==
The effect of the [[statute]] of ''[[Quia Emptores]]'' (1290) was to make the creation of manors henceforward impossible, inasmuch as it enacted "that upon all sales and [[enfeoffment|feoffments]] of land the [[feoffee]] shall hold the same, not of his immediate feoffor, but of the chief lord of the [[fee (feudal tenure)|fee]] of whom such feoffor himself held it". The statute did not apply to a [[tenant-in-chief]] of the king, who might have alienated his land under a license. Accordingly, it is assumed that all existing manors are "of a date prior to the statute of ''[[Quia Emptores]]'' except perhaps some which may have been created by the king's tenants-in-chief with license from the crown".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Real Property, chap. 4; See also Scriven, Copyholds, chap 1&lt;/ref&gt; When a great [[English feudal barony|baron]] had granted out smaller manors to others, the seignory of the superior baron was frequently termed an [[Honour (feudal land tenure)|honour]].

==Differentiated by legal status==
All land was differentiated by its legal status and by physical characteristics. The basic forms of tenure were: [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], [[Copyhold]], [[Customary Freehold]] and  [[Leasehold]]. The legal status of land in England and Wales has been simplified such that only Freehold and Leasehold land remains (although, since 2002, a new category, [[Commonhold]], also exists).

==Constituent physical elements==
*[[Demesne]] divided into:
** [[Medieval deer park|deer park]], where the high and rare honour of a royal [[licence to empark]] had been obtained, usually restricted to great nobles or to the king's favoured courtiers, which enabled the lord to de-bar entry into the emparked area to other hunters, including to the king himself, who was accustomed to hunt several dozen square miles at a time with hundreds of hunt followers when on royal progresses around his kingdom. Horsemen would surround such large area in a funnel shape and all deer enclosed within would be systemmatically driven into large nets at the mouth of the funnel, to be slaughtered and later cooked and eaten by the king's huge retinue. Thus the lord of the manor would be able to enclose the licenced area by casting up an earthbank and hedge or a stone wall, both to preserve his own deer captive within, safe from predation and to prevent entry by others. Such arrangements frequently caused disputes amongst neighbouring lords and the annals record many instances of deliberate break-ins and breaking down of hedges for the purpose of exercising purported hunting-rights.
**pleasure garden, a later development.
**manor farm, home farm or [[Barton (demesne)|barton]], land retained "in-hand" by the lord of the manor, without sub-tenant and exploited for his own direct benefit by his own paid servants or manorial workforce, being chiefly, until latter centuries, tenants-at-will (those with no tenancy rights) or those whose [[copyhold]] tenancies stipulated so many days per month or year to be worked on the demesne.&lt;/br&gt;
*Village, a settlement where most of the tenants lived, originally the ''villeins'', tenants of the lord. The [[villa]] was the centre of the manor in Roman Britain. 
*Cotts (or cottages) scattered individual small farmsteads occupied by the cottars, a superior class of tenants.
*Court house, in which manorial courts were held where a non-resident lord had no [[manor house]] and thus no [[great hall]] in which such business could be transacted by his steward. This was a common arrangement as many absentee lords held multiple manors and resided on only one permanently, or commuted between only two or three. 
*Church land, the land on which was built the parish church. Originally part of the demesne land. Many surviving early mediaeval deeds record donations of land by lords to a local priory, perhaps one founded by their ancestors, for the purpose of establishing a parish church on. Sometimes an existing church was given by the lord to some favoured priory.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[Molland]] Church in Devon was given by the lord of the manor in the 12th century to [[Hartland Abbey]]&lt;/ref&gt; Parish churches were built and established by the original lords of each manor, in consultation with the bishop, out of self-interest, next to their manor houses, as being close to an institution which was believed to have direct access to an all-powerful god was clearly advantageous, perhaps even deemed essential for prosperity. [[Nave]]s were added to the original buildings (which then became [[chancel]]s) as parishioners began to require access also, usually built and maintained at the expense of the parishioners. Many such churches were built in time immemorial or pre-historic Celtic or later Anglo-Saxon times, thus the process of their establishment is not recorded. The Norman Conquest of 1066 obtained for King William ready-made and fully staffed "going concern" manors, income producing businesses, and parish churches which had been established for centuries. 
*Manorial chapels (or "manorial aisles") were built onto the sides of chancels of parish churches as the lord's household expanded, for the seating of the lord and his household at mass. He was thus seated in a private area out of direct view of his tenants occupying the nave, with its own private external entrance, and was near the high altar, the holiest place in the church, and was able to view the priest elevating the [[Sacramental bread|host]], the holiest part of the mass, through a [[hagioscope|squint]] let into the intervening wall, if any. He and his family were buried under the floor of the manorial chapel, in dedicated vaults or under individual [[ledger stone]]s, or in the chancel nearer the high altar itself, the position of greatest honour being to the immediate north of the high altar, a position frequently occupied by founder's tombs and their effigies or monuments. From the 17th century the lord's family erected their mural monuments on the walls of the manorial chapel. The lords were responsible for the building costs and for financing the maintenance of the fabric of the manorial chapel, and this onerous clause is frequently found in their deeds by modern purchasers of manor houses. Today many such unaware purchasers are sued in law by the Church of England, owners today of the freeholds of most parish churches, for refusal to pay large repair bills for roofs of former manorial chapels.
*[[Glebe]], land donated in fee at some time by a previous lord of the manor to the [[rectory]] for support of the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] (parson or [[parish priest]]). Each succeeding rector thus became effectively the life tenant. In addition to the produce from the glebe, the rector was entitled to [[tithes]] from the manor as a whole, in general one tenth of all agricultural produce, due annually from all tenants of the manor, frequently delivered before the specified due date into the [[tithe barn]], a large structure within the manor.
*[[Common land]], by convention open land, over which the lord, certain manorial tenants, and other [[ecclesiastical parish|parishioners]] held shared rights. For example, grazing rights or a right of [[estovers]] (taking wood).
*Woodland, in which tenants might have the right to [[pannage]] (feeding swine on acorns).
*Corn-mill, usually situated by a stream and driven by water power, at which tenants were obliged to grind their corn into flour, thus providing a further revenue stream for the lord, who had a captive customer-base. They were thus forbidden from grinding at the mill within any other manor.
*[[Freehold (law)|Freehold]]. Such "free-tenants" or "free men" had a duty to attend and sit as jury on the lord's manorial court, presided over by himself, or if an absentee lord, by his [[steward (office)|steward]]. Apparently not subject to the jurisdiction of the manorial court. Disputes between a lord and his freeholders were held in the county court, presided over by the Sheriff of the county.
*[[Copyhold]], the text of which tenancy agreement was recorded only in the manorial roll, which therefore had to be consulted in case of dispute. Subject to the jurisdiction of the manorial court.
*[[Customary Freehold]] (between the two)
*[[Leasehold]] (granted for a term, usually one of years or a number of lives not exceeding three, or the longer of either period); the Reversion (also known as Reversionary Freehold Interest or Freehold Reversion), at the end of the term or in case of [[escheat]] or forfeiture, is the prospective property of the lord of the manor.

===Differentiated by physical character===
*[[Arable land|Arable]], ploughed land used to grow crops.
*Waste, economically unproductive land. 
*[[Pasture]], grassland used for grazing livestock in the summer.
*[[Meadow]], grassland set aside for making hay for winter fodder.
*Closes, small enclosed fields closed-off by the erection of earth-banks, hedges or stone wall boundaries, used for example to house ewes with their lambs requiring close observation, and for rotational pasture management, reducing parasite infestation and keeping grass fresh.
*[[Marsh]], a possible source of reed for thatching of roofs.
*[[Woodland]], an essential fuel and building resource. Also used for [[pannage]].
*[[Furze]], a highly flammable fuel resource used by the lower tenants.
*Fallow, land resting within the cycle of [[crop rotation]] agriculture.
*Fishpond, for inland manors used to breed and store fish such as [[carp]] for eating on Fridays when the eating of meat was prohibited by religious custom.
*[[Quarry]], a source of building stone and of lime for burning to create mortar and fertiliser.

==Officers==
A manor was akin to the modern firm or business or other [[going concern]]. It was a productive unit, which required physical capital, in the form of land, buildings, equipment and draught animals such as ploughing oxen and labour in the form of direction, day-to-day management and a workforce. It was further similar in that its ownership could be transferred, with the necessary "licence to alienate" having been obtained from the overlord, as can the ownership of a modern company. The administration was self-contained and the new lord needed only to collect its net revenues to form his return on investment. The direction was ultimately provided by the [[manorial court]], presided over by the lord's personal [[Steward (office)|steward]], whose members included the freehold tenants of the manor. The court itself appointed most of the lower manorial officers, which included the following:
*[[Bailiff]], in charge of supervising the cultivation of the manor.
*[[Reeve (England)|Reeve]], an overseer.
*Ditch Reeve, responsible for maintaining drainage ditches.
The efficiency, productivity and thus profitability of a manor therefore depended on a mixture of qualities and interaction of location, micro-climate, natural resources, soil type, direction and labour. It was in the interest of all dwellers within the manor, to a greater or lesser degree, that it should be successful.

==Jurisdiction==
The [[manorial court]] had wide legal jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the manor, sometimes with the right to administer capital punishment, if the lord had obtained from the king the right of holding a [[court leet]]. Much of the law was specific to a particular manor, as developed by "custom of the manor" and as interpreted by the manorial court. Rights of appeal existed to the [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred court]] and the [[county court]] beyond that over which presided the county's [[High sheriff|sheriff]].

==Free manor==
A ''free manor'' was an autonomous area, outside the jurisdiction, law and administrative control of the surrounding territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=duPsOUlyaWEC&amp;pg=PA101 Across the open field: essays drawn from English landscapes, page 101] [[Laurie Olin]], published 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-3531-9}}, accessed 2011-10-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Every person who lived in medieval England was regarded as a member of a manor and was under the jurisdiction of a manorial court, unless a citizen of a [[borough]] (in certain generally urban towns), or a cleric, or a lord of the manor himself, or (failing sons) an heiress lady of the manor herself, who were subject to the primary jurisdiction of the king's court, if a [[tenant-in-chief]], or of the [[county court]], if a [[mesne lord|mesne (intermediate) lord]]. It was not permissible for a man to migrate from the manor of his birth except by arrangement with its authorities. The manor was typically, via its [[vestry]], also the source of a needy family's charitable relief, which was at the discretion of the manorial court, according to the custom of each manor. An alien within a manor would not therefore be automatically entitled to any relief or protection (such as parish [[constable]]s) offered by the lord to prevent crime. Merchants and travellers were in general only safe in traveling with costly hired protection or with protection in place from a local [[sheriff]], particularly in remote and sparsely populated areas. Even in 1822, the book ''Rural Rides'' refers to frequent instances of robbery in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;''Rural Rides'' Volume i. THROUGH HAMPSHIRE, BERKSHIRE, SURREY, AND SUSSEX, BETWEEN 7th OCTOBER AND 1ST DECEMBER, 1822 (ed. Everyman) William Cobbett,  p 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residents of a manor===
*[[Lord of the manor]], often absent, or an [[Absentee landlord|absentee]], never resident
*[[Serfdom|Serfs]]
*[[Villein]]s
*[[Cottar]]s
*[[Bordar]]s
*[[freehold (law)|Freeholder]]s
*[[Copyhold]]ers

==Overlap with parish==
Any parish which is among the bulk formed in the medieval period (whether town or village, but not in old cores of cities) tended to share its name with the manor (which may or may not exist today).  Such non-borough parishes have clerical jurisdiction over the same geographic territory over which the lord had jurisdiction through his manorial court.

The parish generally came into existence after the establishment of the manor, following the building of a church by the [[Lord of the Manor]] for the use of himself and his tenants, perhaps in consultation with the [[bishop]] within whose clerical jurisdiction the manor was situated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TQ1655/thorncroft/ Domesday Map listing all Domesday Book entries - Thorncroft] Retrieved 2013-09-30&lt;/ref&gt; He gave permanently the parish church some of his land, the revenues from which thus were to support the priest and the maintenance of the church building. The lord of the manor retained the [[advowson]], that is the right to select and appoint the parish priest, yet the parish was governed by the [[diocese]] within which it was situated, which also granted it the [[tithes]] to which it was legally entitled, which was a tax of one tenth of the produce of the manor.  Outlying parts of many manors over time were forcibly lost by judgment or [[attainder]] by the sovereign, exchanged between neighbouring lords or sold to pay debts, and thus would change owner, but would almost never change parish.

As, over time, a manor's lands could grow and shrink (they could extend over several different parishes), many manors became virtually worthless and lost any pretence of having a lord or became entirely subsumed by another.  Others could arise by the principal lord's [[feudal system|special grant, approved by the sovereign]] of [[subinfeudation]].  Where such additional manors were created, the parish would then cover these, unless a new parish was also created.

Ludwig Schwarz served as the Director of Dorpat Observatory&lt;ref name=ob376/&gt; (now [[Tartu Observatory]]) from 1872&lt;ref name=Moll&gt;Mollin (2011), p.&amp;nbsp;162, Biography 4.8, Thomas Clausen (1801-1885).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;''EMWS'' issue (1894), p.&amp;nbsp;317: Scientific News, shows incorrectly 1874.&lt;/ref&gt;  to 1891,&lt;ref name=ob376/&gt; succeeding [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Thomas Clausen]] who held the position from 1866 to 1872.&lt;ref name=Moll/&gt; Upon the retirement of Schwarz from the directorship on 1 September 1891 the position became the responsibility of Grigori Levitski who held it until 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Tartu Observatory profiles, website.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure in later life he conducted studies of one third of the 10,000 celestial stars visible at Tartu.&lt;ref name=top/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Radde's warbler]], a [[leaf warbler]] bird that breeds in [[Siberia]] and winters in southeast [[Asia]], bears a scientific name (Phylloscopus schwarzi) that commemorates Schwarz.{{sfnp|Raade|1863|p=260}} The bird was described in 1863 by naturalist and fellow explorer Gustav Radde who served in the East Siberian Expedition of 1855 led by Schwarz.{{sfnp|Raade|1863|p=260}}

'''Rheinfelden''' ({{lang-gsw|Rhyfälde}}, {{IPA-gsw|ˈriːfæld̥ə|}}) is a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Aargau]] in [[Switzerland]], seat of the district of [[Rheinfelden (district)|Rheinfelden]].  It is located 15 kilometres east of [[Basel]].  The name means the fields of the [[Rhine]], as the town is located on the [[Hochrhein]].  It is home to [[Feldschlösschen]], the most popular beer in Switzerland. The city is across the river from [[Rheinfelden, Germany|Rheinfelden]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]]; the two cities were joined until [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] fixed the [[Germany|German]]–Swiss border on the Rhine in 1802 and are still socially and economically tied.

==Geography==
[[File:Aerial View - Rheinfelden AG1.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view at the historic centre]]
[[File:Grossraum Basel.png|thumb|left|Rheinfelden, shown to the right of [[Greater Basel]]]]
The old town of Rheinfelden lies on the left bank of the [[Rhine]], where the river is divided into two arms by the "Inseli", a roughly {{convert|150|m|ft}} long island. Downstream of the Inseli and the ''Rheinbrücke'', the river bottoms drops to about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, creating a huge and deadly vortex, known as the ''St-Anna-Loch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismus-rheinfelden.ch/de/erlebnisse/tourofaargau/stadtrundgang/welcome.php?action=showinfo&amp;info_id=4330 Tourismus Rheinfelden] {{de icon}} accessed 6 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} east is the ''[[:de:Magdenerbach|Magdenerbach]]''.

The wooded, gently-rising foothills of the ''[[Table Jura|Tafeljura]]'' lie south of the town. These are the Steppberg ({{convert|395|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}above [[sea level]]) and the "Berg" ({{convert|427|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}), both in the south-east.&lt;ref&gt;[https://map.geo.admin.ch Swiss Topo] accessed 6 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Between these two hills lie the deeply incised valleys of the ''Magdenerbach''.

Rheinfelden has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|16.03|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.  Of this area, {{convert|3.32|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 20.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|8.01|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 50.0% is forested.   Of the rest of the land, {{convert|3.62|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 22.6% is settled (buildings or roads), {{convert|1.07|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} or 6.7% is either rivers or lakes and {{convert|0.01|km2|acre|abbr=on}} or 0.1% is unproductive land.&lt;ref name=BFS_land&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/data/gemeindedaten.html |title=Statistik Schweiz - Gemeindedaten |publisher=Bfs.admin.ch |date=2015-01-13 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rheinfelden has an area, (as of the 2004/09 survey) of {{Swiss area|4258|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|4258|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 20.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 50.0% is forested.   Of the rest of the land, 22.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and 6.7% is unproductive land.  In the 2013/18 survey a total of {{convert|213|ha|acre|abbr=on}} or about 13.3% of the total area was covered with buildings, an increase of {{convert|57|ha|acre|abbr=on}} over the 1982 amount.  Over the same time period, the amount of recreational space in the municipality increased by {{convert|25|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and is now about 3.43% of the total area.  Of the agricultural land, {{convert|4|ha|acre|abbr=on}} is used for orchards and vineyards, {{convert|297|ha|acre|abbr=on}} is fields and grasslands.  Since 1982 the amount of agricultural land has decreased by {{convert|104|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.  Over the same time period the amount of forested land has increased by {{convert|6|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.  Rivers and lakes cover {{convert|108|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/raum-umwelt/bodennutzung-bedeckung.gnpdetail.2016-0436.html |title=Arealstatistik Land Use - Gemeinden nach 10 Klassen |date=24 November 2016 |website=www.landuse-stat.admin.ch |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFOS2017&gt;[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/regionalstatistik/regionale-portraets-kennzahlen/gemeinden/daten-erlaeuterungen.assetdetail.2422865.html Regionalporträts 2017: Swiss Federal Statistical Office] {{de icon}} accessed 18 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest point ({{convert|427|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is located on "Berg", the lowest point ({{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is on the Rhine. Neighbouring cities are [[Kaiseraugst]] to the west, [[Olsberg, Switzerland|Olsberg]] to the south-west, [[Magden]] to the south and Möhlin to the east (all in the Aargau); over the river in Germany lies [[Rheinfelden, Germany|Rheinfelden, Baden-Württemberg]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
{{original research|section|date=July 2015}}
The area around Rheinfelden was already settled in the [[Middle Stone Age]], around 10,000 years [[Before Present|before the present day]]. At that time, people lived in the "Hermitage", a small natural cave next to the current highway. In the year 45 BC, a few kilometres further west, the settlement [[Augusta Raurica]] was founded, the first [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town in Switzerland, near modern Kaiseraugst. In the plains at Rheinfelden was then a large [[estate (building)|estate]]. Towards the end of the 4th century a border fort was constructed at the western settlement.
[[File:Beladung eines frachtkahnes vor den toren rheinfeldens.png|thumb|left|upright|Loading a boat near the gate of Rheinfelden from Diebold Schillings "Schweizerchronik" from 1484. The Rhein has always played a pivotal role in the development of Rheinfelden.]]

Rheinfelden is first mentioned about 851 as ''Rifelt'' and in the first half of the 12th century it was called ''Rinfelden''.&lt;ref name=HDS/&gt; In the second half of the 10th century, the entire [[Fricktal]] area—the Frick valley, a finger of land in northwestern [[Switzerland]] east of present-day [[Basel]], between the [[Jura Mountains]] to the south, and the [[High Rhine]] border with present-day Germany to the north—was within [[County of Burgundy|Kingdom of Burgundy]]. At that time, Rheinfelden was granted to the von Wetterau family. They later adopted the title of Count of Rheinfelden. The Rheinfeldens built a fortress, "Stein", on the strategically located island; a riverbank settlement stood at the "Altenburg". The last of this [[Graf|comital]] line was [[Rudolf of Rheinfeld]]en, [[Duke of Swabia]] (1057–79) and German [[antiking]] (1077–80) during the [[Investiture Controversy]].

When Rudolf died on October 15, 1080 in [[Merseburg]], his territories were inherited by [[Berthold II, Duke of Swabia|Berthold II of Zähringen]].but the town went to his son Otto and his family the von Wetter's. Berhold's second son, [[Conrad of Zähringen|Conrad]], awarded [[market town|market rights]] to the city, making it the oldest [[House of Zähringen|Zähringerstadt]] in Switzerland and the oldest city in the Aargau; in 1150 he also had the first bridge built across the Rhine, between [[Konstanz]] and [[Strasbourg]]. In 1218, [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen|Berthold V]] died without issue. In 1225, Rheinfelden gained ''[[Reichsfreiheit]]'' to become an [[Free Imperial City|Imperial City]].

A little over a century later, in 1330, the city pledged itself to the [[Habsburg]]s, becoming a part of [[Further Austria]]. In 1445, when the Habsburgs were fighting the [[Old Zürich War]], insurgents destroyed the castle on the "Inseli", due to the city's allegiance with Basel. After a siege lasting several months, Rheinfelden was returned to Austrian subjugation in 1449. After the [[Waldshut War]] from 1468, all of Fricktal Burgundy pledged to the Habsburgs. After the Burgundians were beaten by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in the [[Burgundian Wars]], Rheinfelden land, not Title, was restored to Austria in 1477.

During the 17th century, there was very little time during which the city enjoyed peace. During the [[Rappenkrieg (1612-1614)|Rappenkrieg]], a peasant uprising that lasted from 1612 until 1614, the city was unsuccessfully besieged but devastated. Between 1633 and 1638 the [[Thirty Years' War]] reached Fricktal, where Rheinfelden played an important role. On 15 July 1633, [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] and [[Early Modern France|French]] troops devastated the city. On 5 February 1638, the city was besieged by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] troops under the command of [[Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]]. On 28 February the [[Battle of Rheinfelden]] began, as the city was attacked by numerically-superior [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] troops under the command of [[Johann von Werth]] and [[Federico Savelli]]. The Protestants lost this encounter and withdrew. Bernhard brought them weapons, but in the second action, on 3 March, they were victorious, as he and his men unexpectedly re-appeared on the battlefield; both Savelli and Werth were captured.

By the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Austrians had built a fortress on the island to secure the southwestern border of the [[Breisgau]]. In 1678, French troops under the command of [[François de Créquy]] fired at the city. In 1745, during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], the French made a fortress on the same ground and also blasted a portion of the city wall. On 17 July 1796 Rheinfelden was again occupied and looted by the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French]].

As a result of the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] in 1797, the Fricktal became a [[French client republic|French protectorate]], forming the [[front line]] between the [[French Revolution]]ary and the [[Austria]]n troops in the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. On 20 February 1802 Rheinfelden was made a district capital of the newly created [[Canton of Fricktal]], (Principality of Frickgau), joining the [[Helvetic Republic]] in August, the point at which the city became decisively Swiss. After the removal of the governor [[Sebastian Fahrländer]] at the end of September 1802, the seat of the cantonal government was relocated here from [[Laufenburg, Switzerland|Laufenburg]]. With the beginning of the ''Reichsdeputationshauptschluss'' (the [[German Mediatisation]]), Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the canton of Fricktal. Since 19 March 1803, Rheinfelden has been the capital of a district of the same name, in the [[canton of Aargau]]. With the ''Reichsdeputationshauptschluss'', the remaining (German) parts of the city lost their independence to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], becoming [[Rheinfelden, Germany]].

'''Rui (Ruy) Faleiro''' {{IPA-pt|ˈʁuj fɐˈlɐjɾu|}} was a Portuguese [[cosmography|cosmographer]], [[astrology|astrologer]], and [[astronomy|astronomer]] who was the principal scientific organizer behind [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s [[circumnavigation]] of the world.

Born in [[Covilhã]], [[Kingdom of Portugal]], at the end of the fifteenth century, Faleiro and his brother [[Francisco Faleiro]], also a cosmographer, served the [[Spain|Spanish]] king  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] in [[Seville]]. Faleiro, one of the first to apply the most rigorously scientific method of determining [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], had earlier served [[John II of Portugal]] and his successor, [[Manuel I of Portugal]].

Faleiro was certain that south of the "Terras de Vera Cruz" (i.e. [[Brazil]]), at [[40th parallel south|40 degrees latitude]], there was an [[Atlantic]] passage that led to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]]. The sought-after [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] would, by Faleiro's calculations, fall on the Spanish side of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of Tordesillas]].

The merchant [[Christopher de Haro]] helped Faleiro and Magellan present their proposal before the Spanish royal counselors.

Faleiro planned to accompany Magellan on his voyage around the world. However, it is said that on the evening prior to embarkation, Faleiro worked out his own [[horoscope]] for the voyage. The stars predicted a violent death. Consequently, he remained behind. Other sources claim he went [[lunatic|mad]] before the voyage, and thus did not join the expedition.

Fixed line numbers are seven digits long in a [[closed telephone numbering plan]], with the geographical area being indicated by the first two or three digits. There are no [[area code]]s in [[Botswana]].

==Calling formats==
* '''xx xxxxx''' or '''xxx xxxxx''' – calling within Botswana
* '''+267 xx xxxxx''' or '''+267 xxx xxxxx''' – calling from outside Botswana
The NSN length is seven digits for fixed lines, and eight digits for VoIP and mobile ranges.

Until the 1990s, calls to [[Botswana]] could be made from [[South Africa]] using the regional code '''0192'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j75IAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=swaziland+%220194%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%220194%22 ''Pretoria Telephone Directory''], Department of Posts and Telecommunications, 1991, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lions''' are a pair of pointed peaks (West Lion – {{convert|1646|m|ft|0|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name="cme1"&gt;{{cite bivouac|id=572|title=West Lion}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Lion – {{convert|1606|m|ft|0|abbr=on}})&lt;ref name="cme2"&gt;{{cite bivouac|id=575|title=East Lion}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the [[North Shore Mountains]] in [[Metro Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. They can be seen from much of the Greater [[Vancouver]] area, as far as [[Robert Burnaby Park]] in East [[Burnaby]], south to parts of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], and from the west on the [[Howe Sound]] Islands and the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]. Along with the [[Lions Gate Bridge]] named in their honour, these twin summits have become one of the most recognizable Vancouver landmarks. The city's [[BC Lions]] [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] football team is also named in their honour. [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] which was founded in Vancouver in July, 1997 is also named for the peaks.

The Lions are composed of [[hornblende]] [[diorite]], the oldest [[plutonic]] rock on the West Coast of Canada.

==Hiking and rock climbing routes==
Hikers can climb up to the ridge between the East and West Lion peaks using either the Binkert Trail leading up from [[Lions Bay]], or the [[Howe Sound Crest Trail]]. The Binkert Trail, named after Paul Binkert of the [[British Columbia Mountaineering Club]], is one of the most popular in the Lower Mainland. Hiking to the ridge from Lions Bay takes approximately four hours and gains {{convert|1280|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. Most hikers stop there as both the East and West Lion peaks require rock climbing equipment and expertise. The East Lion is out-of-bounds for climbing as it is located in the [[Metro Vancouver watersheds|Greater Vancouver watershed]].

==Early ascents==
According, to an article by Steven Threndyle in ''The Greater Vancouver Book'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Greater Vancouver Book'', an urban encyclopedia, Chuck Davis – Editor in Chief. Linkman Press. 1997. {{ISBN|978-1-896846-00-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the earliest recorded climb of the West Lion in 1889 happened almost by accident. A group of hunters following a herd of goats found themselves at the top with no place to go but down. The hunting party was guided by Squamish First Nations Chief [[Joe Capilano]]. One of the members of the hunting team was Doctor Henry Bell-Irving, who asked Chief Capilano if he could time one of the chief's young natives to see how long it would take him to run from the base of the West Lion to the summit. The youth stripped completely naked, made the round trip ascent and descent in under 20 minutes.

With its steep granitic face, the East Lion was believed to be impossible to scale. That did not deter John Latta and his two brothers from setting out to climb the East Lion in 1903. Hearing that climbers often used ropes for mountaineering ascents, they packed one along but actually had no idea of how to use it. Their technique was to grasp the small shrubs and bushes growing out of the cracks in the rock. The Latta brothers also climbed the West Lion on their way out.

=="The Sisters"==
The Indigenous [[Squamish people]] named these two prominent peaks "Ch'ich'iyúy Elxwíkn" (translates as 'Twin Sisters'). These mountains remain sacred for their legal marker of a peace treaty, family lineage histories, and spiritual value.  The two peaks were transformed by the Sky Brothers, or ''Transformers'', after twin sisters that had married with Haida twins created the path for the war to end between the Squamish and [[Haida people]].  The families that made the Peace Treaty and married together still live in the Squamish and Haida Nations. Sometime around 1890, Judge John Hamilton Gray proposed that Canada rename the mountain peaks to lions ''[[Couchant#Couchant|couchant]]'' from heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia Place Names.  G.P.V. and Helen B. Akrigg.  Vancouver: UBC Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nautical chart tidal diamond.PNG|thumb|right|A tidal diamond table]]
'''Tidal diamonds''' are symbols on British [[admiralty chart]]s that indicate the direction and speed of [[tide|tidal streams]].

The symbols consist of a letter of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] in a [[rhombus]], printed in purple ink. On any particular chart each tidal diamond will have a unique letter starting from "A" and continuing alphabetically.

Somewhere on the chart, generally on land, will be a ''Tidal Diamond table''. This contains a grid of thirteen rows and three columns for each Diamond. The rows are the hours of the tidal cycle showing the 6 hours before [[high water]], high water itself and the 6 hours after high water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easytide.ukho.gov.uk/EASYTIDE/EasyTide/Support/faq.aspx EasyTide - on-line tidal predictions from the UKHO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The columns show the [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of the tidal stream and its speed, in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s, at both [[spring tide]] and [[neap tide]]. The times on the table are related to the high water of the [[standard port]] displayed on the table.

An alternative to a '''tidal diamond''' is a [[tidal atlas]] which are often more accurate and easier to use (if available).

{{unreferenced|date=March 2008}}

The '''Ural Ocean''' (also called the '''Uralic Ocean''') was a small, ancient ocean that was situated between [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[Baltica]]. The ocean formed in the [[Ordovician|Late Ordovician]] epoch, when large [[islands]] from Siberia collided with Baltica, which was then part of the minor supercontinent of [[Euramerica]]. The islands also caused Ural Ocean's precursor, [[Khanty Ocean]] to close. By the [[Devonian]] Period, however, Ural Ocean begins to shrink because the Siberian continent and [[Kazakhstania]] microcontinent were closing in to Baltica. In the Latest Devonian to [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] periods, Ural Ocean became a [[sound (geography)|seaway]]. Until the three collided in the [[Carboniferous]], it created the [[Ural Mountains]], completely closing the ocean, and forming the [[Pangaea]] supercontinent.

[[License plate]]s are displayed on all motorized road vehicles in [[Brunei]], as required by law. The issue of license plates is regulated and administered by the [[Brunei Land Transport Department]].  All vehicles must also display two of the same license plates numbers of the same colours at the front and rear of the vehicles.  All vehicle license plates in Brunei, other than those issued to royalty, diplomats and [[taxi cab|taxi]]s (see below), have white characters on a black background, regardless of the vehicle type.&lt;ref name=LTDrules&gt;[http://www.land-transport.gov.bn/rules/2.htm Land Transport Department Rules and Regulations] - last retrieved 13 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental design==
[[File:Brunei car plate (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Typical three-numbered [[Brunei]] license plate.]]

The most common form of Brunei licence plates, in use since the introduction of motorised vehicles in the country's British colonial era, typically begin with one or more letters followed by up to four numerical digits with no leading zeros. Thus, the configuration of a common Brunei number plate may be in the form of ''BB 1234''.&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt; Brunei number plates bears similarity to Malaysian state of [[Selangor]] and [[Kedah]] number plates which also begin with "B" and "K".  

The sequence of licenced numbers, since 1 January 1984, issued begins with ''xA 1'' to ''xY 9999''.  "x" is either "B" for cars registered with the [[Brunei-Muara]] Land Transport Department prior to 2006, or "K" for cars registered with the [[Kuala Belait]] Land Transport Department prior to 2006.  After 2006, the letter "K" is assigned to all cars irrespective of the location that the cars are registered.  The table below shows the possible combinations in use.  Special cases are also listed in the table.  Some letters are not used - these are listed in the  (letters I, O and Z are not used to avoid ambiguity with numbers or other forms of local license plates).&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt; Distinctive font, size and serial sequences for Brunei number plates did not conflict with Malaysian state of [[Selangor]] and [[Kedah]] number plates.

The format is used in virtually all classes of vehicles with engines, including, unless stated later:
* Private vehicles (cars, motorcycles, vans, trucks and other vehicles of similar design).
* Commercial and industrial vehicles (vans, trucks - light or heavy, buses, road-legal vehicles for construction and excavation and other vehicles of similar design).
* Service vehicles (police cars, ambulances, fire engines, public utility vehicles and other vehicles of similar design).

The shape and size of Brunei license plates on vehicles, with the exception of motorcycles and scooters, are restricted to either 8.5 inch by 13.5 incy or 21 inch by 6 inch.&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt;  Vehicular plates on motorcycles are usually smaller at either 4.25 inch by 6.75 inch or 8.5 inch by 3 inch.&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt;  The size of the letters and numbers on the license plate is defined to be 3.5 inch by 2.5 inch by 0.625 inch for all vehicles except for motorcycles which is defined to be 1.75 inch 2.5 inch by 0.3125 inch.&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt;

==Special cases==

===Royal Family===
Some of the vehicles of the members of the Brunei Royal Family including the [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan]] and the [[Al-Muhtadee Billah|Crown Prince]] have unique license plates.  Some of the plates have different colours (e.g. white on red), initials or fancy script.&lt;ref name="DPK picture"&gt;[http://www.supercars.net/Pics?viewPic=y&amp;source=gal&amp;uID=129612&amp;gID=976&amp;pgID=8&amp;pID=635984&amp;first=true Supercars picture] - last retrieved 10 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

XX-NN-DC where XX is a sequential number, NN&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;foreign mission number (e.g. USA&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9) and DC stands for diplomat's&amp;nbsp;car.  The plates have a white background with black letters and numbers.&lt;ref name="LTDrules"/&gt;

===Taxis and buses===

The numbers for taxis and buses are the same as those for private vehicles, but the plates have a green background instead of black background instead.  The letters and numbers on the plate is white in colour as with private vehicles.&lt;ref name="ltdbus"&gt;[http://www.land-transport.gov.bn/rules/3.htm Land Transport Department Rules and Regulations, Commercial Vehicles] - last retrieved 10 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dealerships===

Temporary license plates are given to car dealerships to enable the car to be transported to the showroom, for test drives, etc.  These plates have a white background with red letters and numbers.&lt;ref name="ltdbus"/&gt;

===Military vehicles===

Military vehicles have a white letters/numbers on black background like any private registered cars.  However, the numbering system is different from private vehicles as all military vehicles are registered with a MOD1111x number, where MOD stands for Ministry of Defence, 1111 is the number with any leading zeros being omitted and x is a letter denoting which branch of the [[Royal Brunei Armed Forces|military]] it is registered under.

'''PM2FAS''' (99.9 FM), on air name '''Virgin Radio Jakarta''', is a radio station in [[Jakarta]]. It is the first [[Virgin Radio]] in [[Indonesia]]. It was launched on May 2016.

==History==
===The 99.9 FM Frequency===
99.9 FM frequency historically used for [[Universitas Indonesia]] campus radio back to 70s era, named RTC UI. RTC UI started broadcast regularly in early 1990s. Later after Reformation era, RTC moved to 89.35 FM, sharing frequency with [[PM2FPA|Green Radio]] (now 89.2 Power FM). After regulation forcing all campus radio to use 107.7-108.0 FM canal, RTC moved to 107.9 MHz. 

===The Radio Company (PT Dengan Radio Anda Bahagia)===
In 2004, Radio Draba (Dengan Radio Anda Bahagia) owned by [[Sys NS]] (deceased 2018) used this frequency, moving from 88.3 FM. This station's history is much unknown, beside regular broadcast of [[gamelan]] music. A radio chain from Bandung, 99ers, acquired this frequency in middle of 2000s. Sys NS might partially own this station, since speculations said that 99ers ceased broadcast because of expired contract.

===After 99ers: Sys NS Radio===
99ers gave up the radio chain in 2012. Soon, this frequency was popular for [[pirate radio]] broadcasting. In 2014, Sys NS took this station back, creating self-named radio station. Sys NS Radio played some oldies from various genre beside [[dangdut]]. Sys NS Radio broadcast in low power due to various reasons, one of them was pirate stations operating in 100.0 , 99.9 , and 99.8 MHz.
Eventually, Sys NS sold this station to Virgin Group (via MPG Media) in 2015. Virgin Radio Jakarta started test broadcast in September 2015, first airing in May 2016.

===Early Virgin Radio Era===
In May 2016, Virgin Radio started with only one [[Radio personality|jockey]] named Vari (from [[PM2FAT|Oz Radio]]). And then in late June 2016, it added one more [[Radio personality|jockey]] named Stefany. Not long after that in late 2016, Virgin Radio held a DJ audition, and added one more [[Radio personality|jockey]] named Canti. Advertisement kept running in prime time hours (6am-10am), together with its sister station [[PM3FBJ|Smooth FM]] which abandoned morning program. 
In 2017, Virgin Radio introduced its morning show named Breakfast Show with Vari and Canti as host, later Jerome replaced Canti in 2018. There are also other programs; Virgin Radio Music Morning with Canti, Virgin Radio Rush Hour with David, Virgin Radio Hot Hits with Stefany, and New Song Sunday, which used to be with Stefany, and in early 2018 is replaced with Aleef.

==Hits==
The hits are compiled based on both local taste and Top 100 Charts. The la{{coord missing|Indonesia}}test new releases should always be heard in this radio.

== Presenters ==
* Vari and Jerome: Weekdays 06:00 - 10:00
* Canti: Weekdays 10:00 - 15:00

The '''Western Australian Planning Commission''' ('''WAPC''') is a statutory authority of the [[Government of Western Australia]] that exists to coordinate planning for future land use and transport needs. It describes itself as [[Western Australia]]'s "peak representative body of [[land-use planning]] and development".{{cn|date=June 2014}} Its main role is to coordinate the various government agencies and other stakeholders in large infrastructure projects, to ensure that consideration is given to all interests and needs, including environmental, economic and community interests. It operates within the purview of the [[Department of Planning]], which is responsible to the [[Minister for Planning (Western Australia)|Minister for Planning]].

==History==
The commission was originally called the '''Metropolitan Regional Planning Authority''' (MRPA) when it was established with [[David Carr (Austrlian)|David Carr]] as the chief planner.  Shortly after that time, in 1965 [[Paul Ritter]] became the first city planner for Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2328/653/1/49.pdf | title = Light and Shade | author = David Hutchison |magazine= Australian Book Review |date=March 2004 |page=49 | issn = 0155-2864 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignace Xavier Morand Hommaire de Hell''', often known as '''Xavier Hommaire de Hell''', (24 November 1812 in [[Altkirch]] – 29 August 1848 in [[Isfahan]]) was a French geographer, engineer and traveller who carried out research in [[Turkey]], southern Russia and [[Iran|Persia]].

==Biography==

After attending school in Altkirch and [[Dijon]], Hommaire graduated as an engineer at the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Étienne|École des Mines]] in [[Saint-Étienne]] in 1833. There he met Adèle Hériot whom he married in 1834. In October 1835, he went Turkey where he coordinated the construction of a [[suspension bridge]] in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and a lighthouse on the [[Black Sea]] coast. In 1838, he arrived in southern Russia where he performed [[ethnography|ethnographical]] research and geographical surveys. After he discovered coal resources along the [[Dnieper River]], [[Nicholas I of Russia|Czar Nicholas I]] awarded him the [[Order of St. Vladimir|St Vladimir Cross]]. In 1842, while working on mining and road-building projects in [[Moldavia]], he fell ill and returned to France. The following year he became a member of the ''[[Société de Géographie]]'' and the ''[[Société géologique de France|Société géologique]]'' and published a number of scientific papers. In 1844 the Société de Géographie awarded him their [[Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie|Gold Medal]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/grande-medaille-dor-des-explorations-et-voyages-de-decouverte/| title=GRANDE MÉDAILLE D’OR DES EXPLORATIONS ET VOYAGES DE DÉCOUVERTE (in French)|publisher=Société de géographie|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his wife, he embarked on ''Les steppes de la mer Caspienne'' (1844–1847) and in 1845 was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hommaire-de-hell Jacqueline Calmard-Compas, "Hommaire de Hell, Ignace Xavier Morand"], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''. Retrieved 29 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a grant of 3,000 francs per year from the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, he left with his wife and the painter [[Jules Laurens]] on an extended journey to the Orient. In Turkey, he wrote reports on trade in the [[Bosporous]] and the Black Sea before proceeding to Persia. As he expected the journey to be difficult, he sent his wife back to France, travelling only with Laurens. In June 1847, they sailed to [[Trabzon]], entering Persia through [[Diyarbakir]] and [[Lake Van]] that November. In February 1848, he finally arrived in [[Tehran]] after suffering from cholera and [[ophthalmia]] on the way. With the help of the French ambassador, he met [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] who entrusted him with studying the feasibility of a canal bringing water from the [[Shahrood (River)|River Shahrood]] to the [[Savojbolagh County|Savojbolagh plain]].  Hommaire left for [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]] in May 1848 where he carried out surveys including a study of the [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin|Mosque of Varamin]]. He returned to Tehran to complete his research notes and then travelled to [[Isfahan]]. He arrived there seriously ill and died two weeks later on 29 August 1848. Laurens sent his notes back to his wife in Paris who completed a full account of his travels (1856–1860) subsidized by the French authorities.&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt;
