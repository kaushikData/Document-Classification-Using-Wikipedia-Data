'''''Akira''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: アキラ [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]: ''Akira'') is a 1988 [[Anime|Japanese animated]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[cyberpunk]] film directed by [[Katsuhiro Otomo]], produced by Ryōhei Suzuki and Shunzō Katō, and written by Otomo and [[Izo Hashimoto]], based on Otomo's [[Akira (manga)|manga of the same name]]. The film had a production budget of {{JPY|1.1 billion|link=yes}}&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt; ({{US$|{{#expr:1100/128 round 0}} million|long=no}}),&lt;ref name="currency"/&gt; making it the most expensive [[anime]] film of its time.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt;

Set in a [[dystopia]]n 2019, ''Akira'' tells the story of Shōtarō Kaneda, a leader of a local [[bōsōzoku|biker]] gang whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amidst chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and removes much of the last half of the manga.

''Akira'' premiered in Japan on 16 July 1988 by [[Toho]], and was released the following year in the United States by pioneering animation distributor [[Streamline Pictures]]. It garnered an international [[cult following]] following its theatrical release, and eventually grossed over $80{{nbsp}}million worldwide through its theatrical and [[VHS]] releases.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt; It is widely considered by many critics to be [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest animated and science fiction films of all time]], as well as a landmark in Japanese animation.&lt;ref name="Akira"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviecricket.com/top-10-anime-movies-time-34075/|title=Akira as #1 anime movie.|publisher=Movie Cricket|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akira 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenjunkies.com/movies/movie-lists/10-best-anime-movies-of-all-time/|title=Ten best anime movies of all time.|publisher=Screen Junkies|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Phelim|title=Akira: No 22 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/akira-otomo-fantasy-sci-fi|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 August 2012|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Film4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Akira|url=http://www.film4.com/galleries/top-50-science-fiction-films/sci-fi-akira|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231120014/http://www.film4.com/galleries/top-50-science-fiction-films/sci-fi-akira|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 December 2011|work=Top 50 Science Fiction Films|publisher=[[Film4]]|accessdate=4 August 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barone|first=Matt|title=27.

In July 1988, a blinding white singularity destroys [[Tokyo]], resulting in [[World War III]]. By the 21st century, however, peace has been achieved.

By 2019, Tokyo, now called “Neo-Tokyo,” has been rebuilt, but is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests and terrorism, and gang violence. One night, during a large protest, the hot-headed Shōtarō Kaneda leads his vigilante [[bōsōzoku]] gang, the Capsules, against their rivals, the Clowns. During this mission, Kaneda's best friend, Tetsuo Shima, inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, a psychic [[Psionics|esper]] who recently escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes the injured Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, he meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her along with his gang, taking an interest in her. 

Shikishima and his head of research, Doctor Ōnishi discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Meanwhile, Takashi's fellow esper, Kiyoko, forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. Neo-Tokyo's parliament, however, dismisses Shikishima's concerns, so he considers killing Tetsuo in order to prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to run away from Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend Kaori, but the Clowns ambush them, prompting the Capsules to intervene. While the Capsules are apprehending them, Tetsuo suffers [[headache]]s and hallucinations, and is taken back to the hospital. Searching for answers about Tetsuo, Kaneda finds Kei and joins her resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers. At the hospital, the espers unsuccessfully attempt to confront and control Tetsuo as he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers, which make him egomaniacal and unstable, and escapes again. Meanwhile, Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and find themselves drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and leaves the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, located in [[Cryonics|cryonic]] storage beneath the Olympic Stadium's construction site.

Using Kei as a [[Mediumship|medium]], Kiyoko and Kaneda escape military custody in the hope of stopping Tetsuo, while Shikishima stages a [[coup d'état]] against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Returning to the Capsules' former hangout to obtain drugs to control his powers, Tetsuo murders his old gang member, Yamagata; upon discovering his death, Kaneda vows to avenge him by searching for Tetsuo. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, eventually arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] in the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains which were dissected, and preserved for future studies. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel; meanwhile, Shikishima fires an [[orbital weapon]] at him but is unsuccessful. 

Shikishima and Kaori approach the stadium where Tetsuo is hiding out at in great pain and losing control over his powers. Shikishima offers Tetsuo to return to the hospital and help with his injuries and pain, and to help him control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo once again. Losing control of his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass continues to grow, the espers decide to awaken Akira as the only way to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension. 

In the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers. The singularity suddenly disappears and water floods the city's remains. In the aftermath, Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally in control of his powers, Tetsuo triggers a [[big bang]] to create a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] as [[God]].

== Production ==
While working on the ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' comic, [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] did not intend to adapt the series outside of the manga; however, he became "very intrigued" when the offer to develop his work for the screen was put before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=''Akira Production Report''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Madman Entertainment]]|date=13 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to an anime film adaptation of the series on the grounds that he retained creative control of the project — this insistence was based on his experiences working on ''[[Genma Taisen#Harmagedon|Harmagedon]]''.&lt;ref name="CBM" /&gt; The Akira Committee was the name given to a partnership of several major Japanese entertainment companies brought together to realize production of an ''Akira'' film. The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around ¥1,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[Laserdisc]] Corporation and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film. The animation for the film was provided for by animation producers, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now [[TMS Entertainment]]).&lt;ref name="AK3" /&gt;

At the time, most anime were notorious for cutting production corners with [[limited animation]], such as having only the characters' mouths move with basic lip sync while their faces remained static. ''Akira'' broke from this trend with detailed scenes, [[Lip-synching#Animation|pre-scored]] dialogue (wherein the dialogue is recorded before the film starts production and the movements of the characters' lips are animated to match it;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFmrVHB44w Interview with Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo (3/4)]&lt;/ref&gt; a first for an anime production, although the voice actors did perform with the aid of [[animatics]]),&lt;ref name="CBM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Comic Book Movies|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0767-6|date=2003|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation [[cel]]s.&lt;ref name="AK3"&gt;Production insights, Akira #3 ([[Epic Comics]], 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-generated imagery]] was also used in the film (created by High-Tech Lab. Japan Inc. and the cooperative companies for computer graphics, Sumisho Electronic Systems, Inc. and [[Wavefront Technologies]]), primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor Ōnishi, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens flares.&lt;ref name="CBM" /&gt; Unlike its live-action predecessors, ''Akira'' also had the budget to show a fully realized futuristic Tokyo. The film's production budget was {{JPY|1.1 billion|link=yes}}&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt; ({{US$|{{#expr:1100/128 round 0}} million|long=no}}),&lt;ref name="currency"/&gt; making it the most expensive anime film of its time.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |title=The Animated Movie Guide |date=2005 |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |isbn=9781569762226 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTI1yeZd-tkC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaser trailer for ''Akira'' was released in 1987. The film's main production was completed in 1987, with sound recording and mixing performed in early 1988. It was released in 1988, two years before the manga officially ended in 1990. Otomo is claimed to have filled 2,000 pages of notebooks, containing various ideas and character designs for the film, but the final storyboard consisted of a trimmed-down 738 pages.&lt;ref name="CBM" /&gt; He had great difficulty completing the manga; Otomo has stated that the inspiration for its conclusion arose from a conversation that he had with [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961|title=Akira Program Notes|publisher=Austin Film Society|accessdate=22 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092919/http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961|archive-date=22 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later recalled that the film project had to begin with the writing of an ending that would bring suitable closure to major characters, storylines, and themes without being extraordinarily lengthy, so that he could know in reverse order which manga elements would make the cut into the anime and thus suitably resolve the manga's various elements into a lean, two-hour story.&lt;ref name="DVD int"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=''Director Interview''|medium=DVD|publisher=[[FUNimation Entertainment]]|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otomo is a big fan of ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''. As a result, his naming conventions match the characters featured in ''Tetsujin 28-go'': Kaneda shares his name with the protagonist of ''Tetsujin 28-go''; Colonel Shikishima shares his name with Professor Shikishima of ''Tetsujin 28-go'', while Tetsuo is named after Shikishima's son Tetsuo Shikishima; ''Akira''{{'}}s Ryūsaku is named after Ryūsaku Murasame. In addition, Takashi has a "26" [[tattoo]]ed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in ''Tetsujin 28-go''. The namesake of the series, ''Akira'', is the 28th in a line of psychics that the government has developed, the same number as ''Tetsujin-28''.&lt;ref name="DVD int" /&gt;

== Releases ==

=== Theatrical ===
''Akira'' was released by [[Toho]] on 16 July 1988. Fledgling North American distribution company [[Streamline Pictures]] soon acquired an existing English-language rendition created by Electric Media Inc.&lt;ref name = Streamline /&gt;  for [[Kodansha]],&lt;ref&gt;Interviews with Streamline Pictures' co-founders [[Carl Macek]] and [[Jerry Beck]] in ''[[Protoculture Addicts]]'' #9 (November 1990), and company spotlight in ''Protoculture Addicts'' #18 (July 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; which saw limited release in North American theaters on 25 December 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=akira.htm|title=Akira|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streamline became the film's distributor.&lt;ref&gt;"Otomo Takes Manhattan", ''Marvel Age'' #100 ([[Marvel Comics]], May 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, ''Akira'' was theatrically released by [[Island Records|Island Visual Arts]] on 25 January 1991,&lt;ref name=Answerman&gt;{{Cite web |first=Justin |last=Sevakis |date=September 14, 2015 |title=What Ever Happened to Manga Entertainment? |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-09-14/.92910 |department=Answerman (column) |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 10, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; and was re-released on 13 July 2013 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the film and again on 21 September 2016. In Australia, ''Akira'' was theatrically released by Ronin Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=XPO5yEPSaJ%252f%2b4i5%2blYm0xQ%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=AXgI8FPacIVa6JoUTkdfB1w0BmurDzx%252frD86Ln3UaPgtYBnrB73BDNAvBfKzYRLk0PugGNmGFduXFLSRYtMX91R3fNcoD8jyYhlSkDbDSqg%253dḴ|title=Akira (35mm)|publisher=[[Australian Classification Board]]|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Streamline dub was released by [[Lionsgate]] (at the time known as C/FP Distribution), who would eventually become Manga Entertainment's owner through their media operating unit [[Starz Distribution]], in 1990. In 2001, Pioneer released a new English dub which was produced by [[Animaze]] and ZRO Limit Productions and was presented in select theaters from March through December 2001. [[GKIDS]] later announced that it would distribute the film within North America, with a theatrical release scheduled for December 2018.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Home media ===
[[VHS]] releases included the initial Streamline Video offering (May 1991), later wider distribution by [[MGM/UA Home Video]], and a subtitled edition from [[Orion Pictures|Orion Home Video]] (September 1993). In the UK, ''Akira'' was released on video by Island World Communications in 1991. The film went on to gross over $80{{nbsp}}million worldwide from its theatrical and VHS releases.&lt;ref name="Blanc"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blanc |first1=Michelle Le |last2=Odell |first2=Colin |title=Akira |date=2014 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan International Higher Education]] |isbn=9781844578092 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzooBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this release led to the creation of [[Manga Entertainment]], who later took over the release. The original VHS release of ''Akira'' started up Manga Entertainment Australia and VHS distribution was handled by Ronin Films and [[PolyGram]] until 1994 when [[Siren Visual|Siren Entertainment]] took over all of Manga Entertainment Australia's distribution including ''Akira'' under a special license from PolyGram, who handled Island's video distribution. ''Akira'' was re-released on video in 1994, and again on DVD in 2001 and distributed by Madman Entertainment and The AV Channel. [[Geneon|Pioneer Entertainment]] issued a DVD and a VHS with a new English dub (the dub produced by Animaze) in 2001. This was one of the few releases from Geneon to feature [[THX]]-certified audio and video. In 2002, Manga released a two-disc DVD featuring the new Pioneer/Animaze English dub followed in 2004 by another two-disc set containing the original Japanese as well as both the Streamline and Pioneer/Animaze dubs. This version did not contain standard English subtitles, only [[closed captioning]] subtitles. In 2005, Manga Entertainment and Boulevard UMD released ''Akira'' on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] for the [[Sony PSP]] in the United Kingdom using the original Streamline dub.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1992, video-distribution company [[the Criterion Collection]], which specializes in licensing "important classic and contemporary films", released a [[LaserDisc]] edition of ''Akira''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author=  |user= Criterion|number= 128940222170931200 |date= 25 October 2011 |title= In 1992 we released Katsuhiro Otomo's landmark AKIRA on laserdisc: http://ow.ly/i/jTnf |access-date= 16 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Criterion|url=https://www.criterion.com/about_us|website=The Criterion Collection|publisher=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release is notable in that ''Akira'' is the first animated film to be released by Criterion and for more than twenty years their sole animated film to be released until their 2014 [[Blu-ray]]/DVD release of ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Criterion's First Animated Feature Release in 20 Years: A Sign of Things to Come?|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/dvd/criterions-first-animated-feature-release-in-20-years-a-sign-of-things-to-come-93377.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[Cartoon Brew]]|publisher=Cartoon Brew, LLC|date=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as Japanese with English subtitles, the Blu-ray also features the 2001 Pioneer/Animaze English dub ([[Dolby TrueHD]] 48&amp;nbsp;kHz). The DVD version of ''Akira'' has been re-released in 2012 by Bandai Entertainment. The film was licensed again by [[Funimation]] following Bandai Entertainment's closure shortly after its DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funi Adds Seikishi, Yamato: R, One Piece: Strong World, Fairy Tail Film, Akira|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-28/funi-adds-seikishi-yamato/r-one-piece/strong-world-fairy-tail-film-akira|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=28 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330093631/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-28/funi-adds-seikishi-yamato/r-one-piece/strong-world-fairy-tail-film-akira|archivedate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Funimation release includes both the Streamline and Pioneer dubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akira 25th Anniversary Edition Includes Streamline, Pioneer Dubs|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-05/akira-25th-anniversary-edition-includes-streamline-pioneer-dubs|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=6 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329073955/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-05/akira-25th-anniversary-edition-includes-streamline-pioneer-dubs|archivedate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation released the 25th anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo and separate DVD release on 12 November 2013, which contain both English dubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akira DVD/Blu-ray 25th Anniversary Edition (Hyb)|url=http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/bhlxBJs6OiFRz6L21v/browse/item/99275/4/0/0|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=4 September 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130904181155/http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/bhlxBJs6OiFRz6L21v/browse/item/99275/4/0/0|archive-date=4 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best Buy released a limited edition exclusive Blu-ray Steelbook the same year.

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Akira'' is distractingly bloody and violent, but its phenomenal animation and sheer kinetic energy helped set the standard for modern anime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/akira/ |title=''Akira'' (1998) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''AKIRA: Original Soundtrack'' (''Symphonic Suite AKIRA'') was recorded by [[Geinō Yamashirogumi]] (芸能山城組). The music was composed and conducted by musical director Shōji Yamashiro (pseudonym of [[Tsutomu Ōhashi]]). It features music which was additionally re-recorded for release. "Kaneda", "Battle Against Clown" and "Exodus From the Underground Fortress" are really part of the same song cycle — elements of "Battle Against Clown" can be heard during the opening bike sequence, for example. The score is generally sequenced in the same order that the music occurs in the film. The North American version featured extensive production notes by David Keith Riddick and Robert Napton.

''AKIRA: The Original Japanese Soundtrack''; an alternate soundtrack was also released. This version included music as it appeared in the film with dialogue and sound-effects albeit ordered out of sequence.

The soundtrack spawned an album of [[electronica]] remixes from Bwana, called ''Capsules Pride''.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;

== Live-action adaptation ==
In 2002, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired the rights to create a [[live-action]] [[remake]] of ''Akira'' as a seven-figure deal.&lt;ref name="ign2002"&gt;Linder, Brian et al. (12 April 2002).  [http://movies.ign.com/articles/357/357213p1.html "Akira Hollywood Remake!?"] ''IGN.com''.

''[[IGN]]'' concluded that long-term troubles with producing the live-action film come from two areas. First, there has been the fear of [[whitewashing in film|whitewashing]] or [[racebending]], casting American or other Western actors in lieu of Japanese ones, which has come to light when various actors have been named for roles. Secondly, ''Akira'' itself is not a story that is easy to relocate outside of Japan, due to the influence on the original story of Japan's role in [[World War II]], including the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings of Japan]], and their own [[Unit 731]].&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

Shortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights, [[Stephen Norrington]] was slated to direct with [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] writing the screenplay and [[Dan Lin]] producing.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/04/12/akira-hollywood-remake]&lt;/ref&gt; Norrington had planned to make the remake more appealing to Western audiences, making Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. Following the commercial failure of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' in 2003, which both Norrington and Robinson were also on, the project was put on hold.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

Director [[Ruairi Robinson]] announced in 2008 he was teaming with Whitta to adopt the manga for live-action, breaking the narrative out over two films with the first to have been completed and released by 2009. Producer [[Andrew Lazar]] said that the first film would cover volumes 1 through 3 of the manga, with the rest covered in the second film.&lt;ref name="collider2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/06/17/producer-andrew-lazar-interview-jonah-hex-akira-get-smart-2-joe-namath-one-finger-salute|title=Exclusive: Producer Andrew Lazar Video Interview JONAH HEX; Plus Updates on AKIRA, ONE FINGER SALUTE, GET SMART 2, More|author=Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub|publisher=Collider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitta, in a 2015 interview, said that the story would have taken place in a Japan-owned Manhattan, renaming the region as New Tokyo. This would allow them to have used a mix of Western and Asian actors as to avoid concerns that they would be [[whitewashing in film|whitewashing]] the project.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collider.com/akira-movie-news-gary-whitta/ |title=Screenwriter Gary Whitta Says His AKIRA Script Took Place in a Japanese-owned Manhattan |publisher=Collider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruairi Robinson left the project in 2009 and was replaced by directors [[Hughes brothers|Allen and Albert Hughes]], though later Albert Hughes went solo with the project by 2011. They used Whitta's script with modifications by [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]] with an aim for a [[PG-13]] rating.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt; Around 2011, a version of the ''Akira'' script leaked online; though it was unclear if this was Whitta's or Fergus/Ostby's version, the scripts deviated significantly from the source material in what was considered a negative way according to ''[[IGN]]'', such as making Akira a "psychotic murderous creepy child", inclusion of heavy-handed references to the [[September 11 attacks]], and characters written in a misogynistic fashion.&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt; Around this same time, casting calls for the film led to accusations of whitewashing. Shortly after these events, Albert Hugest left the project citing "amicable creative differences".&lt;ref name="ign la 2017"/&gt;

Since the project began, several writers, directors (including [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] and [[Christopher Nolan]]), producers, actors and actresses have been attached to the project.&lt;ref name="ign2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-02-20/warner-leonardo-dicaprio-to-produce-akira-live-action|title=Warner, Leonardo DiCaprio to Produce Live-Action Akira|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331162032/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-02-20/warner-leonardo-dicaprio-to-produce-akira-live-action|archivedate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/exclusive-akira-movie-update/7120/|title=Exclusive AKIRA Movie Update|author=Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub|publisher=Collider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comingsoon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=61594|title=Gary Whitta Provides Akira Update|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112164331/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=61594|archivedate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashfilm2010"&gt;[http://www.slashfilm.com/rumor-zac-efron-albert-hughes-akira/ Slashfilm.com] "Rumor: Zac Efron in Albert Hughes' ''Akira''?" by Peter Sciretta, Retrieved 5 March 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20130202112117/http://www.slashfilm.com/rumor-zac-efron-albert-hughes-akira/ |date=2 February 2013 |title=Akira }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47357|title=Another Akira Casting Rumor Emerges From the Frozen Locker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214204/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47357|archivedate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashfilm"&gt;[http://www.slashfilm.com/james-franco-akira/ Slashfilm.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130202111219/http://www.slashfilm.com/james-franco-akira/ |date=2 February 2013 }} ''Is James Franco Going to Play Kaneda in ‘Akira’?''

[[George Takei]] spoke with ''The Advocate'' in April 2011 about the casting rumors at that time, stating that any decision to [[Racebending|cast white actors]] in ''Akira'' would offend both Asians and the fans of the original manga or animated film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/News_Features/Takei_to_WB_Do_The_Right_Thing|title=Takei to WB: Do the Right Thing|author=Ross von Metzke|publisher=The Advocate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423070556/http://www.advocate.com/News/News_Features/Takei_to_WB_Do_The_Right_Thing/|archivedate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2015, the planned director [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] told [[Collider (website)|Collider]] in an interview that there was no progress on the film and planned to take a break from directing.

==Plot==
Mike Howell is a [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, West Virginia, where he works as a convenience store clerk. He is planning to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to Hawaii. However, due to a fear of travel, he suffers intense panic attacks and is unable to board the plane. It is revealed he has had similar issues trying to leave town in the past and does not understand why Phoebe is so nice about it.

In Langley, Virginia, CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her “Wiseman” [[Project MKUltra|Ultra program]], is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar “Toughguy” agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and "activates" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration.

Mike finds two Toughguys planting a bomb in his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he quickly kills them. Horrified, he calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealing friend Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realises he has very little memory prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before.

Yates places the city under quarantine, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter contacts her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon. Yates finds out and threatens Petey with charges of treason, causing Peter to deny her further help. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Wuinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's handler, leaving him heartbroken.

Laugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his memories erased. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she legitimately fell in love. Lasseter also explains that his phobias, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe.

Yates’ army liaison, Otis, joins a  Toughguy to attack Mike’s house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey launches the drone but eventually refuses to fire its missile, then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger.

Mike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares when Mike learns he is a mentally unbalanced man forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her.

Phoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, before whom he proposes to her.

In a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of seven innocent sheriffs, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, missing the “successful” codicil, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger. Krueger admits he informed Lasseter of Yates’ plan, and she points out that, by taking out 17 Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of her Wiseman program.

Six months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in Manila, confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''American Ultra'' grossed $14,439,985 in North America and $15,855,091 in other territories for a worldwide total of $30,295,076, against a budget of $28 million.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt; In its opening weekend, the film grossed $5.5 million, finishing sixth at the box office and third among the week's new releases, behind ''[[Sinister 2]]'' ($10.5 million) and ''[[Hitman: Agent 47]]'' ($8.3 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2015&amp;wknd=34&amp;p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 21-23, 2015 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=August 24, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis criticized the film's poor box office performance on his Twitter, stating, 

{{quote|"So here's an interesting question: American Ultra finished dead last at the box office, behind even Mission Impossible and Man From Uncle. American Ultra was also beaten by the critically reviled Hitman Agent 47 and Sinister, despite being a better reviewed film than either, which leads me to a bit of a conundrum: Why? American Ultra had good ads, big stars, a fun idea, and honestly, it's a good movie. Certainly better, in the internet's opinion, than other things released the same day. If you saw it, you probably didn't hate it. so I'm left with an odd thing here, which is that American Ultra lost to a sequel, a sequel reboot, a biopic, a sequel and a reboot. It seems the reviews didn't even matter, the MOVIE didn't matter. The argument that can/will be made is: big level original ideas don't $ [sic]. Am I wrong? Is trying to make original movies in a big way just not a valid career path anymore for anyone but Tarantino and Nolan? That's the question: Am I wrong? Are original ideas over? I wanted to pose this to the public, because I feel, put lightly, confused." - Max Landis on the film's box office performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/08/max-landis-wonders-if-the-flop-of-american-ultra-means-that-original-movies-are-dead-260572/|title=Max Landis Wonders If The Flop Of ‘American Ultra’ Means That Original Movies Are Dead|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|work=IndieWire|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''American Ultra'' received mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 43%, based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''American Ultra'' has some interesting ideas, but like its stoned protagonist, it's too easily distracted to live up to its true potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_ultra/|title=American Ultra |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 50 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/american-ultra|title=American Ultra reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] announced that audiences gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-sinister-2-american-ultra-agent-47-box-office-opening-1201503182/ |title=‘Compton’ To Cross $100M Today As August Marketplace Chills Out – Late Night B.O. Update |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Kermode]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, stating "Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart brave an anarchic mish-mash with lots of violence but few laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/american-ultra-review-kristen-stewart | title=American Ultra review – stoner turns state killer to little comic effect | work=[[Mark Kermode]] | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 6, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Dishman of the ''[[McAlester News-Capital]]'' writes "''American Ultra'' promoted itself under the slogan, "There is nothing more dangerous than a stoned cold killer," and while they may be right, there's also nothing spectacular about that stoned cold killer's movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcalesternews.com/news/movie-review-american-ultra-is-ultra-average/article_b54fdf8a-4d93-11e5-8c96-638cc4eea57e.html | title=Movie review: American Ultra is ultra-average | work=David Dishman | publisher=[[McAlester News-Capital]] | date=August 28, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film two of four stars: "Soon the movie's twisty charm gives way to gory splatter. Eisenberg and Stewart stay appealing to the last. The movie, not so much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/american-ultra-20150819 | title='American Ultra' Movie Review | work=[[Peter Travers]] | publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=August 19, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Genzlinger]] from ''[[New York Times|The New York Times]]'' gave the film a mixed review, ending with "A lot of it seems familiar, and Mr. Eisenberg and Ms. Stewart aren’t stretched much. But Mike finds amusing ways to defend himself using ordinary household items, Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo enliven things in goofy small roles, the plot has a nice twist or two, and your theater is probably air-conditioned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/movies/review-in-american-ultra-jesse-eisenberg-is-a-stoner-and-a-target.html?referrer=google_kp&amp;_r=0 | title=Review: In ‘American Ultra,’ Jesse Eisenberg Is a Stoner and a Target | work=[[Neil Genzlinger]] | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=August 20, 2015 | accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landis discussed the negative critical and box office performance of the movie and its misleading marketing campaign in an interview with [[RedLetterMedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR-Dry8Qb4A | title=RedLetterMedia, 'A conversation with Max Landis' | date=November 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7239">'''Art methodology''' refers to a ''studied'' and constantly reassessed, questioned method within [[the arts]], as opposed to a method merely applied (without thought). This process of studying the method and reassessing its effectiveness allows [[art]] to move on and change. It is not the thing itself but it is an essential part of the process. 

An [[artist]] drawing, for instance, may choose to draw from what he or she [[observation|observes]] in front of them, or from what they ''imagine'' or from what they already know about the subject. These 3 methods will, very probably, produce 3 very different pictures. A careful [[methodology]] would include examination of the [[Art materials|materials]] and [[tool]]s used and how a different type of canvas/brush/paper/pencil/rag/camera/chisel etc. would produce a different effect. The artist may also look at various effects achieved by starting in one part of a canvas first, or by working over the whole surface equally. An author may experiment with [[stream of consciousness writing]], as opposed to [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] [[narrative]], or a combination of styles.

==Fine Art compared with Traditional Crafts==
In stark contrast to [[fine art]] practice is the [[tradition]]al [[craft]] form. With traditional crafts, the method is handed down from generation to generation with often very little change in techniques. It is usually fair to say that folk crafts employ a method but not an art methodology, since that would involve rigorous questioning and criticising of the tradition.

==Art Methodology compared with Science Methodology==
An art methodology differs from a [[scientific method|science]] [[methodology]], perhaps mainly insofar as the artist is not always after the same goal as the scientist. In art it is not necessarily all about establishing the exact truth so much as making the most effective form ([[painting]], [[drawing]], [[poem]], [[novel]], [[performance]], [[sculpture]], [[video]], etc.) through which ideas, feelings, perceptions can be communicated to a public. With this purpose in mind, some artists will exhibit preliminary sketches and notes which were part of the process leading to the creation of a work. Sometimes, in [[Conceptual art]], the preliminary process is the only part of the work which ''is'' exhibited, with no visible end result displayed. In such a case the  ''"[[Travel|journey]]"'' is being presented as more important than the destination. Conceptual artist [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]] once put on an exhibition where the door of the gallery remained shut and a sign on the door informed visitors that the gallery would be closed for the exhibition. These kind of works question accepted concepts, such as that of having a tangible [[work of art]] as end result.

==Some Art Methodology statements==
===Global Responsibility===
The [[Peace Through Art]] methodology developed by the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaf.org |title=International Child Art Foundation |accessdate=2008-08-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080811024014/http://www.icaf.org/| archivedate= 11 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized as a Stockholm Challenge Finalist for best practice and innovative initiative, in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. ICAF's statement on the methodology of the programme says: "the Peace Through Art methodology draws upon the creativity and imagination of young people, and teaches them the ethics of responsibility in this interdependent global village that has come to be our world. The methodology incorporates best practices from the fields of psychology, conflict resolution and peace education, while employing the power of the arts for self-expression, healing and communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ICAF's Peace Through Art methodology is Stockholm Challenge Finalist |publisher=The International Child Art Foundation |date=2004-09-07 |url=http://www.icaf.org/news/newsfiles/200210000001.html |accessdate=2008-08-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907063554/http://www.icaf.org/news/newsfiles/200210000001.html| archivedate= 7 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Therapy===
In [[Art Therapy]] and other applied forms of art to the needs of groups within the community art methodology is built up in relation to other methodologies, such as that of [[psychotherapy]]. 

Pauline Mottram SRAsTh, gave a short paper entitled ''“Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness.”'' for the October 2000 TAoAT Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baat.org/taoat/mottram2.html |title=Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness |first=Pauline |last=Mottram |accessdate=2008-08-06 |publisher=British Association of Art Therapists |date=October 2000| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723212828/http://www.baat.org/taoat/mottram2.html| archivedate= 23 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here's an excerpt: 

''"In addressing the effectiveness challenge and in seeking a means of measuring outcomes of the art therapy service that I deliver, I have sought a methodology that can provide a valid and reliable quantitative outcome, whilst still respecting the aesthetic and humanistic nature of art therapy practice. This endeavour is made all the more complex by the fact that art therapy lacks a fully developed theory and it has a fragile research base. Generally it is argued that art therapy is more compatible with qualitative research designs that encompass subjectivity, rather than quantitative objective methods. Kaplan (1998, p95) states that ‘Qualitative is exploratory and theory building. Quantitative  tests hypothesis in order to refine and validate theory.’ She holds that art therapy cannot afford to reject either form of inquiry."''

===Generative Art===
In ''"The Methodology of Generative Art"''  by  Tjark Ihmels and Julia Riedel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/themes/generative-tools/generative-art/1/]&lt;/ref&gt; an online article at Media Art Net&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozart]]'s "musical game of dice" is cited as a precedent for the methodology of Generative art which, say the authors, has ''"established itself in nearly every area of artistic practice (music, literature [3], the fine arts)."'': 

''"Mozart composed 176 bars of music, from which sixteen were chosen from a list using dice, which then produced a new piece when performed on a piano. Sixteen bars, each with eleven possibilities, can result in 1,116 unique pieces of music. Using this historical example, the methodology of generative art can be appropriately described as the rigorous application of predefined principles of action for the intentional exclusion of, or substitution for, individual aesthetical decisions that sets in motion the generation of new artistic content out of material provided for that purpose."''

'''Bikini Planet''' is a [[science fiction]] comedy written by [[David S. Garnett]] and released exclusively in the United Kingdom as a paperback. It is written as a sub-sequel to an earlier story written by Garnett in 1994, entitled ''[[Stargonauts]]'', which features some of the same settings and characters from the first story.

==Backstory==
In 1968, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] weakling cop Wayne Norton stumbles on a gangster plot by crime lord Mario to freeze himself and re-emerge as the Head of a large criminal empire in the future. After knocking Wayne unconscious, Mario freezes him instead and then kills his servants.

While Wayne is frozen, Mario is caught and sentenced to 300 years imprisonment. Over the years, the world becomes heavily dependent on the [[Internet]], and all books, videos etc., are recorded electronically. On Day Zero, the entire Internet crashes and all history and knowledge is wiped out. People eventually forget what they were taught, and learn from the past through old [[John Wayne]] films. Las Vegas is overrun by [[Red Indian]]s, who leave many American cities to ruin.

==Plot==
Waking in the 24th Century, Wayne claims to be [[John Wayne]]. He's appointed a GalactiCop [[Police]] [[Sergeant]] by his new employer, Colonel Travis. Unbeknownst to Norton, Travis sends Wayne as his double to Hideaway, the entertainment planet.

On the nearby prison planet Arazon (colloquially known as "Clink"), the female prisoner Kiru (a neurotic) falls into league with a band of space pirates planning to escape. The mute bodyguard Grawl decides to protect Kiru. He even kills his friend Aqa after he and Kiru have sex. Once she escapes and gets to Hideaway, Kiru gets away from Grawl. He had planned on transplanting all of her organs to keep himself going.

Wayne arrives on Hideaway and checks in as [[Robin Hood]]. He comes across a tailors' shop run by Janesmith, a princess-in-exile from the female-dominated planet of [[Algol]]. After identifying himself as Duke Wayne this time, Janesmith immediately has sex with him, thinking he's an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Wayne is unwilling to continue, though, after discovering Janesmith has ''[[vagina dentata]]'', but she uses hypnosis to knock him out.

Wayne awakes up in his room alone, but a few seconds later Kiru comes rushing in to hide from Grawl. The two have sex and are then arrested, while still naked, by a band of amoeba aliens who have already captured the escaped space pirates. Both Wayne and Kiru escape the aliens' ship, but in different escape pods. Kiru ends up riding with Colonel Travis (under the false name of [[Eliot Ness]]) and Wayne ends up stuck with Grawl.

Both escape pods land on an unknown planet. While Kiru and Travis land safely, Grawl sacrifices himself to help Wayne escape before the pod floods in the alien sea. Wayne is rescued and learns from Travis that the planet is to be the new Las Vegas, in direct competition with Hideaway. It will be called either Cafe World or Vegas World. The inhabitants all wear bikinis for uniforms, even while construction is underway.

There are three alternate endings to the story. Two of which involve Kiru and Wayne marrying on Vegas / Cafe World, while the other involves a massacre of the characters by a resurrected Grawl.

==Links to Stargonauts==
''[[Stargonauts]]'' also featured the characters of Grawl and Janesmith, and ended on Hideaway. In the original story, Grawl worked as a bodyguard to media tycoon William Ewart, who was in his fifth marriage to Janesmith's sister, Marysmith (who is mentioned on several occasions in ''Bikini Planet''). Bikini Planet picks up from where the story left off, with Janesmith left abandoned on Hideaway whilst Grawl and Ewart became space pirates and presumably ended up on Arazon together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">[[File:Gauguin Il Cristo giallo.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'' (''Le Christ jaune'')&lt;br&gt;1889, oil on canvas&lt;br&gt;[[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]]]
'''Cloisonnism''' is a style of [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painting with bold and flat forms separated by dark contours. The term was coined by critic [[Edouard Dujardin]] on the occasion of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]], in March 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Dujardin, Édouard: ''Aux XX et aux Indépendants: le Cloisonismé'' (sic!), Revue indépendante, Paris, March 1888, pp. 487-492&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Sérusier]], and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of [[cloisonné]], where wires (''cloisons'' or "compartments") are soldered to the body of the piece, filled with powdered glass, and then [[Pottery firing|fired]]. Many of the same painters also described their works as [[Synthetism]], a closely related movement.

In ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'' (1889), often cited as a quintessential cloisonnist work, Gauguin reduced the image to areas of single colors separated by heavy black outlines. In such works he paid little attention to classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color&amp;mdash;two of the most characteristic principles of post-[[Renaissance]] painting.

The cloisonnist separation of colors reflects an appreciation for discontinuity that is characteristic of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/first-moderns/ William R. Everdell, [[The First Moderns|''The First Moderns, Profiles in the Origin of Twentieth-Century Thought'']] University of Chicago Press, 1997] retrieved March 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjectural history has been identified as "the core of a theory" of [[progress (history)|progress]] within Scottish philosophical history of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|pages=171–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocock writes that Scottish conjectural history was "of considerable importance to Gibbon and the creation of philosophical historiography".&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1780s there were European historians of culture who worked in a different way, preferring an [[inductive method]] to the pure deductions of conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&amp;pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sketches'' was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Sauer|title=Reading the Nation in English Literature: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEcG669IWIC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44524-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a "history of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Alan Barnard|author2=Jonathan Spencer|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1VpdrbH3BUC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-45803-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Trentmann|title=Paradoxes of Civil Society: New Perspectives on Modern German and British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ry0AybYtwEC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-143-1|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779).

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''content package''' is a file containing content in a database [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]]. 

A content package is used in e-learning to define some learning content or an assessment that can be delivered, for example by a [[Learning Management System]]. It's a standard way of describing learning content that can be read by many programs. 

The most widely used content packaging format is that defined by IMS Global, which uses an [[XML]] manifest file called imsmanifest.xml wrapped up inside a zip file. The learning content itself is either included in the zip file if it is HTML or other media that can run on its own, or else is referenced as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] from within the manifest.

The IMS format was used by [[SCORM]] to define their packaging format, and typically every sharable content object (SCO) is defined by a content package.

The [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]] also define a content package format for material that can be called by the widely used AICC HACP standard. Their format consists of four comma separated ASCII files that define details about the learning content including a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]].

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

{{Culture of Nigeria}}
[[File:Queen Mother Pendant Mask- Iyoba MET DP231460.jpg|200px|upright|thumb|The [[Benin ivory mask]] from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The '''culture of Nigeria''' is shaped by [[Nigeria]]'s multiple [[ethnic group]]s. The country has 527 languages, seven of them are extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |publisher=SIL International Publications| editor1=Lewis, M. Paul|editor2=Gary F. Simons|editor3=Charles D. Fennig |year=2016|edition=19th|location=Dallas, Texas|url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria also has over 1150 dialects and ethnic groups. The six largest ethnic groups are the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fulani]] in the north, the [[Igbo culture|Igbo]] in the southeast, and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] predominate in the southwest, the [[Tiv people]] of North Central Nigeria and the [[Efik language|Efik]] - [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]]. 
The [[Edo people]] are most frequent in the region between [[Yorubaland]] and [[Igboland]]. Many of the Edo tend to be Christian. This group is followed{{clarify|date=November 2016}} by the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]]/[[Annang]]/[[Efik people|Efik]] people of the coastal south southern Nigeria and the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] of the Niger Delta.

Nigeria's other ethnic groups, sometimes called 'minorities', are found throughout the country but especially in the north and the middle belt. The traditionally [[nomad]]ic Fulani can be found all over West and Central Africa. The Fulani and the Hausa are predominantly Muslim while the Igbo are predominantly Christian and so are the Efik, Ibibio, and Annang people. The Yoruba are equally likely to be either Christian or Muslim. Indigenous religious practices remain important to all of Nigeria's ethnic groups, and frequently these beliefs are blended with Christian beliefs, a practice known as [[syncretism]].
[[File:Afro_asiatic_peoples_nigeria.png|200px|thumb|upright]]

==Major Nigerian Ethnic Culture==

==Efik-Ibibio Culture==
The Efik-Ibibio culture of coastal southeastern Nigeria has a significant contribution to the Nigerian culture, especially the culture of southern part of Nigeria.  A brief summary is as follows:

* [[Efik-Ibibio]] language: This language is spoken in [[Akwa Ibom State]] and [[Cross River State]]. It has various dialects such as the [[Annang]] dialect, [[Oron language|Oron]] dialect, and many others. The [[Efik-Ibibio]] language has a significant influence on the languages and names of people of southern Nigeria.
* [[Ekpe]]: The Efik-Ibibio culture was protected by a secret society, the [[Ekpe]], that was indigenous to southeastern Nigeria. The "Ekpe", meaning "Lion", became a popular symbol in the Efik-Ibibio culture which later became popular in other Nigerian ethnic cultures.
* [[Nsibidi]]: The popular ancient indigenous writing of the Efik people was invented by the Ekpe of the Efik-Ibibio people.
* [[Food]]: Located in the coastal southeastern Nigeria by the Atlantic Ocean, the [[Efik-Ibibio]] people are blessed with various edible vegetables.  Their food is popular throughout the entire Nigeria including the popular Afañg soup, [[Edikang Ikong]] soup, pepper soup, Ukwoho, Atama,Eritañ, jollof-rice, etc., etc.

==Bini==
Eghosa the queen of Bini

==Yoruba Culture==
The Yorubas are located on the western region of Nigeria.

==Igbo Culture==
The eastern part of Nigeria is the home of the Igbos, who are mostly Christians. Their traditional religion is known as 
[[Omenani]]. Socially they are led by monarchs known as [[Eze|Eze Igwe]]s. These figures in turn are expected to confer subordinate titles upon men and woman that are highly accomplished. This is known as the [[Nze na Ozo]] title system. People of title are usually well-spoken, highly respected and well recognized in their communities.

==Hausa-Fulani Culture==

==Nigerian literature==
{{See also|Nigerian literature}}
Nigeria is famous for its [[English language]] [[Nigerian literature|literature]]. ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', by [[Chinua Achebe]], is an important book in [[African literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Booker, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; With over eight million copies sold worldwide, it has been translated into 50 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogbaa, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian Nobel laureate [[Wole Soyinka]] described the work as "the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him."&lt;ref name="Bard College-2001"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chinua Achebe of Bard College|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|date=Autumn 2001|volume=33|issue=33|page=28|doi=10.2307/2678893|jstor=2678893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the speakers of standard English, a large portion of the population, roughly a third, speaks [[Nigerian pidgin]], which has a primarily English [[lexicon]]. It has become a common ''[[lingua franca]]'' as a result. Pidgin English is a creolized form of the language. For instance, "How you dey" means "How are you". ''[[The Palm Wine Drinkard]]'', a popular novel by [[Amos Tutuola]], was written in it. 

==Nollywood==
{{See also|Nollywood}}
Since the 1990s the Nigerian [[movie industry]], sometimes called "[[Nollywood]]", has emerged as a fast-growing cultural force all over Africa. Because of the movies, western influences such as music, casual dressing and methods of speaking are to be found all across Nigeria, even in the highly conservative north of the country.

==Media==
{{main|Media in Nigeria}}

==Sports==
Supporters of English football clubs like [[Manchester United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] often segregate beyond the traditional tribal and even religious divide to share their common cause in [[Premier League]] teams. The [[Nigerian national football team]], nicknamed the "Super Eagles", is the national team of Nigeria, run by the [[Nigeria Football Federation]] (NFF). According to the FIFA World Rankings, Nigeria ranks 22nd and holds the third highest place among the African nations behind Cameroon (11th) and Côte d'Ivoire (16th). The highest position Nigeria ever reached on the ranking was 5th, in April 1994.

==Food==
{{see also|West African cuisine|Nigerian cuisine}}

[[Nigerian cuisine|Nigerian food]] offers a rich blend of traditionally African carbohydrates such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[cassava]] as well as the vegetable soups with which they are often served. Maize is another crop that is commonly grown in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
a powdered [[cassava]] grain that can be readily eaten as a meal and is quite inexpensive. Yams are frequently fried either fried in oil or pounded to make a [[mashed potato]]-like yam [[pottage]]. Nigerian beans, quite different from green peas, are widely popular. Meat is also popular and Nigerian [[suya]]—a barbecue-like roasted meat—is a well-known delicacy. [[Bush meat]], meat from wild game like [[antelope]] and [[giraffe]]s, is also popular. Fermented palm products make a traditional liquor, [[palm wine]], and also fermented cassava. Nigerian foods are spicy, mostly in the western and southern part of the country, even more so than in [[Indian cuisine]]. Some more examples of their traditional dishes are [[eba]], pounded yam, iyan, [[fufu]] and soups like [[okra]], [[ogbono soup|ogbono]] and [[egusi]]. Fufu is so emblematic of Nigeria that it figures in Chinua Achebe's ''Things Fall Apart'', for example. Achebe's magnum opus is the most widely read book in modern African literature.&lt;ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Sango_priestress.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
The [[music of Nigeria]] includes many kinds of [[traditional music|folk]] and [[popular music]], some of which are known worldwide. The singer and social activist [[Fela Kuti]] was instrumental in Nigeria's musical development. 

Traditional musicians use a number of diverse [[Music of Nigeria#Traditional instruments|instruments]], such as [[Talking drum|Gongon drum]]s. The [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] and the [[kakaki]] are also important.

Other traditional cultural expressions are found in the various [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerades]] of Nigeria, such as the [[Eyo festival|Eyo masquerades]], the [[Ekpe]] and Ekpo Masquerades of the Efik/Ibibio/Annang/Igbo peoples of coastal southeastern Nigeria, and the [[Northern Edo Masquerades]]. The most popular Yoruba manifestations of this custom are the [[Gelede]] masquerades.

A very important source of information on modern Nigerian art is the [[Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art]] operated by the [[Pan-Atlantic University]] in Lagos.

In addition, the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission, and Naija Invest Gateway, provide real time information on the Nigerian business culture.

==Clothing==

Women wear long flowing robes and headscarves made from local markets who dye and weave the fabric locally. Southern Nigerian women choose to wear [http://answersafrica.com/nigerian-people-culture.html western-style wear]. People in urban regions of Nigeria dress in western style, the youth mainly wearing jeans and T-shirts.  Other Nigerian men and women typically wear a traditional style called ''Buba''. For men the loose fitting shirt goes down to halfway down the thigh. For women, the loose fitting blouse goes down a little below the waist. Other clothing gear includes a ''gele'', which is the woman's headgear. For men their traditional cap is called ''fila''.
The dressing and colours of the garments can sometimes change according to the occasion to be attended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3541">[[File:Roerich Book.jpg|thumb|''The kings of the Earth reading the Book of the Dove'', a Symbolist painting by [[Nicholas Roerich]]]]
'''The Verse about the Book of the Dove''' (Голубиная книга, ''Golubinaya Kniga'') is a medieval [[Russian spiritual verse|Russian religious ballad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://bigenc.ru/literature/text/1971264&lt;/ref&gt; At least 20 versions are known.  They vary in length from 30 to over 900 lines. The poem is generally thought to have been written ca. 1500 in the [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod region]], though Russian nationalists postulate its great antiquity. The earliest extant manuscript is dated to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Мочульский В. Н. Историко-литературный анализ стиха о Голубиной книге. — Варшава: Типография Михаила Земкевича, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem's folk [[cosmology]] and the title have been derived by [[Vladimir Toporov]] from the ''[[Bundahishn]]''.&lt;ref&gt; В. Н. Топоров. Исследования по этимологии и семантике: Индоевропейские языки и индоевропеистика. Том 2. Выпуск 1. Языки славянской култьуры, 2006. Стр. 225—226.&lt;/ref&gt; Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century (such as [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Andrey Bely]]) were inspired by the ''Dove-Book''. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] had it banned as a heretical mixture of [[apocrypha|apocryphal Christian tales]] with pagan lore. 

The main part of the ''Dove-Book'' is a long sequence of [[riddle]]s. In a series of answers to those riddles, [[King David]] explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social classes. He also mentions a mysterious stone "clept the [[Alatyr Stone|Alatyr]]". [[Isabel Florence Hapgood]] describes the content of one version in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood Isabel F. A Survey of Russian Literature, with Selections. New York; Chautauqua; Springfield; Chicago, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Dove Book" falls from Alatyr, the "burning white stone on the Island of [[Buyan]]", the heathen paradise, which lies far towards sunrise, in the "Ocean Sea". The heathen significance of the stone is not known, but it is cleverly explained in "The Dove Book" as the stone whereon Christ stood when he preached to his disciples. This "little book" ("forty fathoms long and twenty wide") was written by St. [[John the Evangelist]], and no man can read it. The book is somewhat suggestive of the "little book" in Revelation. The prophet [[Isaiah]] deciphered only three pages of it in as many years. But the "most wise tsar David" undertakes to give, from memory, the book's answers to various questions put to him by [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Tsar Vladimir]] (as spokesman of a throng of emperors and princes). A great deal of curious information is conveyed - all very poetically expressed - including some odd facts in natural history, such as: that the [[ostrich]] is the mother of birds, and that she lives, feeds, and rears her young on the blue sea, drowning mariners and sinking ships. Whenever she (or the [[Indrik|Indrik-Beast]]) moves, an earthquake ensues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}
The '''elderly martial arts master''' is a mentor/teacher [[stock character]] in [[fiction]], especially ''[[Wuxia]]'', ''[[Chanbara]]'', and other [[martial arts films]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger.]] [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040416/REVIEWS/404160301/1023 Kill Bill, Volume 2: Reviews], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. Published April 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically an [[East Asia]]n male, he is a near-invincible master of the [[martial arts]], despite being advanced in age and presumably having a decrease in physical strength. Often he possesses the rank of Sensei (or teacher) and is referred to as such by his student. The elderly master most often teaches either generic [[kung fu]] or an exotic style specific to the fictional period (see List of fictional martial arts). During the films, the master often becomes close with their student, with the master becoming a guardian figure to the trainee, who is, in turn, looked upon as a son or daughter. Usually, when the master is captured or killed, or an iconic portrait of the deceased master has been desecrated by some villains, the hero will take it upon themselves to rescue or avenge their master.

==Personality traits and mannerisms==
A typical elderly sensei spends most of his time meditating in a [[dojo]]. The master is typically a serene, calm, sober and reserved old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uarel371.wordpress.com/2015/02/23/colonizer-colonized-and-the-karate-kid/|title=Colonizer, Colonized, and the Karate Kid|date=23 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represents the maturity and self-contentment that comes with age, along with the quiet confidence that comes with experience—both of life in general and of the skills and also the ideals and values that he has inherited from the martial arts. To him, his martial art is not just a way to beat people up or to act tough, it is—in keeping with the values and ideals generally attached to and associated with the martial arts by the [[Oriental]] societies—more a means to positively developing one's personality and way of living to cultivate values such as respect, patience, self-control, discipline and the whole lot. The master is polite towards everyone, even the mischief makers who would misbehave with him sometime in the course of the movie. He always tries to verbally prevent mischief makers or the rival martial artist (who is often young and arrogant and sees the martial arts only as a means to act tough and bully people) for as long as he can, and that too politely. Only when he is forced to use his skills and left with no option, he shows how the mischief makers are no match for him—thereby demonstrating how politeness should not be mistaken for weakness. These are shown, for example, by [[Iroh]] in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', [[Mr. Miyagi]] in the ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' series, the Janitor in the new [[Karate Kid (2010 film)|''Karate Kid'']], or [[Yoda]] of ''[[Star Wars]]''.

==Speech==

The master always speaks in a very calm and composed manner. In case of the master being east-Asian, as is almost always in such films, he is invariably given the accent of an Oriental (Chinese or Japanese) who is not used to speaking in English and can only speak it without much fluency and speed. His way of speaking takes on a particularly benevolent, patient, affectionate and friend-philosopher-guide tone when he speaks with his disciple. He typically reprimands and/or castigates the protégé in his more "raw" and "immature" stage, but always in a fatherly manner. In most films of this genre, he often controls or restrains his protégé, from getting provoked and retaliating at the "bad boy(s)", and makes the protégé realize that everything has the "right place and time" and that losing control of oneself or giving in to the provocations of the rival or enemy is not like the true martial artist he wants his disciple to become. 
His speech is also full of [[philosophical]] observations, [[anecdotes]], short [[parables]] or [[insights]], that are mostly intended to constantly improve the insight and knowledge of the disciple in the martial arts, but also at times to improve his personality, behavior, moral values, and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kmu3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=mr+miyagi+stereotype&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin8ZO-uq7YAhVJbVAKHXj6BhgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mr+miyagi+stereotype&amp;f=false|title=The Cultural Politics of U.S. Immigration: Gender, Race, and Media|first=Leah|last=Perry|date=27 September 2016|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=29 December 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the martial arts epic ''[[Enter The Dragon]]'', the old master at the beginning of the film is seen taking a walk with the hero played by [[Bruce Lee]], where he tells his best disciple how the latter has succeeded in acquiring an intuitive skill in the art that has gone beyond the mere physical, and how it is his duty now to use that wisely and prudently in life.  
The master's dialogues with the protégé would often carry short recollection of his own earlier life, his fighting or career experiences, or how he had come upon a particular knowledge or insight.

==Relationship with the protégé==

Though the master is always the benevolent father-figure, he can be very strict when it comes to the training. He does not give any false hope to the protégé when it comes to training. He makes it very clear that in order to trained by him, the young man has to be unquestioningly obedient and be ready to bear the pain.

In the movie ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'', the teenage [[Frank Dux]] is treated by the Japanese master Senzo Tanaka in a very fatherly and affectionate manner in general, but the training in rigorous and harsh, and the master never gives any relief or comfort zone to Frank Dux. In the movie ''[[Kickboxer (film)|Kickboxer]]'', the hero played by [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] is made to kick the palm tree trunk with his bare shins, until he fractures his shin and drops to the ground in agony.

In ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', Mr. Miyagi makes [[Daniel LaRusso]] ([[Ralph Macchio]]) paint the fences and walls, and wipe the floors and the cars, with two specific arm-movements day after day, and only when Mr. Miyagi tests (by mock attacks) and finds that those movements have become spontaneous and unconscious reactions from Daniel, does he give the boy respite from that toil. It was then that Daniel too realizes, why after all his master had made him do that for days—in spite of him becoming tired, aching and fed-up—for those are actually blocking and parrying techniques, which his master by his experience, had ingrained into him without his being aware of it.

In many movies, the hero, after being wronged in some way by the rival gang or fighter, or after having his martial artist brother, or friend, maimed for life (or even killed) by the formidable and vicious fighter, seeks the master out himself with a resolution to take revenge. In such cases, the master is often unwilling at first, and may appear to be so just to test the seriousness and commitment of the protégé. But finally after a few days, he agrees to start training, after he feels the protégé has passed his test. The training imparted is typically harsh and rigorous right from day-one, and the master does not care if the hero has bruised and bloodied himself all over. He often administers medicine and pain-relief techniques, which are in many cases seen to be associated skills that such masters possess along with fighting techniques—since oriental martial arts are also closely related and complementary to traditional physio-therapy and healing systems. 
Yet, in other movies, the protégé does not really have to persuade or coax the master. The master is seen right from the beginning. He and the protégé get to know each other often by a random event.

In ''Bloodsport'', the teenage Frank Dux sees a [[katana]] sword through the window of Senzo Tanaka's house, and in his teenage immaturity, decides to steal it with two of his friends. He is caught in the act, by the master and his son who was of the same age as Frank. But the master in gentle and kind to Frank, and instead of seeing that Frank is punished, decides to teach him a long term moral lesson—that such a sword can only be earned through merit, one cannot be a fighter by stealing it. He talks to Frank's parents about the benefits of martial training and expresses the wish to make Frank his student. That became the beginning of a lasting and close father-son like relationship between Frank and Tanaka, and when Tanaka's son died as a young adult, it was Frank—by then grown into a mature young man, a soldier in the army and a worthy disciple—whom Tanaka saw as his deserving successor and inheritor of his martial legacy. The training phase of the movie thus ended with a quiet ceremony in which Tanaka was seen handing over his katana to Frank, signifying Frank's success in earning that sword, which he had tried to steal as a young boy, by merit and qualification. Frank, too shows the place his master occupies in his life by dedicating his victory in the underground [[Kumite]] to him.

In the second [[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|''Karate Kid'']] movie, there is a touching scene where [[Daniel LaRusso]] is seen coming up to the bereaved and tearful [[Mr. Miyagi]], who was sitting alone facing the sea and grieving for his father who had just died. Daniel sits besides him and comforts the old Mr. Miyagi both with words and an arm on his shoulder.

In some movies, the ability of the master to make his protégé rise above the thought of "revenge", and to acquire the moral strength and fortitude to hold himself back from doing to the rival/ villain the same thing that the latter once had done to his brother or friend, even in the face of the strongest provocation, is shown very movingly and dramatically. In the [[Taekwondo]] classic ''[[Best of the Best (1989 film)|Best of the Best]]'', featuring some world-renowned martial-artists and a renowned martial arts grandmaster [[Hee Il Cho]], the coach of the American team Frank Couzo ([[James Earl Jones]]), prevents the American fighter in the last face-off of the competition, Tommy Lee ([[Phillip Rhee]]), from dealing a fatal blow to his Korean opponent Dae Han Park (played by Philip's real-life brother [[Simon Rhee]]). Tommy had maimed his opponent and rendered him helpless by disabling his arms and legs, and the Korean could barely keep standing and taking a fighting stance. This was the same man who had cruelly killed his brother in sport combat years ago with excessive brutality. All Tommy had to do was to deal the final maiming or death blow with a powerful kick he had already braced himself for, as the scene of his brother's death flashed through his mind. But Coach Couzo's gentle but strong "No!" "No!" call from the sidelines helped Tommy avoid repeating the same crime for the sake of revenge and coming down to the level of Dae Han. By doing so, he won over Dae Han with moral strength instead of and eye-for-an-eye revenge, which made Dae Han repent and approach Tommy to hail him and give him his own medal after the fight was over.

Although it is not necessarily a rule or always true, the elder martial arts master is almost always depicted as being childless and unmarried, the character having either never having had a wife or child or having lost both at some point in his life (Mr. Miyagi is a prime example of this). This is often contrasted by the hero having either a very strained relationship with his parents, or often depicted as having no parents at all in the picture. This common ground between the characters, as well as the hard training the hero must go through at the hands of his master, lead to a very close bonding experience between the two, with the master assuming a fatherly role to his young protégé, who is turn becomes a son to his master. Their mutual enemy, as well as the battles and issues they face throughout the film, help bring them together as the film progresses making the hero ultimately realize that, although his master pushed him hard, he is beloved in the end, having become a son. In turn, when viewing the hero triumph and succeed in his battle, the master experiences a fathers pride in his protégé.

==Humour==

The old master shows a wry sense of humor at times. Master Tanaka flashes his katana with a practiced lightning speed to cleanly cut off the visor of Frank's baseball cap, with Frank becoming wide-eyed in frightened surprise. In ''[[Kickboxer (1989 film)|Kickboxer]]'' the lead character of [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] is awakened flabbergasted at dawn by a splash of cold water from his master. The [[Kung Fu]] movies starring [[Jackie Chan]] are probably the most mentionable as containing the most instances of master-disciple frolics. In ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', when an arrogant rival misbehaves, Miyagi tells Daniel a story about [[Okinawa]]: there was a bull that terrorized everyone, but one fine day there was a feast, when everyone was scared no more. The angry bull became tasty soup.

The Master also keeps an eye on his protégé's less martial and more "romantic" activities. He views them in an indulgent manner, as Mr. Miyagi does in the case of Daniel, as something that is but normal for the protégé's age. But he also takes care, directly or indirectly, to make the disciple remember that the "girl" should not be interfering with and hampering his martial arts training or lessening his commitment to training. Miyagi also displays humor when he explains to Daniel the importance of [[obi (martial arts)|belts]] in martial arts: "belt hold up pants."

[[File:India Square JC jeh.JPG|thumb|[[India Square]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey#Demographics|Jersey City]], New Jersey, one of 24 [[Indian American|Indian]] ethnic enclaves in the [[New York City Metropolitan Area]].]]

In [[sociology]], an '''ethnic enclave''' is a geographic area with high ethnic concentration, characteristic cultural identity, and economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamson, Mark . "Urban Enclaves: Identity and Place in America." Review by: David M. Hummon. ''Contemporary Sociology''. American Sociological Association. Vol. 25 No. 6 (Nov. 1996): pp. 781-782.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used to refer to either a residential area or a workspace with a high concentration of ethnic firms.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"&gt;Portes, Alejandro, and Leif Jensen. "Disproving the Enclave Hypothesis: Reply." ''American Sociological Review''. Vol. 57. no. 3 (1992): 418-420.&lt;/ref&gt; Their success and growth depends on self-sufficiency, and is coupled with economic prosperity.

The theory of [[social capital]] and the formation of migrant networks creates the social foundation for ethnic enclaves. [[Douglas Massey]] describes how migrant networks provide new immigrants with social capital that can be transferred to other tangible forms.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 1990 pp. 60"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. "Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science." Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Vol. 510. World Population: Approaching the Year 2000 (Jul., 1990): pp. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; As immigrants tend to cluster in close geographic spaces, they develop migrant networks—systems of interpersonal relations through which participants can exchange valuable resources and knowledge.  Immigrants can capitalize on social interactions by transforming information into tangible resources, and thereby lower costs of migration. Information exchanged may include knowledge of employment opportunities, affordable housing, government assistance programs and helpful [[NGO]]s.&lt;ref name= "Massey, Douglas S."&gt;Massey, Douglas S. "Why Does Immigration Occur? A Theoretical Synthesis."  The Handbook of International Migration: The American Experience, Charles Hirschman, Philip Kasinitz, and Josh DeWind, editors. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus by stimulating social connections, ethnic enclaves generate a pool of intangible resources that help to promote the social and economic development of its members.&lt;ref name= "Massey, Douglas S." /&gt;

By providing a space for co-ethnics to create potentially beneficial relations, ethnic enclaves assist members in achieving [[economic mobility]]. Enclaves create an alternative labor market that is ethnic-specific and does not demand social and cultural skills of the host country. By eliminating language and cultural barriers, enclave economies employ a greater proportion of co-ethnics and speed the incorporation of new immigrants into a bustling economy. By increasing employment opportunities and facilitating upward mobility, studying ethnic enclaves helps to explain the success of some immigrant groups.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt; Additionally, while the ethnic enclave theory was developed to explain immigrant incorporation into the receiving society, it has also been linked to migration processes at large as successful incorporation of immigrants has the potential to lower migration costs for future immigrants, an example of [[chain migration]].

Despite their immediate benefits, the long-term implications of participation in an ethnic enclave are a topic of debate.  Enclave economies have been linked to a glass ceiling limiting immigrant growth and upward mobility. While participation in the enclave economy may assist in achieving upward mobility through increased availability of employment opportunities in the enclave labor market, it may also impede acquisition of host country skills that benefit the immigrant over the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;Edin, Per-Anders, Peter Fredriksson, and Olof Aslund. "ETHNIC ENCLAVES AND THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF IMMIGRANTS—EVIDENCE FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT." The Quarterly Journal of Economics. no. 1 (2003): 329-357.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such delays constrain immigrants to activity within the enclave and secludes them from the larger economy. Opportunities available to mainstream society can thus be out of reach for immigrants who haven't learned about them. Thus, the accelerated path toward economic mobility that lures new immigrants into enclave economies may impede success.  Integration into an ethnic enclave may delay and even halt [[cultural assimilation]], preventing the immigrants from benefiting from mainstream institutions.&lt;ref name= "Sanders, Jimy M. and Nee, Victor"&gt;Sanders, Jimy M. and Nee, Victor.  "Limits of Ethnic Solidarity in the Enclave Economy." American Sociological Review. 52. no. 6 (1987): 745-773.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, the formation of ethnic enclaves has been the result of a variety of [[socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] factors that draw immigrants to similar spaces in the receiving country. The lack of access to economic capital and of knowledge regarding residential neighborhoods can constrain newly arrived immigrants to regions of affordable housing. Social dynamics such as [[prejudice]] and [[racism]] may concentrate co-ethnics into regions displaying ethnic similarity. [[Housing discrimination]] may also prevent ethnic minorities from settling into a particular [[residential area]] outside the enclave. When discussing the ethnic enclave as defined by a spatial cluster of businesses, success and growth can be largely predicted by three factors. These factors include 1) the size and population of the enclave 2) the level of entrepreneurial skills of those in the enclave and 3) the availability of capital resources to the enclave. Successful enclaves can reach a point where they become self-sufficient, or "institutionally complete" through the supply of new immigrants and demand of goods offered in the market. They only reach this point after first supplying for the needs of co-ethnics and then expanding to meet needs of those in the larger market of the host society.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Portes |first1=Alejandro |editor-last=Portes |editor-first=Alejandro |title= The Economic Sociology of Immigration |publisher=Russel Sage Foundation | year=1995|pages=1–41|chapter=Chapter 1: Economic Sociology and the Sociology of Immigration: A conceptual Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ethnic enclave" arose in response to a publication by [[Alejandro Portes]] and Kenneth Wilson in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger, Roger. "The Ethnic Enclave Debate Revisited."International Journal of Urban and Regional Research. 17. no. 3 (1993): 428-436.&lt;/ref&gt; Portes and Wilson identified a third labor market in which Cuban immigrants in Miami took part. Instead of entering the [[secondary labor market]] of the host society, Portes and Wilson discovered that new immigrants tended to become employed by co-ethnics running immigrant-owned firms. The collection of small immigrant enterprises providing employment to new immigrants was defined as the enclave economy.&lt;ref&gt;Portes, Alejandro, and Kenneth Wilson. "Immigrant Enclaves: An Analysis of the Labor Market Experiences of Cubans in Miami." American Journal of Sociology. 86. no. 2 (1980): 295-319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Enclave economy hypothesis===

Observations of the Cuban ethnic enclave economy in Miami led [[Alejandro Portes]] and Kenneth Wilson to conclude that participation in an enclave economy provided immigrants with an alternative, speedy option to achieve economic mobility in a host society. The discourse pioneered by Portes and Wilson produced the construct for a body of literature that came to be known by the ethnic enclave hypothesis. While never empirically defined, the term "ethnic enclave" began to be widely used to represent two distinct definitions: that of an enclave economy and that of a residential area of high co-ethnic concentration.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt; The most fundamental concept within the enclave hypothesis is that of [[social capital]], which lays the foundation for the establishment of migrant networks and the advantages associated with them.&lt;ref name= "Massey, Douglas S." /&gt;

===Cumulative causation===
{{See also|Chain migration}}
With the rise in [[globalization]] and ease of international transportation, patterns of immigration show the role of ethnic enclaves for contributing to increased migration over time. New immigrants unintentionally lower costs for future immigration of co-ethnics by pooling together resources for themselves. Thus, by achieving mobility in the receiving country themselves, immigrants create a social structure that makes it easier for future immigrants to become upwardly mobile. According to Douglas Massey, "Networks build into the migration process a self-perpetuating momentum that leads to its growth over time, in spite of fluctuating wage differentials, recessions, and increasingly restrictive immigration policies." &lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 1990 pp. 60"/&gt; 
Ethnic enclaves thus contribute to continued immigration by providing co-ethnics with a space to make connections that ultimately lower migration costs and promote economic mobility. Many worn path taken by former immigrants are made accessible to enclave members, making immigration easier to future generations. By generating further immigration, migration leads to its own cumulative causation over time.

==Modes of incorporation==
An approach that analyzes ethnic enclaves and their members by their modes of incorporation is preferred to a neoclassical model, which states that the economic success of immigrants depends on the education, work experience, and other elements of human capital that they possess.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt; Sociologists have concluded that these factors do not suffice in explaining the integration and success of immigrants measured by occupational mobility and earnings.

===Social===

Upon arrival to a foreign country, immigrants face challenges in [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and [[Social integration|integration]] processes and thus experience different modes and levels of incorporation within the host society. Many factors influence the level of ease or challenge experienced by immigrants as they make the transition and undergo physical, social, and psychological challenges. The segmented assimilation model notes that there can exist a "consciously pluralistic society in which a variety of subcultures and racial and ethnic identities coexist" &lt;ref name="Waters, Mary C 1994"&gt;Waters, Mary C.  "Ethnic and Racial Identities of Second-Generation Black Immigrants in New York City." International Migration Review. 28. no. 4 (1994): 795-820.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters"&gt;Waters, p. 799.&lt;/ref&gt;

One influential factor in an immigrant's journey is the presence of relatives or friends in the receiving country. Friends and family, making up a [[kinship]] network, who are willing to help the newcomers can be classified as a type of capital commonly referred to as [[social capital]]. Upon arrival, many immigrants have limited or no access to human capital and thus rely heavily on any available source of social capital.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt; The cost to immigration is large, however this burden can be shared and thus eased through an immigrant's access to social capital in the receiving country. Kinship networks in the receiving country can provide aid not only for the physical and economic needs of immigrants, but also for their emotional and socio-psychological needs.&lt;ref name= "Menjívar, Cecilia"&gt;Menjívar, Cecilia.  "Immigrant Kinship Networks and the Impact of the Receiving Context: Salvadorans in San Francisco in the Early 1990's." Social Problems. 44. no. 1 (1997): 104-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quality of kinship networks ====

Access to social capital does not guarantee ease or success for the migrant. Because social capital is rooted in relationships it easily lends itself to conflict and disagreement between parties.&lt;ref name= "Menjívar, Cecilia"/&gt;  The level of economic stability on the side of the receiving party can dictate the level of aid they are willing or able to offer.  In addition, the economic condition of the country and the availability of jobs open to the immigrants can largely affect the quality of the support network available to the migrant. If the receiving country provides favorable conditions such as access to social programs, the local economy, and employment opportunities, the network is likely to be of much higher quality. Adversely, kinship networks may break down if much stress is placed on the relationships involved due to economic hardships. The duration and intensity of aid needed can dictate the quality of the kinship network available to the immigrant. Immigrant ideas regarding level of support to be received are often high and left unmet if true economic conditions do not allow for favorable network conditions.&lt;ref name= "Menjívar, Cecilia"/&gt; Shared norms and relational ties can also lead to obligatory ties which some scholars, such as Tsang and Inkpen, argue restricts an individual's willingness to explore opportunities outside the network.&lt;ref name= "Inkpen, C. Andrew and Tsang, W. K. Eric"&gt;Inkpen, C. Andrew and Tsang, W. K. Eric. "Social Capital, Networks, and Knowledge Transfer" The Academy of Management Review. Vol 30. No. 1 (1992): 146-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnic identity====

Methods of assimilation and access to social capital vary between and even within ethnic groups. A variety of factors can influence individuals' ethnic identities including their social class background and the social networks available to them.  As theorized by sociologist Mary C. Waters, the involvement level of parents in ethnic organizations or activities heavily influences the development of their children's ethnic identities. This is important to note as second-generation immigrants must actively work to identify themselves with their ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Waters, Mary C 1994"/&gt;

====Enclave networks====

Enclave networks offer access to a unique type of [[social capital]] and act as large kinship networks. Within enclave networks, social capital commonly exists both as a private and public good.&lt;ref name= "Inkpen, C. Andrew and Tsang, W. K. Eric"/&gt; Though there is some debate in relation to the long-term benefits offered by these networks, the short-term benefits are universally acknowledged. The socio-psychological challenges faced by the immigrant can be largely reduced through the individual's entrance into an ethnic enclave. Ethnic enclaves can resemble the immigrant's place of origin through physical look, layout, and language employed both written and orally.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt; In addition to increasing the cultural comfort of the migrant, healthy ethnic enclaves offer solidarity and trust among members, and informal training systems within the workplace. The geographic proximity of the enclave network allows for easy flow of knowledge and varying types of assistance between firms as well. Where there is an atmosphere of trust in ethnic enclaves, this transfer of knowledge and sharing of social capital exists as an asset to the firms.&lt;ref name= "Inkpen, C. Andrew and Tsang, W. K. Eric"/&gt;  Connections with members in an enclave may also afford the newcomer work opportunities. Immigrants may also receive informal training regarding the customs and practices of the larger culture outside the enclave and help navigating challenges in many areas of everyday life.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt; Social hostility may be a challenge faced by immigrants in their host society, therefore to avoid this factor, ethnic enclaves provide a haven where economic success may still be achieved.&lt;ref name= "Sanders, Jimy M. and Nee, Victor"/&gt;

===Economic===
The processes of enclave economies can only be fully understood through a sociological perspective that considers [[economic sociology]] and the [[sociology of immigration]]. Ethnic Enclaves generate a pool of [[social capital]]  through which members can access resources that lower the costs of migration. Economic assistance through enclave membership takes the form of job opportunities, loans for small businesses, and other forms of economic assistance.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt;
Small ethnic firms within the enclave provide new immigrants with immediate access to economic opportunities by subverting the [[secondary sector of the economy]] and creating numerous low-wage jobs that are easily accessed by members. The barriers of entry into the enclave economy are significantly lowered due to the ethno-centric nature of businesses and firms. Goods and services tend to be offered in the language of that enclave. Additionally, social and cultural norms specific to the host country are not required of employees in the enclave economy. Thus, the ethno-specific nature of enclave economies makes them attractive to new immigrants who lack the social and cultural skills necessary to integrate into the mainstream economy.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt;

Entrance into the enclave economy is dependent upon the conditions of incorporation experienced by the individual. Unfavorable modes of incorporation into the host society provide incentives for immigrants to enter the [[informal economy]]. [[Discrimination]], [[hostility]] and lack of resources may encourage immigrants to enter into informal forms of employment for survival.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt;  Ethnic enclaves are rich in informal activities, as the entrepreneurial services making the core of the enclave's founding were historically informal ventures. Informality proves favorable for immigrant entrepreneurships, allowing them to bypass costly regulations. Additionally, the scope of employment for immigrants is greatly widened by the availability of informal jobs in the enclave economic sector.  
The informality of the enclave economy is also a reason for risk and fraud. Informal activities are constantly under risk of detection by the formal sector, which has a negative effect on job security. Furthermore, due to the absence of legal framework, immigrant laborers often remain silent about various forms of exploitation. The most common form of [[labor exploitation]] in immigrant economies is unpaid labor. Undocumented immigrants are especially afraid to report violations of [[labor laws]] and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. "Blowups and Other Unhappy Endings" in Global Woman: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy by Barbara Enrehnreich and Arlie Hochschild. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political/civic===
[[File:ChineseStreetSignBellaire.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Bilingual street sign in Houston's Chinatown]]Government policy toward immigrants is the first mode of reception to the receiving country.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt; Governments generally enforce measures to reduce the amount of "unwanted" immigrants which may potentially pose a burden on the receiving society and economy.&lt;ref name="Cornelius, Wayne1"&gt;Cornelius, Wayne A. Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004. 3-42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The granting of different statuses and visas (i.e. refugee, temporary visas for students and workers) to immigrant groups affects the type of reception immigrants will receive. Aside from immigration control policies, some governments also impose measures to accelerate social and political incorporation of new immigrants, and to stimulate economic mobility.

Wayne Cornelius studies two central theses regarding institutional response to increased movement of people across transnational borders. The first of these is the gap hypothesis which describes the dissonance between official immigration policies and real policy outcomes. Policy gaps are the result of [[unintended consequences]] and inadequate enforcement by the receiving society. Many reasons can explain unintended consequences of [[immigration policy]]. Governments with undefined or ambiguous stances toward immigration may propagate unintended consequences, and the reliance on flawed policies can further reduce the efficacy of institutional measures. Furthermore, political incoherency policy poses a greater challenge for the incorporation and enforcement of effective measures.

A negative public opinion toward immigrants is a good measure of significant policy gaps in the receiving government; however, special interest groups may also constrain political responses to immigration. This is especially true in liberal democracies, where "lobbying by powerful employer groups, religious groups, ethnic and immigrant advocacy groups, and even labor unions leads governments to adopt more expansionary immigration policies, even when the economy goes bad and general public opinion turns hostile to immigrants." &lt;ref name="Cornelius, Wayne2"&gt;Cornelius, p.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, governments and special groups in the immigrant-sending country may align  themselves with pro-immigration lobbyists in the receiving country. Thus, the policymaking process is complicated by involvement of multiple factions.

The second thesis studied by Wayne Cornelius is the convergence hypothesis which describes the growing similarity of political responses to immigration among immigrant-receiving countries. These similarities fall into: "(1) the policies that their governments have adopted to control immigration; (2) policies designed to integrate immigrants into host societies by providing them with social services as well as political, economic, and social rights; and (3) attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy preferences among general publics." &lt;ref name="Cornelius, Wayne3"&gt;Cornelius, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic groups receive various levels of reception by the host society for various reasons. In general, European immigrants tend to encounter little resistance by host countries, while tenets of racism are evinced by widespread resistance to immigrants of color.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro"/&gt;

Political incorporation into the host country is coupled with adoption of citizenship of the host country. By studying the diverging trajectories of immigrant citizenship in Canada and the U.S., Irene Bloemraad explains that current models of citizenship acquisition fail to recognize the social nature of political incorporation. Bloemraad describes political incorporation as a "social process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement." &lt;ref name="Bloemraad, Irene"&gt;Bloemraad, Irene. "Social Forces." Social Forces. Vol. 85. No. 2 (Dec. 2006): pp. 667-695. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This alternative model emphasizes the role of migrant networks in critically shaping how immigrants consider citizenship. Bloemraad shows that friends, family, co-ethnic organizations  and local community affect political incorporation by providing a structured mobilization framework. This social structure is most essential for immigrants who face language barriers and may lack familiarity with host institutions.

The extent to which migrant networks promote citizenship depends on the efficacy of government policies on immigrant integration. Governments adopting policies that facilitate the emergence, integration and growth of ethnic economies are presumed to gain support by co-ethnics. Thus, the movement toward political incorporation and citizenship is nested in a larger institutional structure involving economic and social integration policy as these relate to immigrants.&lt;ref name="Bloemraad, Irene"/&gt;
Ethnic enclaves have the ability to simultaneously assist in political and civic incorporation of immigrants. By providing a space that facilitates upward mobility and economic integration into the receiving society, enclaves and their members fundamentally influence the perceptions of receiving institutions by co-ethnics. Finally, enclaves may gauge community interest in naturalization and direct immigrants through the process to gaining citizenship

==Ethnic enclave debate==

The discourse surrounding ethnic enclaves has prompted debate among scholars in two related areas of thought. Both areas discuss the role ethnic enclaves play by either offering aid or hindering the economic and social well-being of the enclave's members. One area of thought discusses the role of enclaves in assimilative patterns and upward mobility while the second area of thought argues the economic ramifications associated with membership within ethnic enclaves.

The immediate economic and social advantages associated with membership in an ethnic enclave are undisputed by scholars, however the long-term consequences remain an area of uncertainty. The role these networks play remains uncertain due to the fact that ethnic enclaves allow immigrants to function successfully within the host society without a significant amount of adjustment either culturally or linguistically. As such, they can either help or hinder naturalization within the host country. The relatively low levels of skill required allow immigrants to achieve financial stability which can in turn encourage eventual naturalization and assimilation. Adversely, this same factor can afford enclave members the opportunity to remain considerably segregated and secluded from the host society. As such, members may circumvent the need to acquire skills necessary for life in the larger host society such as knowledge of cultural norms and language.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Natasha T. and Waldorf, Brigitte S." Becoming a U.S. Citizen: The Role of Immigrant Enclaves" Cityscape. 11. No. 3 (2009): 5-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate regarding the economic viability of ethnic enclaves revolves around the enclave-economy hypothesis. The hypothesis as written by Wilson and Portes formulates the idea that "[i]mmigrant workers are not restricted to the secondary labor market." They instead argue that "those inserted into an immigrant enclave can be empirically distinguished from workers in both the primary and secondary labor markets. Enclave workers will share with those in the primary sector a significant economic return past human capital investments" something those who enter the secondary labor market are not able to enjoy.&lt;ref name= "Sanders, Jimy M. and Nee, Victor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders and Nee2"&gt;Sanders and Nee, pp. 746.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, they assert the enclave economy is not a mobility trap as some would term it, but an alternate mode of incorporation.

In their argument formulated to disprove the enclave economy hypothesis, Sanders and Nee state the need for a distinction between "immigrant-bosses" and "immigrant-workers" as the economic benefits differ along this distinction.&lt;ref name="Sanders and Nee"&gt;Sanders and Nee, pp. 745.&lt;/ref&gt; They also call for the investigation of economic opportunities available to those in the enclave, believing them to be lesser in quality and supply. Sanders and Nee also assert the idea that segregation and forced entrance of immigrant-workers into low paying jobs is actually aggravated by the existence of ethnic enclaves. Due to these objections, they call for the revision of Portes and Wilson's hypothesis to include an acknowledgement and outline of the entrepreneur/worker economic benefit distinction.

In reaction to Sanders and Nee, Portes and Jensen make the clarification that those in ethnic enclaves need not be wealthier than those who left the enclave for the hypothesis to be supported. They instead assert that this will usually not be the case as the constant entrance of new immigrants into the enclave will actually be somewhat burdensome on the economy; a factor which does not actually represent disadvantage when compared with the other advantages provided.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt; Additionally, Portes and Jensen outline three different conditions to be fulfilled in order to disprove their hypothesis. The first of these conditions requires the demonstration that ethnic entrepreneurship is a mobility trap leading to lower earnings than the immigrant's worth in human capital. The second condition requires data proving the work within the enclave to be exploitative, and the third condition requires data showing employment within the enclave leads to a 'dead end' and offers no chance of upward mobility.&lt;ref name= "Portes, Alejandro and Leif Jensen"/&gt; They acknowledge that the fulfillment of these three requirements is difficult as there is little data available to accurately test them.

Jennifer Lee adds to the discussion noting the particular niches and types of business immigrant groups enter. She notes that it is most common for immigrants to participate in long hours of physically demanding work in the [[retail industry]]. The retail market is a viable option due to the relatively low startup costs and knowledge of the host country's language required. Different niches have different levels of communication, for example the retail and self-service niche, (fruit and vegetable markets, take out restaurants) typically require the lowest level of customer interaction and communication. Lee notes the embeddedness of ethnic enclaves and brings the thought that such practices are good for those within the enclave but harmful to certain groups outside them.&lt;ref name= " Lee, Jennifer "&gt;Lee, Jennifer. Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews, and Koreans in Urban America. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England: Harvard University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes the adverse effects patterns of ethnic embeddedness can have on surrounding ethnic groups by noting the difficulty other groups face in joining the network. She argues that this type of retail niche domination can have positive consequences for co-ethnics, as Portes and Wilson believe, however can also have negative effects on surrounding ethnic groups who face exclusion due solely to their ethnic dissimilarity from the network.&lt;ref name=" Lee, Jennifer "/&gt;

==Ethnic enclaves in the United States==
{{Main article|Immigration to the United States}}
Immigration to the United States has occurred in waves that demonstrate the predominance of certain sets of ethnic minorities. As immigrants tended to cluster in certain cities and states, separate waves were responsible for the establishment of ethnic enclaves in separate physical spaces. In 1998, nearly three quarters of all immigrants in the United States lived in California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey or Illinois.&lt;ref name= "Borjas, George J."&gt;Borjas, George J. Heaven's Door: Immigration Policy and the American Economy. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999. p.8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Housing discrimination (United States)|Housing discrimination]] remains a factor in the persistence of racial enclaves in American cities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Racial Structuring of the Housing Market and Segregation in Suburban Areas'' Linda Brewster Stearns, John R. Logan Social Forces, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Sep., 1986), pp. 28&amp;ndash;42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R Holloway (1998) ''Exploring the Neighborhood Contingency of Race Discrimination in Mortgage Lending in Columbus, Ohio'' Annals of the Association of American Geographers 88 (2), 252–276.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent patterns of migration, such as [[chain migration]], challenge traditional methods of enclaves establishment.

===Effects on society===
The increased supply of less-skilled immigrants raises concerns for the economic opportunities of the least-skilled natives. As the supply of low-wage workers increases, the wages for native workers who seek similar employment decrease. While native employees lose from lower wages, employers benefit from lower costs, which can lead to a decrease in the cost of the good for native consumers, with cheaper goods and services. That can cause increase of the gain to native-owned firms.

On the other hand, ethnic enclaves expand the size of the market, encouraging cross-cultural interactions and introducing Americans to a variety of foreign products and cuisines.&lt;ref name= "Borjas, George J."/&gt;

== Historical ethnic enclaves ==
Ethnic enclaves have become commonplace in modern times, with the increase in the geographic mobility of humankind.  However, they have also arisen in historical times, for various reasons. The village of [[Schandorf]], now in Austria, was for centuries a [[Croatia]]n ethnic enclave, surrounded by areas of Austrian and Hungarian ethnicity. The enclave originated around 1543 when the Hungarian magnate [[Batthyany]] sought to repopulate lands that had been emptied by devastating Turkish attacks; he invited Croatian settlers.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://schandorf.at/kultur/die-urspruenge/].&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Alghero]] in [[Sardinia]] still marginally preserves a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] ethnic enclave; this dates from a military conquest of the town by Catalans in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://prosodia.upf.edu/coalgueres/en/algueres.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic enclaves also arose when a people remained in its original territory but came to be surrounded by a far more numerous majority, as in the case of [[Vepsians]] and Russians.

The '''Evil Queen''', also called the '''Wicked Queen''', is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[antagonist]] in "[[Snow White]]", a German [[fairy tale]] recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; similar stories are also known to exist in other countries. Other versions of the Queen [[Queen (Snow White) in derivative works|appear in "Snow White" derivative works]], and the character has also become an [[archetype]] for unrelated works of fiction.

The Queen is Snow White's evil and vindictive [[stepmother]] who is obsessed with being "the fairest in the land". The beautiful young princess Snow White evokes the Queen's sense of envy, so the Queen designs a number of plans to kill Snow White through the use of [[witchcraft]]. A driving force in the story is the Queen's [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]]. In the traditional resolution of the story, the Queen is grotesquely executed for her crimes. The tale is meant as a lesson for young children warning them against [[narcissism]] and [[pride]].

Various other versions of the Queen appear in subsequent adaptations and continuations of the fairy tale, including novels and films. In these, the Queen is often re-imagined and sometimes portrayed more sympathetically, such as being morally conflicted or suffering from madness instead of being simply evil. In some of the revisionist stories she has even been portrayed as an [[antihero]] or a [[tragic hero]]. In some instances, she serves as the [[protagonist]] or [[narrator]] of the story; one such particularly notable version is [[Disney]]'s, sometimes known as [[Queen Grimhilde]]. The Queen has also become an [[archetype]] that inspired several characters featured in the works that are not directly based on the original tale.

==In "Snow White"==
[[File:Magic mirror.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The queen with her mirror, from 1921's''My Favourite Book of Fairy Tales'' (illustrated by [[Jennie Harbour]])]]

===In the Brothers Grimm tale===
The Evil Queen is a very beautiful but proud and arrogant woman who is secretly dabbling in dark arts. When the [[King (Snow White)|King]]'s first wife, the Good Queen passes away, Snow White's father marries again. The King's new and second wife is very beautiful, but she is also a wicked and vain woman who becomes the new and second Queen, and Snow White's stepmother. She owns a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], which one day informs her that her young stepdaughter Princess [[Snow White]] has surpassed her in beauty. After deciding to eliminate Snow White, the Queen orders her [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to take the princess into the forest and kill her. The Queen tells him to bring back Snow White's lungs and liver, as proof that the princess is dead. However, the Huntsman takes pity on Snow White, and instead, brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a wild boar. The Queen then eats what she believes are Snow White's organs.

While questioning her mirror, the Queen discovers that Snow White has survived. Intending to kill Snow White herself, she uses [[witchcraft]] to prepare poison and take the disguise of an old peddler woman. She visits the dwarfs' house and sells Snow White laces for a [[corset]] that she laces too tight in an attempt to [[asphyxia]]te the girl. When that fails, the Queen returns, as a different old woman, and tricks Snow White into using a poisoned comb. When the comb fails to kill Snow White, the Queen again visits Snow White, this time disguised as a farmer's wife, and gives Snow White a poisoned apple.

Eventually, Snow White and the Prince from another kingdom reveal the Queen's true nature and invite her to their wedding, where she is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes and "dance" until she drops dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brothers Grimm|title=The Complete Fairy Tales |publisher=[[Routledge|Routledge Classics]]|isbn=0-415-28596-8|chapter=Little Snow White|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternate fates===

In the classic ending of "Snow White", the Evil Queen is tricked into attending Snow White's wedding and put to death by torment; this is often considered to be too dark and potentially horrifying for children in modern society. [[Sara Maitland]] wrote that "we do not tell this part of the story any more; we say it is too cruel and will break children's soft hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Maitland, ''From the Forest: A Search for the Hidden Roots of Our Fairy Tales'', page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, many (especially modern) revisions of the fairy tale often change the gruesome classic ending in order to make it seem less violent. In some versions, instead of dying, the Queen is even just merely prevented from committing further wrongdoings. However, in the same 2014 nationwide UK poll that considered the Queen from "Snow White" the scariest fairy tale character of all time (as cited by 32.21% of responding adults), around two thirds opined that today's stories are too "sanitised" for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uk.msn.com/snow-white-favourite-fairy-tale |title=Snow White 'favourite fairy tale' |publisher=News.uk.msn.com |date=2014-05-23 |accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already the first English translation of the Grimms' tale, written by [[Edgar Taylor (author)|Edgar Taylor]] in 1823, has the Queen choke on her own envy upon the sight of Snow White alive. Another early (1871) English translation by Susannah Mary Paull "replaces the Queen's death by cruel physical punishment with death by self-inflicted pain and self-destruction" when it was her own shoes that became hot due to her anger.&lt;ref&gt;Gunilla M. Anderman, ''Voices in Translation: Bridging Cultural Divides'', page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternative endings can have the Queen just instantly drop dead "of anger" at the wedding&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gikow, ''Muppet Babies' Classic Children's Tales''.&lt;/ref&gt; or in front of her mirror upon learning about it,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Carruth, ''The Best of the Brothers Grimm'', page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; die from her own designs going awry (such as from touching her own poisoned rose&lt;ref&gt;Jane Heitman, ''Once Upon a Time: Fairy Tales in the Library and Language Arts Classroom'', page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;) or by nature (such as falling into quicksands while crossing a swamp on her way back after poisoning Snow White&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Solski, ''Fairy Tales Using Bloom's Taxonomy Gr. 3-5'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;), be killed by the dwarfs during a chase,&lt;ref&gt;Van Gool, ''Snow White'', page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; be destroyed by her own mirror,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Thornes, ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; run away into the forest never to be seen again,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holliss, ''Bedtime Collection Snow White'', page 82.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply being banished from the kingdom forever.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Giulemetova, ''Stories'', page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===Origins and evolution===
The Evil Queen's origins can be traced to the character of Silver-Tree, a jealous queen who threatens her daughter, in the Celtic oral tale "[[Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kay F. Stone, ''Some Day Your Witch Will Come'', page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kenny Klein]], the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] of the [[Welsh mythology]] was "the quintissential evil stepmother, the origin of that character in the two tales of Snow White and [[Cinderella]]".&lt;ref name=fae&gt;Kenny Klein, ''Through the Faerie Glass'', page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Madox Hueffer]] noted that the [[wicked stepmother]] with magical powers  threatening a young princess is a recurring theme in fairy tales; one similar character is the witch-queen in "[[The Wild Swans]]" as told by [[Hans Christian Andersen]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;Oliver Madox Hueffer, ''The Book of Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schneewitchen (1).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Queen in disguise, offering a poisoned apple to [[Snow White]] (a late 19th-century German illustration)]]

[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley]] suggests that the Queen uses an apple because it recalls the [[Adam and Eve|temptation of Eve]]; this [[creation myth|creation story]] from the [[Bible]] led the Christian Church to view apples as a symbol of [[sin]]. Many people feared that apples could carry evil spirits, and that witches used them for poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley, ''The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy'', page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert G. Brown of [[Duke University]] also makes a connection with the story of Adam and Eve, seeing the Queen as a representation of the [[archetype]] of [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Brown, ''The Book of Lilith'', page 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apple (symbolism)|symbol of an apple]] has long had traditional associations with enchantment and witchcraft in some European cultures, as in case of [[Morgan le Fay]]'s [[Avalon]] ("Isle of the Apples").&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley, ''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'', page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Scottish versions of "Snow White"-type fairy tales, a talking trout takes the place of the Queen's mirror, the Queen is the princess' biological mother, rather than her stepmother, the huntsman figure is the princess' own father, and the Queen's fate remains unresolved.&lt;ref name=evolution&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ctzine.com/the-evolution-of-snow-white-magic-mirror-on-the-wall-who-is-the-fairest-one-of-all/ |title= The Evolution of Snow White: ‘Magic Mirror, on the Wall, Who Is the Fairest One of All?’ &amp;#124; Cultural Transmogrifier Magazine |publisher= Ctzine.com |date= 2012-06-01 |accessdate= 2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale varies widely from place to place, with the Queen using various tricks against the princess. For example, in Italy, the Queen uses a toxic comb, a contaminated cake, or a suffocating braid. The Queen's demands of proof from the huntsman (often her lover in non-Grimm versions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forsga2.html |title= Snow, Glass, Apples: The Story of Snow White by Terri Windling: Summer 2007, Journal of Mythic Arts, Endicott Studio |publisher= Endicott-studio.com |date= |accessdate= 2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also vary: a bottle of blood stoppered with the princess' toe in Spain, or the princess' intestines and blood-soaked shirt in Italy.&lt;ref name=hard&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', pages 233-234.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a local tale features a poisoned tomato.&lt;ref name=fae/&gt; One of the early variations of the tale was [[Giambattista Basile]]'s "[[The Young Slave]]".

[[File:Snow White Iron Shoes.png|thumb|The iron shoes being heated in an illustration from an 1852 Icelandic translation of the Grimms' story]]

The Grimm brothers invented the motif of the Queen's execution at Snow White's wedding; the original story sees her punished by the King. The Grimms noted on the margin of their 1810 manuscript: "The ending is not quite right and is lacking something."&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Ann Abate, ''Bloody Murder: The Homicide Tradition in Children's Literature'', page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diane Purkiss]] attributes the Queen's fiery death to "the folkbelief that burning a witch's body ended her power, a belief which subtended (but did not cause) the practice of [[Witch burning|burning witches]] in Germany",&lt;ref&gt;Diane Purkiss, ''The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations'', page 285.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[American Folklore Society]] noted that the use of iron shoes "recalls folk practices of destroying a witch through [[Iron in folklore|the magic agency of iron]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of American Folklore'', volume 90, page 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] collected the German fairy tale in their 1812 ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen'' ("Children's and Household Tales", more commonly known in English as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]''). In the first edition of the Brothers Grimm story, the Queen is Snow White's biological mother, not her stepmother. This motif changed in subsequent versions,&lt;ref name=windling&gt;Terri Windling, "[http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forsga.html Snow, Glass, Apples: the story of Snow White] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517095921/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forsga.html |date=May 17, 2008 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; after 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Cay Dollerup, ''Tales and Translation: The Grimm Tales from Pan-germanic Narratives to Shared International Fairytales'', page 339.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version was known as "Snow Drop".&lt;ref&gt;Diane Purkiss, ''The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations'', page 278.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Zipes]] said "the change from 'evil mother' to 'evil stepmother' for example, was because the brothers 'held motherhood sacred'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bringmethenews.com/2014/11/14/miserably-ever-after-u-of-m-professors-fairy-tales-translation-reveals-grimm-side/|title= Miserably ever after: U of M professor's fairy tales translation reveals Grimm side|author= Adam Uren|work= Rick Kupchella's - BringMeTheNews.com|accessdate= 8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheldon Cashdan, Professor of Psychology at the [[University of Massachusetts]], a "cardinal rule of fairy tales" mandates that the "heroes and heroines are allowed to kill witches, sorceresses, even stepmothers, but never their own mothers".&lt;ref name=witch/&gt; Zipes' 2014 collection of Grimm fairy tales in their original forms reinstated the Queen as Snow White's mother.&lt;ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
According to some scholars, the story is constructed and characters are presented with [[ageism|ageist]] undertones. The [[University of Hawaii]] professor Cristina Bacchilega said, "I think there is still very much an attachment to vilifying the older, more powerful woman."&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; [[Roger Sale]] opined that "the term '[[narcissism]]' seems altogether too slippery to be the only one we want here. There is, for instance, no suggestion that the queen's absorption in her beauty ever gives her pleasure, or that the desire for power through sexual attractiveness is itself a sexual feeling. What is stressed is the anger and fear that attend the queen's realization that as she and Snow White both get older, she must lose. This is why the major feeling involved is not [[jealousy]] but [[envy]]: to make beauty that important is to reduce the world to one in which only two people count."&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; [[Terri Windling]] wrote that the Queen is "a woman whose power is derived from her beauty; it is this, the tale implies, that provides her place in the castle's hierarchy. If the king’s attention turns from his wife to another, what power is left to an aging woman? Witchcraft, the tale answers. Potions, poisons, and self-protection."&lt;ref name=evolution/&gt; According to Zipes, "the queen's actions are determined by the mirror's representations of her as exemplifying beauty and [[evil]], or associating evil and vanity with beauty, and these mirror representations are taken as the truth by the queen. Had she perhaps doubted and cracked the mirror, cracked the meaning of the mirror, she might still be alive today."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films'', page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deborah Lipp]], discussing the character's archetype, stated that "in fact [[Western culture]] had, for hundreds of years, associated the idea of powerful, commanding women with witchcraft and evil. That's why, I think, the most interesting women in stories have been villainesses."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipp, ''The Study of Witchcraft: A Guidebook to Advanced Wicca'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Zipes opined that the Queen character is much more complex and "as a figure she is much more fascinating than this dumb, innocent, naïve Snow White. So why not focus on this figure who is tragic in many, many ways. We really don't know too much about her - where she gets her powers. She's mysterious."&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|last=Berkowitz |first=Lana |url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Are-you-Team-Snow-White-or-Team-Evil-Queen-3438997.php |title=Are you Team Snow White or Team Evil Queen? - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Whereas Snow White achieves inner harmony, her stepmother fails to do so. Unable to integrate the [[social]] and the [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] aspects of human nature, she remains enslaved to her desires and gets caught up in an [[Oedipus|Oedipal]] competition with her daughter from which she cannot extricate herself. This imbalance between her contradictory drives proves to be her undoing.&lt;ref name=theory/&gt;|source=[[Bruno Bettelheim]]|width=25%|}}

[[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]] regard Snow White and her mother/stepmother as two female [[stereotype]]s, the angel and the monster.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; The fact that the Queen was Snow White's biological mother in the first version of the Grimms' story has led several psychoanalytic critics to interpret "Snow White" as a story about repressed [[Oedipus complex]], or about Snow White's [[Electra complex]].&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] opined that the three "temptations" all "testify to a mutual sexual attraction between Snow White and her stepmother."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sale, ''Fairy Tales and After: From Snow White to E.B. White'', page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bruno Bettelheim]], the story's main motif is "the clash of sexual innocence and sexual desire"&lt;ref name=theory&gt;Henk De Berg, ''Freud's Theory and Its Use in Literary and Cultural Studies: An Introduction'', pages 102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cashdan wrote that the Queen's "incessant query, 'Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?' literally reflects her fear that the king will find Snow White more appealing than her. It thus is the implicit sexual struggle between the young girl and the queen."&lt;ref name=witch/&gt; This struggle is so dominating the psychological landscape of the tale, that Gilber and Gubar even proposed renaming the story "Snow White and Her Wicked Stepmother".&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tatar |first=Maria |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/06/snow-white-and-the-huntsman-and-fairy-tales.html |title=A Brief History of Snow White |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bettelheim, "only the death of the jealous queen (the elimination of all outer and inner turbulence) can make for a happy world."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Bettelheim, ''The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cashdan opined "the death of the witch signals a victory of virtue over vice, a sign that positive forces in the self have prevailed," and "the active involvement of heroine in the witch's demise communicates to readers that they must take an active role in overcoming their own errant tendencies." The evil queen "embodies [[narcissism]], and the young princess, with whom readers identify, embodies parts of the child struggling to overcome this tendency. Vanquishing the queen represents a triumph of positive forces in the self over vain impulses." According to Cashdan, "her death constitutes the emotional core of the tale" as the story could easily end with the resurrection of Snow White, "but there is one detail that needs to be resolved: the wicked queen is still alive. Her continued existence means not only that Snow White's life remains in jeopardy, but that the princess is apt to be plagued by vain temptations for the rest of her days. Unless the evil woman is eliminated once and for all, Snow White will never be free."&lt;ref name=witch&gt;Sheldon Cashdan, ''The Witch Must Die: The Hidden Meaning of Fairy Tales'', pages 11, 15, 35-37, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the psychologist Betsy Cohen wrote that "in order to avoid becoming a wicked queen herself, Snow White needs to separate from and kill off this destructive force inside of her. The death of the wicked queen allows Snow White to truly celebrate her marriage, the bringing together of herself." Cohen further wrote that "the queen was forced to face her own mortality, the inevitability of death. As Snow White rids herself of her envious stepmother, she is, at the same time, next in line to become a mother herself—more able, we hope, to deal with envy than her stepmother had been."&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Cohen, ''The Snow White Syndrome: All About Envy'', pages 6, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the manner of the Queen's execution, Jo Eldridge Carney, Professor of English at [[The College of New Jersey]], wrote: "Again, the fairy tale's system of punishment is horrific but apt: a woman so actively consumed with seeking affirmation from others and with violently undoing her rival is forced to enact her own physical destruction as a public spectacle."&lt;ref&gt;Jo Eldridge Carney, ''Fairy Tale Queens: Representations of Early Modern Queenship'', page 94.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheldon Donald Haase, Professor of German, and Associate Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at [[Wayne State University]], "a measure of justice is achieved" with "the sadistic punishment to some extent fitting the crime. The glowing shoes, an appropriate symbol for her own unbridled envy, bring about her final demise."&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;Donald Haase, ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', pages 777-778, 885.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Mary Ayers of the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] wrote that the red-hot shoes symbolise that the Queen was "subjected to the effects of her own inflamed, searing hot envy and hatred."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ayers, ''Mother-Infant Attachement and Psychoanalysis: The Eyes of Shame'', page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted that this ending echoes the fairy tale of "[[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|The Red Shoes]]", which similarly "warns of the danger of attachment to appearances."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Halprin, ''Look at My Ugly Face!: Myths and Musings on Beauty and Other Perilous Obsessions With Women's Appearance'', page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=Should we cheer on Snow White's wicked stepmother as she dances to her death in red-hot iron shoes?

John Hanson Saunders of the [[Pennsylvania State University]] wrote that the Queen's "rather barbaric...torture and death gives closure to the reader and the death seems more fitting...Her death can provide justice and allows the audience to see good triumph over evil."&lt;ref&gt;John Hanson Saunders, ''The Evolution of Snow White: A Close Textual Analysis of Three Versions of the Snow White Fairy Tale'', pages 71-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Cashdan argued that, from a psychological viewpoint, the Queen could not flee or get merely locked up in a dungeon or exiled, as the story has portrayed her "as a thoroughly despicable creature who deserves the worst conceivable punishment." Furthermore, he claims "such a horrible death" is necessary because, like in several other fairy tales, "if the witch is to die — and remain dead — she must die in a way that makes her return highly unlikely," and so "the reader needs to know that the death of the witch is thorough and complete, even if it means exposing young readers to acts of violence that are extreme by contemporary standards."&lt;ref name=witch/&gt; On the other hand, Oliver Madox Hueffer wrote that "it is impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with this unfortunate royal lady in her subsequent fate."&lt;ref name=book/&gt; According to Sharna Olfman, Professor of Psychology at the [[Point Park University]], "when reading or listening to stories, children aren't assaulted with precreated graphic visual imagery. They don't have to see close-ups of...the agony of pain in the queen's eyes as she dances to her death." Nevertheless, Olfman's personal preference is to "skip the torture scenes when I read these stories to kids."&lt;ref&gt;Sharna Olfman, ''The Sexualization of Childhood'', page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Burgess]] commented: "Reading that, how seriously can we take it? It is fairy-tale violence, which is not like real mugging, terrorism and [[Dirty War|Argentinean torture]]."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Magazine'' issue of 21 November 1983, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clear}}

The character was portrayed in a variety of ways in the subsequent adaptations and reimaginations of the classic fairy tale. According to Lana Berkowitz of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', "Today stereotypes of the evil queen and innocent Snow White often are challenged. Rewrites may show the queen is reacting to [[extenuating circumstances]]."&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; Scott Meslow of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted that "[[Walt Disney|Disney]]'s decision to throw out the Grimms's appropriately grim ending—which sentences the evil queen to dance in heated iron shoes until her death—has meant that ending is all but forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutler |first=David |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/snow-whites-strange-cinematic-history/255222/ |title=Snow White's Strange Cinematic History - Scott Meslow |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wasn’t very efficient – it took her three tries to kill Snow White, for example. And I had read [[Barbara Comyns]]’ ''The Juniper Tree'', which is a retelling of the fairy tale from the perspective of the wicked stepmother, as well, so I began to see a way that I could do it for myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/03/25/dwarfing-snow-white-a-qa-with-helen-oyeyemi/ |title=Dwarfing Snow White: A Q&amp;A with Helen Oyeyemi &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=Arts.nationalpost.com |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' 2014 prequel, ''Fairest'' tells the story of Levana's descent to evil, which begins when she is fifteen years old and covers the next ten years of her life. Meyer said: "In the fairy tale, she has the mirror, and I did a lot with mirrors and played with that element and that concept of what could make a woman so vain that she would commit unspeakable evil to remain the most beautiful woman in her country? I took all of that from that fairy tale and twisted it to match the world of ''The Lunar Chronicles''. (...) Some people are very sympathetic toward her and feel like they really have come to understand and pity her. Other readers are like, 'No, she's frickin' crazy.' I personally have always had a great deal of sympathy for her knowing the things she's gone through."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/life/books/2014/06/16/marissa-meyer-fairest-book-exclusive/10573961/ |title=Book Buzz: Meyer's 'Fairest' delves into evil |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Queen laughs off her magic mirror's answer, claiming that people go through cycles and that it is impossible to challenge the will of nature. The story suggests that the traditional version of the tale was actually invented by the exiled and crazed huntsman, now imprisoned in a distant country. In the preface, Walker wrote: "Snow White's stepmother seems to have been vilified because (a) she resented being less beautiful than Snow White, and (b) she practiced witchcraft. One might suspect that female beauty was really a larger issue for men than for women, because male sexual response depends to a considerable degree on visual clues. (...) A queen who was also a witch would have been a formidable figure, adding political influence to spiritual mana. Snow White's stepmother therefore seems to me a projection of male jealousies. As re-envisioned in this story, she may seem more true to life."&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Fairy Tales'', page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Ravenna is depicted as scheming and power-hungry as well as vain. She kills the King on their wedding night, so her animosity toward Snow White is not rooted in competition for the King's favor. Rather, the Queen Ravenna fears that Snow White will challenge her rule over the kingdom. Queen Ravenna's obsession with power and beauty is explained by a reference to childhood trauma, in which her mother tells her that beauty is a weapon to be used for protection; additionally, the strength of her powers seems to correlate to her appearance, and both begin to fade as Snow White comes into her own. In fact, Queen Ravenna's mother is seen casting a spell on a young Queen Ravenna as men sworn to an unnamed king appear, presumably to raid the small settlement in which Queen Ravenna and her brother, who is also an antagonist in the film, reside. This iteration of her Magic Mirror assures her that the only way to render her powers and her youth permanent is to consume Snow White's heart. She is destroyed by the Huntsman-trained Snow White in the final duel. Director [[Rupert Sanders]] said: "It was very important that we didn’t have a terrible cut-out villain. We had someone who was doing evil things from a fear and weakness. I think it is important that you do sympathize with her to a degree, but also really understand why she is the person she’s become because she wasn’t born evil. It was a journey for her to become evil, and I think it was very important to myself and Charlize Theron to play a realistic version of the queen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/interview-director-rupert-sanders-talks-snow-white-and-the-huntsman |title=Interview: "Snow White And The Huntsman" Director Rupert Sanders Talks Dark Fairy Tales &amp; Kristen Stewart's Toughness |publisher=Complex |date=2012-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron said about the character: "At first, I didn't really understand why she was evil or losing her mind, but once I understood that it wasn't just the fact that her mortality relied upon finding Snow White, and that knowing that and not being able to do anything and being stuck in a castle. Well, I think that would be maddening for somebody like her.

At the film's conclusion, Ravenna is revealed to have hidden part of herself in the Mirror, allowing her to be restored to life when Freya tries to claim its power, but this backfires when Ravenna reveals that she was responsible for the death of Freya's daughter out of jealousy, prompting Freya to aid the Huntsman in destroying the mirror and thus apparently killing Ravenna (Although a golden raven flying away hints that a part of the Mirror, and thus Ravenna, may have survived).
*''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'': The Queen, usually known as the Evil Queen or the Wicked Queen, is the villain in the 1937 [[Disney]] animated film. This version of the character was sometimes referred to as '''[[Queen Grimhilde]]''' in Disney publications of the 1930s, and was originally voiced by [[Lucille La Verne]]. The film's Queen, in the form of an old witch, falls to her death after poisoning [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]. In the film, similar to the [[Brothers Grimm]] story, the Queen is cold, cruel, and extremely vain, and obsessively desires to remain the "fairest in the land". She becomes madly envious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, as well as the attentions of the Prince from another land; such love triangle element is one of Disney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly caused by the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. The film's version of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually transform herself into an old woman instead of just taking a disguise like in the Grimms' story; this appearance of hers is commonly referred to as the '''Wicked Witch''' or alternatively as the '''Old Hag''' or just the '''Witch'''. The film's version of the Queen was created by [[Walt Disney]] and [[Joe Grant]], and originally animated by [[Art Babbit]] and voiced by [[Lucille La Verne]]. Inspiration for her design came from several sources, including the characters of Queen Hash-a-Motep from ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' and Princess [[Kriemhild]] from ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', as well as actresses such as [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gale Sondergaard]]. The Queen has since been voiced by [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Louise Chamis]] and [[Susanne Blakeslee]], and was portrayed live by [[Anne Francine]], [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Olivia Wilde]], and in alternative versions, by [[Lana Parrilla]] (''[[Evil Queen (Once Upon a Time)|Once Upon a Time]]'') and [[Kathy Najimy]] (''Descendants''). This interpretation of the classic fairy tale character has been very well received by film critics and general public, often being considered one of Disney's most iconic and menacing villains. Besides in the film, the Evil Queen has made numerous appearances in Disney attractions and productions, including not only these directly related to the tale of Snow White, such as ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', sometimes appearing in them alongside [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. The film's version of the Queen has also become a popular archetype that influenced a number of artists and non-Disney works.

Queen Elspeth grows jealous of her stepdaughter Snow White when told by her mirror that her stepdaughter, the princess Snow White, is now fairer than her. She also comes to desire the Prince named Alfred and envies his affections for her stepdaughter Snow White.

The nanny has a heart attack after looking into a mirror she and Lily find in the Lady's room. By the time Lily is a teenager, she and her stepmother's relationship has not warmed although they are civil to one another. By the ninth year of her marriage to Lord Hoffman, the Lady is finally pregnant with a son. The night of the celebratory dance the Lady Claudia is enraged by Lily and suffers such a severe rush of stress that she collapses and goes into childbirth and the baby is stillborn. Driven mad by grief, she turns to her magic mirror for reassurance, but sees her reflection distorted and deformed. The mirror blames Lily for the baby's death. Claudia plots her stepdaughter's assassination. Lily goes to play in the forest, and Claudia sends her mute, inbred brother to kill her. When she escapes, the brother kills a pig and gives the Lady Claudia the organs as proof of Lily's death. Claudia serves part of the organs as a stew which she eats with cannibalistic relish. When her mirror tells her that her stepdaughter is alive, she uses black magic to murder her brother. The Lady Claudia learns Lily's whereabouts from her ravens and attempts to kill her and the seven miners with whom Lily hides. She first buries a bird in the falling sand of an hourglass to cause a cave-in at the mine, killing a miner, Father Gilbert. Later she pushes over her husband's statues of the Saints to make the trees in the miner's forest home fall over, killing another miner, Lawrence. Finally, she takes her mirror's advice to kill Lily with [[Satan|the Serpent's]] fruit: the poison apple. Using the black magic to disguise herself as an old hag, Claudia poisons Lily with the poison apple, placing her in a coma. When Lily at last is healed, she, Gutenberg, and Will, the chief miner, confront Claudia. A fight ensues during which a fire breaks out. Lily ultimately kills her stepmother by stabbing her image in the mirror, causing Claudia to rapidly age.

Otto drives Willa into the forest where she takes refuge with a traveling medicine show sells her "Chief Tonka's Elixir of Life", a highly alcoholic potion that is supposed to reverse aging. Consumed by madness, Regina kills Otto then almost kills Willa, who is playing Snow White in a theater, but the girl is ironically saved by the false medicine and subsequently cast in a moving picture. A demented Regina interrupts the picture and drinks from the Elixir of Life before throwing it over near some candles, perhaps inadvertently setting fire to the stage and herself. Dr. Tonker who claims to have seen Regina perform Juliet in a Brooklyn theatre says that she was described as "the Tragic Queen" and "could bring an audience to its feet" adding that she serves as a cautionary tale against "the corrosive effects of fame and fortune."

There, she reveals to them her tragic story. Her real name was '''Evly''', and she was once in love with, and engaged to, a man named Mira. When Evly refused to comply with the wishes of [[Sleeping Beauty|an evil enchantress]], he was cursed to be trapped inside a mirror. Evly sought her revenge by killing the enchantress but there was no way for her to break the curse.

Evly then snaked her way up to the throne of the Northern Kingdom, killing Snow White's mother and marrying the King. Mira's condition began to deteriorate until he became a bland reflection, and he became enamored with Snow White rather than the Queen. This enraged her and made her order the Huntsman to kill Snow White.

Seeing Snow White dead, the giants attack the Queen's castle. The Queen tries to fend them off with lightnings and summons seven demons to fight them. One of the giants, Hicker, begins hiccuping and causes an earthquake and the magic mirror that is the source of the Queen's life and power is shattered and she is destroyed. With the Queen's final defeat, her spells are broken and all her victims are returned to life.

===Inspired characters===
{{further|Evil Queen (Disney)#Influence}}

[[File:Monica Bellucci, Women's World Awards 2009 c.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Monica Bellucci]] in 2009]]

*''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'': In [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 2005 fantasy film, [[Monica Bellucci]] plays a villainous character similar to the Queen. Known as the Thuringian Queen (or Mirror Queen) she is extremely vain, obsessed with preserving her youth and beauty and being the fairest in the land, an ideology which backfires when she acquires a spell for eternal ''life'' that does not grant her eternal ''youth.''
*''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'': The villain of the Disney film ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' (2007), named Queen Narissa and played by [[Susan Sarandon]], while not actually being the Evil Queen from the Snow White's story, is also heavily influenced by the character and also by [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (Early on in the project, the film was supposed to be an animated sequel to Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in which Narissa was the Evil Queen's sister who would kidnap six of the dwarfs to lure Snow White, the Prince, and their 13-year-old daughter Rose, aided by Dopey, into a trap).
*''[[Fantaghirò]]'': [[Brigitte Nielsen]] said she has based her role as the Black Witch ("more than a witch, a queen") in the 1992 film ''[[Fantaghirò 2]]'' on Disney's Evil Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/agosto/28/cattiva_inseguo_sempre_TV_co_0_92082810034.shtml |title=la cattiva: inseguo sempre la TV |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'': In this science fiction film, the Queen figure is "a higher-evolved being known as the Queen of the Universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-cast-story-2014/ |title=Wachowskis Begin Filming 'Jupiter Ascending'; Official Synopsis Released |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Legends: The Enchanted]]'': The main antagonist in this 2007 cyberpunk fantasy graphic novel is an old hag witch trying to free her beautiful sister from being imprisoned in a mirror. The story also features various other classic fairytale characters such as [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Rapunzel]], but not Snow White.
*''[[Sailor Moon]]'': One of the main antagonists in the 1990s manga and anime series, Queen Nehellenia is based on many evil sorceresses from fairy tales, with a particular emphasis on the Evil Queen from Snow White and the [[The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]]. Like the [[The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]] and the Evil Queen, she has a large magic mirror and like the latter she is very vain and arrogant.
*''[[The Serpent's Shadow (Lackey novel)|The Serpent Shadow]]'': The character was an inspiration for Shivani, the evil identical twin sister of the late mother of Maya Witherspoon, the main character in 2001's ''The Serpent's Shadow'', second part of the ''[[Elemental Masters]]'' reimagined fairy tales by [[Mercedes Lackey]]. This story takes place in the London of 1909 and Maya's mother Surya was an Indian sorceress (but not evil), whose seven pet servants/friends take the place of Snow White's dwarf protectors in the story.
*''[[Stardust (novel)|Stardust]]'': Talking about his 1999 novel, Neil Gaiman said that "Snow White" has left him "with a fondness for wicked and magnificent witch-queens" and that is probably why he put one (Lamia) in this book.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Datlow, ''A Wolf at the Door: And Other Retold Fairy Tales'', page 34&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood]]'': In this 1962 film, the Queen Witch (Reina Bruja) is the mistress of all evil and the queen of all monsters in the world. She looks similar to the Disney version of the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' but has a green face like [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' and dies when the [[Little Red Riding Hood]] tricks her to fall into a furnace-like shrine of the Devil at her castle.
*''Vivien and Time'': Vivien in [[W. B. Yeats]]'s 1884 (albeit published only after his death) verse play ''Vivien and Time'', based on his own poem "Time and the Witch Vivien", was inspired by the Queen of Snow White and even asks the mirror who is the fairest of them all.

'''Forkhead box protein P2''' ('''FOXP2''') is a [[protein]] that, in humans, is encoded by the ''FOXP2'' [[gene]], also known as ''CAGH44'', ''SPCH1'' or ''TNRC10'', and is required for proper development of speech and language.&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lai CS, Fisher SE, Hurst JA, Vargha-Khadem F, Monaco AP | title = A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6855 | pages = 519–23 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11586359 | doi = 10.1038/35097076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene is shared with many vertebrates, where it generally plays a role in communication (for instance, the development of [[bird song]]).

== Discovery ==
''FOXP2'' and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an English family known as the [[KE family]], half of whom (fifteen individuals across three generations) suffered from a speech and language disorder called [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]]. Their case was studied at the [[UCL Institute of Child Health|Institute of Child Health of University College London]].&lt;ref name = "pmid2332125"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst JA, Baraitser M, Auger E, Graham F, Norell S | title = An extended family with a dominantly inherited speech disorder | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 352–5 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2332125 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16948.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 [[Myrna Gopnik]], Professor of Linguistics at [[McGill University]], reported that the disorder-affected KE family had severe speech impediment with incomprehensible talk, largely characterized by grammatical deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gopnik M | title = Genetic basis of grammar defect | journal = Nature | volume = 347 | issue = 6288 | pages = 26 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2395458 | doi = 10.1038/347026a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She hypothesized that the basis was not of learning or cognitive disability, but due to genetic factors affecting mainly grammatical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gopnik M | title = Feature-blind grammar and dysphagia | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268 | pages = 715 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2330028 | doi = 10.1038/344715a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her hypothesis led to a popularised existence of "grammar gene" and a controversial notion of grammar-specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona| name-list-format = vanc |title=What's Within?: Nativism Reconsidered|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, US|isbn=978-0-1951-5978-3|pages=290–291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb1pvz1JhQYC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Lyle| name-list-format = vanc |title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the Biology of Language|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-5210-0391-9|pages=98–99|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2AN2f6GPFQC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1995, the [[University of Oxford]] and the Institute of Child Health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargha-Khadem F, Watkins K, Alcock K, Fletcher P, Passingham R | title = Praxic and nonverbal cognitive deficits in a large family with a genetically transmitted speech and language disorder | journal = Proc.

This is one of the few known examples of [[Mendelian]] (monogenic) inheritance for a disorder affecting speech and language skills, which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors.&lt;ref name = "pmid12524432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher SE, Lai CS, Monaco AP | title = Deciphering the genetic basis of speech and language disorders | journal = Annu.

In 1998, Oxford University geneticists [[Simon Fisher]], [[Anthony Monaco]], Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and [[Faraneh Vargha-Khadem]] identified an autosomal dominant monogenic inheritance that is localized on a small region of [[chromosome 7]] from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members.&lt;ref name="pmid9462748"/&gt; The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genes that are essential for speech|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_10/d_10_m/d_10_m_lan/d_10_m_lan.html|website=The Brain from Top to Bottom|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locus was given the official name "SPCH1" (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] clones.&lt;ref name="pmid10880297"/&gt; Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family, but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.&lt;ref name="pmid10880297"/&gt;

In 2001, the team identified in CS that the mutation is in the middle of a protein-coding gene.&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"/&gt; Using a combination of [[bioinformatics]] and [[RNA]] analyses, they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the [[forkhead-box]] (FOX) group of [[transcription factors]]. As such, it was assigned with the official name of FOXP2.

''FOXP2'' is expressed in many areas of the brain&lt;ref name="pmid12192408"/&gt; including the [[basal ganglia]] and inferior [[frontal cortex]] where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development.&lt;ref name="pmid17999357"/&gt;

A knockout mouse model has been used to examine ''FOXP2'''s role in brain development and how mutations in the two copies of ''FOXP2'' affect vocalization.

There are several abnormalities linked to ''FOXP2''.

There is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the ''FOXP2'' gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal/ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.

Levels of ''FOXP2'' in adult zebra finches are significantly higher when males direct their song to females than when they sing song in other contexts.&lt;ref name="Teramitsu 2006"/&gt; “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarvis ED, Scharff C, Grossman MR, Ramos JA, Nottebohm F | title = For whom the bird sings: context-dependent gene expression | journal = Neuron | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 775–88 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9808464 | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80594-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that FoxP2 levels vary depending on the social context. When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teramitsu I, White SA | title = FoxP2 regulation during undirected singing in adult songbirds | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 28 | pages = 7390–4 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16837586 | pmc = 2683919 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1662-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in ''FOXP2'' [[gene expression]], rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the ''FOXP2'' protein.

''FOXP2'' also has possible implications in the development of [[bat]] [[animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="Preuss 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17878935"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li G, Wang J, Rossiter SJ, Jones G, Zhang S |title=Accelerated FoxP2 evolution in echolocating bats |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e900 |year=2007 |pmid=17878935 |pmc=1976393 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000900 |editor1-last=Ellegren |editor1-first=Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilbrecht 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilbrecht L, Nottebohm F |title=Vocal learning in birds and humans |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=135–48 |year=2003 |pmid=12953292 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Far-Right subcultures''' refers to the symbolism, values and traits that hold relevance to various politically extreme right-wing groups and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patyi|first1=Peter|last2=Levická|first2=Jana|title=Attractiveness of Right Wing Oriented Movements and Subcultures in Modern Society of the Slovak Republic|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2014|volume=143|pages=832–837|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subkulturen {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/category/ressorts/wissen/woran-man-sie-erkennt/subkulturen&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=CCyrWMXaIcGIaLizrZAL|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of subcultures within far-right movements to distinguish: subcultural parasitism, subcultural creation around ideology and subcultures that are networking with far-right movements, as some football hooligans did with neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/new-right-wing-alliance-of-neo-nazis-and-hooligans-appears-in-germany-a-1000953.html|title=Germany's New Right: The Unholy Alliance of Neo-Nazis and Football Hooligans - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcultures created around or related to Nazi ideology ==
{{main|Nazi symbolism}}
{{see also|Nazi chic}}

== Subcultural Parasitism ==

[[Image:Neo-Nazi Skinhead.jpg|thumb|left|A neo-Nazi skinhead from Germany]]
Far-right ideologists try to infiltrate subcultures to spread their ideas amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: Rechtsextreme Jugendkultur http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41740/jugendkultur&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts are defined as subcultural parasitism. The probably most known subculture, which got taken over by the far-right and neo-nazis is the [[Skinhead]] scene, which started originally in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Worley, Matthew, and Nigel Copsey. "White youth: the Far Right, Punk and British youth culture." JOMEC Journal 9 (2016): 27-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples for subculture parasitism: the [[Nipster]], infiltration of the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)]] by neo-nazis (Nazi Hipster), [[Nazi punk]], infiltration of the [[Heavy metal subculture]], known as [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM/NSCH). Subcultures as the [[Goth subculture]] and the [[Hip Hop]] subculture got also infiltrated by far-right movements and ideologists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other examples for far-right or neo-Nazi subcultures: [[Esoteric Nazism]] and [[Nazi Satanism]].

[[File:Bussines berlin 2003.jpg|200px|thumb|British [[punk rock]] band [[The Business (band)|The Business]] performs in [[Berlin, Germany]] in 2003.]]

== Cultural counter-subversion ==
There is another strategy of neo-nazis and far right movements, that is called cultural subversion. This strategy uses already existing forms of expression and organization and fills them with far right meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/service/lexikon/k/kulturelle-subversion|title=Kulturelle Subversion - Mut Gegen Rechte Gewalt|website=www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples: 
*Music: use of already existing songs and the change of its lyrics into something national or racist 
*Slogans: the change of the left-wing slogan 'Long live the international solidarity' into 'Long live the national solidarity'
*Forms of Organization: democratic forms of organizations are copied and accommodated with far right ideology

== Modern forms of far-right subcultures and lifestyles in specific countries ==
=== Italy ===
During the regime the [[National Fascist Party]] heavily influenced fashion in the pursuit for autarchy and the importance of aesthetics and symbolism: clothes had to be produced in Italy and had to reflect the values of the Italian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=- la Repubblica.it|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/10/30/moda-autarchica-vestiti-di-regime-della.htmlhttp://mda-arte.blogspot.it/2012/09/mussolini-il-fascismo-e-la-moda.html|website=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of clothing such as the '''black shirts''' became associated with the dreaded [[Blackshirts|Volunteer Militia for the Safety of the Nation]] and even to the regime itself. 
Nowadays [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascists]] still care a great deal about clothing, but with different approaches. Symbols and clothes like the [[Celtic Cross]] and the black clothing are still present and associated to the new filo-fascists political parties and movements, but, similarly to the neo-nazism case, there has also been a growing interest in "trendiness" and fashion, with new clothing brands that offer casual and formal clothing more in line with today's consumerist culture. This has led to three different types of brands usage by the neo-fascist subculture that still cares a big deal about clothing as a way to show their political affiliation, while caring about what is trendy as well:
* The use of brands that are not openly using symbols of fascism but that are thought to be targeting neo-fascist consumers in light of their choices in advertising and partnerships, with the choice of testimonials, models, settings and even copy material that recalls the neo-fascist archetypical man. For example, Pivert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pivert, l'hanno ribattezzata 'linea di abbigliamento fascista'. Il responsabile: "Non è così ma ai ragazzi di CasaPound piace"|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/01/26/pivert-lhanno-ribattezzata-linea-di-abbigliamento-fascista-il-responsabile-non-e-cosi-ma-ai-ragazzi-di-casapound-piace/2405761/|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that while denying any political involvement (the apology of fascism in Italy is a felony officially) heavily rely on the fascist's regime icons, using symbols, mottos and images without using the name of the party while still making clear what is their political affiliation. An example is the decimaofficialstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Natale rivive l’abbigliamento fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2014/12/22/news/per-natale-rivive-l-abbigliamento-fascista-1.192927|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that are arbitrarily given a power of identification with their political values by the members of the subculture itself.

[[File:Neo-Nazi celtic cross flag.svg|thumb|[[Celtic cross]] on a Neo-Fascist flag]]

The arbitrary appropriation of modern devices of today's [[consumer culture]] in addition to the ones typical of its "ancestor" in Neo-fascism is not just limited to fashion, examples of modern culture products that were not born with this political affiliation but were used by neo-fascists to frame their values and the adherence of its affiliates to them are [[Tolkien]]'s novels, which led to the "Campi Hobbit" (Hobbit Camps) experience: real political camps where space was given to topics often overlooked by typical political institutions, with right wing music groups, visual artists, radio podcasts performances and social issues discussions about topics such as young people's unemployment together with paramilitary activities being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Repubblica 08 giugno 2007|url=http://www.compagniadellanello.net/rassegna/repubblica_08_06_07.htm|website=www.compagniadellanello.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another very famous example is the politicization of [[Association football|football]], with the [[Ultras]] groups often affiliated with certain ideologies. The majority of ultras groups in fact present small "bands" within them that are openly neo-fascist or at least far-right extremists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osservatoriosport.interno.gov.it/allegati/rapporto_2015_versione_stampabile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with groups such as Hellas Verona's "Brigate Gialloblu" or Juventus' "Vikings" having an infamous record of violence episodes, which are not related to the sport nor their supported teams' ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcio, la piaga nera del tifo fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2016/07/11/news/calcio-la-piaga-nera-del-tifo-fascista-1.276905|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|Far right in Germany}}
{{category see also|Neo-Nazism in Germany}}

==== Far right Organisations und Formations in Germany ====
*Far right parties: East-Germany: [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD); West-Germany: 'Die Rechte' and 'Dritter Weg'. All together there are around 6000 members of far right parties in Germany.
*Extreme right-wing comradeships: [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network (or 'White Power'). Both networks are primarily selling extreme right-wing music and organizing international concerts. Their offers play an important role regarding the far right Lifestyle and they have an integrating effect on the far right scene in general. The [[Autonome Nationalisten]] are a similar organization, for predominantly young far right. The ideology is the same but in terms of aesthetics, they are more orientated towards their political opponent on the left and copy their lifestyles and symbols for their own purposes. See also Cultural Subversion
*Intellectuals of the 'Neue Rechte' ([[New Right]]): they function as the source of inspiration and keyword transmitter. 
*Far-right projects: An innovation of the last years are far right projects at the interface of virtual and real life. Examples are the 'Identitären' ([[Identitarian movement]]) and the 'Unsterblichen'. The 'Unsterblichen' was started by far rights in east Germany. They formulated the prosecution of the supposed 'Volkstods' (death of the nation). Which can be seen as relation to the demographic change in Germany and the  fear of being swamped by foreign influences. The 'Unsterblichen' took over the flashmob idea and produced high quality choreographies for demonstrations which they filmed professionally and distributed them with music in social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borstel|first1=Dierk|title=Ungleichwertigkeitsideologien in der Einwanderungsgesellschaft|date=2017|publisher=Springer Fachmedien|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=978-3-658-14245-2|pages=153–164|edition=Borstel, Dierk; Bozay, Kemal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Identitarian movement ====
''Main Article'': [[Identitarian movement|Identitarian Movement]]

The Identitarian movement is one of the most renowned far-right youth culture in Germany and part of the [[New Right]]. Within the New Right it has four unique position features: youthfulness,  excessive desire for action, pop culture and [[Corporate Identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Julian|last2=Glösel|first2=Kathrin|last3=Strobl|first3=Natascha|title=Die Identitären. Handbuch zur Jugendbewegung der Neuen Rechte in Europa.|date=May 2016|publisher=UNRAST|location=Münster|isbn=978-3-89771-560-8|pages=68–69|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The German Identitarian movement uses Facebook as its main platform, where it spreads quotations of famous thinkers of the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] such as Ernst Jünger and Carl Schmitt, articles of the far-right journal ''Sezession'' and videos of various campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Julian|last2=Glösel|first2=Kathrin|last3=Strobl|first3=Natascha|title=Die Identitären. Handbuch zur Jugendbewegung der Neuen Rechte in Europa.|date=May 2016|publisher=UNRAST|location=Münster|isbn=978-3-89771-560-8|page=85|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
''Main Article'': [[Alt-right|Alt-Right]]

==== The American Alt-Right Movement====

Also referred to as the alternative right, the [[alt-right]] is a recent political movement which holds strong views on a wide array of political, cultural, racial and religious subjects, with a central theme being [[white supremacy]] and [[white nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Definitive Source {{!}} Writing about the 'alt-right'|url=https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/writing-about-the-alt-right|website=blog.ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political movement of the American Alternative Right is a political movement that has gained significant prominence since the buildup to the consequent election of [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 US election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/alt-right-a-primer-about-the.html?referrer=https://www.google.it/#.WKQq3BIrKTc|website=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical alt-right supporter is a white US citizen, most likely of a family lineage without recent immigration to the USA. While there are numerous recorded cases of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim behaviour and supporters to be of predominantly Christian background, personal religious disposition does not prove to be of great importance beyond those which are discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michael|first1=George|title=The seeds of the alt-right, America's emergent right-wing populist movement|url=http://theconversation.com/the-seeds-of-the-alt-right-americas-emergent-right-wing-populist-movement-69036|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}}

==== Adoption of Neo-Fascist/Nazi symbolism ====

[[File:Richard B. Spencer in 2016.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Richard B. Spencer speaking at an Alt-Right Rally, 2016]]

Since Donald Trump's victory in November 2016, the exposure and symbolism associated with the alt-right has become more distinct. In mid-November 2016 at an alt-right conference with approximately 200 people in Washington, D.C. One of the speakers at this event was president of the National Policy Institute and white supremacist; [[Richard Spencer (activist)|Richard Spencer]]. Audience members cheered and gave the [[Nazi salute]] when he said, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Joseph|title=Alt-Right Gathering Exults in Trump Election With Nazi-Era Salute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html|website=The New York Times|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel theme of cultural purity combined with the totalitarian and ominous connotations associated with Nazi history provide an aesthetic appeal to the themes and ideas of the alt-right. Due to the highly superficial nature of the group, understanding of the key concepts behind these other far-right political movements is secondary to the imagery and visual culture associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|title=The 2016 culture war, as illustrated by the alt-right|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/30/13572256/2016-trump-culture-war-alt-right-meme|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Far-right subcultures and fashion labels ==
=== Fashion label abuse ===

Fashion label abuse means in this case, far-right movements, use specific labels and connect their ideology. Some prominent examples are [[Lonsdale (clothing)|Lonsdale]], [[Fred Perry]] and [[New Balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/fashion-labels-worn-by-europes-skinheads-restore-their-reputation/a-5226933|title=Fashion labels worn by Europe's skinheads restore their reputation - Culture - DW - 16.02.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British sport label Lonsdale became popular in the German neo-nazi movement because of the letters 'NSDA' in the name, which refers to the National Socialist German Workers' Party ([[NSDAP]], [[Nazi Party]]), that was active between 1920 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lonsdale {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/lonsdale|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Fred Perry can be explained through the demand in the skinhead scene. On top of that the brand offers polo shirts with a collar in the colors black-white-red, which was the flag color used by the nazi regime and is therefore as well prominent in German neo-nazi movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred Perry {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/fred-perry|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both brands distance themselves from any association. In November 2016 Matthew LeBretton, New Balance's vice president of public affairs, criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, that the Obama administration led and [[Donald Trump]] opposes. After New Balance defended its opposition to TTP, Andrew Anglin, publisher of the American [[neo-nazi]] news and commentary website [[The Daily Stormer]], declared New Balance the “Official Shoes of White People”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We live in crazy times: Neo-Nazis have declared New Balance the ‘Official Shoes of White People’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/the-crazy-reason-neo-nazis-have-declared-new-balance-the-official-shoes-of-white-people/|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion label creation around far-right ideology ===

There are also fashion labels that got created for neo-nazis, by neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/marken-der-rechtsextremen-szene |title=Marken der rechtsextremen Szene |date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Netz-gegen-Nazis.de| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples for nazi fashion labels: Ansgar Aryan, Consdaple, Eric and Sons, Masterrace Europe, Outlaw, Reconquista, Rizist, Thor Steinar, Troublemaker, Dryve by Suizhyde, Greifvogel Wear, Hate-Hate, Hermannsland, Sport Frei, Pro Violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/marken-die-bei-neonazis-beliebt-sind|title=Marken, die bei Neonazis beliebt sind - Belltower News|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the type of media content}}
'''Fiction''' broadly refers to any [[narrative]] that is derived from the [[imagination]]—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiction fiction]." Merriam-Webster, Incorporated. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sageng, Fossheim, &amp; Larsen (eds.) (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=events+places The Philosophy of Computer Games]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"&gt;William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition).  New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the [[novel]] and [[short story]]), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;M. h. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels, but it may also denote any "[[literature|literary]] narrative" (see [[literary fiction]]),&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition). Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fiction Definition of 'fiction']." ''Oxford English Dictionaries'' (online). Oxford University Press. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[novel]]s, [[novella]]s, and [[short story|short stories]]. More broadly, fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format, including [[writing]]s, [[drama|theatrical performances]], [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[animation]]s, games (most notably, [[video game]]s and [[role-playing game]]s), and so on.

A work of fiction implies the inventive act of [[worldbuilding|constructing an imaginary world]], so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only [[character (arts)|characters]] who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true.&lt;ref name="litfiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farner|first=Geir|year=2014|title=Literary Fiction: The Ways We Read Narrative Literature|chapter=Chapter 2: What is Literary Fiction?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXXHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the context of fiction, generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world, is more open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction|quote=Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity. The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about. Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary [i.e. fictional] works as a function they are given by interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent [[fictional universe]].

Fiction's traditional opposite is [[non-fiction]], a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements, such as [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Iftekharuddin, Frahat (ed.). (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61w4hxtXnFUC&amp;dq The Postmodern Short Story: Forms and Issues]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, fiction includes [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[fables]], [[legend]]s, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[narrative poetry]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] (including [[operas]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[drama]]s, [[puppet play]]s, and [[concert dance|various kinds of theatrical dances]]). However, fiction may also encompass [[comic book]]s, and many [[animated cartoon]]s, [[stop motion]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[fictional film|films]], [[video games]], [[radio drama|radio programs]], [[television program]]s ([[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), etc.

The [[Internet]] has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of [[copyright]] as a means to ensure [[royalties]] are paid to copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Oliver. (2015). "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/09/why-it-is-crucial-that-the-publishing-industry-embrace-fan-fiction.html Why Fan Fiction is the Future of Publishing]."
''The Daily Beast''. The Daily Beast Company LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[digital libraries]] such as [[Project Gutenberg]] make [[public domain]] texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive [[computer game]]s or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for [[fan fiction]] can be found online, where loyal followers of specific [[fictional realm]]s create and distribute derivative stories. The Internet is also used for the development of [[blog fiction]], where a story is delivered through a [[blog]] either as flash fiction or serial [[blog]], and [[collaborative fiction]], where a story is written sequentially by different authors, or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a [[wiki]].

Types of [[literary fiction]] in [[prose]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Milhorn, H. Thomas. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1AM825Ny4v0C&amp;pg Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft]''. Universal Publishers: Boca Raton. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Short story]]: A work of at least 2,000 words but under 7,500 words. The boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (1992). London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novella]]: A work of at least 7,500 words but under 50,000 words. [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) is an example of a [[novella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novel]]: A work of 50,000 words or more.

== Genre fiction ==
{{main|Genre fiction}}

Fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of [[list of fictional genres|genres]]: subsets of fiction, each differentiated by a particular unifying [[Tone (literature)|tone or style]], [[literary technique#literary techniques|narrative technique]], [[content (media)|media content]], or popularly defined criterion. [[Science fiction]], for example, predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]] first land on the moon.

[[Historical fiction]] places imaginary characters into real historical events. In the early historical novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s fictional character Edward Waverley meets a figure from history, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and takes part in the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. Some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story, or a reconstructed biography.&lt;ref name="The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies"/&gt; Often, even when the fictional story is based on fact, there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting. An example is Tim O'Brien's ''[[The Things They Carried]]'', a series of [[short stories]] about the [[Vietnam War]].

Fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural, magical, or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of [[fantasy]], including [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice In Wonderland]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"/&gt;

==Literary fiction==
{{main|Literature|Literary fiction}}

[[Literary fiction]] is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having [[literary merit]], from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].

[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, he suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from 20 October 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', he argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from 14 June 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fiction often involves [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}} In general it focuses on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|pp=181–82}} Usually in literary fiction the focus is on the "inner story" of the characters who drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}} The [[Style (fiction)|style]] of literary fiction is often described as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}} The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}

== Realism{{anchor|Reality_and_fiction}} ==
{{See also|Literary realism}}

Realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic [[setting (narrative)|setting]] (time and location in the world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely [[wikt:alternate universe|imaginary universe]], an [[alternative history]] of the world other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting [[impossible technology]] or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.{{refn|group=note|As philosopher Stacie Friend explains, "in reading we take works of fiction, like works of non-fiction, to be about the real world—even if they invite us to imagine the world to be different from how it actually is. [Thus], imagining a storyworld does not mean directing one's imagining toward something other than the real world; it is instead a mental activity that involves constructing a complex representation of what a story portrays".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Friend |first=Stacie |year=2017 |title=The Real Foundation of Fictional Worlds |url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/13997/1/13997.pdf |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=95 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|The research of Weisberg and Goodstein (2009) revealed that, despite not being specifically informed that, say, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, had two legs, their subjects "consistently assumed that some real-world facts obtained in fiction, although they were sensitive to the kind of fact and the realism of the story."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deena_Weisberg/publication/233656603_What_Belongs_in_a_Fictional_World/links/54aadcd90cf2ce2df668ca52.pdf Weisberg, D.S. &amp; Goodstein, J., "What Belongs in a Fictional World?", ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', Vol. 9, No. 1, (March 2009), pp. 69–78.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of the traditional separation between fiction and [[non-fiction]], the lines are now commonly understood as blurred, showing more overlap than mutual exclusion. Even fiction usually has elements of, or grounding in, truth. The distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience, according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people, places, and events are all historically or factually real, while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], argues that "fiction is both artifice and [[verisimilitude (narrative)|verisimilitude]]", meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James. 2008. ''How Fiction Works.'' New York. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; a notion often encapsulated in poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s term: [[willing suspension of disbelief]]. Also, infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality, provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.&lt;ref name="subversive"/&gt;

The film was released in the United States on October 2, 2015 by [[Scream Factory]].&lt;ref name="ew.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/13/gravy-trailer|title=This exclusive 'Gravy’ trailer teases a Halloween cannibal slumber party - EW.com|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
It's All Hallow's Eve. Anson ([[Michael Weston]]) enters a convenience store where he buys sorbet and flirts with the cashier, Bethany ([[Sarah Silverman]]). Nearby the employees of a Mexican Cantina &amp; Bar, waitress Cricket ([[Molly Ephraim]]), bartender Kerry ([[Sutton Foster]]), cook Yannick ([[Lothaire Bluteau]]), busboy Hector ([[Gabriel Luna]]), manager Chuy ([[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]]), and security guard Winketta ([[Gabourey Sidibe]]) close up the Cantina and have a small party celebrating Kerry, who is leaving to become a [[paramedic]]. As the party wraps up the employees discover the doors have been welded shut and the phone lines are cut. Anson, his brother Stef ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), and Stef's girlfriend Mimi ([[Lily Cole]]) (the latter two having been at a table making out earlier) then appear and quickly take the employees hostage, tying them to chairs. Apparently uninterested in money, their true intentions soon become clear - they are [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadists]] and [[cannibal]]s, who plan to torture and eat the various employees.

Stef soon chains up Yannick in the kitchen to cook the various employees as they are dispatched in different sick and sadistic games. After the trio eat Chuy, Kerry pretends to be romantically interested in Anson to gain his trust, and comes onto him while retrieving a list of items from the pantry for Yannick to cook with.

However while eating Winketta's corpse Stef starts to experience [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]], and realizes Yannick has snuck basil into his food, which he had forbid earlier as he is highly allergic. Examining the list of items he realizes that Yannick used the Army of Portugal [[cipher]] to tell Kerry to bring him basil. While Stef and Yannick start fighting each other, in the other room Hector has managed to free himself and Cricket. Anson and Hector square off upstairs while Cricket and Kerry fight Mimi. Back in the kitchen, after a long battle with both parties sustaining horrible wounds, Stef manages to kill Yannick. Mimi kills Cricket, but Kerry manages to kill her, and just as it appears Hector will kill Anson, Anson kills Hector instead.

Anson and Kerry reunite and head into the kitchen, where Anson sees his brothers condition and learns from Stef that Kerry betrayed him and brought Yannick the basil (Which Kerry confirms, and further tells him her apparent romantic interest in him was a ruse). While Anson holds his brother as he succumbs to his wounds and anaphylaxis, Kerry frees Bert, a random patron who was being kept hostage in the kitchen by Mimi. Together they head upstairs to escape through an opening for an air conditioner. When Anson suddenly runs out of the kitchen attempts to attack Kerry after Stef dies, she manages to shoot him with arrow. Thinking she is safe Kerry crawls out the opening, only for a revived Anson to appear &amp; take a bite out of her leg; however Kerry still manages to escape. Though the fall from the opening kills Bert, Kerry lives and is riding away on a Vespa when she is hit by an ambulance, whose driver happens to be someone she completed paramedic training with. As she is loaded into the ambulance, Kerry panics and notes that Anson (who had been watching from the opening) has disappeared.

Several months later, we see Anson consulting with his brother (who is now a pickled head impaled on a stick) before heading into the convenience store he went to in the beginning of the movie. He visits with Bethany (the clerk) and gives her a single red rose while proposing a romance between them, which Bethany agrees to. As Bethany and Anson share ice cream &amp; flirt, the camera pulls back to reveal Kerry across the street, scarred but alive, taking photos of them. She smiles slyly into the camera before the screen cuts to black.

The '''Havor hoard''' ({{lang-sv|Havorskatten}}) is an [[Iron Age]] treasure found in 1961, in [[Hablingbo]] on the Swedish island of [[Gotland]]. It consists of a large [[gold]] [[torc]], known as the Havor Ring, along with several well-preserved [[bronze]] objects and was buried inside a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze ''[[situla]]'' in the mound surrounding a [[hillfort]].

In 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen from the [[Gotland Museum]]. {{As of|2016}}, it has not been recovered.

== Location ==
The hillfort in the small village of Havor in Hablingbo is located in a meadow about {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} northeast of the main building at ''Stora Havor'' farm. The fort was built more than 2000 years ago during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe|Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. At that time it was situated on the south banks of the lake that later became [[Mästermyr]] mire. The hillfort is surrounded by a round mound or wall {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|7|–|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. On top of the mound, there are traces of a wooden [[palisade]] and outside it are traces of a grave. Close by are also a couple of Iron Age house foundations and in one of these seven [[Denarius|denarii]] minted in 112–192 AD were found. [[Excavation (archaeology)|Archaeological excavations]] of the area in 1961–80, revealed that the site had been continuously inhabited from the [[Bronze Age]] until the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="hoard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hablingbo321"&gt;{{cite web|title=RAÄ-nummer Hablingbo 32:1|url=http://www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html?tab=3&amp;page=1&amp;objektid=10092800320001|website=www.raa.se|publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]]|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The hoard was discovered on the first day&lt;ref name="hoard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nylén|first1=Erik|last2=Lund Hansen|first2=Ulla|last3=Manneke|first3=Peter|title=The Havor hoard: the gold, the bronzes, the fort|date=2005|publisher=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]]|isbn=9174023454|url=http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/the-havor-hoard-the-gold---the-bronzes---the-fort-9789174023459|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an archaeological excavation in April 1961, by a couple of workers who were removing [[sod|turf]] from the mound around the hillfort. The excavation was a relief work project provided by [[Havdhem]] Municipality. Two men found a vessel containing several objects and "something that looked like gold" under a flat stone on the inside of the mound. As there was no archaeologist present that day, they put the stone back and shoveled some dirt over it and continued to dig elsewhere. The next day archaeologists took control of the site and police had to keep press, TV crews and spectators at bay. The excavation supervisor, then archaeology student Peter Manneke, was credited with the find.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vem upptäckte Havorskatten?|trans-title=Who discovered the Havor hoard?|url=http://www.helagotland.se/start/vem-upptackte-havorskatten-7226103.aspx|website=www.helagotland.se|date=12 November 2011|publisher=Helagotland|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manneke phoned his boss, professor Erik Nylén, who was in Stockholm at the time and he immediately flew to Gotland. To guard the find Manneke and Nylén spent the night in sleeping bags by the hoard.&lt;ref name="20years"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geisle.|first1=Gunnar|title=Havorringen gäckar 20 år efter den svarta junidagen|trans-title=The Havor ring still baffels 20 years after the black day in June|url=http://www.helagotland.se/start/havorringen-gackar-20-ar-efter-den-svarta-junidagen-1830142.aspx|date=20 June 2006|website=www.helagotland.se|publisher=Helagotland|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoard was brought to Gotland Museum where it went on public display in the Treasury (''Skattkammaren'') for the next 25 year.&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt; At first it was displayed in a custom built iron case with armored glass and in the mid 1980s it was moved to an ordinary glass alarmed showcase.&lt;ref name="privat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westin|first1=Josefin|title=Privatspanare hoppas hitta Havorringen|trans-title=Private investigators hope to find the Havor ring|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article20208464.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|date=25 January 2015|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Find ==
The find consisted of a large Roman bronze vessel with a handle, a ''situla'',&lt;ref name="gute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="musthefts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamm|first1=Jan Peder|title=Från Vadstena till Havor — om stölder av förhistoriskt guld från svenska museer|trans-title=From Vadstena to Havor — about thefts of prehistoric gold from Swedish museums|journal=[[Fornvännen]]|date=1987|issue=82|pages=184–191|url=http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/2579/1987_184.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which held a large gold torc, four Roman wine cups resembling modern [[tastevin]]s, a bronze strainer and two bronze bells. The hoard was from about 100 AD and all the objects were exceptionally well preserved.&lt;ref name="saga" /&gt; On the handle of the ''situla'' were [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamps]] reading "TOR, CANNIMASUIT, (P CI)PI POLYB and IPI(?)". The two bells were tied together with leather straps into a [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].&lt;ref name="hoard" /&gt;

No official archaeological report was written on the Havor hoard or the excavation of the site at the time of the find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gustafson|first1=Birgitta|title=Havorskatten äntligen på pränt|trans-title=The Havor hoard finally documented|url=http://popark.se/305/nr3-2005.html|website=www.popark.se|publisher=Populär Arkeologi|issue=3|date=2005|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Havor Ring ===
The gold torc, known as the Havor Ring (''Havorringen'') was made in the 1st century. It, along with other neck rings of this kind, were previously believed to be of western [[Celts|Celtic]] or southeast European origin, but it is now concluded that the Havor Ring could have been made in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt; {{As of |2016}}, it is the earliest known well-dated major gold ornament in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Alan|last2=Garnsey|first2=Peter|last3=Cameron|first3=Averil|title=The Crisis of Empire, AD 193-337|date=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=12|series=The Cambridge Ancient History|isbn=0-521-30199-8|page=456|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torc is {{convert|257|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighs close to {{convert|800|g|lb}},&lt;ref name="musthefts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gute"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Enderborg|first1=Bernt|title=Stora Havor|url=http://www.guteinfo.com/?id=2127|website=www.guteinfo.com|publisher=Guteinfo.com|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a gold value of about [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 40,000–50,000 in 2006. However, the value of the neck ring as a historic art object is estimated at tens of million SEK. A copy of it was made for a display at the [[Swedish History Museum]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt;

Because of its size, the torc is considered a unique object. It is too large to be worn by a person and it is believed to have adorned a [[Cult image|statue of a deity]] and was part of a treasure belonging to a temple.&lt;ref name="musthefts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spanare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westin|first1=Josefin|title=Privatspanare hoppas hitta Havorringen|trans-title=Private investigators hope to find the Havor ring|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article20208464.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|date=25 January 2015|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five similar but smaller torcs have been found; one in [[Trollhättan]], one in a [[bog]] on [[Jutland]], two near [[Kiev]] and one at [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]] by the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name="saga"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nylén|first1=Erik|title=Sagan om ringarna|trans-title=The Saga of the rings|journal=[[Fornvännen]]|date=1996|issue=91|pages=1-12|url=http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/2850/1996_001.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ancient&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Alicia|editor1-last=Perea|editor2-first=Ignacio|editor2-last=Montero Ruiz|editor3-first=Óscar|editor3-last=García-Vuelta|title=Ancient gold technology: America and Europe|date=2004|publisher=Editorial CSIC – CSIC Press|isbn=8400082931|page=291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buwX0mi6mFIC&amp;dq|volume=32|series=Anejos de Archivo Español de Arqueología}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Havor Ring is the most richly decorated and technically most complicated of the six torcs with a ring-body made from several twisted gold wires figure-8-shaped [[filigree]] ornamentation on the cones by the claps orbs. The gold wires of the ring section were twisted around a core-rod which was later removed. This made the torc very flexible when opening and closing the clasp mechanism hidden within the front orbs. The cones on the front of the ring are decorated with bullheads and half-moons made of gold sheet, surrounded by small gold grains and twisted gold wires in a filigree pattern.&lt;ref name="saga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ancient" /&gt;

==== Theft ====
On 18{{nbsp}}June 1986, the Havor Ring was stolen during visiting hours from the Gotland Museum. The circumstances of the theft have been described as "mysterious". On that day, the alarm in the Treasury was activated twice. After the first time, at 12{{nbsp}}pm, the antiquarian in charge of security found everything in order and the alarm was reset. At 12:45{{nbsp}}pm the alarm went off again. This time the antiquarian noticed that a latch on the lock was recessed, meaning that the showcase was unlocked, but she did not notice that the torc was gone. She locked the case and reset the alarm again. The theft was discovered at noon the next day. According to the police, the lock had been [[Lock picking|picked]] or opened with a key.&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt;

The police immediately sent out a nationwide alert about the missing torc and contacted [[Interpol]]. A SEK 25,000 reward was offered for information leading to the recovery of the neck ring. A young man who had been seen in the Treasury was suspected of the theft, but he was never found. In the late 1990s, the crime was investigated on the Swedish TV show ''[[Efterlyst]]'' ("''Wanted''"). Several persons have been interviewed and investigated about the crime over the years but without results. The theft is now [[Statute of limitations|prescribed]] but even if the police have no ongoing investigation about it, tips from the public are still coming into the [[Visby]] police department.&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt; Since 2015, two private investigators have been looking for the torc; a former [[Espionage|intelligence agent]] and a [[Forensic science|forensic scientist]], both retired. Their focus has been on a former employee at the museum – a now deceased archaeologist who was convicted of multiple antiquities thefts and sentenced to psychiatric care after having been diagnosed with [[kleptomania]].&lt;ref name="privat" /&gt;

About a year after the theft, a copy of the torc was made from the copy at the History Museum. {{As of|2016}}, that second copy is displayed in the Gotland Museum along with the bronze objects from the hoard.&lt;ref name="20years" /&gt;

The '''Hobbesian trap''' (or '''Schelling's dilemma''') is a theory that explains why [[preemptive strike]]s occur between two groups, out of bilateral fear of an imminent attack. Without outside influences this situation will lead to a fear spiral ([[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]], [[vicious circle]], [[Nash equilibrium]]) in which fear will lead to an [[arms race]] which in turn will lead to increasing fear. The Hobbesian trap can be explained in terms of [[game theory]]. Although cooperation would be the better outcome for both sides, mutual distrust leads to the adoption of strategies that have negative outcomes for individual players and all players combined.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baliga|first=Sandeep|author2=Tomas Sjöström|title=The Hobbesian Trap|date=2010-09-21|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/baliga/htm/hobbesiantrap.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used to explain outbreaks of conflicts and violence, spanning from individuals to states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.|publisher=Penguin Group USA|isbn=978-0143122012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theory is most commonly associated with [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Thomas Schelling]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] is a proponent of the theory of the Hobbesian trap and has applied the theory to many conflicts and outbreaks of violence between people, groups, tribes, societies and states.&lt;ref name="Pinker BAooN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker TBS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0142003343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of gun control have been described as a Hobbesian trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |title=The Gun Craze |last=Ocampo |first=Dan |date=December 16, 2012 |website= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419014702/http://danseconpolicy.blog.com/2012/12/16/the-gun-craze/ |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is the dilemma that both the armed burglar and the armed homeowner face when they meet each other. Neither side may want to shoot, but both are afraid of the other party shooting first so they may be inclined to fire pre-emptively, although the favorable outcome for both parties would be that nobody be shot.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_10_29_nytbookreview.html|title = All About Evil.

Fear and mutual distrust between the actors increased the likelihood of a [[preemptive strike]].&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

==Avoidance==
The Hobbesian trap can be avoided by influences that increase the trust between the two parties.&lt;ref name="Baliga Sjöström" /&gt; In the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], for example, [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Khrushchev]] realized that they were caught in a Hobbesian trap which helped them to make concessions that reduced distrust and fear.&lt;ref name="Pinker AllaboutEvil" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14839">The term '''information revolution''' describes current [[economy|economic]], social and technological trends beyond the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Many competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development.
The British [[polymath]] [[crystallography|crystallographer]] [[J. D. Bernal]]  introduced the term "''scientific and technical revolution''" in his 1939 book ''The Social Function of Science'' to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a "productive force", using the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theory of Productive Forces]].&lt;ref name=Bernal/&gt; After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-[[Soviet Bloc]]. Their aim was to show that [[socialism]] was a safe home for the scientific and technical ("technological" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym STR. The book ''Civilization at the Crossroads'', edited by the Czech [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Radovan Richta]] (1969), became a standard reference for this topic.&lt;ref name=Richta/&gt;

[[Daniel Bell]] (1980) challenged this theory and advocated [[post-industrial society]], which would lead to a [[service economy]] rather than [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; Many other authors presented their views, including [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] (1976) with his "Technetronic Society".&lt;ref name=Brzezinski/&gt;

==Information in social and economic activities==

The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of [[information]]. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the [[Platonic Academy]], [[Aristotle]]'s [[Peripatetic school]] in the [[Lyceum]], the [[Musaeum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]], or the schools of [[Babylonian astronomy]]. The [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.

Information is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including [[Claude E. Shannon|Shannon]]'s (1949) ''[[Information Theory]]''&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; and [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]]'s (1948) ''[[Cybernetics]]''. Wiener stated: "information is information not matter or energy". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with [[matter]] and [[energy]] as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy.&lt;ref name=Wiener/&gt;  By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all "large structures".&lt;ref name="tsin"&gt;{{cite book |title=The sovereign individual |last=Davidson |first=James Dale |author2=William Rees-Mogg] |year=1999 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0684832722 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theory of information revolution==
The term ''information revolution'' may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:&lt;ref name=Veneris1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Veneris1990/&gt;

# The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between matter, energy, and information. These apply both to the object of each economic activity, as well as within each economic activity or enterprise. For instance, an industry may process matter (e.g. iron) using energy and information (production and process technologies, management, etc.).
# Information is a [[factor of production]] (along with [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[Labor (economics)|labor]], [[land (economics)]]), as well as a [[Product (business)|product]] sold in the [[Market (economics)|market]], that is, a [[commodity]]. As such, it acquires [[use value]] and [[exchange value]], and therefore a [[price]].
# All products have use value, exchange value, and informational value. The latter can be measured by the information content of the product, in terms of innovation, design, etc.
# Industries develop information-generating activities, the so-called [[Research and Development]] ([[R&amp;D]]) functions.
# Enterprises, and society at large, develop the information control and processing functions, in the form of management structures; these are also called "[[white-collar workers]]", "[[bureaucracy]]", "managerial functions", etc.
# Labor can be classified according to the object of labor, into information labor and non-information labor.
# Information activities constitute a large, new economic sector, the information sector along with the traditional [[primary sector]], [[secondary sector]], and [[tertiary sector]], according to the [[three-sector hypothesis]]. These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made by [[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]] (1940), who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary (agriculture, forestry, etc.) and secondary (manufacturing) sectors.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; The [[quaternary sector]] and the [[quinary sector of the economy]] attempt to classify these new activities, but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme, although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the information sector. [http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/sectorseconomy.htm]
# From a strategic point of view, sectors can be defined as information sector, [[means of production]], [[means of consumption]], thus extending the classical [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]]-[[Marx]] model of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Capitalist mode of production]] (see [[Influences on Karl Marx]]). [[Marx]] stressed in many occasions the role of the "intellectual element" in production, but failed to  find a place for it into his model.&lt;ref name=Ricardo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marx/&gt;
# Innovations are the result of the production of new information, as new products, new methods of production, [[patents]], etc. [[Diffusion of innovations]] manifests saturation effects (related term: [[market saturation]]), following certain cyclical patterns and creating "economic waves", also referred to as "[[business cycles]]". There are various types of waves, such as [[Kondratiev wave]] (54 years), [[Kuznets swing]] (18 years), [[Juglar cycle]] (9 years) and [[Kitchin cycle|Kitchin]] (about 4 years, see also [[Joseph Schumpeter]]) distinguished by their nature, duration, and, thus, economic impact.
# Diffusion of innovations causes structural-sectoral shifts in the economy, which can be smooth or can create crisis and renewal, a process which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] called vividly "[[creative destruction]]".

From a different perspective, [[Irving E. Fang]] (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the information highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.&lt;ref name=Fang/&gt;

==Measuring and modeling the information revolution==
Porat (1976) measured the information sector in the US using the [[input-output analysis]]; [[OECD]] has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries.&lt;ref name=Porat/&gt; Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a [[systems dynamics]] [[simulation]] [[computer model]].&lt;ref name=Veneris1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Veneris1990/&gt;

These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of [[Fritz Machlup]] who in his (1962) book "The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States", claimed that the "knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product", which he saw as evidence that the [[Information Age]] had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.&lt;ref name=Machlup/&gt;

More recent estimates have reached the following results:&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;
* the world’s technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 7% between 1986 and 2007;
* the world's technological capacity to store information grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 25% between 1986 and 2007;
* the world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 30% during the same two decades;
* the world's technological capacity to compute information with the help of humanly guided general-purpose computers grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 61% during the same period.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118072720/http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--this is a mere list of data--&gt;
A 47-nation global survey of public opinion conducted in June 2007 by the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] found considerable opposition to the NATO military operations in Afghanistan. In 2 out of the 47 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping troops in Afghanistan – Israel (59%) and Kenya (60%).&lt;ref name="47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116"&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/256.pdf 47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in 41 of the 47 countries pluralities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116"/&gt; In 32 out of 47 countries majorities wanted NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.

The 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 again found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries wanted NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible. In 3 out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – public opinion favoured keeping troops there until the situation stabilized.&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=260|title=Global Economic Gloom – China and India Notable Exceptions|date=12 June 2008|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"/&gt; Since then, public opinion in Australia and Britain has shifted, and the majority of Australians and British now also want their troops to be brought home from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Britons call for troop withdrawal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7725228.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Britons call for troop withdrawal|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australians lose faith in Afghan war effort"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/australians-lose-faith-in-afghan-war-effort/1320931.aspx |title=Australians lose faith in Afghan war effort |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003032403/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/australians-lose-faith-in-afghan-war-effort/1320931.aspx |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruel human toll of fight to win Afghan peace"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/12/afghanistan-taliban-troops-roadside-bombs|title=This page has been removed - News - The Guardian|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 February 2015|location=London|first=Jason|last=Burke|date=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poll finds 51% oppose role in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/poll-finds-51-oppose-role-in-afghanistan-20090329-9fk5.html|title=Poll finds 51% oppose role in Afghanistan|work=The Age|accessdate=6 February 2015|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven NATO countries in the survey, not one showed a majority in favor of keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – one, the U.S., came close to a majority (50%). Of the other six NATO countries, five had majorities of their population wanting NATO troops removed from Afghanistan as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"/&gt;

The 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2009 continued to find that the war in Afghanistan was unpopular in most nations&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/264.pdf 25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 (PDF p.26) Opposition to War in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; and that most publics want American and NATO troops out of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.13 Views of the U.S. and American Foreign policy"&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/264.pdf 25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.13 (PDF p.17)]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 global survey reported that majorities or pluralities in 18 out of 25 countries wanted NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"/&gt; (Changes from 2008 included Tanzania, South Africa, and Australia having been replaced by Israel, Kenya, the Palestinian Territories, and Canada in the survey, and shifts in opinions in India and Nigeria.) In 4 out of 25 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – the U.S. (57%), Israel (59%), Kenya (56%), and Nigeria (52%).&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"/&gt; Despite American calls for NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in every one of the NATO countries surveyed: Germany (63% opposition), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%).&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.39 (PDF p.43)"&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/264.pdf 25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.39 (PDF p.43)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, polls in France, Germany, Britain, and other countries showed that the European public wanted their troops to be pulled out and less money spent on the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Cruel human toll of fight to win Afghan peace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1888764,00.html|title=Obama's Unlikely Ally: Iran Signs On To Afghan Plan|date=31 March 2009|work=TIME.com|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=798995 Afghan war exposes flaws in assumption of Nato unity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110613/http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=798995 |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Europe opposes more troops for Afghanistan: poll"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE50J0NQ20090120|title=Europe opposes more troops for Afghanistan: poll|work=Reuters|accessdate=6 February 2015|first=Adrian|last=Croft|date=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International public opinion compared to American public opinion==
In October 2001, a poll by CNN/Gallup/USA Today indicated that about 88% of Americans backed military action in Afghanistan, and a poll by Market Opinion Research indicated that about 65% of Britons supported having British troops involved.&lt;ref name="AEI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/paper/politics-and-public-opinion/polls/america-and-the-war-on-terror-paper/ |title=America and the War on Terror |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=AEI Public Opinion Study |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221741/http://www.aei.org/paper/politics-and-public-opinion/polls/america-and-the-war-on-terror-paper/ |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }} Published July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by [[Gallup poll|Gallup]] International in late September 2001, found that majorities in most countries favoured a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: In 3 of the 37 countries surveyed – the United States, Israel, and India – did majorities favour military action. In 34 out of the 37 countries surveyed, the survey found majorities that did not favour military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%), Mexico (94%), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/media/2001/1121opinion.htm|title=World Opinion Opposes the Attack on Afghanistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201strangevic.html|title=Strange Victory: A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dichotomy between American and international public opinion on the military operations continues to be seen, although opposition to the war is [[#Growing American opposition to the war|growing in the U.S. as well]]. A Gallup poll conducted July 10–12, 2009 reported that the majority 61% of Americans do not think the U.S. made a mistake in sending military forces in 2001, while 36% of Americans do. 54% also thought things are going well for the U.S..&lt;!-- Gallup Poll, July 10–12, 2009--&gt;&lt;ref name="Americans Upbeat on Progress in Iraq, Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/121727/americans-upbeat-progress-iraq-afghanistan.aspx|title=Americans Upbeat on Progress in Iraq, Afghanistan|author=Gallup, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Angus Reid poll conducted July 15–18, 2009, found that 55% of Americans support the military operation, while 35% oppose it. 49% of Americans thought their country did the right thing in sending military forces. About half, 48%, of Americans felt that they did not have a clear idea of what the war is about.&lt;!-- Angus Reid poll July 15–18, 2009 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Britain, Canada Differ from U.S. on Afghan War"&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/33849/britain_canada_differ_from_us_on_afghan_war/ Britain, Canada Differ from U.S. on Afghan War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724000201/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/33849/britain_canada_differ_from_us_on_afghan_war/ |date=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the United States international public opinion has been largely opposed to the war. In a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] found considerable opposition to NATO operations. In 4 out of the 47 countries surveyed was there a majority that favoured keeping troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%).&lt;ref name="47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116"/&gt; In 41 of the 47 countries, pluralities want NATO troops out as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116"/&gt; In 32 out of 47 countries, majorities want NATO troops out as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries say troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global Unease With Major World Powers"/&gt;

The 24-nation [[Pew Global Attitudes Project|Pew Global Attitudes]] survey in June 2008 similarly found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want NATO to remove their troops as soon as possible. In 3 out of the 24 countries – the U.S. (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%) – did public opinion lean more toward keeping troops there until the situation has stabilized.&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"/&gt; Since that poll, views in Britain and Australia have also diverged from public opinion in the United States, and majorities in both Britain and Australia now want their troops to be brought back home from the war.&lt;ref name="Britons call for troop withdrawal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Australians lose faith in Afghan war effort"/&gt; Of the seven NATO countries included in the survey, none showed a majority in favor of keeping NATO troops until the situation stabilised – only the United States came close to a majority (50%). Of the other six NATO countries, five had majorities of their population wanting NATO troops to be removed as soon as possible: Spain (56%), France (54%), Germany (54%), Poland (65%), and Turkey (72%).&lt;ref name="24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey"/&gt;

The 25-nation [[Pew Global Attitudes Project|Pew Global Attitudes]] survey in June 2009 continued to find the war to be unpopular in most nations,&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"/&gt; with most publics wanting American and NATO troops out as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.13 Views of the U.S. and American Foreign policy"/&gt; The 2009 global survey reported that majorities or pluralities in 18 out of 25 countries want NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"/&gt; (Changes from the 2008 survey included Tanzania, South Africa, and Australia having been replaced by Israel, Kenya, the Palestinian Territories, and Canada in the survey, as well as shifts in opinions in India and Nigeria.) In 4 out of 25 countries was there a majority that favoured keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan – the U.S. (57%), Israel (59%), Kenya (56%), and Nigeria (52%).&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.22 Opposition to War in Afghanistan"/&gt; In 1 of the 8 NATO countries included in the survey – the U.S. – was there a majority in favour of keeping NATO troops until the situation stabilised. Despite repeated American calls for NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan, there was majority or plurality opposition to such action in all seven of the other NATO countries surveyed: Germany (63% disapprove), France (62%), Poland (57%), Canada (55%), Britain (51%), Spain (50%), and Turkey (49%).&lt;ref name="25-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 2009, p.39 (PDF p.43)"/&gt;

The 22-nation [[Pew Global Attitudes Project|Pew Global Attitudes]] survey released in June 2010 again continued to find the war unpopular in most nations. The poll reported that majorities or pluralities in 16 of 22 countries want the military forces to be withdrawn "as soon as possible". One country out of the 22 was there a majority that supported keeping troops until the situation stabilizes (57% in Kenya).&lt;ref name="Pew2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/2010/06/17/obama-more-popular-abroad-than-at-home/2/#chapter-1-views-of-the-u-s-and-american-foreign-policy|title=Obama More Popular Abroad Than At Home, Global Image of U.S. Continues to Benefit|date=17 June 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority 71% of conservative voters, including over two-thirds of Tea Party supporters, are worried that the war's cost to American taxpayers – $120 billion spent on the war in 2010 – will make it more difficult to reduce the U.S. deficit next year and balance the U.S. federal budget in the next decade. The poll for the Afghanistan Study Group was conducted January 4–10, 2011.&lt;ref name="Tea Party eyes the cost of war in Afghanistan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caivn.org/article/2011/01/15/tea-party-eyes-cost-war-afghanistan|title=Tea Party eyes the cost of war in Afghanistan|work=IVN.us|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Afghanistan Study Group – Survey Results of Conservatives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanistanstudygroup.org/2011/01/12/afghanistan-study-group-survey-results-of-conservatives/|title=Afghanistan Study Group – Survey Results of Conservatives|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poll of the NATO countries, conducted in June 2009, about 2 months before the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|Afghan election]], also reported that 56% of Americans were optimistic about stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan, whereas the majority 62% of people in the 12 NATO countries in Europe and Turkey were not.&lt;ref name="German Marshall Fund of the United States – Transatlantic Trends survey 2009 – Key Findings p.4–5, p.14–15"/&gt;

In the 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey, none of the seven NATO allies surveyed had majority support for keeping NATO troops in Afghanistan.

In 2010, none of the six NATO allies in the Pew Global Attitudes survey had majority support for keeping troops in Afghanistan.

An '''it girl''' is an attractive young woman, generally a celebrity, who is perceived to have both [[sex appeal]] and a personality that is especially engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=It girl | dictionary=Dictionary.com unabridged | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/it-girl?s=t | accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression ''it girl'' originated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith|Etherington-Smith, Meredith]] &amp; Pilcher, Jeremy. (1986). ''The 'It' Girls'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached global attention in 1927, with the popularity of the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] film ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'', starring [[Clara Bow]]. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an ''it girl'' if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty.

==Early use==
An early literary usage of ''it'' in this sense may be traced to a 1904 short story by [[Rudyard Kipling]]: ''It isn’t beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It’s just ‘It’.''
&lt;ref name=KiplingSociety&gt;{{cite web|quote=... she had that indefinable quality which Kipling was the first to call ‘It’ &amp;ndash; sex-appeal without flaunting her sexuality.|last1=Wilson|first1=Alastair|title=Mrs Bathurst|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_bathurst1.htm |publisher=KiplingSociety.co.uk|accessdate=5 March 2014|last2=Wilson|first2=Commander Alastair|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Glyn]], the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled ''It'' and the subsequent screenplay, lectured {{quote|With ''It'', you win all men if you are a woman and all women if you are a man. ''It'' can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.|source=Elinor Glyn (1927)&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;Introduction in the film script for ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (USA, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Glyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller ''Three Weeks''. She is usually credited with the invention of the ‘It Girl’ concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she is definitely responsible for the impact the term had on the culture of the 1920s. 
Bow later said she wasn’t sure what “It” meant,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Waterloo Daily Courier'', 21&amp;nbsp;September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; although she identified [[Lana Turner]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and later [[Marilyn Monroe]]&lt;ref name="Stenn8"&gt;{{cite book|title= Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild| first=David| last=Stenn| authorlink=David Stenn| publisher=Doubleday| year=1988| ISBN= 0-385-24125-9| page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “It Girls”, and [[Robert Mitchum]] as an “It Man”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The fashion component of the ''It Girl'', originated with the celebrated [[couturier]] [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]], known professionally as “Lucile”, the name under which she directed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York; she was [[Elinor Glyn]]’s elder sister. As Lucile, Lucy Duff-Gordon was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music, inspiring the modern runway or catwalk show, and she was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative [[lingerie]] and lingerie-inspired clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Caroline. (2013). ''The Mechanical Smile'', pp&amp;nbsp;34–36, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'' pp&amp;nbsp;23–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucile also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on Broadway to silent screen icons such as [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Irene Castle]].

As early as 1917, Lucile herself used the term ''It'' in relation to style in her fashion column for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'': "...&amp;nbsp;I saw a very ladylike and well-bred friend of mine in her newest Parisian frock ... she felt she was 'it' and perfectly happy."&lt;ref&gt;Duff-Gordon, Lady (Lucile). (1917). The Last Word in Fashions. ''Harper's Bazaar'', ''63'', October&amp;nbsp;1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'', 31, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''It'' (1927 film)==
The [[It (1927 film)|Paramount Studios' film]] was planned as a special showcase for its popular star [[Clara Bow]], and her spectacular performance&lt;ref&gt;private showing. (1927-01-01) ''Variety''&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term ‘It’ to the cultural lexicon.
The film plays with the notion that "It" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] and a [[femme fatale]], with a touch of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s latter day "[[Material Girl]]" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely (and rich and well-bred to boot), yet she doesn't have "It".

==Modern "It Girls"==
Since the 1990s, ''It Girl'' or ''It-Girl'' has been used slightly differently, referring to a wealthy, normally unemployed, young woman who is pictured in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] going to many parties often in the company of other celebrities, receiving media coverage in spite of no real personal achievements or TV hosting / presenting. The writer [[William Donaldson]] observed that, having initially been coined in the 1920s, the term was applied in the 1990s to describe "a young woman of noticeable 'sex appeal' who occupied herself by shoe shopping and party-going".&lt;ref name=donaldson&gt;[[William Donaldson|Donaldson, W]]. (2002) ''Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominence of an "It Girl" is often temporary; some of the rising It Girls will either become fully-fledged celebrities, commonly initially via engineering appearances on reality TV shows or series; lacking such an accelerant, their popularity will normally fade. Reflection on the celebrity-focused and celebrity-promoting nature of news media &amp;ndash; particularly [[tabloid journalism|tabloid newspaper]]s &amp;ndash; may be helpful.

===Film and theater===
* Glyn's 1927 film script was adapted into a musical called ''The It Girl'', which opened off-Broadway in 2001 at the York Theatre Company, starring [[Jean Louisa Kelly]].&lt;ref name="musical"&gt;[http://www.ItGirlMusical.com  It Girl Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051014205406/http://www.itgirlmusical.com/ |date=2005-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Szwed published ''Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth'', which analyses the art of [[Billie Holiday|Billie Holiday's]] singing and the construction of her life as a mythic paradigm of African American suffering. Szwed argues that Holiday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', is a generally accurate account of Holiday's life, and that Holiday's co-writer, [[William Dufty]], was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reviewer [[Richard Brody]] writes: "In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with [[Charles Laughton]], in the nineteen-thirties, and with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], in the late nineteen-forties—and of one relationship that’s sharply diminished in the book, her affair with [[Orson Welles]] around the time of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''."&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|author=Brody, Richard|title=The Art of Billie Holiday's Life |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-art-of-billie-holidays-life |accessdate=April 6, 2015|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those times each province of the Kazakh nation had its own [[Khan (title)|Khan]] and each tried to supersede the other.
The love story of Tolegen, the brave warrior, and the beauty Zhibek ends tragically because of inter-family strife. Tolegen is foully murdered by Bekejan (the batyr, or nobleman, of the rival family), who earlier strived for the hand of Zhibek. Zhibek commits suicide after learning about the death of Tolegen.

16 variants of the legend exist in different parts of [[Kazakhstan]].

In 1934 opera "Kyz-Zhibek" was staged in [[Abay Opera House]] (music - [[Yevgeny Brusilovsky]], libretto -  [[Gabit Musirepov]]).

In 1970 [[Kazakhfilm]] made film based on the legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazakhfilmstudios.kz Официальный сайт «Казахфильма»]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the poem was translated into Russian by Kazakh poet [[Bakhytzhan Kanapyanov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152073573&amp;chapter=1123809301&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=12&amp;month=08&amp;year=2005.htm Казахстанская правда]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde''''' (also referred to simply as '''''Legally Blonde 2''''') is a 2003 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Charles Herman-Wurmfeld]] and written by Kate Kondell. The [[sequel]] to the 2001 film ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', the film stars [[Reese Witherspoon]] alongside an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Sally Field]], [[Regina King]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Bruce McGill]], [[Dana Ivey]], [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]], [[Bob Newhart]], and [[Luke Wilson]], with Coolidge and Wilson reprising their roles from the first film.

Although the story is set in [[Washington, D.C.]], the film was shot in the offices at [[Vivint Smart Home Arena]] (then the Delta Center), the [[Utah State Capitol]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and the [[Illinois State Capitol]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. The supposed "aerial views" on Washington buildings were [[scale model]]s built by the crew.

The film opened on July 2, 2003, to generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a box office success, grossing $90 million in North America and $125 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=legallyblonde2.htm|title=Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde (2003) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Elle Woods]] wants her [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], Bruiser, to reunite with his mother, because she would like Bruiser's mom to attend her wedding to Emmett. Elle hires a detective to find Bruiser's mother, only to discover that the owner of her dog's mother is C'est Magnifique, a [[cosmetics]] company that [[Animal testing|uses Bruiser's mother for "testing"]]. She finds out that her law firm represents the C'est Magnifique Corporation and when she urges the firm to drop them as a client, she's fired.

Elle decides to leave [[Boston]], where she and Bruiser have settled with her fiancé Emmett, and go to [[Washington, D.C.]], to work on Bruiser's Bill. Elle is upset that her dog's mother is in a make-up testing laboratory, and decides to take it upon herself to be the "voice for those who can't speak" and to outlaw animal testing.

While working for Congresswoman Victoria Rudd, Elle is met with skepticism and other barriers common to Washington politics. Rudd's member of staff, Timothy, sarcastically calls her "[[Capitol Hill|Capitol]] [[Barbie]]". (There has even been a Barbie doll based on Elle Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elle Woods as Barbie|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008X341}}&lt;/ref&gt;) After a variety of ups and downs including a failed attempt to improve her work environment by having her co-workers write compliments about one another and place them in the "snap cup", Elle starts to lose her faith in Washington politics.

Elle discovers that Bruiser is actually [[Homosexuality|gay]], after she is paged by "The Paws That Refreshes: A Doggy Day Spa". Bruiser has been affectionate with Leslie, a [[Rottweiller]] owned by Congressman Stan Marks, the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]] which has jurisdiction over Bruiser's Bill. Elle also finds that Congresswoman Libby Hauser, the [[Ranking minority member|Ranking Member]] of the same committee, was a member of Elle's [[sorority]] Delta Nu. As a result, both Marks and Hauser warm to Elle and eventually come to support Bruiser's Bill.

Elle also discovers that Congresswoman Rudd has actually been working against her. Rudd has been doing so in an effort to satisfy the interests of a major campaign donor named "Bob" (who is [[Unseen character|never seen]], but with whom Rudd has several telephone conversations). However, Rudd is eventually blackmailed into supporting Elle's petition, because Rudd's Chief of Staff, Grace Rossiter, eavesdrops on a recorded conversation during which Rudd admits to Elle that she has been working against Bruiser's Bill in order to help Rudd's sponsors who want to continue with tests on animals. As Grace is appalled that Rudd lied to Elle and blamed it on her, Grace and Elle eventually reach a place of mutual respect, especially after Grace admits she came to Washington D.C. with an enthusiasm not unlike Elle's, but later lost that idealism when she discovered how dirty politics could really be.

With the help of her friends, Elle's [[discharge petition]] is successful, and Bruiser's Bill is brought to the floor of the House. Bruiser's mother and the rest of the dogs are released by C'est Magnifique Corporation. Elle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at [[Fenway Park]] as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by the UPS Guy.

In the final scene, Emmett asks Elle whether they want to live in [[Beverly Hills]], Washington D.C., or Boston. As Elle has many legal and political job offers after the successful discharge hearing, she responds, "Oh, I think I know just the place", and winks as they drive by the [[White House]].

==Reception==
Although Witherspoon's performance was highly praised, the film overall received mostly negative reviews, and came in at number 21 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s "Top 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made" (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1169126,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Chris | last=Nashawaty | title=The 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made | date=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently holds 38% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the critical consensus being that "this blonde joke is less funny the second time around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/legally_blonde_2_red_white_and_blonde/ |title=Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White &amp; Blonde - Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film hit theaters on the Wednesday before the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] in 2003 and grossed nearly $40 million by Monday. However, the following weekend the film could only boast sales half of that and the film quickly left theaters in the coming weeks. Grossing about $90 million in the U.S., the film was a success for the studio, though many expected it to perform just as well as Witherspoon's last big film, ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (movie)|Sweet Home Alabama]]''.

A '''mother goddess''' is a [[goddess]] who represents, or is a personification of [[nature]], [[motherhood]], [[fertility]], [[Creation myth|creation]], [[natural disasters|destruction]] or who embodies the bounty of the [[Earth]]. When equated with the Earth or the natural world, such goddesses are sometimes referred to as '''Mother Earth''' or as the '''Earth Mother'''.

There is difference of opinion between the academic and the popular conception of the term. The popular view is mainly driven by the [[Goddess movement]] and reads that primitive societies initially were [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]], worshipping a sovereign, nurturing, motherly [[earth goddess]]. This was based upon the nineteenth-century ideas of [[unilineal evolution]] of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]]. According to the academic view, however, both Bachofen and the modern Goddess theories are a projection of contemporary world views on ancient myths, rather than attempting to understand the ''[[History of mentalities|mentalité]]'' of that time.&lt;ref&gt;''The idea of the Mother Goddess, also called the Great Mother or Great Goddess, has dominated the imaginations of modern scholars in several fields. The image of the Mother Goddess with which we are familiar today has its modern genesis in the writings of Johann Jakob Bachofen. In 1861 Bachofen published his famous study ''Das Mutterrecht'' in which he developed his theory that human society progressed from hetaerism, characterized by unrestricted sexual relations, to matriarchy, in which women ruled society, and finally to the most advanced stage, patriarchy. Bachofen conceived of religious practice as progressing in a parallel manner from a belief in a mother goddess to a more advanced belief in a father god, associating belief in a mother deity with a primitive stage in the development of human society: “Wherever we encounter matriarchy, it is bound up with the mystery of the chthonian religion, whether it invokes Demeter or is embodied by an equivalent goddess” (Bachofen, 88). Bachofen believed that the matriarchal form of social organization derived from the maternal mystery religions (88-9).''&lt;br /&gt;
''As we see with Bachofen, modern theories of the Mother Goddess have inevitably been shaped by modern cultural presuppositions about gender. Lynn Roller believes that “[m]any discussions of the Mother Goddess rely on modern projections ought to be, rather than on ancient evidence defining what she was” (Roller, 9). William Ramsay, the late nineteenth-century archaeologist, who was the first researcher to demonstrate that the principal deity of Phrygia was a mother goddess, drew heavily on Bachofen's theory (Roller, 12). Like Bachofen's, Ramsay's understanding of the national character of matriarchal pre-Phrygian society is based on contestable evidence and relies on stereotypically feminine characteristics; he describes matriarchal pre-Phrygian society as “receptive and passive, not self-assertive and active” (12). For Ramsay, this “feminine” character explains why this culture was conquered by the masculine, warlike Phrygians with their male deities. Thus, constructions of ancient matriarchal societies, which are inseparable from “a glorification of the female element in human life” (12), are suspiciously similar to modern stereotypes of the feminine that are not necessarily native to pre-Phrygian culture. Given these observations, Bachofen's repeated emphasis on the necessity of freeing oneself from the cultural prejudices of one's own time if one is to truly understand these ancient cultures takes on an ironic tone. It is not only Bachofen and Ramsay, but many others after them, who assume the stereotypical femininity of the Mother Goddess. Many of these conceptions of what a mother goddess ought to be stem from “the Judaeo-Christian image of the loving, nurturing mother subservient to her husband and closely bonded with her children” (Roller, 9).'' [[Amy Charlotte Smith|Smith]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''At one time, scholars tended to use the 'Mother Goddess' label for all female figurines found at sites. This was largely because of the belief that the worship of fertility goddesses was an important part of agricultural societies all over the world, and also due to a tendency to look at ancient remains through the lens of later-day Hinduism, in which goddess worship had an important place. However, scholars are now increasingly aware of the stylistic and technical differences among assemblages of female figurines. Further, all goddesses need not have been part of a single goddess cult, and not all ancient goddesses were necessarily associated with maternity.&lt;br /&gt;In the light of such problems, the term 'Mother Goddess' should be replaced by the longer but more neutral phrase— 'female figurines with likely cultic significance.' This does not mean that none of these figurines might have had a religious or cultic significance. It is indeed possible that some were either images that were worshipped or votive offerings that were part of some domestic cult or ritual. However, not all female figurines necessarily had such a function. Whether we are looking at human or animal figurines, in all cases, their possible significance or function has to be assessed, and cannot be assumed. Apart from their form, the context in which they were found is crucial.'' [[Upinder Singh|Singh]] (2008) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Often this is accompanied by a desire for a lost civilization from a bygone era that would have been just, peaceful and wise.&lt;ref&gt;''A popular undercurrent in fringe archaeology concerns the ostensible presence of a ''lost civilization'' hidden somewhere in the proverbial ''dim mists of time.'' This lost civilization is usually portrayed as having been amazingly and precociously advanced, possessing technological skills as yet still not developed even by our modern civilization and paranormal capacities of which we are not even aware. This lost civilization (or civilizations) is usually presented as the ''mother culture'' of all subsequent, historically known civilizations, having passed down their knowledge to them. The lost civilization was, tragically, destroyed, through either a natural cataclysm or some catastrophic technological mishap, and has been somehow hidden from us.'' [[Kenneth Feder|Feder]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is highly unlikely that such a civilization ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;''There isn't a scintilla of physical evidence that anything of the kind occurred. There is no archaeological evidence of a supersophisticated civilization 10000 years ago—no gleaming cities, no factories powered by Earth energies'' [...] [[Kenneth Feder|Feder]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, feminist authors advocated that these peaceful, matriarchal agrarian societies were exterminated or subjugated by nomadic, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] warrior tribes. An important contribution to this was that of archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]]. Her work in this field is now however largely rejected.&lt;ref&gt;''There is another popular view of figurines, which may be summed up as the “Mother Goddess” issue. The idea of the ascendancy of the Mother Goddess as the primeval deity can be traced back to nineteenth century culture theory, endorsed by Freud and Jung (Parker Pearson 1999:99-100; Talalay 1991), if not before. The modern manifestation was given a huge impetus in the work of Marija Gimbutas (1974, 1989, 1991). To reduce Gimbutas's argument to simplicity, she viewed early Neolithic society as egalitarian, matrifocal, matrilineal, and focused on worshipping a Mother Goddess (Tringham 1993), as evidenced by females figurines found in Neolithic sites in the Near East and eastern Mediterranean region.''&lt;br /&gt;''Few archaeologists support her notion for a number of reasons (Meskell 1995; Tringham 1993, for example). They maintain that the Mother Goddess is an assumption, not a theory, and certainly not a demonstrated thesis. The critics argue that Gimbutas is blending modern myth, feminist ideology, and psychological theory unsupported by clinical research to impose the Mother Goddess archetype on past societies.'' [...]&lt;br /&gt;''Gimbutas's own work included excavations at Achilleion (Thessaly). Reviewers of that work (McPherron 1991; Runnels 1990) find problems with the sample size (four 5 x 5 m test units on the slope of a tell), use of dating methods, lack of explanation of field methodology, recording systems or lack thereof, omission of clear criteria for discerning interior versus exterior contexts, typology, statistics---it is hard to find a part of this work not negatively critiqued.'' [[Kit Wesler|Wesler]] (2012), pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Also with feminist archaeologists this vision is nowadays considered highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;In her book ''The Faces of the Goddess'' from 1997, [[Lotte Motz|Motz]] negated the popular theory of the archetypal fertility cult of the Mother Goddess which supposedly would have existed prior to the rise of patriarchy and the oppression of women.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''We begin with an issue that is foundational to the modern study of women in the ancient world, namely the Mother Goddess. As Lauren Talalay demonstrates in Case Study I (“The Mother Goddess in Prehistory: Debates and Perspectives”), there was a desire among scholars, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, to locate a period in the distant past in which women were not secondary, when female power was celebrated, and when an overarching Mother Goddess was the primary divinity. This myth continues to have great appeal, as witnessed in “goddess-tourism” in the Mediterranean even today. While it is no longer an active scholarly theory, the issue of the Mother Goddess continues to be an exemplar for the problems of studying women in antiquity: mysterious images disembodied from their contexts, multiple scholarly biases and motivations, and conflicting interpretations of the scanty and fragmentary evidence.'' [[Sharon L. James|James]]; [[Sheila Dillon|Dillon]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the sixties of the twentieth century, especially  in [[popular culture]], the alleged worship of the mother goddess and the [[social position]] that women in prehistoric societies supposedly assumed, were linked. This made the debate a political one. According to the goddess movement, the current male-dominated society should  return to the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] matriarchy of earlier times. That this form of society ever existed was supposedly supported by many [[figurine]]s that were found.&lt;br /&gt;
In academic circles, this prehistoric matriarchy is considered unlikely. Firstly, worshiping a mother goddess does not necessarily mean that women ruled society.&lt;ref&gt;''Worship of a nurturing Mother Goddess who oversees cosmological creation, fertility, and death does not necessarily entail or reflect a pacific matriarchy and female power in society.'' [[Lauren Talalay|Talalay]] in [[Sharon L. James|James]]; [[Sheila Dillon|Dillon]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the figurines can also portray ordinary women or goddesses, and it is unclear whether there really ever was a mother goddess.&lt;ref&gt;''Let me be perfectly clear about my own position: the maternal Great Goddess is a ''fantasy'', a powerful fantasy with an astonishing capacity to resist criticism.'' [[Nicole Loraux|Loraux]] in [[Georges Duby|Duby, G.]]; [[Michelle Perrot|Perrot, M.]] (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''It may be impossible to ever prove one way or the other that a Great Goddess existed in prehistory. As the essays that follow suggest, what is more likely is that interpretations of female deities, their intersection with the roles of women in antiquity, and the place of these debates in modern society will be rewritten many times in the future.'' [[Lauren Talalay|Talalay]] in [[Sharon L. James|James, S.L.]]; [[Sheila Dillon|Dillon, S.]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Goddesses of the prime of life are often described as ''mother goddesses,'' although that term is questionable, given that the goddesses may not be maternal in any conventional sense. For instance, the single child of Cybele was conceived upon her while she was in the form of a rock and was never reared by her (see Southeastern Europe). Similarly, the eastern Mediterranean goddess Ninlil ''gave birth'' by making images of people from clay, as did the Chinese goddess Nüwa. The distinction between mother goddess and creatrix is often difficult to locate. In the Pacific, the goddess Papa both created the earth and gave birth to the gods.''&lt;br /&gt;''The role of goddess as creatrix is common among goddesses, who can create by some other mechanism than birth, as Inuit Aakuluujjusi did when she threw her clothing on the ground, which walked away as animals.'' [[Patricia Monaghan|Monaghan]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Çatalhöyük==
[[File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg|thumb|[[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]]]]
Between 1961 and 1965 [[James Mellaart]] led a series of excavations at [[Çatalhöyük]], north of the Taurus Mountains in a fertile agricultural region of South-[[Anatolia]]. Striking were the many statues found here, which Mellaart suggested represented a Great goddess, who headed the pantheon of an essentially matriarchal culture. A seated female figure, flanked by what Mellaart describes as [[lion]]esses, was found in a grain-bin; she may have intended to protect the harvest and grain.&lt;ref&gt;Mellaart (1967), 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the sites as [[shrine]]s, with especially the [[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük]] capturing the imagination. There was also a large number of sexless figurines, which Mellaart regarded as typical for a society dominated by women: ''emphasis on sex in art is invariably connected with male impulse and desire''.&lt;ref name=mellart180&gt;Mellaart (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that there could have been a matriarchy and a cult of the mother goddess was supported by archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]]. This gave rise to a modern cult of the Mother Goddess with annual [[pilgrimage]]s being organized at Çatalhöyük.

Since 1993, excavations were resumed, now headed by [[Ian Hodder]] with [[Lynn Meskell]] as head of the ''Stanford Figurines Project'' that examined the figurines of Çatalhöyük. This team came to different conclusions than Gimbutas and Mellaart. Only a few of the figurines were identified as female and these figurines were found not so much in sacred spaces, but seemed to have been discarded randomly, sometimes in garbage heaps. This rendered a cult of the mother goddess in this location as unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;''As an example, the publication by Meskell et al. (2008) of detailed data on the figurines from the site has transformed our understanding of these objects. In much earlier work and writing on the site, including by Mellaart, these objects were seen as representational and as religious, relating to a cult of the mother goddess. The work of the figurine team has thoroughly undermined this interpretation. In fact, when properly quantified, few of the figurines are clearly female. In addition, examination of their context of deposition shows that the objects are not in 'special' locations, but were discarded, often in middens. A study of the fabric of the figurines by Chris Doherty (pers. comm.) has shown that they are made of local marls and that they are unfired or low fired. Many have survived only because they were accidentally burned in hearths and fires. Thus all the evidence suggests that these objects were not in a separate religious sphere. Rather, it was the process of their daily production – not their contemplation as religious symbols – that was important. They gave meaning, at the everyday, low-intensity level, to subjectivities and to the social world that they helped imagine.'' [[Ian Hodder|Hodder]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary religion==
===Hinduism===
{{See also|Kali}}
[[Image:S344 durga-idol-golden.png|thumb|Goddess [[Durga]] is seen as the supreme mother goddess by Hindus]]

In [[Hinduism]], [[Durga]] represents the feminine aspect and the ''shakti'' (energy/power) of the One God (The ''Brahman''), as well as the empowering and protective nature of motherhood. From her forehead sprang [[Kali]], who defeated Durga's enemy, [[Shumbh]]. Kali (the feminine form of Kaala" i.e. "time") is the primordial energy as power of Time, literally, the "creator or doer of time"—her first manifestation. After time, she manifests as "space", as [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], from which point further creation of the material universe progresses. The divine Mother, [[Devi]] [[Adi parashakti]], manifests herself in various forms, representing the universal [[creator deity|creative force]]. She becomes Mother Nature (Mula Prakriti), who gives birth to all life forms as plants, animals, and such from Herself, and she sustains and nourishes them through her body, that is the earth with its animal life, vegetation, and minerals. Ultimately she re-absorbs all life forms back into herself, or "devours" them to sustain herself as the power of death feeding on life to produce new life. She also gives rise to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (the illusory world) and to [[prakriti]], the force that galvanizes the divine ground of existence into self-projection as the cosmos. The Earth itself is manifested by [[Adi parashakti]]. Hindu worship of the divine Mother can be traced back to [[Vedas|pre-vedic]], [[prehistoric India]].

{{see|Shaktism}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tridevi.png|thumb|180px|The ''[[Tridevi]]'' – the conjoined forms of [[Lakshmi]], [[Parvati]],  and [[Saraswati]] – considered Shaktis of the ''[[Trimurti]]''- [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], and [[Brahma]] respectively]] --&gt;
The form of [[Hinduism]] known as [[Shaktism]] is strongly associated with [[Samkhya]], and [[Tantra]] [[Hindu philosophies]] and ultimately, is [[monist]]. The primordial feminine creative-preservative-destructive energy, [[Shakti]], is considered to be the motive force behind all action and existence in the phenomenal cosmos. The cosmos itself is  [[purusha]], the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality that is the Divine Ground of all being, the "world soul". This masculine potential is actualized by feminine dynamism, embodied in multitudinous goddesses who are ultimately all manifestations of the One Great Mother. Mother Maya or Shakti, herself, can free the individual from demons of ego, ignorance, and desire that bind the soul in [[maya (illusion)]]. Practitioners of the [[Tantra|Tantric]] tradition focus on Shakti to [[Moksha|free themselves]] from the cycle of [[karma]].

===New religious movements===
Some members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believe in, but do not worship, a [[Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)|Heavenly Mother]], or heavenly mothers, the wife and female counterpart of the Heavenly Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Joseph F. |last=Smith |authorlink=Joseph F. Smith |title= Man: Origin and Destiny |pages=348–355 |year=1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not emphasized, however, and typically, adherents pray to the "Father in Heaven".

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the Earth goddess is called the "[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic being functioning within Earth|Planetary Logos of Earth]]".

The [[Goddess (Wicca)|Mother Goddess, or Great Goddess]], is a composite of various feminine deities from past and present world cultures, worshiped by modern [[Wiccans|Wicca]] and others broadly known as Neopagans. She is considered sometimes identified as a [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], who takes the form of Maiden, Mother, and Crone [[archetypes]].  She is described as Mother Earth, Mother Nature, or the Creatress of all life. She is associated with the [[moon|full moon]] and stars, the [[Earth]], and the sea. In [[Wicca]], the Earth Goddess is sometimes called [[New Age Gaian|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sage Woman" magazine Issue 79 Autumn 2010--special issue "Connecting to Gaia"&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the mother goddess varies depending on the Wiccan tradition.

[[Carl Gustav Jung]] suggested that the [[archetype|archetypal]] mother was a part of the [[collective unconscious]] of all humans, and various Jungian students, e.g. [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]] and [[Ernst Whitmont]], have argued that such mother imagery underpins many [[mythology|mythologies]], and precedes the image of the paternal "father", in such religious systems. Such speculations help explain the universality of such mother goddess imagery around the world.

The Upper Paleolithic Venus figurines have been sometimes explained as depictions of an [[Earth Goddess]] similar to Gaia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christopher L. C.

'''Nakshi kantha''', a type of embroidered quilt, is a centuries-old [[Bengal]]i art tradition of the [[Bengal]] Region, notable in [[Bangladesh]] and [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bengalcrafts.com/History.html |title=Nakshi Kantha-Benhal Craft |website=Bengal Crafts |access-date=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaman |first=Niaz |year=2012 |chapter=Nakshi Kantha |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Nakshi_Kantha |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org" /&gt; The basic material used is thread and old cloth.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|p=23}} Nakshi kanthas are made throughout Bangladesh, but the greater [[Mymensingh]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] and [[Jessore]] areas are most famous for this craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sirajuddin |first=Muhammad |date=1992 |title=Living Crafts in Bangladesh |location=Dhaka |publisher=Markup International |page=44 |oclc=29737195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[running stitch]] called "[[kantha]] stitch" is the main stitch used for the purpose.{{sfn|Ghuznavi|1981|pp=23–24}} Traditionally, kantha was produced for the use of the family. Today, after the revival of the nakshi kantha, they are produced commercially.
== Etymology ==
The word ''kantha'' has no discernible etymological root.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997}} The exact time of origin of the word [[kantha]] is not accurately known but it probably had a precursor in ''kheta'' (khet [[Bengali language|Bengali]] means "field").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Perveen |date=1999 |title=Lecture: Aesthetics and Vocabulary of Nakshi Kantha |url=http://ignca.nic.in/nl_01310.htm |journal=Vihangama |publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) |volume= VII |issue=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Niaz Zaman, the word ''kantha'' originated from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''kontha'',  which means rags, as kantha is made of rags.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=36}}

==Tradition==
Like any other folk art, kantha making is influenced by factors such as materials available, daily needs, climate, geography, and economic factors.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}} Probably the earliest form of kantha was the [[patchwork]] kantha, and the kanthas of the decorative [[appliqué]] type evolved from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Gurusaday |date=1995 |title=Kantha: Album of Art Treasure (Series One) |location=24 Parganas, India |publisher=Gurusaday Dutt Folk Art Society, Gurusaday Museum |oclc=475731213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The earliest mention of Bengal Kantha is found in the book ''Sri Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita'' by Krishnadas Kaviraj, which was written some five hundred years ago. The famous Bengali poet [[Jasimuddin]] also had a very famous poem '[[Nakshi Kanthar Math]]' on Nakshi Kantha &lt;ref name="Jaismuddin.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sos-arsenic.net/lovingbengal/quilt.html |title=Quilt (Kantha) Art of Bengal |website=Jaismuddin.org |access-date=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox geographical indication

==Making==
Traditionally old [[saree]]s, [[lungi]]s and [[dhoti]]s were used to make kanthas. Kantha making was not a full-time job. Women in almost every household were expert in the art. Rural women worked at leisure time or during the lazy  days of the rainy season, so taking months or even years to finish a kantha was normal.  At least five to seven sarees were needed to make a standard-size kantha. Today the old materials are replaced by new cotton cloths. Traditionally the thread was collected from the old sarees. That is rarely done today.

When a kantha is being made, first the sarees are joined together to attain the required size, and then layers are spread out on the ground. The cloths are then smoothed, and no folds or creases are left in between. During the process, the cloth is kept flat on the ground with weights on the edges. Then the four edges are stitched and two or three rows of large running stitches are done to keep the kantha together. At this stage, the kantha can be folded and stitched at leisure time.

Originally, designs and motifs were not drawn on the cloth. The design was first outlined with needle and thread, followed by focal points, and then the filling motifs were done. In a kantha with a predominant central motif the centre was done first, followed by corner designs and the other details. In some types of kanthas (carpet, lik and sujni, etc.) wooden blocks were used to print the outline. The blocks are replaced today by patterns drawn in tracing papers.

The following is how kanthas are categorized, according to the stitch type:{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

=== Running stitch ===

The [[running stitch]] kantha is truly the indigenous kantha. They are subdivided into Nakshi (figured) and par tola  (patterned). Nakshi (figured) kanthas are further  divided into motif  or scenic kanthas.

=== Lohori kantha ===

The name was derived from Persian word ''lehr'', which means wave. This type of kantha is particularly popular in [[Rajshahi]]. These kanthas are further divided into soja (straight or simple), Kautar khupi (pigeon coop or triangle), borfi or diamond (charchala, atchala or barachala).

=== Lik or anarasi ===

The Lik or Anarasi (pine apple) type of kantha is found in the [[Chapainawabganj District|Chapainawabganj]] and [[Jessore]] areas. The variations are lik tan, lik tile, lik jhumka, and lik lohori.

=== Cross-stitch or carpet ===

This type of kantha was introduced by the English during the British Rule in India.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=114}} The stitch employed in these kanthas is the [[cross-stitch]].

=== Sujni kantha ===

This type of kantha is found only in [[Rajshahi]] area. The popular motif used is the undulating floral and vine motif.

==Influence of religion and folk belief==

==Stitches==
{{main|Kantha}}
The earliest and most basic stitch found in kanthas is the ''[[running stitch]]''. The predominant form of this stitch is called the ''phor'' or kantha stitch.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|pp=44–45}} The other forms of stitches used are the  Chatai or ''pattern darning'', Kaitya or ''[[bending stitch]]'', ''weave running stitch'', ''[[darning stitch]]'', ''Jessore stitch'' (a variation of darning stitch), ''[[threaded running stitch]]'', Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia ''([[Holbein stitch|Holbein]]) stitches''. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the ''Kasmiri stitch'' and the ''[[arrowhead stitch]]''. Stitches like the  ''[[herringbone stitch]]'', ''[[satin stitch]]'', ''[[backstitch]]'' and ''[[cross-stitch]]'' are occasionally used.{{sfn|Zaman|1993}}

==Types==
Kanthas generally denote quilts used as wrappers; however, all articles made by quilting old cloth may also be referred to by the same generic name. However, depending on the size and purpose, kanthas may be divided into various articles, each with its specific names. The various types of kantha are as follows:{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=v}}
* [[Quilt]] (lep in Bengali): A light quilted covering made from the old sarees/dhotis/lungis and sometimes from sheet cloths.
* Large spread (Naksi Kantha in Bengali): An embellished quilt embroidered in traditional motifs and innovative style
* [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] floor spread (Ason in Bengali): Cloth spread for sitting at a place of worship or for an honoured guest.
* Cosmetic wrapper (Arshilota in Bengali): A narrow embroidered wrapper to roll and store away a woman's comb, mirror, eye kohl, vermilion, sandal paste, oil bottle, etc. Often, a tying string is used to bind the wrap, as in later day satches.
* Wallet (Batwa thoiley in Bengali): Small envelope-shaped bag for keeping money, [[betel leaves]], etc.
* Cover for Quran (ghilaf in Arabic and Bengali): Envelope-shaped bag to cover the Quran.
* Prayer mats (Jainamaz in Bengali): Mats used by Muslims to say prayers.
* Floor spread (Galicha in Bengali): Floor coverings.
* Cloths wrapper (Bostani, guthri in Bengali): A square wrapper for books and other valuables.
* Cover (Dhakni in Bengali): Covering cloths of various shapes and sizes.
* Ceremonial meal spread (Daster khan in Bengali): A spread for eating place, used at meal time.
* Pillow cover (Balisher chapa or oshar in Bengali): A flat single piece pillow cover.
* Handkerchief (Rumal): Small and square in shape.
* Modern-day articles: Today newer uses are found for nakshi kanthas, such as bedspreads, wall hangins, cushion covers, ladies' purses, place mats, jewellery boxes, dress fronts, skirts border, shawls and sharees.

==Motifs==
Motifs of the nakshi kantha are deeply influenced by religious belief and culture. Even though no specific strict symmetry is followed, a finely embroidered naksi kantha will always have a focal point. Most kanthas will have a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] as focal point, and around the lotus there are often undulating vines or floral motifs, or a shari border motif. The motifs may include images of flower and leaves, birds and fish, animals, kithen forms even toilet articles.

While most kantas have some initial pattern, no two naksi kantas are same. While traditional motifs are repeated, the individual touch is used in  the variety of stitches, colours and shapes. The notable motifs found in naksi kantha are as follows:

===Lotus motif===
[[File:Lotus motif.JPG|thumb|right|Lotus motif]]
The lotus motif is the most common motif found in kanthas. This motif is associated with Hindu iconography and thus is also very popular in the kantha. The  lotus is the divine seat. It is also symbolic of cosmic harmony and essential womanhood. The lotus is also the symbol of eternal order and  of the union of earth, water and, sky. It represents the life-giving power of water, and is also associated with the sun for the opening and closing of the petals. It is also the symbol of the recreating power of life. With the drying up of water, the lotus dies and with the rain it springs to life again. The lotus is associated with purity and the goddess [[Laksmi]], the goddess of good fortune and abundance. There are various forms of lotus motifs, from the eight-petaled ''astadal padma'' to the hundred petaled ''satadal''. In the older kanthas, the central motif is almost always a fully bloomed lotus seen from above.

===Solar motif===
The solar motif is closely associated with the lotus motif. Often, the lotus and the solar motifs are found together at the centre of a nakshi kantha. The solar motif symbolizes the life giving power of the sun. The sun is associated with the fire which plays a significant part in Hindu rites, both religious and matrimonial.

===Moon motif===
The moon motif has a religious influence, and is popular amongst the Muslims. Mostly it is in the form of a crescent moon accompanied by a star. This motif is particularly found in ''jainamaz'' kanthas.

===Wheel motif===
The wheel is a common symbol in Indian art, both Hindu and Buddhist. It is the symbol of order. The wheel also represents the world. The wheel is a popular motif in kanthas even when the maker has forgotten the significance of the symbol. The motif is relatively easy to make with ''chatai phor.''

===Swastika motif===
Su asti in [[Sanskrit]] means '''it is well'''. As a motif in Indian art, it dates back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It is symbol of good fortune. It is also known as ''muchri'' or ''golok dhanda.''  With the passage of time, the design is more curvilinear than the four armed swastika of the [[Mohenjodaro]] seal. The symbolic design has significant influence in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

===Tree of life motif===
[[File:BanglaNak1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Contemporary Nakshi Kantha (used as a wall hanging) with animal, fish, butterfly, tree and human figure motif]]
The influence of this motif in Indian art and culture (as with kantha) may be traced back to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. ''It is likely that the Indus people conceived the pipal as the [[Tree of Life]]...with the devata inside embodying the power of fecundity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mukerjee |first=Radhakamal |date=1964 |title=The Flowering of Indian Art: The Growth and Spread of a Civilization |location=Bombay |publisher=Asia Pub. House |page=35 |oclc=30086718}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Buddhist times, the cult of the tree continued. [[Ficus religiosa|Pipal]] is sacred to the Buddha because he received enlightenment under its shade.  It reflects the fecundity of nature and is very popular in Bengal. Vines and creepers play an important role in kanthas and they contain the same symbolisation as that of tree of life. A popular motif in [[Rajshahi]] lohori is the betel leaf.

===Kalka motif===
[[File:Kalka motif.JPG|thumb|right|Close view of Kalka motif]]
This is a latter-day motif, dating from Mughal times.{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=82}} The kalka or [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] motif originated in Persia and Kashmir and has become an integral image of the subcontinental decorative motif.{{sfn|Ahmad|1997|p=92}} It can be compared with a stylized leaf, mango or flame. The kalka is an attractive motif and number of varieties are experimented. Similar motifs can be found in traditional kashmiri [[shawl]]s.

Most nakshi kanthas have some kind of border. Either a sari border is stitched on or a border pattern is embroidered around the kantha. The common border found in kanthas are as follows:{{sfn|Zaman|1993|p=94}} [[File:Kantha border2.JPG|thumb|left|200px|From the top: necklace border, ladder border, gut taga, chik taga, nose ring border, fish border, panch taga, bisa taga, anaj taga]]

== Controversy regarding Geographical Indication ==
Despite being a Bangladeshi traditional art, the Indian state of West Bengal applied for the [[Geographical Indication]] for Nakshi kantha in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ttg-sric.iitkgp.ernet.in/GIDrive/images/gi/registered_GI_13June2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to absence of proper law on Geographical Indication in Bangladesh that time (which was later adopted), Bangladesh couldn't counter apply for the GI. The registry office had no option but to hand-over the Geographical Indication to West Bengal in 2008.

Bangladesh authority however later passed the "Bangladesh Geographical Indication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2013"&lt;ref&gt;http://dpdt.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/dpdt.portal.gov.bd/page/cc2ca133_4da5_42f7_9776_21cff528a032/GI%20Act-2013%20Bangla.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in parliament and with other necessary preparations now waiting for the next re-applying time cycle to claim the Geographical Indication for Nakshi kantha to Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpd.org.bd/index.php/press-reports-geographical-indication-jamdani-bangladesh-cpd-dialogue/ |title=Press reports on Protecting Geographical Indication Products in Bangladesh |website=Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |title=India – Bangladesh Parliamentary Dialogue |website=Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry |access-date=24 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160127051454/http://www.ficci-inbdpd.com/htm/recom.html |archivedate=27 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''New rhetorics''' is an [[interdisciplinary field]]&lt;ref name="Andreea"&gt;Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ''Rhetorics: New Rhetorics'', in Wolfgang Donsbach (ed.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching for the broadening of [[classical rhetorics|classical rhetorical canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Per example in ''Defining the New Rhetoric'' and ''Professing the New Rhetoric''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"&gt;New and Alternative Rhetorics - William DeGenaro, ''Who says?: working-class rhetoric, class consciousness, and community'', Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Rhetoric is a result of various efforts of bringing back rhetorics from the marginal status&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; it attained by its image and 'negative connotations' of "political lies, corporate spin, long list of Greek and Roman terms for patterns of expression no one knowingly uses, purple prose, boiler-plate arrangement schemas, unimaginative reproductions of bullshit and so on"&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George Pullman, ''Rhetorically Speaking, What’s New?'', Georgia State University, What is the New Rhetoric? conference&lt;/ref&gt; if not to its previous place of a discipline "associated with social and intellectual prestige"&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; then at least to the level of the other contemporary fields in the social, cultural and linguistic studies. Notoriously the field emerged after the work of [[Chaïm Perelman]] and [[Lucille Olbrechts-Tyteca]] in their book ''The New Rhetoric'' (1969)&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas M. Carr, Jr. ''Some Consequences of The New Rhetoric: A Critical Study'', Argumentation 7: 475-479, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; but both the notion and the idea for the need of "new" rhetoric, different from the "old" one can be traced to the works of [[Kenneth Burke]] - ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950) and ''Rhetoric - Old and New'' (1967),.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary M. White, [https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3113888/ Re-examining Kenneth Burke on "identification" in the "new" rhetoric],  dissertation @ Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;

What helped the emergence of New rhetoric was the ideas of the [[epistemic]] status of rhetoric, the notion of a clearly definable rhetorical core and other.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt;

New rhetorics attempts to preserve the original field but it also has tense relationship with it.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; For example, New Rhetoric attempts to break up with the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalistic]] and [[logocentric]] (i.e. [[patriarchal]]) [[Neo-Aristotelian]] analysis in favour of interplay between [[Text (literary theory)|text]] and [[Context (language use)|context]], but according to DeGenaro it does not succeed to place itself outside the "Western-patriarchal" with being unable to departure from "elite backgrounds and scopes of study"&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"/&gt; to a diversity of voices, topics, etc. This probably makes New Rhetoric rather a ground for the '''postmodern rhetoric'''&lt;ref&gt;Not the rhetoric of [[postmodernism]] but postmodern theory and analysis in rhetorics.&lt;/ref&gt; which "puts into question the identities of the speaker, the audience, and the messages that pass between them"&lt;ref name="Gary1"&gt;Gary E. Aylesworth, ''Rhetoric, Postmodern'' ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with evaluating the [[intersubjective]] philosophy&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry Brummett, ''Some Implications of "Process" or "Intersubjectivity": Postmodern Rhetoric'', Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Penn State University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherently accepted in the [[postmodern philosophy|postmodernistic philosophy]] idea that "differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by cancelling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or defaced in the course of traversing them."&lt;ref name="Gary2"&gt;Gary Aylesworth, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#8 Postmodernism]'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-English-based programming languages''' are computer [[programming language]]s that, unlike better-known programming languages, do not use keywords taken from, or inspired by, the [[English language|English]] vocabulary.

== Prevalence of English-based programming languages ==
{{further|English in computing}}

There has been an overwhelming trend in programming languages to use the English language to inspire the choice of [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s and code libraries. According to the HOPL online database of languages,&lt;ref&gt;In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.&lt;/ref&gt; out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]&lt;!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page --&gt;, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].

In other words, over a third of all programming languages were developed in a country with [[English language|English]] as the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English (see the case of [[Caml]], developed in France but using English keywords).

== International programming languages ==
[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]], and the standard allowed the internationalisation of the programming language itself.

On December 20, 1968, the "Final Report" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was made available also in [[Braille]]. ALGOL 68 went on to become the [[GOST|GOST/ГОСТ]]-27974-88 standard in the [[Soviet Union]].

In English, Algol68's ''reverent'' case statement reads '''case''' ~ '''in''' ~ '''out''' ~ '''esac'''. In [[Russian language|Russian]], this reads '''выб''' ~ '''в''' ~ '''либо''' ~ '''быв'''.

This civilization resulted from numerous exchanges in the cultural and scientific fields, based on the tolerance showed by the Normans towards the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking populations and the [[Muslim]] settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White, Jr.: "The Byzantinization of Sicily", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1 (1936), pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Sicily]] under the Normans became a crossroad for the interaction between the Norman and Latin [[Catholicism|Catholic]], Byzantine-[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and Arab-[[Islam]]ic cultures.

==Norman conquest of Southern Italy==

==Norman conquest of Sicily==
[[File:Christ Pantokrator, Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily.jpg|thumb|Byzantine-style mosaic of [[Christ Pantokrator]] in the [[Cefalù Cathedral]], erected by Roger II in 1131]]
In 965 [[Muslim]]s completed their [[History of Islam in southern Italy | conquest of Sicily]] from the [[Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]]  following the fall of the final significant Greek citadel of [[Taormina]] in 962.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Seventy three years later, in 1038, Byzantine forces began a reconquest of Sicily under the Greek general [[George Maniakes]]. This invasion relied on a number of [[Norsemen|Norse]] mercenaries, the [[Varangian Guard|Varangian]]s, including the future king of Norway [[Harald Hardrada]], as well as on several contingents of [[italo-Normans|Normans]]. Although Maniakes' death in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 cut the invasion short, the Normans followed up on the advances made by the Byzantines and completed the conquest of the island from the [[Saracens]]. The Normans had been expanding south, as mercenaries and adventurers, driven by the myth of a happy and sunny island in the Southern Seas.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman [[Robert Guiscard]], son of [[Tancred of Hauteville|Tancred]], [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|invaded Sicily]] in 1060. The island was split politically between three [[Arabs|Arab]] [[emirate|emir]]s, and the sizable [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Christian]] population rebelled against the ruling Muslims. One year later [[Messina]] fell to troops under the leadership of Roger Bosso (the brother of Robert Guiscard and the future Count [[Roger I of Sicily]]), and in 1071 the Normans took [[Palermo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art139.htm |title= Saracen Door and Battle of Palermo |publisher= Bestofsicily.com |date= 2004 |accessdate= 28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the cities, each with a splendid harbor, dealt a severe blow to Muslim power on the island. Eventually Normans took all of Sicily. In 1091, [[Noto]] in the southern tip of Sicily and the island of [[Malta]], the last Arab strongholds, fell to the Christians.

By the 11th century Muslim power in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] had begun to wane.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Charles William Previté-Orton|Previté-Orton]] (1971), pp. 507-511.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Norman rule, Palermo confirmed its role as one of the great capitals of Europe and the Mediterranean.

==Norman conquest of Africa==
{{Main article|Kingdom of Africa}}
[[File:Regnonormanno1160.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Kingdom of Africa" (''Regno d'Africa'') pinpointed in red]]
The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the [[Siculo-Norman]] state in the former [[Roman province of Africa]]{{efn|Before it was finally conquered by the Muslims, this province was reorganised as the [[Exarchate of Africa|Byzantine exarchate of Africa]].}} (''[[Ifrīqiya]]'' in [[Tunisian Arabic]]), corresponding to [[Tunisia]] and parts of [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] today.  The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim);&lt;ref&gt;All the Arabic sources can be found in Michele Amari, ''Biblioteca arabo-sicula'' (Rome and Turin: 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. According to Hubert Houben, since "Africa" was never mentioned in the royal title of the kings of Sicily, "one ought not to speak of a ‘Norman kingdom of Africa’."&lt;ref&gt;Houben, ''Roger II'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "[Norman Africa] really amounted to a constellation of Norman-held towns along coastal Ifrīqiya."&lt;ref name=dalli79&gt;Dalli, "Bridging Europe and Africa", 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under [[Roger II]] in 1146–48. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded.  Early in the reign of [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the "kingdom" of Africa fell to the [[Almohads]] (1158–60). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180.

An intense Norman-Arab-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] culture developed, exemplified by rulers such as [[Roger II of Sicily]], who had [[Islam]]ic soldiers, poets and scientists at his court,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; and had [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[Christodulus|Christodoulos]], the famous [[George of Antioch]], and finally [[Philip of Mahdia]], serve successively as his ''ammiratus ammiratorum'' ("emir of emirs").&lt;ref&gt;Abulafia, David (2011) ''The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean''. (London: Allen Lane). {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9934-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger II himself spoke [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] and was fond of [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; He used Arab and Byzantine Greek troops and siege engines in his campaigns in southern Italy, and mobilized Arab and Byzantine architects to help his Normans build monuments in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine style. The various agricultural and industrial techniques which had been introduced by the Arabs in Sicily during the preceding two centuries were kept and further developed, allowing for the remarkable prosperity of the Island.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Classical Greek works]], long lost to the Latin speaking West, were translated from Byzantine Greek manuscripts found in Sicily directly into Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. (ed.).  ''Science in the Middle Ages''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978. p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; For the following two hundred years, Sicily under Norman rule became a model which was widely admired throughout Europe and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

The English historian John Julius Norwich remarked of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Norman Sicily stood forth in Europe --and indeed in the whole bigoted medieval world-- as an example of tolerance and enlightenment, a lesson in the respect that every man should feel for those whose blood and beliefs happen to differ from his own."&lt;br /&gt;[[John Julius Norwich]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in History Edition of Best of Sicily Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During Roger II's reign, the Kingdom of Sicily became increasingly characterized by its multi-ethnic composition and unusual religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art171.htm |title=Normans in Sicilian History |publisher=Bestofsicily.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Normans, Langobards and native Sicilians, Muslim Arabs, and Orthodox Byzantine Greeks existed in a relative harmony for this time period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II&amp;nbsp;— Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=2007-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |publisher=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger II was known to have planned for the establishment of an Empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] and the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]] up until his death in 1154.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest geographical treatises of the Middle Ages was written for Roger II by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], and entitled [[Tabula Rogeriana|Kitab Rudjdjar]] ("The book of Roger").&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"&gt;Lewis, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 12th century, the population of Sicily is estimated to have been up to one-third [[Byzantine Greek]] speaking, with the remainder speaking [[Latin]] or [[Vulgar Latin]] dialects brought from mainland Italy ([[Gallo-Italic languages]] and [[Neapolitan language]]), [[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Sicilian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G. A. |title=The Latin Church in Norman Italy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |page=494 |isbn=978-0-521-25551-6 |quote={{ISBN|0-521-25551-1}}" "At the end of the twelfth century&amp;nbsp;... While in Apulia Greeks were in a majority – and indeed present in any numbers at all – only in the Salento peninsula in the extreme south, at the time of the conquest they had an overwhelming preponderance in Lucaina and central and southern Calabria, as well as comprising anything up to a third of the population of Sicily, concentrated especially in the north-east of the island, the Val Demone. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the language of the court was [[Old Norman]] or [[Old French]] ([[Langues d'oïl|Langue d'oïl]]), all royal edicts were written in the language of the people they were addressed to: [[Latin]], Byzantine Greek, Arabic, or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;Aube, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; Roger's royal mantel, used for his coronation (and also used for the coronation of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]), bore an inscription in Arabic with the [[Hijri year|Hijri]] date of 528 (1133–1134).

Islamic authors marvelled at the forbearance of the Norman kings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They [the Muslims] were treated kindly, and they were protected, even against the [[Franks]]. Because of that, they had great love for king Roger."&lt;br /&gt;[[Ibn al-Athir]]&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Aubé, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interactions continued with the succeeding Norman kings, for example under [[William II of Sicily]], as attested by the Spanish-Arab geographer [[Ibn Jubair]] who landed in the island after returning from a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1184. To his surprise, Ibn Jubair enjoyed a very warm reception by the Norman Christians. He was further surprised to find that even some Christians spoke Arabic and that several government officials were Muslim:&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attitude of the king is really extraordinary. His attitude towards the Muslims is perfect: he gives them employment, he choses his officers among them, and all, or almost all, keep their faith secret and can remain faithful to the faith of Islam. The king has full confidence in the Muslims and relies on them to handle many of his affairs, including the most important ones, to the point that the Great Intendant for cooking is a Muslim (...) His [[vizier]]s and [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]s are [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], of which there are many, who are the members of his government and on whom he relies for his private affairs."&lt;br /&gt;Ibn Jubair, ''Rihla''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lewis, p. 148, also Aube, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ibn Jubair mentioned that some Christians in Palermo wore the Muslim dress and spoke Arabic. The Norman kings continued to strike coins in Arabic with [[Hegira]] dates. The registers at the Royal court were written in Arabic.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt; At one point, William II of Sicily is recorded to have said: "Every one of you should invoke the one he adores and of whom he follows the faith".&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabo-NormanArchitecture.JPG|thumb|Arab-Norman art and architecture combined Occidental features (such as the Classical pillars and friezes) with typical Islamic decorations such as [[muqarnas]] and [[Arabic calligraphy|calligraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Numerous artistic techniques from the Byzantine and Islamic world were also incorporated to form the basis of Arab-Norman art: inlays in mosaics or metals, sculpture of [[ivory]] or [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sculpture of hard stones, bronze foundries, manufacture of silk (for which Roger II established a ''regium ergasterium'', a state enterprise which would give Sicily the monopoly of silk manufacture for all Western Europe).&lt;ref&gt;Aubé, pp. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt; During a raid on the Byzantine Empire, Roger II's admiral George of Antioch had transported the silk weavers from [[Thebes, Greece]], where they had formed a part of the, until then, closely guarded monopoly that was the [[Byzantine silk industry]].

===Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture===
{{Further|Byzantine architecture}}
{{Further|Norman architecture}}
[[File:Monreale-bjs-3.jpg|thumb|left|The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches of the [[Monreale]] cathedral are magnificently enriched with carving and colored [[inlay]], a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab]]

The new Norman rulers started to build various constructions in what is called the Arab-Norman style. They incorporated the best practices of Arab and Byzantine architecture into their own art.&lt;ref&gt;"Le genie architectural des Normands a su s’adapter aux lieux en prenant ce qu’il y a de meilleur dans le savoir-faire des batisseurs arabes et byzantins", ''Les Normands en Sicile'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of [[Saint-John of the Hermits]], was built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148 in such a style. The church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century. In her ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', [[Frances Minto Elliot|Frances Elliot]] described it as "... totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]". The bell tower, with four orders of arcaded loggias, is instead a typical example of [[Gothic architecture]].

[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|"The [[Cappella Palatina]], at Palermo, the most wonderful of Roger's churches, with Norman doors, Saracenic arches, Byzantine dome, and roof adorned with Arabic scripts, is perhaps the most striking product of the brilliant and mixed civilization over which the grandson of the Norman Trancred ruled" ([[EB1911]])]]

The [[Cappella Palatina]], also in Palermo, combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the [[Norman architecture]] and door decor, the Arabic arches and scripts adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian [[cross]].

The [[Monreale]] cathedral is generally described as "Norman-Arab-Byzantine". The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches are magnificently enriched with carving and colored inlay, a curious combination of three styles—Norman-French, Byzantine and Arab.

The [[Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio]] built in 1143 by Roger II's "emir of emirs" [[George of Antioch]] was originally consecrated as a [[Greek Orthodox]] church, according to its Greek-Arab bilingual foundation charter, and was built in the Byzantine [[Cross-in-square|Greek cross]] style with some Arab influences. Another unusual church from this period is the country church of [[Santi Pietro e Paolo d’Agrò]] in [[Casalvecchio Siculo]]; it has been described "one of the most sophisticated and coherent works of architecture to emerge from the Norman rule of the island".&lt;ref name=agro&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/22630|title=The architecture of the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo d'Agro, Sicily |last=Nicklies|first=Charles Edward|date=1992|website=Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship|publisher=University of Illinois|access-date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of Arab-Norman architecture include the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], or [[Castelbuono]]. This style of construction persisted until the 14th and the 15th century, exemplified by the use of the [[cupola]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', pp. 53–57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission to Europe==
{{main|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe}}

The points of contact between Europe and Islamic lands were multiple during the Middle Ages, with Sicily playing a key role in the transmission of knowledge to Europe, although less important than that of Spain.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"&gt;Lewis, p.149&lt;/ref&gt; The main points of transmission of Islamic knowledge to Europe were in Sicily, and in Islamic Spain, particularly in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (with [[Gerard of Cremone]], 1114–1187, following the conquest of the city by the Spanish Christians in 1085). Many exchanges also occurred in the Levant due to the presence of the [[Crusaders]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedel, p.110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Saint-John of the Hermits(1840Lithograph).JPG|thumb|An example of Arab-Norman architecture, combining Gothic walls with Islamic domes: [[Saint-John of the Hermits]] built in Palermo by Roger II around 1143–1148. 1840 lithography&lt;ref&gt;''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Arabic and Greek art and science continued to be influential in Sicily during the two centuries following the Norman conquest. Norman rule formally ended in 1198 with the reign of [[Constance of Sicily]], and was replaced by that of the [[Swabia]]n [[Hohenstaufen Dynasty]].

In 1224 however, Frederick II, responding to religious uprisings in Sicily, expelled all Muslims from the island, transferring many to [[Lucera]] over the next two decades. In this controlled environment, they couldn't challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called ''Lucaera Saracenorum'' because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. The colony thrived for 75 years until it was sacked in 1300 by Christian forces under the command of [[Charles II of Naples]]. The city's Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Julie Taylor. [http://www.umd.umich.edu/univ/ur/press_releases/nov03/taylorbook_pr.html Muslims in Medieval Italy: The Colony at Lucera] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100819071240/http://www.umd.umich.edu/univ/ur/press_releases/nov03/taylorbook_pr.html |date=2010-08-19 }}. Lanham, Md.: Lexington Books. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; with many finding asylum in [[Albania]] across the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ataullah Bogdan Kopanski. [http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/quran/albanian/Albchapt.htm Islamization of Shqeptaret: The clash of Religions in Medieval Albania.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125004644/http://www.iiu.edu.my/deed/quran/albanian/Albchapt.htm |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their abandoned mosques were destroyed or converted, and churches arose upon the ruins, including the cathedral S. Maria della Vittoria.

Even under [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]] (died in 1266) Islamic influence in Sicily persisted, but it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.149"/&gt; Latin progressively replaced Arabic and Greek, the last Sicilian document in the Arabic language is dated to 1245.&lt;ref name="Lewis, p.148"/&gt;

It was developed and popularized in [[Rome]], where metalworkers used it to make [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s and other similar designs. The technique involves punching holes in metal to simulate lattice patterns, openwork gold jewelry, and so on. Patterns were often drawn on the metal, and then various tools used to remove the desired pieces.

The technique may be referred more generically to as openwork or pierced work. The equivalent technique in Japan is called [[sukashibori]], and is found in Buddhist art.

'''''Papo &amp; Yo''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]], released on August 14, 2012 on the [[PlayStation 3]] via the [[PlayStation Network]]&lt;ref name=euroannounce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-03-papo-and-yo-announced-for-psn |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |author=Dutton, Fred |title=Papo &amp; Yo announced for PSN |date=June 3, 2011 | accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since April 18, 2013 on [[Microsoft Windows]] through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It was released on January 7, 2014 on [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] through the Humble Indie Bundle X.&lt;ref name=humbleindiebundlexannounce/&gt; The game involves a young Brazilian boy Quico who, while hiding from his abusive, alcoholic father, finds himself taken to a dream-like [[favela]], and meeting a normally docile creature, Monster. The player, as Quico, can interact with Monster and manipulate the buildings of the favela in unique ways, such as by stacking individual shacks on each other, to complete puzzles and progress in the game. ''Papo &amp; Yo'' was designed by Vander Caballero, who created the story based on his own past in dealing with an abusive, alcoholic father.

== Gameplay ==
The game takes place in an unspecified Brazilian [[favela]] which the player has to navigate. The player takes on the role of Quico, a young boy who has run away from his home to escape his abusive and alcoholic father. Quico has the ability to turn the environment into a magical and dream-like world. For example, tugging a glowing thread can pull a stairway out of the side of a building, lifting a cardboard box can cause an entire building to come unmoored from its foundations, shacks can sprout legs and scuttle into place to provide a handy bridge. According to [[Ars Technica]]'s website "there's a sense of childlike imagination at play in the way the game adds a layer of magic into the rundown world, and it's likely to make you look at your own surroundings a little differently after you play".&lt;ref name=arstechnicareview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/08/review-papo-yos-dream-like-fable-will-stick-with-you/ |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |last=Orland |first=Kyle |title=Review: Papo &amp; Yo's dreamlike fable will stick with you |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key elements of the game is Monster, a giant that Quico discovers while navigating through the slums. Monster at first appears to be very kind and helpful. He can be made to hold down pressure plates and his belly can be used as a super-trampoline to reach rooftops. Monster has an addiction for eating frogs and if he eats one he becomes a fiery, raging beast that will damage anything around him, even Quico if he cannot get away quickly enough. The player can use a fruit to calm him.&lt;ref name=lubbockonlinereview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/technology/2012-09-09/review-papo-yo-tells-tale-abuse#.UEw1CNJ26So |publisher=LubbockOnline |last=Kesten |first=Lou |title=Review: 'Papo &amp; Yo' tells tale of abuse |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Quico is a young Brazilian boy that has been abused by his alcoholic father. While hiding in his closet during one of his father's drunken rages, clutching his favorite toy, a robot doll named Lula, Quico discovers a strange chalk mark on the wall, and touching it, finds himself taken to a dream-like world. There, a young girl named Alejandra initially sees Quico as a threat, but comes to be a guide. Lula also becomes animated and helps guide Quico through the world.

Quico eventually comes upon a giant lumbering creature, simply known as Monster. Alejandra and Lula warn Quico about the dangers of Monster, but Quico finds the creature docile and playful. However, when Monster eats a frog, it becomes enraged, chasing after Quico until he can calm it with a rotten fruit. They proceed through the dream world, but during one episode when Monster is enraged, it damages Lula. Alejandra directs Quico to a temple where they can use the anger from Monster to revive Lula, but this requires luring the creature into giant traps meant to hurt it. Quico completes this task, and Lula is successfully revived, but the three are now chased by Monster. Alejandra is eventually caught and eaten by Monster, but not before she directs Quico to go to the Shaman to help cure the Monster.

During these scenes, there are brief periods where Quico awakes in a dream and witnesses a past memory: that of his father accidentally running over a person with his car in a dark rainstorm. One such scene shows his father's shadow as that of Monster.

Quico guides Monster to a sky-tram like device but Lula is forced to stay behind to operate it. The tram ends at the Shaman, but Quico finds there is no Shaman, only the memories of his father, and showing that he had fallen into his alcoholic and abusive state after the accident; Monster represents Quico's imagination of his father, while the frogs are a substitute for his father's alcoholism. A voice warns him that Monster cannot be cured and Quico must let him go. After calming Monster to sleep, Quico reluctantly pushes Monster into an abyss, and then follows a path that returns him back to his closet in the real world.

"'''Remember Me'''" is the 79th episode of the [[first-run syndication|syndicated]] American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', the fifth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 4)|fourth season]].

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]]. This episode focuses on the ship's chief medical officer, [[Beverly Crusher|Dr. Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]), who notices that her friends — and every trace of them — are vanishing around her.

==Plot==
The ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' docks at Starbase 133, where [[Beverly Crusher|Dr. Beverly Crusher]] ([[Gates McFadden]]) greets her elderly friend and mentor, Dr. Dalen Quaice ([[Bill Erwin]]).  After taking him to his quarters discussing the loss of old friends, Dr. Crusher visits her son Ensign [[Wesley Crusher]] ([[Wil Wheaton]]) in Engineering.  Wesley attempts to create a [[static warp bubble]] but the experiment appears to fail.  As the ''Enterprise'' leaves Starbase, Dr. Crusher finds that Dr. Quaice seems to have gone missing, with no record of him coming aboard the ship.  As she performs a medical test on transporter chief [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]] ([[Colm Meaney]]), she realizes that her medical staff are missing; further investigation and discussion with the crew shows that she has always worked alone in [[sick bay]].

Dr. Crusher continues to try to track down the disappearing people, and finds more and more crew members that she remembers being completely unknown to the crew or the computer.  At one point, a vortex appears near Dr. Crusher and attempts to pull her in, but she is able to hold on to a fixture until it dissipates; the ship shows no record of the vortex's appearance when she investigates.  Eventually, no one but [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and herself remain on the ship, but Picard believes that the situation is normal.  Dr. Crusher orders the computer to give Picard's vital signs over the ship's speakers so that she knows he is still there, but shortly thereafter even he disappears.  Then the vortex reappears, and once again tries to claim Beverly.  She is blown across the bridge, but she manages to hang onto [[Data (Star Trek)|Commander Data]]'s ([[Brent Spiner]]) chair until the vortex disappears.

At this point, the viewer is shown the actual ''Enterprise'', where Wesley had successfully created the warp bubble, accidentally trapping his mother within it. With the warp bubble collapsing rapidly, Wesley's fears lead [[Traveler (Star Trek)|The Traveler]] ([[Eric Menyuk]]) to appear and help Wesley attempt to stabilize the bubble. The Traveler recommends the ''Enterprise'' return to the Starbase, where the warp bubble was formed and may be more stable.

Within the warp bubble, Dr. Crusher attempts to direct the ''Enterprise'' to the home planet of the Traveler, but soon finds the ship is unable to set that destination as it no longer exists. More of the universe she knows disappears, soon leaving only the ''Enterprise''. She recognizes the shape as being that of Wesley's warp bubbles, and determines that she is trapped, the earlier vortex being the ''Enterprise'' crew's first attempt to save her. As the warp bubble shrinks, erasing parts of the ''Enterprise'', she races for Engineering, the center of the warp bubble, and finds a vortex waiting there. She jumps in at the last moment, finding herself back in Engineering along with Picard, Wesley, and the Traveler. After assuring herself that everyone she knows, including her guest Dr. Quaice, is aboard the ''Enterprise'', she thanks the Traveler for his help.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4523">In [[Māori culture]], a '''rāhui''' is a form of [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] restricting access to, or use of, an area or resource by unauthorised persons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/Conservation/KaitiakitangaGuardianshipAndConservation/6/en Rāhui – prohibitions]&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of the [[Fisheries Act 1996|1996 Fisheries Act]], a rāhui can also be imposed by the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fish.govt.nz/en-nz/Press/Press+Releases+2002/September+2002/Rahui+To+Protect+Kaikoura+Coastline.htm  "Rahui To Protect Kaikoura Coastline", 17 September 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Cook Islands, Raui (rahui) have been put in place by the National Environment Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931672644|title=The Rahui : legal pluralism in Polynesian traditional management of resources and territories|others=Bambridge, Tamatoa,|isbn=9781925022919|location=Acton, A.C.T.|oclc=931672644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rāhui may be imposed for many reasons, including a perceived need for conservation of food resources or because the area concerned is in a state of 'tapu', due, for example, to a recent death in the area, out of respect for the dead and to prevent the gathering of food there for a specified period.&lt;ref&gt;Rerekura, E., "[https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/280496/iwi-puts-rahui-in-place-after-death-at-tora Iwi puts rāhui in place after death at Tora]," ''Radio New Zealand'', 4 August 2015. Retrieved 15 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Rāhui may be placed on land, sea, rivers, forests, gardens, fishing grounds, and other food resources. A rāhui is given its authority by the [[mana]] of the person or group that imposes it. (Barlow 1994:104).

An area may be set aside for a special purpose or function. Trees may be set aside as a carving resource; or flax bushes for the weaving of a special cloak for a chief. Areas may be placed under rāhui requiring them to be left to lie fallow so that the resources may regenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26130392|title=Tikanga whakaaro : key concepts in Māori culture|last=Cleve.|first=Barlow,|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195582128|location=Auckland, N.Z.|pages=105|oclc=26130392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of rāhui is still used today, and it has similarities to the bans imposed by the present day legal system on the gathering of food resources for conservation purposes; however Māori often perceive such bans on the gathering of traditional resources such as shellfish and native birds as 'another denial of their customary rights.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26130392|title=Tikanga whakaaro : key concepts in Māori culture|last=Cleve.|first=Barlow,|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195582128|location=Auckland, N.Z.|pages=106|oclc=26130392}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A sign or physical symbol may be displayed to show that a rāhui has been imposed. Sometimes a carved or decorated wooden stick or post may be placed in the ground. Natural features of the landscape can indicate the boundaries of the area that is under restriction. Additionally, people will be informed about the placing of the rāhui.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26130392|title=Tikanga whakaaro : key concepts in Māori culture|last=Cleve.|first=Barlow,|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195582128|location=Auckland, N.Z.|pages=105-106|oclc=26130392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposing of rāhui by Māori [[iwi]] has no official legal standing, and penalties are not formally imposed upon anyone breaking a rāhui,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/92192173/rahui-placed-over-area-where-body-of-dunedin-woman-nic-hedley-was-found Rahui placed over area where body of Dunedin woman Nic Hedley was found]," ''stuff.co.nz'', 3 May 2017. Retrieved 15 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is seen as culturally insensitive to do so, and in general all members of the public tend to respect the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11975399 Rahui clears Waimarama Beach after drowning]," ''New Zealand Herald'', 15 January 2018.

Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  They used SSSM as a reference to [[social science]] philosophies related to the [[blank slate]], [[relativism]], [[social constructionism]], and [[cultural determinism]]. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical [[paradigm]] in the development of the [[social science]]s during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Feb. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP) in general.

== Alleged proponents ==
[[Steven Pinker]] names several prominent scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[John Money]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative theoretical paradigm: the integrated model ==
The authors of ''The Adapted Mind'' have argued&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992). The adapted mind.{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the [[computational theory of mind]].  Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).

Tooby and Cosmides&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992){{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Social Science Model !! Integrated Model
|-
| Humans born a blank slate || Humans are born with a bundle of emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations
|-
| Brain is a "general-purpose" computer  || Brain is a collection of modular, domain-specific processors
|-
| Culture/socialization programs behavior || Behavior is the result of interactions between evolved psychological mechanisms and cultural and environmental influences
|-
| Cultures free to vary any direction on any trait || Culture itself is based on a universal human nature and is constrained by it

== Criticisms ==

{{POV|date=June 2014}}

Richardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a [[Rhetoric device|rhetorical technique]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology. They want us to accept a dichotomy between what they call the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM) and the "Integrated Causal Model" (ICM) they favor ... it offers a false dichotomy between a manifestly untenable view and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Richardson |first1= Robert C. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA176 |edition= |year= 2007 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-262-18260-7 |page= 176 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Wallace (2010) has also suggested the SSSM to be a false dichotomy and claims that "scientists in the EP tradition wildly overstate the influence and longevity of what they call the Standard Social Science Model (essentially, [[behaviorism]]) of human cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallace |first= Brendan |authorlink= |title= Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won't Work |url= |accessdate= |year= 2010 |publisher= Imprint Academic |location= Exeter |isbn= 978-1-84540-207-5 |page= 136 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] argues that the SSSM is based on a [[straw man]]. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as "completely untenable". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and needs. Thus, he challenges Pinker's assertion that the view of the mind among all social scientists is a [[tabula rasa]]. Moreover, Sampson only conditionally agrees that the scientists Pinker associates with the SSSM, such as Skinner, Watson,{{who|reason=who is this particular watson?|date=November 2018}} and Mead, were influential, stating, "to identify them as responsible for the general tone of intellectual life for eighty years seems comical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sampson |first1= Geoffrey |authorlink1= Geoffrey Sampson |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url= |edition= |year= 2009 |publisher= Continuum |location= London |isbn= 978-0-8264-7384-4 |page= |pages= 134–5 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Neil Levy appears to concur with Sampson's straw man thesis regarding the conception of the SSSM, against which evolutionary psychologists direct much of their criticism. Levy writes: "No-one—not even Skinner and his followers—has ever believed in the blank slate of Pinker's title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Levy |first1= Neil |last2= |first2= |year= 2004 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |pages= 459–72|publisher= [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi= 10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] has criticized Tooby and Cosmides' arbitrary exclusion of [[economics]] and [[political science]] from their SSSM model, which Rose argues is "rather like excluding physiology and biochemistry from an account of the life sciences". She also states that Tooby and Cosmides have publicly indicted [[Sociology|sociologists]] and [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] of inappropriate separatist behavior towards other academic disciplines while ignoring their newer efforts that demonstrate the complete opposite. Rose notes how sociologists and anthropologists have many new developments that involve study of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and technology. Furthermore, Rose suggests that Tooby and Cosmides' characterization of scientists like Gould, Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] as SSSM adherents is based on an inaccurate reading of works like ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', two books that have explored the interplay between biology and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rose |first= Hilary |authorlink= Hilary Rose (sociologist) |title= Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |editor1-last= Rose |editor1-first= Steven |editor2-last= Rose |editor2-first= Hilary |chapter= Colonising the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= https://books.google.fr/books?id=HQthCC191y8C&amp;pg=PT203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |isbn= 978-0-09-928319-5 |year= 2001 |pages= 203–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Hampton (2004) contends that evolutionary psychologists' account of the SSSM misses the debate on the existence of psychological [[instinct]]s in the early part of the 20th century. He argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;psychological and behavioural thinkers have for long periods been immersed in the implications of Darwinism. It is plainly and factually incorrect for evolutionary psychology to deny this. And it is disingenuous to down-play it. Evolutionary psychologists who use the term "Standard Social Science Model" and rhetorical equivalents such as "the neo-behaviourist tradition" ... and "the tabula rasa view" ... undermine their own much-vaunted rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hampton |first= Simon Jonathan | date = 2004 |title= The instinct debate and the standard social science model |journal= Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender |volume= 6 |issue= 1|pages= 15–44 | publisher= Routledge |doi= 10.1080/14616660412331279657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''surcoat''' or '''surcote''' initially was an outer garment commonly worn in the [[Middle Ages]] by both men and women in Western Europe. It can either refer to a coat worn over other clothes or the outermost garment itself. The name derives from [[French language|French]] meaning "over the coat", a long, loose, often sleeveless coat reaching down to the feet.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, pp. 14, 23, 24, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Men's surcoat===
From about the 12th century, [[knight]]s wore long, flowing surcoats, frequently emblazoned with their personal [[Coat of arms|arms]], over their [[armor]]. These usually extended to about midcalf, had slits in the bottom front and back, thus allowing the wearer to ride comfortably and were either sleeved or sleeveless. Historians believe that the practice of wearing white ones was adopted during the Crusades, their main purpose of reflecting the direct sun, which overheated it (and the soldier inside); while in poor weather they helped keep rain and the muck of battle away from the easily corroded mail links; although it may be argued that here its color would have been of little help. The surcoat displayed the device of the [[knight]] (origin of the term "[[coat of arms]]") thus identifying him; which in turn, combined with the increased use of the [[great helm]] (late 12th century, early 13th century) became an essential means of recognition. Indeed, some historians cite this as one of the reasons behind the spread of [[heraldry]] across [[medieval Europe]]. During the 13th century, knights began to add plates of armour to their surcoats, that subsequently became the [[medieval]] [[coat of plates]]. In the early fourteenth century, the front of the knight's surcoat was shortened, so that it was longer at the back, knee-length at the front; thus allowing greater freedom of movement, and eliminating the danger of a rider getting his spurs caught in the garment. By the mid-fourteenth century it was replaced with the "jupon" (or "gipon"), a much shorter item, often padded for supplementary protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr|first=E.|year=1873|title=The National History of England|volume=1|publisher=William Collins, Sons &amp; Company|location=London &amp; Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0oBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA386|accessdate=2011-04-06 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, once suits of plate armour became common, the surcoat was phased out of use.  The period in the history of armour development, in which surcoats became increasingly rare, is referred to as the "surcoatless period" (1420-1485).

===Women's surcoat===
Women began wearing surcoats during the 13th century, both with and without sleeves.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=Paul B.|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786450527|pages=115-116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular style, known as the sideless surcoat, developed as a fashion in the 14th century. This was a sleeveless, floor-length garment featuring exaggerated armholes, which at their most extreme were open from shoulder to hip, revealing the gown underneath. The narrow strip covering the torso, known as the plackard,&lt;ref name="cumming"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumming|first1=Valerie|last2=Cunnington|first2=C. W.|last3=Cunnington|first3=P. E.|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|date=2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=9780857851437|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e3evAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|page=186|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was usually no more than a foot wide. The style drew criticism from some moralists, who thought the garment drew an inappropriate amount of attention to the female body.&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; Despite this, sideless surcoats continued to be worn as ceremonial dress well into the 15th century, long after they had ceased to be fashionable. Some estimates place them being worn as state apparel as late as 1525.&lt;ref name="cumming"/&gt;

'''''Travel Holiday''''', formerly ''Travel'', was an American travel magazine, published from 1901 to 2003.

==History and profile==
The magazine was first published in 1901&lt;ref name=mpa&gt;{{cite web|title=Defunct or Suspended Magazines, 2003|url=http://www.magazine.org/insights-resources/research-publications/trends-data/magazine-industry-facts-data/2003-defunct-or|work=The Association of Magazine Media|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ''Four-Track News'' by the [[New York Central Railroad]]. It was sold in 1906, and went bankrupt in 1946. The magazine was bought out of bankruptcy by Herman Shane.

'''Upholstery''' is the work of providing [[furniture]], especially [[chair|seat]]s, with [[padding]], [[Spring (device)|spring]]s, [[webbing]], and [[textile|fabric]] or [[leather]] covers. The word ''upholstery'' comes from the [[Middle English]] word ''upholder'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English | year=1977 | publisher=Routledtge | isbn=978-0-415-05077-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;pg=PA3633&amp;dq=etymology+upholster&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urFETovmJM628QP74dzOBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=3633}} New edition of 4th Revised edition (5 Sep 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to an [[artisan]] who held up their goods. The term is equally applicable to [[wikt:domestic|domestic]], [[automobile]], [[airplane]] and [[boat]] furniture, and can be applied to [[mattress]]es, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design. A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer. An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer. Traditional upholstery uses materials like [[Upholstery coil springs|coil springs]] (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), [[coir]], straw and hay, [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian]]s, linen [[Scrim (material)|scrim]]s, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up. In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like [[dacron]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], serpentine springs, and so on.

==History==
[[File:George Jacob Hunzinger, American, born Germany, 1835-1898. Armchair, designed 1869 patented March 30, 1869. Wood, original upholstery.jpg|thumbnail|left|'''George Jacob Hunzinger''', Armchair, designed 1869. Patented March 30, 1869. Wood, original upholstery. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
''Upholder'' is an archaic term used for "upholsterer", but it appears to have a connotation of ''repairing'' furniture rather than creating new upholstered pieces from scratch ([[shoemaking|cobbler]] vs. [[cordwainer]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th-century London, upholders frequently served as [[interior decorators]] responsible for all aspects of a room's decor.&lt;ref name="James, History" &gt;[[#James, Upholstery|James, Upholstery]], p.13&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals were members of the [[Worshipful Company of Upholders]], whose traditional role, prior to the 18th century, was to provide upholstery and textiles and the fittings for funerals. In the great London furniture-making partnerships of the 18th century, a [[cabinet-maker]] usually paired with an upholder: [[Vile and Cobb]], [[Ince and Mayhew]], [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] and [[James Rannie|Rannie]] or [[Thomas Haig|Haig]].

In the US, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and [[Hickory, North Carolina]] are centers for furniture manufacture along with Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire (England) and many of the best upholsterers can still be found there. These artisans continue to create or recreate many antique and modern pieces of furniture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Furniture reupholstery continues to thrive in the UK with several businesses small and large providing these services.

==Types==
===Traditional upholstery===
Traditional upholstery is a craft which evolved over centuries for padding and covering [[chair]]s, seats and [[couch|sofas]], before the development of sewing machines, synthetic fabrics and [[plastic foam]]. Using a solid wood or webbed platform, it can involve the use of [[spring (device)|springs]], lashings, stuffings of animal hair, grasses and coir, wools, hessians, scrims, bridle ties, stuffing ties, blind stitching, top stitching, flocks and wadding all built up by hand.&lt;ref name="traditionaltechniques"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plumbsreupholstery.co.uk/reupholstery/techniques/index.php | title=Traditional Upholstery Techniques | publisher = Plumbs | accessdate = 30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:upholsterychair.jpg|thumb|left|A stripped chair ready to be upholstered.]]
In the Middle Ages, domestic interiors were becoming more comfortable and upholstery was playing an important part in interior decoration. The decorations consisted mainly of what we would now consider as "soft furnishings", though there were simple platforms of webbing, canvas or leather for stools, chairs and elaborately decorated coverings that already demonstrated the rudimentary beginnings of upholstered furniture. By the beginning of the 17th century chair seats were being padded, but this form of upholstery was still fairly basic. All sorts of stuffings from sawdust, grass, feathers, to deer, goat or horsehair were used, although in England the Livery Company forbade the use of goat and deer hair and imposed fines for misdemeanors. The stuffing was heaped on a wooden platform and held in place with a decorative top fabric and nails. This produced a simple dome shape sloping towards the seat. Only towards the end of the 17th century did upholsterers start to develop the techniques that would distribute and shape the stuffing into more controlled shapes. Curled [[horsehair]] was being used more consistently for stuffing that was easier to hold in place with stitches in twine that were developed from saddlery techniques. Thus layers of stuffing could be distributed evenly and secured to stay in place. On a basic level, squab cushions were made more stable by using tufting ties. Stuffed edge rolls appeared on seat fronts providing support for cushions to be retained and later for deeper stuffing to be held in place under a fixed top cover.&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;Gates, Dorothy, ''Essential Guide to Upholstery'', Merehurst Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p12}}

What we now think of as "classic" upholstery shapes and techniques flourished in the 18th century. Frames of elegant line and proportion were sympathetically matched by expertly executed upholstery. By now, the upholsterers' technical knowledge meant that stuffing's could be controlled along upright and sloping lines, giving new levels of comfort and a simply stated elegance. Later in the century, the border was replaced by a single piece of [[linen]] or [[scrim (material)|scrim]] taken over the stuffed seat and tacked to the frame. At the same time the locked blind stitch and top-stitching combination (pulling the side and top surfaces together and bringing the stuffing up to make a firm top edge) had evolved.&lt;ref name=Gates/&gt;{{rp|p15}}

In the Victorian era, fashions of opulence and comfort gave rise to excesses of stuffing and padding. Mass production techniques made upholstered [[furniture]] available in large quantity to all sections of society. The availability of better-quality steel springs and the development of lashing techniques enabled upholstery to be built up on seats, backs and arms quite independently of the frame shape. Stuffings became even more complex, edges became elaborately shaped into rolls and scrolls and fabrics were folded into soft padded shapes by means of buttoning.&lt;ref name=Gates/&gt;{{rp|p12}}

===Automobile upholstery===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
[[Image:RL Seat.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A typical [[leather]]-upholstered [[car seat]].]]
[[File:Riva junior.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[motorboat]] [[cockpit]].]]
An automotive upholsterer, also known as a trimmer, coach trimmer or motor trimmer, shares many of the skills required in upholstery, in addition to being able to work with carpet.

The term coach trimmer derives from the days when car frames were produced by manufacturers and delivered to [[coach builder]]s to add a [[car body]] and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, [[soft top]]s, and [[automobile roof|roof]] linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were often an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.

Many automotive trimmers now work either in automotive design or with aftermarket trim shops carrying out repairs, restorations or conversions for customers directly. A few high-quality motor car manufacturers still employ trimmers, for example, [[Aston Martin]].

===Commercial upholstery===
This is the type of upholstery work offered to businesses. Examples would be restaurant seating consisting of booth seats, dining room chairs, bar stools, etc. Also churches, including but not limited to pews and chairs for the congregation, hospitals and clinics consisting of medical tables, chiropractic tables, dental chairs, etc. Also common to this type of upholstery would be lobby and waiting-area seating. Upholstered walls are found in some retail premises.

===Marine upholstery===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
Upholsterers may be called upon to repair or replace seating, cushions, cabin furnishings, headliners and even carpeting on boats.

Marine upholstery differs in that one has to consider dampness, sunlight and hard usage. There are many sources for marine grade vinyls such as Spradling and Morbern and they come in hundreds of colors and styles now.

Each style of marine grade vinyl is rated according to cold crack, rub counts, and mold resistance.
Stainless-steel hardware such as staples, screws must be used to prevent rust and early break down of hardware and fasteners. The newest products for fastening vinyl in marine applications are Tenara thread and Monel staples. Any wood used must be of marine quality.

Usually a high-resiliency, high-density plastic foam with a thin film of plastic over it is used to keep out water that might get by the seams. Closed-cell foam is used on smaller cushions which can, sometimes, double as flotation devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3730">'''William Ashbless''' is a fictional poet, invented by [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] writers [[James Blaylock]] and [[Tim Powers]].

Ashbless was invented by Powers and Blaylock when they were students at [[California State University, Fullerton|Cal State Fullerton]] in the early 1970s, originally as a reaction to the low quality of the poetry being published in the school magazine. They invented nonsensical [[free verse]] poetry and submitted it to the paper in Ashbless's name, where it was reportedly enthusiastically accepted. 

{{Quote|text=The college paper printed poetry, and it was close enough to the ’60s that the poetry was all just horrible free verse about children and flowers and rainbows. So we figured we could write poetry that would sound very portentous but be, in fact, meaningless. … We needed a name for our poet and [came up with] ‘Ashbless.’ The paper published them, so we wrote another lot that was dumber, and they published that. … We said [Ashbless] was hideously deformed and couldn’t attend any readings or meetings, but he had given us these poems to read in his stead. … Blaylock and I would often break out laughing in the middle of reading them, which people thought was very insensitive of us, to be laughing at the poetical efforts of our deformed friend. |author=Tim Powers on William Ashbless |source=&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/01/geeks-guide-tim-powers/ ''How to Construct the Ultimate Conspiracy Theory'', Wired Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Ashbless is, however, best known in his incarnation as a 19th-century poet, in which guise he appears in Powers' ''[[The Anubis Gates]]'' (1983) and as a lesser character in Blaylock's ''[[The Digging Leviathan]]'' (1984). Neither author was aware that the other's novel contained a William Ashbless until the coincidence was noticed by the editor responsible for both books, who suggested that the two consult one another so that their references would be consistent.

In 1985, Powers and Blaylock produced ''Offering the Bicentennial Edition of the Complete Twelve Hours of the Night: 1785-1985'', a prospectus for a non-existent collection of Ashbless poetry, published by [[Cheap Street]] Press. ("The Twelve Hours of the Night" had been mentioned in ''The Anubis Gates'' as Ashbless's most famous work.) The prospectus included a sample poem and a replica of Ashbless's signature (the "William" was signed by one, and the "Ashbless" by the other, of the authors). This was followed in 2001 by ''On Pirates'' ({{ISBN|1-931081-22-0}}) — supposedly written by Ashbless, with an introduction by Powers, an afterword by Blaylock, and illustrations by [[Gahan Wilson]] — and in 2002 by ''The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook''.

In his 1992 novel ''[[Last Call (novel)|Last Call]]'' ({{ISBN|0-688-10732-X}}), Tim Powers includes a poem attributed to William Ashbless in the introduction to Book One. The poem is "from" a later time period: it mentions airplanes, cars and blue jeans.

'''Zapp Brannigan''' is a [[fictional character]] in the animated [[sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]''. He is voiced by [[Billy West]], but was originally intended to be voiced by [[Phil Hartman]], with West taking over the role after Hartman's death. The character is based on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' captain [[James T. Kirk]], played by [[William Shatner]]. The show's executive producer [[David X. Cohen]] has described Brannigan as "half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner".

Brannigan is a 25-Star General in the [[D.O.O.P.|Democratic Order of Planets]], and captain of its flagship, the ''Nimbus''. He is first introduced in the fourth episode of the series, "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]", in which he plays a major role. In the episode, Brannigan becomes enamored with [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], whom he attempts to woo for the remainder of the series. Brannigan is portrayed as a respected military hero in the eyes of his superiors and the general public, but strongly disliked by his own crew, most notably his long suffering second-in-command, [[Kif Kroker]]. Though famed for his bravery and strategic genius, it soon becomes very apparent that he is sexist, vain, stupid and often very cowardly and inept.

==Role in ''Futurama''==
{{In-universe|section|date=April 2012}}
Brannigan is a senior member of the military of the Democratic Order of Planets ([[D.O.O.P.]]) though his title varies; he has been referred to as a "25-star [[General]]", Captain, "General Major [[Cub Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Webelo]]", "Rear Brigadier", and "[[Commodore 64]]." Brannigan is widely revered in military circles for his numerous victories over hostile aliens. However, almost all of these victories tend to come from using excessive force to subdue comically weak opponents, or the use of tactics that rely on large numbers and wanton disregard for the safety of his men.

Soon after first meeting him, [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] has sex with him. He mentions this encounter repeatedly in later episodes while remaining convinced that Leela lusts after him despite her vocal (and often violent) opposition to the idea.

Brannigan's Law forbids interfering with an undeveloped planet, a parody of the [[Prime Directive]] from ''Star Trek''. Brannigan himself does not pretend to understand it, he merely enforces it, and even fails to uphold it on at least one occasion.&lt;ref name="Drawn To TV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker| first=M. Keith|title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy|pages=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brannigan's Law is officially called ''Directive B10.8:1''. According to Brannigan, "Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: hard and fast".

In "[[Brannigan, Begin Again]]", Zapp was stripped of his command and court-martialed, but was reinstated as captain of the ''Nimbus'' over the course of the same episode.

The '''''Nimbus''''', BP-[[1729 (number)|1729]], is the [[flagship]] of the fleet of the D.O.O.P. under Brannigan's command. The ''Nimbus'' is an extremely large vessel, capable of blockading or besieging entire [[planet]]s single-handedly, and of transporting armies large enough for the pacification of the planet, all without the aid of support vessels. It is a parody of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''.

==Character==

===Creation===
Brannigan is based on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' captain [[James T. Kirk]], played by [[William Shatner]];&lt;ref name="Drawn To TV"/&gt; Brannigan and Shatner meet face-to-face in the episode "[[Where No Fan Has Gone Before]]". The creators of the series envisioned Brannigan as similar to what Shatner himself would be like as a starship captain. Cohen describes him as being "half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner", and that the initial premise for the character was "What if the real William Shatner was the captain of the ''Enterprise'' instead of Kirk?". In the episode "[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]" the DVD audio commentary describes Zapp Brannigan's reinterpretation of "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" as a spoken word song as a reference to what William Shatner did with "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]". Brannigan also wears a [[girdle]] to appear thinner and in another episode nearly loses his [[toupee]], seemingly a parody of similar accusations aimed at Shatner. Originally Brannigan was to appear fatter in every shot throughout the first episode in which he appeared, but the animators were so disgusted by his ultimate appearance that the idea was dropped.&lt;ref name=1ACV04&gt;{{cite video|people=Cohen, David X.; Groening, Matt; Kelley, Brian; Sheesley, Brian; Moore, Rich; Vanzo, Scott; DiMaggio, John|date=2002|title=Futurama: Volume One DVD commentary for the episode "[[Love's Labours Lost in Space]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|quote=Oh, the gut was supposed to grow and grow over each scene, but it got a little too grotesque, so we had to pull it back a bit. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brannigan's DOOP uniform is very similar to that of [[Magnus, Robot Fighter]] but he bears no other relation to that character.

===Voice===
Zapp Brannigan is voiced by [[Billy West]], though he was originally intended to be voiced by [[Phil Hartman]].&lt;ref name="TV Squad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/15/billy-west-the-tv-squad-interview| title=Billy West: The TV Squad Interview| author=Joel Keller|date=2006-06-15| accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman insisted on auditioning for the role, and "of course, just nailed it" according to creator [[Matt Groening]]. However, due to Hartman's murder, West was given the role. On a ''[[Futurama]]'' DVD commentary, Groening reveals that Zapp's character and mannerisms were established in West's original audition for the character, and any similarity to Phil Hartman or his other well known cartoon characters ([[Lionel Hutz]] and [[Troy McClure]]) is simply coincidence. On the other hand, in an interview for the website [[TV Squad]], Billy West states that his Zapp Brannigan is an imitation of Hartman and also "modeled after a couple of big dumb announcers I knew."&lt;ref name="TV Squad" /&gt;
