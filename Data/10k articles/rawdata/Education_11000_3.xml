{{grading}}
In [[South Africa]], the grading system used in secondary schools until 2008 (when the education minister implemented [[Outcomes Based Education]] or OBE curriculum) was as follows:

*Code 7 (A Symbol): 80 - 100% 
*Code 6 (B Symbol): 70 - 79%
*Code 5 (C Symbol): 60 - 69%
*Code 4 (D Symbol): 50 - 59% 
*Code 3 (E Symbol): 40 - 49%
*Code 2 (F Symbol): 30 - 39%
*Code 1 (FF Symbol): 0 - 29%

The OBE system, when in its experimental stages, originally used a scale from 1 - 4 (a pass being a 3 and a '1st class pass' being above 70%), but this system was considered far too coarse and replaced by a scale from 1 to 7.

For the final standard exams, a 'normal pass' is given for an average mark 50%-59%, and a distinction is given for an average of 80% or more.

Most universities follow a model based on the British system. Thus, at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa (UNISA), the percentages are calibrated as follows: a 1st class pass is given for 75% and above, a second (division one) for 70 - 74%, a second (division two) for 60%-69%, and a third for 50 - 59%. Any lower than 40% is a fail. The University of the Witwatersrand considers an A to be 75% and above.

'''Actors Comedy Studio''' is a [[sitcom]] and [[audition]] technique acting school in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The school was founded in 2011 by [[Gunnar Todd Rohrbacher]] and Lauren Bertoni. The program primarily focuses on acting for sitcoms and audition technique.

==Class Format==
Actors Comedy Studio was created as a counterpoint to the [[improvisational]] and [[sketch comedy]] training that has "proliferated massively in Los Angeles."&lt;ref&gt;Strassberg, Rebecca. "1 Thing Every Aspiring Sitcom Actor Must Know." ''Backstage West''. Backstage West, 21 Oct. 2014. Web. 30 Apr. 2015. &amp;lt;http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/inside-job/1-thing-every-aspiring-sitcom-actor-must-know/&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The program consists of three primary courses: Acting for Sitcoms, Sitcom Essentials and Sitcom Master Class. Acting for Sitcoms introduces new students to cold reading, script analysis, character development and audition technique. Sitcom Essentials focuses on script analysis, [[multi-cam]] vs. [[single-camera]] audition technique, [[Read-through|table read]], [[rehearsal]]s, camera blocking, and shooting scenes in front of a live [[studio audience]]. The Sitcom Master Class is specifically designed for working actors. Admittance into the Master Class is achieved by one of three ways: referral by representation, advancement from the Acting for Sitcoms Class, or multiple film or network/cable television [[IMDB]] credits.&lt;ref&gt;Rohrbacher, Gunnar. "Classes - Actors Comedy Studio." ''Actors Comedy Studio''. Gunnar Rohrbacher, 17 Jan. 2011. Web. 29 Apr. 2015. &amp;lt;http://www.actorscomedystudio.com/classes/&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity Instructors==
Actors Comedy Studios employs a variety of noted actors and casting directors as full-time and part-time faculty members.
[[Elaine Hendrix]] ([[Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll (TV series)|Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll]], [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]], [[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]) is a resident ACS faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;"Elaine Hendrix - Actors Comedy Studio." Actors Comedy Studio. Gunnar Rohrbacher, 17 Feb. 2012. Web. 30 Apr. 2015. &lt;http://www.actorscomedystudio.com/elaine-hendrix/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Co-owner Gunnar Todd Rohrbacher and Actors Comedy Studio have been repeatedly recognized for their work by the Readers Choice Awards by Backstage West. In 2011, Gunnar was Runner-Up for '[http://www.backstage.com/news/readers-choice/carolyne-barry/ Favorite On-Camera Teacher]', '[http://www.backstage.com/news/readers-choice/gerry-katzman/ Favorite Comedy Teacher]', and '[http://www.backstage.com/news/readers-choice/holly-powell/ Favorite Audition Technique Teacher']. Actors Comedy Studio was recently voted by [[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] as one of the top "9 Great Places to Study Comedy in Los Angeles."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wright, KC. "9 Places to Study Comedy in Los Angeles." ''Backstage West''. Backstage West, 13 Jan. 2015. Web. 30 Apr. 2015. &amp;lt;http://www.backstage.com/news/9-places-study-comedy-los-angeles/&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Piper''' (7 June 1908 – 22 August 1985) was a [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] (Nuwuvi) girl residing in [[Big Pine, California|Big Pine]], [[California]] who petitioned to attend the newly built Big Pine High School in 1923 and was denied entry due to her race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Deb |url=http://www.inyoregister.com/node/5634 |title=Honoring Alice Piper |publisher=The Inyo Register |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2014-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524030953/http://www.inyoregister.com/node/5634 |archive-date=2014-05-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, California educational law prohibited Native American children from attending a public school if a separate government run Indian school was established within three miles of the public school.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3936&amp;context=californialawreview|title=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3936&amp;context=californialawreview|publisher=scholarship.law.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice Piper along with six other Indian children sued the district for the right to attend. Piper sued on the grounds that her 14th Amendment rights had been violated knowing full well that she was not receiving the same education that the newly built public school afforded. The local Indian day school only offered education up to the 5th grade level, was underfunded, and lacked many basic resources. Furthermore, the District trustees had previously agreed to allow Indian students to attend the school if their parents voted for a measure that would fund the construction of the school. Although the measure passed, the board of trustees did not honor their agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520037281 |title=Out Of Print : All Deliberate Speed : Charles M. Wollenberg - University of California Press |publisher=Ucpress.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a local resident recalled, "It was an exciting morning when the request was made, all the mothers and fathers of children of school age, Indian and white, were on the street to hear the answer of the district trustees. When the request was denied, the Indians immediately took court action pressing their case in the name of Alice Piper, a beautiful, intelligent, Indian girl."  &lt;ref name="Inyo Independent. May 10, 1946"&gt;Inyo Independent. May 10, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The California Supreme Court unanimously ruled in her favor in the case [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720080122/http://sshl.ucsd.edu/brown/Piper.htm ''Piper v. Big Pine''] (1924), thus opening the door for herself and other Native American children to attend public schools in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=' + auElement.html() + ' |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/13/native-girl-who-challenged-educational-boundaries-be-honored-153367 |title=Native Girl Who Challenged Educational Boundaries to Be Honored - ICTMN.com |publisher=Indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Piper's court victory became a turning point in the struggle for Native American education and ended the practice of sending Indian children who qualified for public school to separate government-run Indian day schools. ''Piper v. Big Pine'' was later cited by [[Chief Justice Warren]] as a precedent in the [[Brown v. Board of Education]] (1954) ruling that ended the practice of [[Segregation in the United States|segregated schools]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Blalock-Moore, Nicole. [http://www.nicole-renee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Blalock-Moore-2012-Piper-v.-Big-Pine-School-District-of-Inyo-County-Indigenous-Schooling-and-Resistance-in-the-Early-Twentieth-Century.pdf Piper v. Big Pine School District of Inyo County: Indigenous Schooling and Resistance in the Early Twentieth Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531182610/http://www.nicole-renee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Blalock-Moore-2012-Piper-v.-Big-Pine-School-District-of-Inyo-County-Indigenous-Schooling-and-Resistance-in-the-Early-Twentieth-Century.pdf |date=2014-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alice Piper stands as an early [[civil rights]] hero who championed equal educational opportunities for Native Americans, opening the door for equal access to education for all children regardless of race. Says Ada Wardle Robinson, the Inyo County Superintendent who held the office years after the Piper case decision had been handed down, "And as each year as both eighth grade and high school students graduate, we are reminded that the development of our youthful citizens is not confined to the white race and we are thankful to those Indians who years ago insisted that their children be given an equal chance."&lt;ref name="Inyo Independent. May 10, 1946"/&gt;

In 2009, the Big Pine Paiute Tribe and Big Pine Unified School District agreed to commemorate Piper's victory with a statue placed in front of the school in her honor. The statue was dedicated on June 2, 2014, on the 90th anniversary of Alice Piper's victory in front of the school steps on the same ground in which the board of trustees had denied Alice Piper the right to attend in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Deb |url=http://www.inyoregister.com/node/5708 |title=Community comes together to support Alice Piper project |publisher=The Inyo Register |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520004454/http://www.inyoregister.com/node/5708 |archive-date=2014-05-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=James |first=Charles |url=http://www.inyoregister.com/node/6017 |title=Long Awaited Honor Comes to Big Pine Schools |publisher=The Inyo Register |date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2014-06-12 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140613182855/http://www.inyoregister.com/node/6017 |archive-date=2014-06-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This date also marks the day in 1924 that president Grover Cleveland signed the ''[[Indian Citizenship Act]]'', which declared all Indians, regardless of membership in a tribe, citizens of the United States.

As of 2014, 56% of the students who attend Big Pine high school are Native American.

'''Anka Radakovich''' is an American [[author]] and [[columnist]], often considered the first modern [[sex columnist]] through her pioneering column in ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine, which ran from 1990 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Nick. [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-and-men-all-mouth-and-no-trousers-1575360.html "Women and Men: All mouth and no trousers"], ''The Independent'', October 1, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Radakovich is of Serbian descent, the daughter of a corporate executive and a former opera singer. She grew up and attended [[North Hagerstown High School|North High School]] in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], and after studying literature and fine arts at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], she moved to [[New York City]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, Rick. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/24/style/hot-blooded-girl-next-door.html "Hot-Blooded Girl Next Door"], ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Radakovich rose to prominence after her column in ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' gained popularity and attracted a loyal readership. She was seen as breaking new ground in the public discussion of sex and sexuality, later to be followed by other sex columnists such as [[Candace Bushnell]], who wrote the column "Sex and the City" for ''[[The New York Observer]]''; and [[Dan Savage]], creator of the syndicated column ''[[Savage Love]]''. Many of her columns were collected into three books, ''The Wild Girls Club'' (1994) ''Sexplorations'' (1997) and ''The Wild Girls Club, Part 2'' (2014).

Her popularity through the 1990s led to frequent radio and television appearances on various talk shows, including ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Loveline]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', along with serving as a commentator on relationships and sexuality for programs on ABC, CNN, E!, Fox News, FX, MTV, NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, and VH1.

In addition to ''Details'', her articles have appeared in ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'', ''[[CosmoGirl]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Marie Claire]]'', ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Playgirl]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'', ''[[Daily News (New York)|The New York Daily News]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

Currently, Radakovich writes a column for ''[[GQ|British GQ]]'' and is reportedly at work on a screenplay and has released her third book ''The Wild Girls Club, Part 2: Tales from New York to Hollywood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Girls-Club-Part-Hollywood/dp/0990462129/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr= |title=The Wild Girls Club, Part 2: Tales from New York to Hollywood |author=Anka Radakovich |isbn=978-0-9904621-2-5 |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:BAP Unión en astillero SIMA.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Under construction in dry dock at [[SIMA]]]]
For a long time, the [[Peruvian Navy]] desired a [[training ship]] for instruction of its cadets. Accordingly, the Peruvian government enacted 1985 Law N° 24094,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leyes.congreso.gob.pe/Documentos/Leyes/24094.pdf |title=Law N° 24094 |publisher=Peruvian Congress |date=February 8, 1985 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075338/http://www.leyes.congreso.gob.pe/Documentos/Leyes/24094.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared as a public necessity the navy having this kind of ship. However, due to the economic [[Economy of Peru#The 1980s|crisis]] of debt and hyper-inflation Peru suffered at the end of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/19898|title=Peru's Debt Crisis and Subsequent Shock Economy|publisher=UCLA International Institute|date=February 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later for public spending restraints, the project was postponed.

Eventually, in 2010 the project was approved and the construction was authorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gacetamarinera.com.ar/nota.asp?idNota=8157|title=La Marina de Guerra del Perú realizó la botadura del buque escuela a vela BAP "Unión"|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160128165436/http://www.gacetamarinera.com.ar/nota.asp?idNota=8157|publisher=gacetamarinera.com.ar|language=Spanish|dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 28, 2016|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Peruvian government announced its decision to order the ship's construction to the Shipyard Marine Industrial Services of Peru, known as [[SIMA]]; in cooperation with the Government of Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archivo.larepublica.pe/12-11-2012/gobierno-espanol-cooperara-con-peru-en-construccion-de-buque-escuela|title=Government of Spain will cooperate in Peruvian training ship construction|publisher=larepublica.pe (cache) |date=November 12, 2012|language=Spanish|deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412182214/http://www.larepublica.pe/12-11-2012/gobierno-espanol-cooperara-con-peru-en-construccion-de-buque-escuela|archivedate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the contractors Cypsa Ingenieros Navales and [[Navantia]], which were responsible for the ship´s structural design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/vigo/2013/11/07/empresa-vigo-disena-mayor-buque-escuela-mundo/0003_201311V7C1995.htm|title=Empresa de vigo diseña mayor buque escuela |publisher=lavozdegalicia.es|date=November 7, 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cypsa.com.es/eng/index.html|title=Cypsa Ingenieros Navales |publisher=cypsa.com.es|date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governmente named the ship as ''Union'' to honors a Peruvian [[corvette]] that took part in the first stage of the 1879–1883 [[Naval Campaign of the War of the Pacific|War of the Pacific]] as part of a naval squadron under the command of [[Miguel Grau]], a hero of the Peruvian Navy.&lt;ref name="Grau Hero"/&gt; On December 8, 2012 ''Unión''{{'}}s construction began with a [[keel laying]] ceremony in the presence of Peruvian president [[Ollanta Humala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diariocorreo.pe/politica/humala-justifica-retraso-a-ceremonia-por-med-203944/|title=Humala justifica retraso a ceremonia por medidas que va a tomar |publisher=diariocorreo.pe|date=December 8, 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was finished two years later and  the ship was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on December 22, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://peru21.pe/politica/ollanta-humala-participo-lanzamiento-mar-buque-escuela-vela-union-2207394|title=Ollanta Humala participó en lanzamiento a mar de buque escuela a vela Unión |publisher=peru21.pe|date=December 23, 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the ship received its [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and [[propeller]]; and the interior fitout began in charge of contractors Acopafi and MO Contract. Also, according to an agreement between SIMA and Navantia, the ship was provided with an "Integrated Control System Platform, Navigation and Communications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.navantia.es/noticia.php?id_noti=347|title=Acuerdo de colaboración de NAVANTIA y el Astillero de la Marina de Guerra del Perú|publisher=navantia.es|date=January 22, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/160460/navantia-teams-with-peru-shipyard-for-naval-bids.html|title=Navantia Signs Partnership Agreement with Navy of Peru Shipyard|publisher=defense-aerospace.com|date=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ship was under construction, the Peruvian government arranged training for the future ''Unión''{{'}}s crew with the help of an instructor from the [[Spanish Navy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infodefensa.com/latam/2015/07/23/noticia-relevo-instructor-cargo-entrenamiento-tripulacion-buque-escuela-marina.html|title=España completa entrenamiento de la primera tripulación de buque escuela del Peru|publisher=infodefensa.com|date=July 23, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by sending personnel to serve on training ships of other countries, such as the Mexican sailing ship {{ship|ARM|Cuauhtémoc|BE01|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/agencia/noticia-buque-escuela-mexicano-adiestra-a-oficiales-de-armada-peruana-563302.aspx|title=Buque escuela mexicano adiestra a oficiales de armada peruana|publisher=andina.com.pe|date=June 30, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a Peruvian delegation was sent to take part in maintenance and repair works on Colombian sailing ship {{ship|ARC|Gloria}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infodefensa.com/latam/2015/01/27/noticia-militares-instruyen-colombia-mantenimiento-buques-escuela.html|title=Militares del Perú se instruyen en Colombia en el mantenimiento de buques a vela|publisher=andina.com.pe|date=January 27, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2016 BAP ''Unión'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in an official flag raising ceremony held on its deck witnessed by the President Ollanta Humala, Jakke Valakivi, the Minister of Defense and Admiral Edmundo Deville, the Commander of the Navy.&lt;ref name="commission"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defensa.com/frontend/defensa/marina-guerra-peru-incorpora-oficialmente-buque-escuela-vela-bap-vn17657-vst336|title=The Navy of Peru officially incorporates Sailing Ship BAP {{sic|nolink=y|Union}}|publisher=defensa.com|date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Gianfranco Polar Figari was named to be the first captain of the ship, who conducted the [[sea trial]]s of the vessel in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infodefensa.com/latam/2016/06/22/noticia-buque-escuela-armada-sometido-pruebas.html|title=Peruvian Navy training ship undergoes its sea tests|publisher=infodefensa.com|date=June 22, 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figurehead ===

The ship's [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] was made of bronze by the Peruvian sculptor Pilar Martínez Woodman, and it features several symbols of the [[Inca Empire|Inca culture]] that previously existed in what is now Peru. As the main element it shows the image of the [[Sapa Inca]] (emperor) [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Yupanqui]], known as "The Shining", who appears with his right arm raised to the image of the Inca sun god [[Inti]]; and who is placed over a representation of the archeological artefact known the [[twelve-angled stone]]. The Sapa Inca wears a checkered cloth and a cape that depicts ocean waves. He also wears two [[cougar|puma]] heads (the puma was a sacred animal in Inca culture)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.machupicchu.org/religious_significance_in_machu_picchu.htm|title=Religious significance in Machu Picchu|website=www.machupicchu.org|publisher=PeruForLess|access-date=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lateinamerika-studien.at/content/lehrgang/lg_mader/lg_mader-473.html|title=La trilogía inca: El cóndor, el puma y la serpiente|website=www.lateinamerika-studien.at.pe|publisher=Lateinamerika-Studien Online|access-date=February 16, 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; as knee guards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6788">The building of '''[[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]]-wood bridges''' is very often used as an [[educational technology]]. It may be accompanied by a larger project involving varying areas of study.

Typically classes which would include a balsa wood bridge cover the subject areas of [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[static equilibrium]], or building trades, although it may be done independently of any of these subjects. Building a balsa wood bridge can be done after completing a section or unit covering a related topic or the process of design and building can be used to guide students to a better understanding of the desired subject area.

[[Image:Balsa Bridge2.JPG|thumb|right|Building balsa wood bridges as a part of a unit on [[statics]], structures, forces, or construction trades is used by teachers to make the learning environment hands-on and to give students a real-world example of material covered in class]]

==Requirements==
Although there is great variety between different balsa wood bridge projects, students are in general trying to build a bridge that can withstand the greatest weight before it fails. Other restrictions are often applied, but these vary widely from one contest to another.
Sample requirements include:
*restricting the maximum [[mass]] of the [[bridge]]
*requiring a minimum [[Span (architecture)|span]]
*requiring a minimum height of the [[roadway]]
*restricting the physical dimensions of the bridge
*restricting the size of individual pieces of [[balsa]] wood
*limiting the amount of glue or balsa wood that can be used
*requiring a driveable roadway that allows passage of a vehicle of specified size
*restricting the way pieces are placed on the bridge (for example no parallel joining pieces)

[[Image:BalsaBridge Break.jpg|thumb|right|A balsa bridge breaks after holding a [[mass]] of  89 pounds (40.4 kg). Note that the [[failure]] of the entire [[bridge]] was a result of the failure of just the [[roadway]].]]

==Testing==
Bridges are usually tested by applying a downward force on the bridge. How and where the [[force]] is applied varies from one contest to the next. There are two common methods of applying the test force to the bridge:
*By hanging a container (such as a [[trash can]]) from the bridge and loading known weights into the container until the bridge breaks.  The tester could also slowly add water or sand to the container until the bridge breaks and then weigh the container, providing a more accurate way to find the breaking force.
*By using a [[machine|mechanical]] or [[pneumatic]] testing device that pushes down on the bridge with increasing force until the bridge breaks. If such a testing device is used it is often equipped with a method of automatically gathering force data, such as a [[pressure sensor]] or [[load cell]] connected to a computer.  This approach is more accurate at measuring bridges that have secondary structure that proves to be stronger than the primary structure.  This method is also less damaging to the bridge, whose structure usually remains intact since the load is automatically relieved at failure.

Of the two, the hanging container method provides by far the greater dramatic effect. Testing with a pneumatic press or ram is often complete in matter of seconds. Exceptionally strong bridges may take up to thirty minutes to test as weight (a combination of steel weights and sand is often used) is added to the suspended container.&lt;ref&gt;[http://balsabridge.com Physics Balsa Bridge Building Contest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and Grading==

===Scoring===
There are two chief ways that balsa wood bridge competitions may be scored. One way is simply by measuring how much weight each bridge can support.  The second way is by structural efficiency, often expressed as a strength to weight ratio.  The weight-only method is most effective where competitors are all building from a specified set of materials and are expected to use all the available materials.  The strength-to-weight method is better when competitors are expected to use their materials as efficiently as possible.

===Competitive Grading===
Competitive grading compares how well each bridge does against bridges built by other participants to determine a grade.  The top scoring bridge is assigned a maximum numeric grade (say, 100%) while the lowest scoring bridge that still meets all basic specifications is assigned a minimum grade (say, 70%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/bridge_project/index.html |title=Canyon High School Balsa Bridge Competition |access-date=2008-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070719/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/bridge_project/index.html |archive-date=2008-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method guarantee that some scores will be high even if the overall quality of bridges is low. Conversely, it also guarantees that some scores will be low, even in situations where all bridges are of high quality.

===Standards-Based Grading===
Standards-based grading sets certain standards that need to be met in order to earn a certain grade. An example of standards-based scoring would be to say that all bridges that hold 50&amp;nbsp;kg earn full credit; bridges that hold 25&amp;nbsp;kg earn half credit, and bridges that hold less than 10&amp;nbsp;kg earn no credit.

This method allows every bridge to potentially earn full credit if the standards are met.  In situations where competition is weak, this method runs the risk of having many competitors receive no credit.

'''Barbara Joyce Robotham''' (15 January 1936 – 1 July 2013) was an English [[mezzo-soprano]] opera singer and concert soloist who later became a distinguished voice teacher at the [[Royal Northern College of Music]].

==Life and career==
The daughter of a [[Fylde Coast]] heating engineer, Robotham was born and raised in [[Blackpool]] where she was educated at the [[Blackpool Aspire Academy|Collegiate School for Girls]]. She then studied singing at the [[Royal Manchester College of Music]] under Elsie Thurston. She won the college's Curtis Gold Medal and the  Imperial League of Opera Prize and in 1961 the Silver Medal at the [[Geneva International Music Competition|Concours de Genève]]. Her early performances included Handel's ''[[Alcina]]'' in Lisbon, Brahms'  [[Alto Rhapsody|''Rhapsodie'']] conducted by Malcolm Sargent at the [[BBC Proms]], Britten's ''[[Canticles (Britten)|Abraham and Isaac]]'' at Aldeburgh, the [[Verdi Requiem]], and the Angel in Elgar's ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Proms]] Archive.

In the early 1970s, after her election as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Manchester College of Music and having sung in over 100 performances and broadcasts in the UK and Europe, Robotham turned to teaching which she considered her true vocation. In 1974 she became a voice professor at [[Lancaster University]], and in 1979 she joined the faculty of the [[Royal Northern College of Music]]. Amongst her students there were [[Amanda Roocroft]] and [[Sara Fulgoni]]. She retired from full-time teaching at the RNCM in 1999, but continued to give master-classes at the college up until her final illness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (October 2013).

Robotham was a long-time resident of [[Lytham St. Annes]] where she was the President of the  Lytham St Annes Choral Society from 1989 until her death. Her last professional performance was as the mezzo-soprano soloist in the Verdi Requiem which she performed with the society in 1997 at [[Blackpool Grand Theatre]]. She died in [[Blackpool Victoria Hospital]] at the age of 77 survived by her husband Eric Waite whom she had married in 1958 and their son Jonathan Waite.&lt;ref name = "DT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lytham St Annes Express'' (4 July 2013).

==Early life and education==
Carder was born in 1982 and grew up in [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref name="tg2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ranscombe|first1=Siân|title=Barnaby Carder, the British spoon-carver|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10892365/Barnaby-Carder-the-British-spoon-carver.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12 a neighbour introduced him to [[woodturning]] by showing him how to make bowls&lt;ref name="spit2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barn the Spoon, Spoon Carver|url=http://spitalfieldslife.com/2012/11/13/barn-the-spoon-spoon-carver/|website=Spitalfields Life|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon he had a [[lathe]] in the garage of his parents' house.&lt;ref name=bbcws2017&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spoon Carving Enthusiast|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04d0nzz|website=BBC World Service|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Bristol University with a degree in biology, intending initially to become a biology teacher before becoming apprenticed to a cabinet maker.&lt;ref name="wwi2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnaby Carder – The Spoon Whittler|url=http://www.woodworkersinstitute.com/news/2013/05/barnaby-carder-the-spoon-whittler/|website=Woodworkers Institute|publisher=GMC Publications LTD.|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After apprenticing himself to green wood worker Mike Abbott in [[Hereford]], he then spent 3 years working in forestry and living in the forests, sourcing [[green wood]].&lt;ref name=spit2017/&gt; It was while living in the woods he began to carve and then sell spoons for a living travelling between Oxford and Bristol,&lt;ref name="bbc2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galliver|first1=John|title=The man who makes his living whittling wooden spoons|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22467510|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that the spoons sold better in cities.&lt;ref name=spit2017/&gt; Carder holds an official [[Peddler#Legislation and regulation|pedlar's licence]] for this purpose.&lt;ref name=spit2017/&gt; 

==Spoons and green wood carving==
Carder is founder of The Green Wood Guild, London's school of traditional woodwork, based at [[Stepney City Farm]].&lt;ref name="scf2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood|url=http://stepneycityfarm.org/rural-arts/wood/?doing_wp_cron=1487722612.2000598907470703125000|website=Stepney City Farm|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guild also has a woodworking venue at [[Abney Park]] in Stoke Newington. The guild provides courses in woodworking, carving, whittling and bladesmithing and runs two regular clubs, Whittlers Anonymous and Spoonclub.&lt;ref name=scf2017/&gt; 

Carder uses freshly cut (green) wood and traditional techniques to carve his spoons, usually using an axe, spoon knife (a curved bladed knife for hollowing out the bowl of the spoon), and small carving knife.&lt;ref name=spit2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=spon2017/&gt; The wood is sourced locally from parks in and around London and is recycled from trees which have been removed for conservation reasons.&lt;ref name="ell2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chia|first1=Jessica|title=Barnaby Carder carves his spoons at shop-front door|url=http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2014/09/barnaby-carder-carves-spoons-in-shop-front/|website=East London Lines|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carder states that a single spoon can take him from twenty minutes to two hours to carve.&lt;ref name=tg2017/&gt; He opened his Hackney Road shop at the end of 2012 and carves in the shop window, where people often stop to watch.&lt;ref name=ell2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=tg2017/&gt; 

Carder has a display of some of his spoons in the [[Fuller Craft Museum]] in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=Time for John Singer Sargent at Duxbury museum|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/south/2017/04/07/time-for-john-singer-sargent-duxbury-museum/eFN31tkEAmrLvpFiLPWKaM/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his spoons have also sold in the Conran shop in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="ft2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tassell|first1=Tony|title=FT Masterclass: spoon carving with Barnaby Carder|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ee980e4ch-5379-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef|website=Financial Times|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Carder and Robin Wood joined [[Stevie Parle]] during [[London Craft Week]] to explore wood-fired cooking and how dining from wooden utensils can affect the experience of eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howells|first1=Tom|title=See the wood for the trees: Robin Wood and Barn the Spoon do dinner at Craft|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/design/seeing-the-wood-for-the-trees-robin-wood-and-barn-the-spoon-set-up-shop-at-craft|website=Wallpaper|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carder has been described by the press as "legendary"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frizzell|first1=Nell|title=The best craft festivals around the country|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/09/knitting-skills-knitwear-faroe-islands-festival-sweaters-knit|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been said that "No one in Britain knows more about crafting a spoon from green wood than Barn the Spoon".&lt;ref name=guard2017/&gt;

In May 2017 following the release of his book, Carder announced the lease on his shop is to expire and he hopes to leave London to be closer to nature. He launched a '1000 spoons' project where he intends to carve 1000 spoons from a single tree, using any profits to plant and maintain his own woodland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Jonny|title=Carving out a new life as a spoon whittler|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/carving-new-life-spoon-whittler/|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Carder teaches spoon and bowl carving at his shop on the Hackney Road and has run courses at various other venues around the UK including [[Stepney City Farm]], [[Tate Britain]], the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spring 2016|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/F%20of%20PRM%2085%20Spring%202016%20LR%20for%20WEB%20AWARD%20FC.pdf|website=The Friends of the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford Magazine|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heal's]].&lt;ref name="tate2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Make it|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/courses-and-workshops/make-it-knife-carving-workshop|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnaby Carder Spatula Carving Workshop|url=https://www.heals.com/barnaby-carder-2.html|website=Heals|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 Carder published his first book, a spoon carving guide entitled ''Spon: A Guide to Spoon Carving and the New Wood Culture'' published by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name=spon2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Spon A Guide to Spoon Carving and the New Wood Culture|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112684/spon/9780753545973/|website=Penguin books|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Spon' refers to the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon English]] word for a wood chip which is believed to be the [[etymology|etymological]] root of spoon.&lt;ref name=sf2017/&gt; In it Carder shows techniques and the appropriate use of tools used in creating different types of spoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The Spoon|first1=Barn|title=Spon: A Guide to Spoon Carving and the New Wood Culture|date=2017|publisher=Penguin (Virgin Books)|isbn=0753545977}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carder explains the need to think in three dimensions, as with other forms of sculpture, and has said {{Cquote|Perfection is always just a spoon away.&lt;ref name="guard2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henley|first1=Jon|title=Carve your own spoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/06/carve-your-own-spoon|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Bing Act''' of 1921 was an Ohio law, adopted April 29, 1921, that stated children between the ages of six and eighteen are required to attend school. There were two major exceptions to this law: a child who had already graduated high school did not have to stay in school until turning eighteen; and a child who was sixteen years old and had passed the seventh grade was allowed to work as a farmer instead of attending school.

The Bing Bill was drafted for Ohio legislation by Ohio Council of Child Welfare’s education committee. Although the Bill had many supporters, women’s groups were the primary activists for the bill. On January 24, 1921, the bill was introduced to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] by [[Simeon H. Bing]] from [[Gallia County]], chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Schools and President of [[Rio Grande College]].

The Bing Bill was opposed by groups such and farmers and the Amish. They didn’t want to take their children out of the workforce and they knew it would cost them more with taxes being raised to run the schools. They also thought the schools would train the children to be delinquent and have bad behavior. Supporters argued that schooling will help the young farmers bring more efficient practices and modern ideas to the farms. 
	
This law was created to stop [[child labor]]. Business wanted to employ children so that they could pay them less money than they would an adult worker. People who opposed child labor were for the Bing act because it mandated that children had to be at least sixteen years of age to work at most industries in Ohio. At age sixteen the children had to get a work permit from their parents and school to say they have passed the seventh grade and are allowed to work. 
	
When children were forced to attend school some families had some financial troubles because they relied on their children to help with the bills and help on the farms. The schools also had financial trouble because more children attended schools. Every school had to have equivalent education through the highs school level and rural schools needed transportation. The [[Ohio Legislature]] adopted a 3 percent [[sales tax]] that gave half of the funds to the school districts for education purposes and [[operating costs]]. With making schooling mandatory, school attendance went up. This reduced illiteracy and promoted good citizenry. Businessmen and industrialists were for the Bing bill because they wanted more intelligence in the work field.

'''Schönburg Castle''' is in the municipality of Schönburg 4.5 kilometers east of [[Naumburg]] at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. 

[[File:Schönburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Schönburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany]]

== Location ==
The Late Romanesque ruins of Schönburg Castle are on top of a mottled sandstone cliff by the [[Saale]] River, which is 40 metres high and declines sharply in the west. The castle was built with the local mottled [[sandstone]].

== History ==
The castle on top of the southern slopes of the Saale was erected as the most important castle in the 12th century on commission by the [[bishops]] of Naumburg. The bishops owned several castles within their territory to secure their assets. From 1158 at the latest, a free [[noble family]] that owned property around [[Naumburg]] named itself after the castle. It was first documented in 1137. Schönburg has been preserved to this day and is an example from the time of classical [[castle]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Schönburg, Burgenlandkreis. ''In:'' Burgen und Schlösser in Sachsen-Anhalt 12.|trans-title=On the history of Schönburg, Burgenland. ''In:'' Castles and palaces in Saxony-Anhalt.|page=15-79|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
All the walls, gates and parts of the [[Palas]] have retained their original substance from the High Middle Ages, as have parts of the interior like visible [[chimneys]] dated to 1220 and decorated windows. The [[architecture]] and decorations found here correspond to other monuments in the World Heritage nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Schönburg. Bischofsburg zu Naumburg.

The amended version of the history of Schöburg since 1036.|page=15-79|author=Baumgart, Uwe|publisher=Naumburg|date=1997|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== World Heritage Nomination ==
Schönburg Castle is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape “[[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]”. As a landmark the castle is an important part of the lines of sight connecting the [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. univ.''' is an abbreviation for ''doctor universitatis'' (Doctor of University in English). It was a doctoral rank in [[Hungary]] classified between Master of Arts and CSc (Candidatus Scientiarum = old-style PhD). It was abolished in the 1990s; i.e., no more dr. univ. degrees were given. Many of those already having dr. univ. degrees had them converted into PhDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2862">'''Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Program''' was a program of the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State]] in 1992-2013.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

The Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Program provided opportunities for graduate students and professionals from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan for one-year non-degree, one-year degree or two-year degree study in the United States.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Eligible fields of study for the Muskie Program were business administration, economics, education, environmental management, international affairs, journalism and mass communication, law, library and information science, public administration, public health, and public policy.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

The program was established by the [[United States Congress]] beginning from 1992 [[Fiscal_year#United_States|fiscal year]] ({{USPL|102|138}}, Sec. 227) and was designated [[Edmund S. Muskie]] name by the [[Freedom Support Act]] of 1992 ({{USPL|102|511}}, Sec. 801).

Due to fiscal constraints&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uz.usembassy.gov/education-culture/exchange-programs/edmund-s-muskie-graduate-fellowship-program/|title=Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Program|publisher=Official website of the U.S. Embassy in Uzbekistan (uz.usembassy.gov)|access-date=2017-09-15}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Muskie program was discontinued in 2013 (the final cohort selected in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/cice/current-issue/07_Campbell.pdf|title=International Scholarship Graduates Influencing Social and Economic Development at Home: The Role of Alumni Networks in Georgia and Moldova|author=Anne C. Campbell|publisher=Current Issues in Comparative Education (CICE)|date=Fall 2016|format=pdf|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the past, the program was administered by [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] and [[American Council of Teachers of Russian|American Council of Teachers of Russian/American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language]].

In 2015 [[Edmund S. Muskie Internship Program]] was launched as a professional exchange program. It provides summer internship placements, career training, and financial support to Eurasian scholars and graduate students studying in the United States. The program is administered by [[Cultural Vistas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">'''Examen facultatum''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''faculty exam''; abbreviated to ''Ex.fac.'') is, together with [[Examen philosophicum]], one of two [[Academy|academic]] [[Test (assessment)|exams]] in most [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate programmes]] at [[Norwegian universities]]. ''Examen facultatum'' is a result of [[theory of science]] being separated from ''Examen philosophicum'' as an independent type of course before 2000. Whereas ''Examen philosophicum'' trains [[student]]s in [[philosophy]] and [[Critical thinking|structured thinking]], ''Examen facultatum'' aims at teaching students how to write academic texts, normally focussing on the [[Branches of science|scientific branch]] of each [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] and on the [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]] of each undergraduate programme.&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="St.meld. 27"/&gt; It is common for universities to have a general course and a course specific part that intertwine with any chosen study as part of ''Examen philosophicum''. 

''Examen facultatum'' as a compulsory course is legally based in [[Statutory instrument|royal regulations]] for each university, for example ''Regulations of 20 December 2005 No. 1798 on Studies and Exams at the University of Oslo'' in the case of the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name="Regulations 20122005 No 1798"/&gt; Both ''Examen facultatum'' and ''Examen philosophicum'' are compulsory parts of most [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[Norway]]: mainly [[professional studies]] at [[University college (Scandinavia)|university colleges]] and [[natural science]] studies at [[Norwegian universities|universities]] are exempt from either one or both.

==Life and career==
Born with the name Joe Bogash to Russian-Jewish parents in Philadelphia, Boghetti was trained at the [[Milan Conservatory]]. It was while in Italy that he changed his name to something that sounded Italian in the hopes that it would help bolster his career. He appeared as a concert tenor in several European cities but was never able to gain enough momentum to make a full-time living as a singer. He accordingly returned to the United States in 1918 where he opened studios in both his native city and New York City. He continued to teach in both cities up until his death in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marian Anderson: A Voice Uplifted|author=Victoria Garrett Jones|page=34|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, at the age of 23, Boghetti began teaching the great American [[contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]]. He remained Anderson's teacher, trusted advisor and friend up until his death 22 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/_post/education/marian-anderson/html/early_life_back.htm|title=Marian Anderson at the Met|work=www.metoperafamily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Hamlet Isakhanli defended his second doctoral dissertation (leading to a D.S. - Doctor of Science degree) "On Problems of Multiparameter Spectral Theory" at the V.I. Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Moscow. He received the degree of Doctor of Physical-Mathematical Sciences, and was later awarded the title of Professor by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Higher Attestation Committee.&lt;ref name="Tanriverdiyev 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aslan 2005"/&gt;

Hamlet Isakhanli is recognised as a [[scholar]] of great research capacity in mathematics. He has performed research in various areas of mathematics and the applied sciences such as non-self-adjoint [[operator theory]], multiparameter [[spectral theory]], the theory of joint spectra, [[differential equations]], numerical ranges, and [[mathematical]] models of economy. He is considered one of the founders of the modern Multiparameter Spectral Theory. He was the first Soviet mathematician to carry out scientific research in this field of study, which has its origin in [[mathematical physics]].

Isakhanli was not only a representative of the famous Moscow mathematics school, but his background also reflects achievements in the scientific schools of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada.  During the times of the Soviet "[[Iron Curtain]]," in spite of some difficulties, he viewed the [[West]] not only from a distance, but also as a [[visiting professor]]. Scientific - research centers, academies and universities in Europe, the [[Americas]] and Asia continuously invited him to their institutions to deliver lectures, undertake joint research, and speak at international conferences. He in turn invited foreign scholars to Moscow and Baku to deliver lectures for furthering good relations between the [[Eastern world|East]] and the [[Western world|West]]. He achieved the establishment of an [[international]] [[academic]] network even in those Soviet times.&lt;ref&gt;Nagiyev R.

His achievements in the field of mathematics were highly praised by prominent mathematicians, particularly by members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as N.N.Bogolyubov, V.S.Vladimirov and S.M. Nikolskiy, [[Lenin Prize]] winners B.M. Levitan and V.B. Lidskiy, and by well-known mathematicians A. G. Kostyuchenko, A.A. Dezin, and V.A. Sadovnichiy (currently rector of Lomonosov Moscow State University), professor F.Atkinson ([[University of Toronto]]), professor P.J.Browne ([[University of Calgary]]), and other scholars.

== Research in humanities and social studies, creative writings ==
Hamlet Isakhanli is a scholar who has carried out research and produced significant results in various fields of sciences and arts, particularly outside of mathematics. Overall, he has written hundreds of articles, monographs, and textbooks in the philosophy of history, history of science, education and culture; education policy; theory and history of translation; language and literature; and in many other areas.

The book ''[[In Search of Khazar]]'' by Hamlet Isakhanli has become very popular in Azerbaijan and throughout the [[international community]]. His storytelling style connected with [[description]] of political, cultural, personal and psychological situations of the process of establishment of a new institution of [[higher education]], and well-documented analyses of events of the time, make this a valuable book to read. "The realities of events associated with the establishment and development of [[Khazar University]] have left indelible traces in my [[memory]]. I intend to pass these events to you in their entirety and in all sincerity," says the author in the introductory note to the book.&lt;ref name="Isaxanli 2006"&gt;{{cite book

His research and writings on translation problems, on language policy, and on lexicography are worthy of esteem. A large article entitled "Translating Poetry and Cross-cultural Communication: In Search of Beauty and Harmony Within Limited Borders" devoted to the history and analyses of East-West communication through the translation highway, to problems of translation from and into Azerbaijani, and to problems of translating poetry, is a "must, for constant reference" according to one expert viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Poetry and music ==
Hamlet Isakhanli's poems are melodic; for this reason his poems have attracted Azerbaijani composers' attention. Many of his lyric poems have been used for composing songs and musical [[spectacle]]s.&lt;ref name="Aslan 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hisaxanli.org"/&gt;

Prominent national composers, the late Ramiz Mustafayev and the late [[Vasif Adigozalov]], composed music - a [[hymn]] based on his poem ''My Khazar University'';  Ramiz Mustafayev – on the poem ''In Search of my Khazar''; Vagif Garayzadeh - on the poem ''Parting''; [[Lutfiyar Imanov]] – on the poem ''Life will be so easy''; Naila Isayeva - on poems ''I just fell in love with you'', ''It is beautiful'', ''Poppy'', ''Lily'', ''Wind and a lassie'', ''I want to stay alone'', ''Come soon'', and ''My world'';  Tahir Akber -on four poems, Elza Seyidcahan - on the poems ''I couldn’t understand this world'' and ''Baku'', Jahangir Zulfugarov – on the poem ''Where we meet'', Dilara Gulamova - on the poems  ''An old question'', ''Magical night'', ''Clouds lag behind childhood'', and musical spectacle "The life path is just a moment" based on a series of Hamlet Isakhanli's [[philosophical]] poems. His entire [[epic poetry|epic]]-[[lyric poetry|lyric]] poem "Pilgrimage" was set to music by composer Javanshir Guliyev, who also composed  eleven songs on the lyric by Hamlet Isakhanli. All these songs and musical spectacles are sung and performed by master-singers [[Lutfiyar Imanov]], Flora Karimova, [[Brilliant Dadashova]], Azer Zeynalov, Ilgar Muradov, Rashida Behbudova, [[Manana Japaridze]], Gulyanaq Memmedova, Elza Seyidcahan, Samir Jafarov, Beture Huseynova, Anar Shushali, Yusif Savalan, Mehseti Cabbarova, Fadaya Lachin, Azerbaijani State [[Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Choir]], the "Savalan," "Sheron" and "Kristal" bands and others. [[Khananda]]s singing [[mugham]] such as Arif Babayev, [[Alim Qasimov]], Nazakat Teymurova, Zabit Nabizadeh, and Zakir Aliyev also have used Hamlet Isakhanli’s poems while singing.

== Reforms in education ==
Besides conducting his research and delivering lectures abroad during the Soviet Period, Hamlet Isakhanli was also interested in studying different aspects of educational organizations in the West. In the late 1980s, Isakhanli tried to explain to the public and to the government the meaning of and reasons for the crisis that was occurring in the Soviet and Azerbaijani Higher Education System. He showed ways to overcome the crisis and called for substantial reforms through his articles published in Azerbaijani and Russian newspapers and in speeches made on the radio and TV.&lt;ref&gt;Hamlet Isakhanli. The Character of Education should be Universal (in Azeri). Kommunist newspaper, Baku, May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamlet Isakhanli. To Reform Education (in Russian). Bakinskiy Rabochiy newspaper, 1991, January 25&lt;/ref&gt;

New ideas started to emerge and be implemented in a country that was living through political and economic crisis and war. Hamlet Isakhanli played an important role in that development.
On the one hand, he noted the necessity for step-by-step reforms in the entire education system; on the other hand, he emphasized the prospect of establishing new types of higher education institutions that would meet the demands of the new, rapidly changing and globalized world.
In his opinion, these new higher education institutions might benefit to some degree from US models of higher education (particularly in terms of curriculum, management, quality of teaching and research, university-industry relations, the knowledge economy and innovation, an interactive student-centered system based on credit accumulation, programs leading to Bachelors, Masters and PhD degrees, extensive international relations, etc.), and they would play an important role not only in education and research, but also in the overall awareness and democratization of society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Tanriverdiyev 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaxanli 2006"/&gt;

== Khazar University (foundation and principles) ==

[[File:Xəzər Universiteti023.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Khazar University's Neftchilar Campus|Khazar University's Neftchilar Campus.]]In addition to thinking and writing about means for educational reform, Hamlet Isakhanli decided to establish a university. In this way he aimed to contribute to the process of implementing his own proposed reforms through his actions. As an outcome of these activities, official preparatory efforts by the Resolution of the Cabinet (Council) of Ministers of the Republic of (then Soviet!) Azerbaijan were carried out (dated on December 20, 1990). Khazar University (then called Azerbaijan University of the English Language) was subsequently created by a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers dated March 18, 1991. The university, which began with seven teachers and 19 students, was the first private (not for profit) university established in Azerbaijan and one of the first officially established in the present-day post-Soviet area&lt;ref name="Isaxanli 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Welcome to Khazar University
 | url = http://www.khazar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its Western-type curricula and study programs, adoption of a flexible credit accumulation system and student-centered model of education, application of modern methods of management, establishment of broad and effective international relations, recruitment of high-quality local and foreign specialists, fighting against corruption in education, and generally speaking, provision of high-quality education under the direction of Hamlet Isakhanli, Khazar University became famous as one of the leading universities not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the wider geographical region covering the former Soviet area, particularly the [[Caucasus]]  and [[Central Asia]], and also the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hamlet Isakhanli decided to use English as a main language of instruction at Khazar. The reasons for this include providing ways to facilitate the use of books and other educational and research resources published in the West, for student exchange programs, for inviting visiting professors; and, in general, for breaking away from [[inertia]] and encouraging innovative thinking.

The [[innovative]] endeavors of Hamlet Isakhanli and Khazar University played an important role in the introduction and successful application of the two-cycled (Bachelor, Master) system and in [[methodology]] for [[evaluation]] in the higher education system of Azerbaijan, which was later envisaged in the [[Bologna Process]] on the creation of the [[European Higher Education Area]]. He was one of the main initiators in joining Azerbaijan to the [[Bologna Process]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Isaxanli 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Dunya School and Training Center(foundation) ==
[[Dunya School]], established by Hamlet Isakhanli in 1998 and affiliated with [[Khazar University]], providing education at the preschool, primary, secondary and high school levels, is a successful and highly sought-after school where schoolchildren receive bilingual education in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hamlet Isakhanli not only put his ideas into practice in the higher education system; he is also trying to create a model for pre-university education that would be able to compete internationally. Thus he is realizing and providing the idea of [[lifelong education]] by building a network of education institutions from early childhood till PhD and professorship.

As part of the goal of providing lifelong education, Isakhanli also established the Khazar University [http://www.khazar.org/s988/KU-Training-Center/en Training Center] which provides courses in foreign languages, all academic fields, standardized examination preparation, and musical instruments for students of all ages.

== Kin ==
Hamlet Isakhanli is a member of the well known Hajibayramli clan. His grandfather was a famous guerilla Isakhan Hajibayramli (1897–1930), who organized an armed rebellion against the Soviets during the collectivization period (in the late 1920s to 1930) in the territories of Georgia and Armenia. Isakhan is retained in the memory of the old generation for his bravery and chivalry. His 100-year anniversary was celebrated in both Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Hamlet's grandmother Zeynab and her children and close relatives were exiled from their home country to [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]] for two years.&lt;ref name="Conference 1996, pp. 1-16"/&gt;

==Academic honours==
{{Main|Honours and awards to Harold Pinter}}
Among the honours received during his lifetime, Pinter was the recipient of 20 honorary degrees or fellowships conferred by European and American [[academia|academic institutions]], and he was an Honorary Fellow of the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Language Association of America (MLA)]] (1970). In 2006 Pinter was elected a "foreign member" of the Department of Language and Literature of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SASA [SANU]),&lt;ref name=SANU&gt;[http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Index.aspx "Foreign Members"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408064202/http://www.sanu.ac.rs/English/Index.aspx |date=8 April 2009 }}, Department of Language and Literature, [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SASA), SANU (sanu.ac.rs), 2009 [Relocated from sanu.ac.rs, 15 September 2007], [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.  [The English-language section of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SASA/SANU) website listing "Foreign Members" of the Department of Language and Literature including the names of both Harold Pinter and [[Ronald Harwood]] is not currently operational since the site's relocation to the "rs" from the "yu" domain, and the previous URL (accessed previously on 15 September 2007) is not archived; however, the information at the "yu" domain was previously verified as indicated, on 15 September 2007.] &lt;!--After a bot (see edit history) changed the "yu" in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.sanu.ac.rs/Eng/members/OdJiKClan.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; to "rs", it became clear that this revised link is dead; sections of the current English version of the SANU (SASA) site (sanu.ac.rs) and the previous section for "Department of Language and Literature" are apparently still under (re)construction; the information was properly verified on 15 September 2007, as stated.  [This information is ''not'' given in the biography at haroldpinter.org drawn upon in newspaper obituaries.] See EL sec. for that link.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and he received the Serbian Foundation Prize and the St. George Plaque of the City of [[Kragujevac]].&lt;ref&gt;Listed in the "Awards" section of the biography [http://www.haroldpinter.org/biography/index.shtml "Harold Pinter"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zuF3mTcA?url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/biography/index.shtml |date=3 July 2011 }} at ''HaroldPinter.org'', Pinter's official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, also due to illness, he had been unable to travel to [[Stockholm]] in December 2005 to receive his Nobel Prize and to deliver his Nobel Lecture in person, presenting it on videotape instead, Pinter did travel to [[Turin]], Italy, in March 2006, to accept the [[Europe Theatre Prize]]; there he was the subject of an international symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, curated by his official, authorised biographer, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], whose participants included "distinguished" academics from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See Francis Gillen, "Introduction," ''The Pinter Review: Nobel Prize/Europe Theatre Prize Volume'' x–xi and "Contributors" 344–45; revised versions of papers presented at Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics are included in this volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the subject of two international academic conferences in March and April 2007.  Viva Pinter: Hommage à Harold Pinter, Prix Nobel de Littérature 2005, Légion d'Honneur 2007, organised by Professor Brigitte Gauthier of the [[University of Lyon]]'s Université Jean Moulin (Lyon 3), in [[Lyon]], France, focused on connections between Pinter's support for human rights, his dramatic works, his poetry, and his films, hosting various events, including productions, panel discussions, and screenings for students, guests, and the public; it was held from 2 to 21 March 2007, with an international colloquium following from 22 to 24 March 2007.&lt;ref name=Viva&gt;[http://www.sens-public.org/IMG/VIVA_PINTER_Lyon_March_2007.pdf "Viva Pinter (Mars 2007)"] ([[PDF]]), ''VivaPinter.org'' (Mar. 2007), rpt. in ''Sens public: Revue internationale – International Webjournal'' (sens-public.org) [Public Sense: International Review – International Webjournal], 5 February 2007, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.  {{en icon}}.

In conjunction with Pinter's being awarded the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] from the [[University of Leeds]], School of English, on 13 April 2007, which he was able to accept in person, there was a three-day academic conference [[#Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Pinter|Artist and Citizen: 50 Years of Performing Harold Pinter]] at the University's Workshop Theatre, co-sponsored by [[#Harold Pinter Society|The Harold Pinter Society]], held from 12 to 14 April.  The honorary degree ceremony on the 13th was conducted by [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] [[Melvyn Bragg|Lord Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref name=BBCNews&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_yorkshire/6553099.stm "Pinter Receives Honorary Degree"], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[BBC]], 13 April 2007, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.

In the spring of 2008, in absentia, Pinter was awarded the Doctor Honoris Causa by the [[University of Kragujevac]].&lt;ref name=Kragujevac&gt;[http://www.filum.kg.ac.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=327:harold-pinter-at-the-university-of-kragujevac&amp;catid=216:activities&amp;Itemid=233 Harold Pinter at the University of Kragujevac], School of Philology and Arts, [[University of Kragujevac]], 2008, [[World Wide Web|Web]].

On 11 December 2008, the [[News media|press media]] reported that Pinter received an honorary degree (an honorary fellowship) from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] (CSSD), in London, also in absentia, as he "was forced to withdraw from the [honorary degree ceremony] event due to illness."&lt;ref name=AOL&gt;[http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/entertainment-news/degree-honour-for-playwright-pinter/article/20081210135450881462169 "Degree Honour for Playwright Pinter"]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}, ''[[AOL]] United Kingdom'', [[AOL|America Online UK]] ([[Time Warner]]), 10 December 2008, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 13 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSSD2008&gt;[http://www.cssd.ac.uk/news.php/14/centralrsquos_2008_graduation_ceremony.html "Central's 2008 Graduation Ceremony"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204203159/http://www.cssd.ac.uk/news.php/14/centralrsquos_2008_graduation_ceremony.html |date=4 February 2009 }}, ''[[Central School of Speech and Drama]]'', News, [[University of London]], 12 December 2008, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 1 January 2009.

In October 2008, two months prior to his death on 24 December, Pinter also became honorary president of the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], a constituent college of the [[University of London]],&lt;ref name=TheStage&gt;Alistair Smith, [http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/22095/pinter-replaces-mandelson-as-central "Pinter Replaces Mandelson as Central President"], ''[[The Stage]]'', thestage.co.uk, 14 October 2008, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 15 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and received his 20th honorary award, from that institution, on 10 December 2008, in absentia because of illness.&lt;ref name=AOL/&gt;&lt;ref name=CSSD2008/&gt;

In 1986, at an annual convention of the [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA), Steven H.

Gale (Tampa: U of Tampa P, 2000) xi–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pinter Society is international in membership and scope, according to the masthead of ''The Pinter Review'' and the Society's ''Webpages'' (home page).  According to the website of the ''International Pinter Society'', its members are "dedicated to studying, celebrating, and appraising the works of this prolific and frequently enigmatic writer" (home page).  As an MLA Allied Organization, it organises "a business meeting, programs in which scholars present papers, and related social events at the MLA annual convention."

===''The Pinter Review''===
Members of The Harold Pinter Society and individual and institutional subscribers receive ''The Pinter Review'', whose founding co-editors are Francis Gillen ([[University of Tampa]]) and Steven H. Gale ([[Kentucky State University]]), an academic journal first published in conjunction with the Pinter Society by The [[University of Tampa]] Press in 1987.

''The Pinter Review'' became a collection of ''Annual Essays'' in 1989 and then a biennial book publication of ''Collected Essays'' in 1997 and 1998; it is published in both hardcover and softcover editions.  Each issue or volume contains a bibliography of works, productions, and other events by and about Pinter compiled by Bibliographical Editor Susan Hollis Merritt.&lt;ref name=TPRContents&gt;[http://www.haroldpinter.org/pinterreview/index.shtml "Contents"], ''The Pinter Review'' (Tampa: U of Tampa P, 1987–  ), rpt. in ''HaroldPinter.org'', Harold Pinter, 2000–[2008], [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.

[Periodically updated.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of ''The Pinter Review: Collected Essays 2003 and 2004'' (published by The University of Tampa Press in 2004) features Pinter's poems "Meeting" (August 2002) and "After Lunch" (September 2002), which, along with some of his other recent poetry, are both posted on his official website.&lt;ref name=TPR2004&gt;[http://www.haroldpinter.org/pinterreview/review03_04.shtml "Contents"], ''The Pinter Review: Collected Essays 2003 and 2004'' (Tampa: U of Tampa P, 2004), rpt. in ''HaroldPinter.org'', Harold Pinter, 2000–[2008], [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meeting&gt;Harold Pinter, [http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/meeting.html "Meeting"], in "Poetry: Harold Pinter's Recent Poetry" (section), ''HaroldPinter.org'', Harold Pinter, 2000–[2008], [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AfterLunch&gt;Harold Pinter, [http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/afterlunch.html "After Lunch"], in "Poetry: Harold Pinter's Recent Poetry", ''HaroldPinter.org'', Harold Pinter, 2000–[2008], [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The softcover edition features the photographed texts of these two poems on its cover; the hardcover edition features them on its dust jacket.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pinter Review: Nobel Prize/Europe Theatre Prize Volume: 2005–2008'', a special "celebratory" volume edited by Francis Gillen with Steven H. Gale, was published by The University of Tampa Press in 2008.  Gillen updated his introduction with an "Editor's Note" to account for Pinter's death, which occurred on 24 December 2008, "While this volume was going to press" (xi).  Consisting of 347 pages, this special volume is "dedicated to Harold Pinter—in celebration" and to the memory of Gillen's late wife, Marie C. Gillen.  Among its contributions, it includes: the "Presentation Speech for the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature", by Per Wäsberg (3–5); Pinter's 2005 Nobel Lecture "Art, Truth and Politics" (6–17); and his May 2006 dramatic sketch "[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart from That]]" (18–19).  The softcover edition and the dust jacket of the hardcover edition feature a photograph of "p. 12" of Pinter's handwritten manuscript of his 2005 Nobel Lecture.  The volume's first page features the poem "Grandpa", written by Pinter's step-grandson Simon Soros between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2008, after Pinter's death (Driscoll);&lt;ref name=Driscoll&gt;""After Harold Pinter's death, his grandson (Simon Soros) celebrated the playwright with a rap. … Simon began his offering, which is being considered for publication in the scholarly American journal [[Harold Pinter and academia#The Pinter Review|The Pinter Review]], on the way home from hospital. … He finished the second stanza of the poem while the rest of the family attended Christmas mass. … The poem reveals a surprisingly tender side to the otherwise prickly and opinionated auteur. … Simon's creation touchingly reveals how fully the playwright had been absorbed into the sprawling [[Antonia Fraser|Fraser]] clan after he became stepfather to her six children in 1980."&lt;/ref&gt; and the second page (opposite) features the poem "To My Wife", written by Pinter for Antonia Fraser in June 2004.  The "Harold Pinter Bibliography: 2002–2004" (262–343), compiled by Susan Hollis Merritt, includes a "''Special Supplement on the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature, October 2005 – May 2006''."&lt;ref&gt;As of 25 April 2009, the contents of this volume is not yet listed on Pinter's website; it may be listed later, if the site is updated.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Pinter Centre for Performance and Creative Writing==
[[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College, University of London]], inaugurated its Pinter Centre in June 2003, installing Harold Pinter as its honorary president.&lt;ref name=GoldsmithsPC&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/pinter-centre/ "Welcome to the Pinter Centre for Performance and Creative Writing"], ''Pinter Centre for Performance and Creative Writing'', [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], 2009, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Professor of Drama Robert Gordon, it is "an interdisciplinary research centre, involving principally the Departments of English &amp; Comparative Literature and of Drama, the latter organising and hosting the Centre, and with links in Media and Communications, Music, PACE and the Digital Studios."&lt;ref name=GoldsmithsPC/&gt; Consistent with "Pinter's keen awareness of the centrality of political issues", according to its mission statement, the Pinter Centre "is particularly committed to looking at [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] and [[Diaspora|diasporic]] literature and performance, and the ways in which contemporary creativity is forging new forms that respond to the cultural diversity of the world in which we live. It also has a strong interest in questions of gender, and writing and performing the body."&lt;ref name=GoldsmithsPC/&gt;

The section on the Pinter Centre in "Introducing the Department of Drama", part of a document on "Drama" published by Goldsmiths, observes that "The Department of Drama founded the Pinter Centre in 2003 as an interdisciplinary research centre dedicated to performance research"; after it "widened its remit to embrace both performance and writing", the Pinter Centre was renamed to include Creative Writing, "becoming the focus for the many different writing courses and research activities concerned with writing and [[dramaturgy]] within Goldsmiths."&lt;ref name=Drama&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/drama-pg.pdf "Drama" ([[PDF]])] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718094022/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/drama-pg.pdf |date=18 July 2009 }}, [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], 2009, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its previous conferences and symposia, the Pinter Centre hosted "an international conference" on [[Stephen Sondheim]]: Collaborator and Auteur, in 2005, and, Ravenhill 10, "a major conference to celebrate 10 years of work by the playwright [[Mark Ravenhill]], in November 2006.&lt;ref name=Drama/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravenhill10&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/ravenhill10/ "Ravenhill 10: 10 – 11/12 November 2006"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721062249/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/ravenhill10/ |date=21 July 2009 }}, ''The Pinter Centre for Performance and Creative Writing'', [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], 2006, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pinter Centre's official website (as periodically updated) provides news and a schedule of its upcoming events; information about its collaborative research project "Beyond the Linear Narrative: Fractured Narratives in Writing and Performance in the Postcolonial era"; ''The Pinter Centre Blog'' ("a resource for anyone interested in the work and influence of Harold Pinter, post-colonial writing and performance, life writing and the future of the fractured narrative", the focus of its Beyond the Linear Narrative project); "In Memoriam: Harold Pinter"; the "Department of Drama" at Goldsmiths; and related links.

==''Harold Pinter: A Bibliographical History''==
[[Image:BakerRossHaroldPinter.jpg|thumbnail|right|80px]]
''Harold Pinter: A Bibliographical History'', compiled by William Baker and John C. Ross, was published by the [[British Library]] and Oak Knoll Press in 2005.  As a result of Pinter's winning the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], according to its publisher, the book, which "provides a comprehensive account of the print-published writings, and texts in other media, which he has wholly or partly authored", became an academic library best-seller.&lt;ref name=OakKnollP&gt;"Oak Knoll Press Bestsellers" 37; Oak Knoll Press, "News Release! Delaware Publisher Hits Nobel Gold!", press release accompanying review copies of the book (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Hollis Merritt provides an intensive analysis of the book in ''The Pinter Review: Nobel Prize/Europe Theatre Prize Volume'' (238–60; dust jacket).

==The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library==
{{Main|The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library}}
The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library is the literary [[archive]] of Harold Pinter, which Pinter had first placed "on permanent loan" in the [[British Library]] in September 1993&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt, "The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library"; Gale and Hudgins; and Baker and Ross.&lt;/ref&gt; and which became a permanent acquisition in December 2007.&lt;ref name=BLArchive&gt;Mark Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/12/books.theatrenews "British Library's ₤1.1m Saves Pinter's Papers for Nation"], ''[[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian]]'', [[Guardian Media Group]], 12 December 2007, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLPR&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/news/2007/pressrelease20071211.html "Pinter Archive Saved for the Nation"], ''British Library News'', [[British Library]], 11 December 2007, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBL&gt;Jennifer Howard, [http://chronicle.com/news/article/3616/british-library-acquires-pinter-papers "British Library Acquires Pinter Papers"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', News Blog, Chronicle of Higher Education, 12 December 2007, [[World Wide Web|Web]], 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2007 the [[British Library]] announced that it had purchased Pinter's literary archive for [[Pound sterling|₤]]1.1 million (approx. [[US dollar|$]]2.24 million), augmenting its current "Harold Pinter Archive" of 80 boxes ("Loan 110 A").&lt;ref name=BLArchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=HowardBL/&gt; It comprises "over one hundred and fifty boxes of manuscripts, scrapbooks, letters, photographs, programmes, and emails", constituting "an invaluable resource for researchers and scholars of Pinter's work for stage, cinema, and poetry."&lt;ref name=BLArchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLPR/&gt; The work of cataloguing the full archive, a process documented in the BL's official ''Harold Pinter Archive Blog'', was completed in December 2008 (before Pinter's death on the 24th), the description of its contents was uploaded to the BL ''Additional Manuscripts Online Catalogue'' on 2 February 2009, and then the archive was re-opened to qualified researchers and scholars.

==Pinter's attitudes toward academic analysis of his work==
Pinter satirises academics or intellectual "distance" in several of his plays, beginning with his character Edward, a scholarly writer, in ''[[A Slight Ache]]'' (1959) and continuing with Teddy, an English philosophy professor in an American university who refuses to become "lost in it", in ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), and Devlin, an English academic, in ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Harold Pinter's perspectives on "scholars' use of language and discourses in academic analysis", see Mark Taylor-Batty, "Fling Open Door and Let Pinter's Pause Be Heard", ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' 27 April 2007: 12; as cited in ''Academic Search Premier'' hosted by [[EBSCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Year of Astronomy''' ('''IYA2009''') was a year-long celebration of [[astronomy]] that took place in 2009 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first recorded astronomical observations with a [[telescope]] by [[Galileo Galilei]] and the publication of [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Kepler&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannes Kepler: His Life, His Laws and Times|url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/JohannesKepler/|website=NASA: Kepler Mission|accessdate=22 February 2015|ref=Johannes Kepler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Year was declared by the 62nd General Assembly of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/12/21/science-astronomy.html |title=2009 to be International Year of Astronomy, UN declares |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=21 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r5swSakm?url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/12/21/science-astronomy.html |archivedate=9 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-62-PV.78 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=62 |meeting=78 |page=18 |anchor=pg018-bk15 |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A global scheme, laid out by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), was also endorsed by [[UNESCO]], the UN body responsible for educational, scientific, and cultural matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/34745114.html |title=International Year of Astronomy 2009 |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |date=1 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202162617/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/34745114.html |archivedate=2 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAU coordinated the International Year of Astronomy in 2009. This initiative was an opportunity for the citizens of Earth to gain a deeper insight into astronomy’s role in enriching all human cultures. Moreover, served as a platform for informing the public about the latest astronomical discoveries while emphasizing the essential role of astronomy in science education. IYA2009 was sponsored by [[Celestron]] and [[Thales Alenia Space]].

==Significance of 1609==
On 25 September 1608, [[Hans Lippershey]], a spectacle-maker from [[Middelburg]], traveled to the [[Hague]], the then capital of the [[Netherlands]], to demonstrate to the Dutch government a new device he was trying to patent: a [[telescope]]. Although Hans was not awarded the patent, Galileo heard of this story and decided to use the "Dutch perspective glass" and point it towards the heavens.

In 1609, [[Galileo Galilei]] first turned one of his telescopes to the [[night sky]] and made astounding discoveries that changed mankind's conception of the world: mountains and craters on the [[Moon]], a plethora of [[star]]s invisible to the naked eye, and moons around [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090108082902.htm |title=Looking Through Galileo's Eyes |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |date=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomical observatories around the world promised to reveal how planets and stars are formed, how galaxies assemble and evolve, and what the structure and shape of our Universe actually are.
In the same year, [[Johannes Kepler]] published his work ''[[Astronomia nova]]'', in which he described the fundamental [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motions]].

However Galileo was not the first to observe the Moon through a telescope and make a drawing of it. [[Thomas Harriot]] observed and detailed the Moon some months before Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harriot Moon|url=http://www.skepticality.com/assets/harriot_moon16091.gif|website=Skepticality|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating Thomas Harriot, the world's first telescopic astronomer|url=http://www.ras.org.uk/news-and-press/68-news2009/1641-celebrating-thomas-harriot-the-worlds-first-telescopic-astronomer-ras-pn-0947|website=Royal Astronomical Society|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's all about publicity. Galileo was extremely good at irritating people and also using creative writing to communicate what he was learning in a way that made people think," says [[Pamela Gay]] in an interview with [[Skepticality]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Year of Astronomy|url=http://www.skepticality.com/international-year-of-astronomy/|website=Skepticality|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intended purpose==

===Vision===
The vision of IYA2009 was to help people rediscover their place in the Universe through the sky, and thereby engage a personal sense of wonder and discovery. IYA2009 activities took place locally, nationally, regionally and internationally. National Nodes were formed in each country to prepare activities for 2009. These nodes established collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. More than 100 countries were involved, and well over 140 participated eventually. To help coordinate this huge global programme and to provide an important resource for the participating countries, the IAU established a central Secretariat and the IYA2009 website as the principal IYA2009 resource for public, professionals and media alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/general/about/|title=About IYA2009 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |publisher=IAU/IYA2009 |date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
[[Astronomy]], perhaps the oldest science in history, has played an important role in most, if not all, cultures over the ages. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 (IYA2009) was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy, but in science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.

The IYA2009 marked the monumental leap forward that followed [[Galileo]]'s first use of the [[telescope]] for astronomical observations, and portrays astronomy as a peaceful global scientific endeavour that unites amateur and professional astronomers in an international and multicultural family that works together to find answers to some of the most fundamental questions that humankind has ever asked. The aim of the Year was to stimulate worldwide interest in astronomy and science under the central theme "The Universe, Yours to Discover."

Several committees were formed to oversee the vast majority of IYA2009 activities ("sidewalk astronomy" events in [[planetarium]]s and public observatories), which spun local, regional and national levels. These committees were collaborations between professional and amateur astronomers, science centres and science communicators. Individual countries were undertaking their own initiatives as well as assessing their own national needs, while the [[IAU]] acted as the event's coordinator and catalyst on a global scale. The [[IAU]] plan was to liaise with, and involve, as many as possible of the ongoing [[outreach]] and education efforts throughout the world, including those organized by amateur astronomers.

===Goals===
The major goals of IYA2009 were to:
# Increase scientific awareness;
# Promote widespread access to new knowledge and observing experiences;
# Empower astronomical communities in developing countries;
# Support and improve formal and informal science education;
# Provide a modern image of science and scientists;
# Facilitate new networks and strengthen existing ones;
# Improve the gender-balanced representation of scientists at all levels and promote greater involvement by underrepresented minorities in scientific and engineering careers;
# Facilitate the preservation and protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage of dark skies in places such as urban oases, national parks and astronomical sites.

As part of the scheme, IYA2009 helped less-well-established organizations from the developing world to become involved with larger organizations and deliver their contributions, linked via a huge global network. This initiative also aimed at reaching economically disadvantaged children across the globe and enhancing their understanding of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/general/about/goals/|title=IYA2009 Goals &amp; Objectives |accessdate=20 May 2009 |publisher=IAU/IYA2009 |date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Secretariat==
The central hub of the IAU activities for the IYA2009 was the IYA2009 Secretariat. This was established to coordinate activities during the planning, execution and evaluation of the Year. The Secretariat was based in the [[European Southern Observatory]] headquarters in the town of [[Garching]] near [[Munich]], Germany. The Secretariat was to liaise continuously with the National Nodes, Task Groups, Partners and Organizational Associates, the media and the general public to ensure the progress of the IYA2009 at all levels. The Secretariat and the website were the major coordination and resource centers for all the participating countries, but particularly for those [[developing countries]] that lack the national resources to mount major events alone.

==Cornerstone projects==
The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was supported by eleven Cornerstone projects. These are global programs of activities centered on specific themes and are some of the projects that helped to achieve IYA2009's main goals; whether it is the support and promotion of women in astronomy, the preservation of dark-sky sites around the world or educating and explaining the workings of the Universe to millions, the eleven Cornerstones were the key elements in the success of IYA2009.

===100 Hours of Astronomy===
'''100 Hours of Astronomy''' ('''100HA''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/100hoursofastronomy/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – 100 Hours of Astronomy|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009 and was part of the scheduled global activities of the International Year of Astronomy 2009. The main goal of 100HA was to have as many people throughout the world as possible looking through a telescope just as Galileo did for the first time 400 years ago. The event included special webcasts, students and teachers activities, a schedule of events at science centers, [[planetarium]]s and science museums as well as 24 hours of sidewalk astronomy, which allowed the opportunity for public observing sessions to as many people as possible.

===Galileoscope===
The '''Galileoscope'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/galileoscope/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Galileoscope
 |accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, where the program was to share a personal experience of practical astronomical observations with as many people as possible across the world. It was collaborating with the US IYA2009 National Node to develop a simple, accessible, easy-to-assemble and easy-to-use telescope that can be distributed by the millions. In theory, every participant in an IYA2009 event should be able to take home one of these little telescopes, enabling them to observe with an instrument similar to Galileo's one.

===Cosmic Diary===
The '''Cosmic Diary''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/cosmicdiary/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Cosmic Diary|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmic Diary|url=http://cosmicdiary.org/|website=Welcome to Cosmic Diary|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April, was not about the science of astronomy, but about what it is like to be an astronomer. Professionals were to blog in texts and images about their life, families, friends, hobbies and interests, as well as their work, latest research findings and the challenges they face. The bloggers represented a vibrant cross-section of working astronomers from all around the world. They wrote in many different languages, from five continents. They have also written feature article "explanations" about their specialist fields, which were highlighted in the website. NASA, ESA and ESO all had sub-blogs as part of the Cosmic Diary Cornerstone.

===The Portal to the Universe===
'''The Portal to the Universe''' ('''PTTU''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/portaltotheuniverse/|title = Global Cornerstone projects – Portal to the Universe|date = 1 January 2009|publisher = IAU/IYA2009|accessdate = 20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, to provide a global, one-stop portal for online astronomy contents, serving as an index, aggregator and a social-networking site for astronomy content providers, laypeople, press, educators, decision-makers and scientists. PTTU was to feature news, image, event and video aggregation; a comprehensive directory of observatories, facilities, astronomical societies, amateur astronomy societies, space artists, science communication universities; and Web 2.0 collaborative tools, such as the ranking of different services according to popularity, to promote interaction within the astronomy multimedia community. In addition, a range of "widgets" (small applications) were to be developed to tap into existing "live data". Modern technology and the standardisation of metadata made it possible to tie all the suppliers of such information together with a single, semi-automatically updating portal.

===She Is an Astronomer===
Promoting gender equality and empowering women is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. '''She Is an Astronomer'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/sheisanastronomer/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – She is an astronomer|accessdate=20 May 2009 |publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that ran 2–5 April 2009, to promote [[gender equality]] in astronomy (and science in general), tackling bias issues by providing a web platform where information and links about gender balance and related resources are collected.
The aim of the project was to provide neutral, informative and accessible information to female professional and amateur astronomers, students, and those who are interested in the gender equality problem in science. Providing this information was intended to help increase the interest of young girls  in studying  and pursuing a career in astronomy.
Another objective of the project was to build and maintain an Internet-based, easy-to-handle forum and database, where people regardless of geographical location could read about the subject, ask questions and find answers. There was also to be the option to discuss astronomy-sector-specific problems, such as observing times and family duties.

===Dark Skies Awareness===
'''Dark Skies Awareness'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/darkskiesawareness/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Dark Skies Awareness|date=1 January 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that ran from 2 to 5 April 2009. The IAU collaborated with the U.S. [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory]] (NOAO), representatives of the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] (IDA), the Starlight Initiative, and other national and international partners in dark-sky and environmental education on several related themes.
The focus was on three main citizen-scientist programs to measure local levels of light pollution. These programs were to take the form of "star hunts" or "star counts", providing people with a fun and direct way to acquire heightened awareness about light pollution through firsthand observations of the night sky. Together, the three programs were to cover the entire International Year of Astronomy 2009, namely [[GLOBE at Night]] (in March), the [[Great World Wide Star Count]] (in October) and [[How Many Stars]] (January, February, April through September, November and December).

UNESCO and the IAU were working together to implement a research and education collaboration as part of UNESCO's thematic initiative, '''Astronomy and World Heritage'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/astroworldheritage/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Astronomy and World Heritage|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2–5 April 2009. The main objective was to establish a link between science and culture on the basis of research aimed at acknowledging the cultural and scientific values of properties connected with astronomy. This programme provides an opportunity to identify properties related to astronomy located around the world, to preserve their memory and save them from progressive deterioration. Support from the international community is needed to implement this activity and to promote the recognition of astronomical knowledge through the nomination of sites that celebrate important achievements in science.

===Galileo Teacher Training Program===
The '''Galileo Teacher Training Program''' ('''GTTP'''): the International Year of Astronomy 2009 provided an opportunity to engage the formal education community in the excitement of astronomical discovery as a vehicle for improving the teaching of science in classrooms around the world. To help training teachers in effective astronomy communication and to sustain the legacy of IYA2009, the IAU – in collaboration with the National Nodes and leaders in the field such as the [[Global Hands-On Universe|Global Hands-On Universe project]], the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory and the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] – embarked on a unique global effort to empower teachers by developing the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/galileoteachertraning/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Galileo Teacher Training Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTTP goal was to create a worldwide network of certified "Galileo Ambassadors" by 2012. These Ambassadors were to train "Galileo Master Teachers" in the effective use and transfer of astronomy education tools and resources into classroom science curricula. The Galileo Teachers were to be equipped to train other teachers in these methodologies, leveraging the work begun during IYA2009 in classrooms everywhere. Through workshops, online training tools and basic education kits, the products and techniques developed by this program could be adapted to reach locations with few resources of their own, as well as computer-connected areas that could take advantage of access to robotic optical and radio telescopes, webcams, astronomy exercises, cross-disciplinary resources, image processing and digital universes (web and desktop planetariums). Among GTTP partners, the [[Global Hands-On Universe|Global Hands-On Universe project]] was a leader.

===Universe Awareness===
'''[[Universe Awareness]]''' ('''UNAWE''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/universeawareness/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Universe Awareness|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran during 2–5 April 2009, as an international program to introduce very young children in under-privileged environments to the scale and beauty of the Universe. Universe Awareness noted the multicultural origins of modern astronomy in an effort to broaden children's minds, awaken their curiosity in science and stimulate global citizenship and tolerance. Using the sky and children's natural fascination with it as common ground, UNAWE was to create an international awareness of their place in the Universe and their place on Earth.

===From Earth to the Universe===
[[File:From Earth to the Universe Movie Poster.jpg|thumb|"From Earth to the Universe" Movie Poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Free Downloadable Planetarium Show|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15040/|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Cornerstone project '''From Earth to the Universe''' ('''FETTU''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/event_photos.php|title=Global Cornerstone projects – From Earth to the Universe|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a worldwide [[public science]] event that began in June 2008, and still ongoing through 2011. This project has endeavored to bring astronomy images and their science to a wider audience in non-traditional [[informal learning]] venues. In placing these astronomy exhibitions in public parks, metro stations, art centers, hospitals, shopping malls and other accessible locations, it has been hoped that individuals who might normally ignore or even dislike astronomy, or science in general, will be engaged.

===Developing Astronomy Globally===
The '''Developing Astronomy Globally'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/cornerstones/developingastronomy/#cite_note-0/|title=Global Cornerstone projects – Developing Astronomy Globally|accessdate=20 May 2009|publisher=IAU/IYA2009|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that ran during 2–5 April 2009, as a Cornerstone project to acknowledge that astronomy needs to be developed in three key areas: professionally (universities and research); publicly (communication, media, and amateur groups) and educationally (schools and informal education structures). The focus was to be on regions that do not already have strong astronomical communities. The implementation was to be centred on training, development and networking in each of these three key areas.

This Cornerstone was using the momentum of IYA2009 to help establish and enhance regional structures and networks that work on the development of astronomy around the world. These networks were to support the current and future development work of the IAU and other programmes, plus ensure that developing regions could benefit from IYA2009 and the work of the other Cornerstone projects. It was to also address the question of the contribution of astronomy to development.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a worldwide astronomy event that also ran 2–5 April 2009, as a project to involve both amateur and professional astronomers around the globe, taking to the streets their telescopes and pointing them as Galileo did 400 years ago. The sources of interest were [[Jupiter]] and its moons, the Sun, our Moon and many others celestial marvels. The event was scheduled to take place on 22–24 October 2009. Astronomers were to share their knowledge and enthusiasm for space by encouraging as many people as possible to look through a telescope at planetary neighbours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">'''Ivan Novikoff''' (August 26, 1899 &amp;ndash; March 20, 2002) was a [[ballet]] master.

Born in [[Kazan]], Russia, Novikoff studied and graduated from the Imperial Ballet School aka Mariinsky. He fled to [[Harbin]], China because of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] at age 17, where he taught dance for the community of Russians.

In 1923, he immigrated to the United States, where he continued teaching ballet until his death. After arriving in San Francisco, Novikoff moved to New York City, where Novikoff and his brother Boris Novikoff together directed Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company. Moving westwards to Seattle, he founded the Novikoff School of Russian-American Ballet in the early 1950s and received the Governor's Heritage Award (of the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]) in 1989. Novikoff followed in the footsteps of his lifetime inspiration Michael Forkin in pure Classic Russian Artistry.

Among his students in Seattle were [[Robert Joffrey]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books? [[Leona Wood]], the founder of Aman Folk Ensemble, [[Richard Ingram]],one of the choreographers of Royal Ballet and [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]] the director of Mark Morris Company, [[Erricka Shebass]],a former principal dancer of Oakland Ballet Company.

'''Kinesthetic learning''' (American English), '''kinaesthetic learning''' (British English), or '''tactile learning''' is a [[learning style]] in which [[learning]] takes place by the students carrying out physical activities, rather than listening to a lecture or watching demonstrations. As cited by Favre (2009), Dunn and Dunn define kinesthetic learners as students who require whole-body movement to process new and difficult information.&lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Kinesthetic intelligence, which was originally coupled with tactile abilities, was defined and discussed in Howard Gardner's ''[[Frames Of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]'' in 1983. In this book, Gardner describes activities such as dancing and performing surgery as requiring great kinesthetic intelligence: using the body to create (or do) something.

[[Margaret H'Doubler]] wrote and spoke about kinesthetic learning during the 1940s, defining kinesthetic learning as the human body's ability to express itself through movement and dance.

===The VARK model===
Neil Fleming, a New Zealand teacher and educational theorist, designed the VARK model (visual, aural or auditory, read/write and kinesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fleming’s model, kinesthetic learners are similar to tactile learners in that they like hands-on experiential learning. They excel in concrete learning such as on-the-job training, work experience, internships, simulations and so forth (Kte’pi, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Kte’pi, B. M. (2016). VARK model. Salem Press Encyclopedia, 1-4. Retrieved from http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=9c230f56-1b84-4d47-a439-c2ae572d551d%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=113931235&amp;db=ers&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Learning styles#Neil Fleming.27s VAK.2FVARK model|Fleming VAK/VARK model]] (one of the most common and widely used categorizations of the various types of learning styles)&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2.  SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; categorized learning styles as follows:
* [[Hands-on learning]]
* [[Visual learning]]
* [[Auditory learning]]
* Read/write learning
* Kinesthetic learning
Skill memory also fits into the category of kinesthetic learning, as it is what happens when somebody is learning kinesthetically. Skill memories are difficult to convey except by direct demonstration, may be acquired without awareness, and require several repetitions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior|last=Gluck|first=M.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Rita Dunn contends that kinesthetic and tactile learning are the same style.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Rita.  2009. Title: Impact of Learning-Style Instructional Strategies on Students' Achievement and Attitudes: Perceptions of Educators in Diverse Institutions.&lt;/ref&gt; Galeet BenZion asserts that kinesthetic and tactile learning are separate learning styles, with different characteristics. She defined kinesthetic learning as the process that results in new knowledge (or understanding) with the involvement of the learner's body movement. This movement is performed to establish new knowledge or extend existing knowledge. Kinesthetic learning is at its best, BenZion found, when the learner uses language (their own words) in order to define, explain, resolve and sort out how their body's movement reflects the concept explored. One example is a student using movement to work out the sum of 1/2 plus 3/4 via movement, then explaining how their motions in space reflect the mathematical process leading to the correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;BenZion(Westreich), Galeet.  1999.  An analysis of kinesthetic learners' responses: teaching mathematics through dance.  Doctoral Dissertation.  American University, Washington D.C..&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Denig (2004) in his article ‘Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions’, presented Dunn and Dunn’s Learning Styles Model, which addresses 21 elements that affect students’ learning. These elements are broken down into five stimuli: environmental, emotional, sociological, physiological and psychological variables. Under this model, physiological stimuli consist of four elements, one of which is perceptual. Perceptual depicts the auditory, visual, tactual and kinesthetic styles whereby learners learn more effectively. This gives meaning to the concept that kinesthetic learners learn best through whole-body activities and experiences while tactual learners learn best through manipulation of items with their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Denig, S. J. (2004). Multiple Intelligences and Learning Styles: Two Complementary Dimensions. Teachers College Record, 106(1), 96-111. Retrieved from https://journals-scholarsportal-info.proxy.library.brocku.ca/pdf/01614681/v106i0001/96_mialstcd.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinesthetic memory==
Depending upon [[Mnemonic|memory systems]] the kinesthetic learners respond differently. The different kinds of learners mainly include whole body learners, hands-on learners, doodlers, students learning through emotional experiences. The learning and the memory is generally short term. To achieve a long term memory different techniques can be used depending on the learning style. Mind mapping, story mapping, webbing, drawing can be used to enhance the learning of a doodler.  For the hands-on learner, role play, clay, building and math manipulative can be used. The whole book body learner can learn better through role-playing, body mapping, puzzles and use of computer technology which allows for certain movement while learning. Students can be engaged in group activities and activities which involve bodily movement such as dance, drama, sports can be used to nurture their learning. The following strategies can be used to facilitate kinesthetic memory through procedural motor pathway such as:
* [[Dance]]: ideas, concepts and processes can be expressed through creative movements
* Laboratory demonstrations
* [[Sport]]s
* [[Gymnastics]]
* [[Charades]]
The kinesthetic learners who have memories associated with [[emotion]]s learning can be facilitated through dance, [[debate]], [[drama]], [[Role-playing|role-play]], and charades. This kind of learning leads to a [[long-term memory]] since it is associated with emotions such as [[wikt:excitement|excitement]], [[curiosity]], [[anger]], [[disappointment]] and success.&lt;ref name="Sprenger2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilee Sprenger|title=Differentiation Through Learning Styles and Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaVu2p5uDBkC&amp;pg=PA113|date=22 April 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-9504-6|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kinds of skill memory ==
Perceptual-motor skills are skills learned by movement patterns guided by sensory inputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are closed skills and open skills. Closed skills are skills learned such as dance.  A ballerina learns a specific set of moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option.  Open skills are skills that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports.  A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can't know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open skills are required to become successful.  Cognitive skills also are a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories.  Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well.  Cognitive skills are skills which require individuals to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move their bodies based on what they perceive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Solving a puzzle would be an example of a cognitive skill.

==Management strategies==
Learners with kinesthetic preferences learn through active movements and [[experience]]s. Activities such as [[Play (activity)|playing]], [[puppetry]], [[drama]], [[acting]] and [[design]]ing ensures involvement of the learners. Thus, it is also important to manage the students during such activities.&lt;ref name="SimsSims1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald R. Sims|author2=Serbrenia J. Sims|title=The Importance of Learning Styles: Understanding the Implications for Learning, Course Design, and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECi3gFMEvh8C&amp;pg=PA53|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29278-1|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some effective [[Strategy|strategies]] used to involve unmotivated students during activities are:
* Motivate the students by giving attention and [[Reward management|reward]], avoid [[punishment]].
* Students should be provided with option to choose activities for learning a particular concept
* Grades can be allotted depending on the participation by using score rubrics
* Activities chosen should encourage all the students to succeed and feel that have accomplished [[learning]] through an activity
* Every student has to be given equal opportunity to participate
* Cooperative activities can be organized and positive feedback can be given to encourage [[teamwork]] in a class
Some effective strategies used to manage hyper motivated students are:
* Encourage the students to organize body movement during activities
* Regular monitoring of the students 
* Appropriate and accurate directions have to be given for any activity
* Before involving the students in the activity, the consequences of the task going out of control has to be clearly explained.&lt;ref name="LengelKuczala2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Traci Lengel|author2=Mike Kuczala|title=The Kinesthetic Classroom: Teaching and Learning Through Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUA4zKBlsrsC|date=26 January 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-7120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinesthetic Learners in the Classroom===

Subjects can be taught to cater for kinesthetic learners. Through a strength-based and learner-centered approach, educators should engage kinesthetic students in activities that require movements because they learn by doing. Activities could include role-plays, drama, dance, races and competitions, field trips and projects.

Favre (2009) stated that instructional strategies should include movement in a game-like format. Favre suggested designing kinesthetic games. For example, “game boards such as Tic-Tac-Toe affixed to the classroom floor and hopscotch template painted on the playground tarmac or sidewalks around the school” (p. 32). Favre also suggested that instructors can use “commercial games such as Twister, Jeopardy and Nerf basketball and create game cards that align with their lesson objectives” (pp.32-33) &lt;ref&gt;Favre, L. R. (2009, March 1). Kinesthetic Instructional Strategies: Moving At-Risk Learners to Higher Levels. Insights on Learning Disabilities, 6(1), 29-35. Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Reese &amp; Dunn (2007) in their research of college freshmen learning styles provided recommended that "to ensure success for kinesthetic learners, classes should provide active experiences for planning or carrying out objectives, such as visits, project, role playing, simulations and floor or wall games"(p. 108). &lt;ref&gt;Reese, V. L., &amp; Dunn, R. (2007). Learning-Style Preferences of a Diverse Freshmen Population in a Large, Private, Metropolitan University by Gender and GPA.

Retrieved from http://journals.sagepub.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/doi/pdf/10.2190/N836-888L-2311-2374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of evidence==
Although the concept of [[learning styles]] is popular among educators in some countries (and children and adults express preferences for particular modes of learning), there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes; on the contrary, there is substantial evidence that the meshing hypothesis (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

Proponents state that the evidence related to kinesthetic learners benefiting from specialized instruction (or targeted materials) appears mixed at best; the [[diagnosis]] of kinesthetic and tactile learning is coupled (rather than isolated), and teachers are likely to misdiagnose students' learning styles.

On the other hand, studies do show that mixed-modality presentations (for instance, using auditory and visual techniques) improve results in a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name=Coffield&gt;Coffield, F., Moseley, D., Hall, E., Ecclestone, K.

University of Maryland at College Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain substrates involved ==
There are three parts of the brain that are the most important to kinesthetic and skill learning.  The [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebral cortex]], and the [[cerebellum]] all play equally important roles in the ability to learn new skills and master them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience: A Brain-Mind Odyssey|last=Presti|first=D.|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basal ganglia are a collection of ganglia (clusters of neurons) that lie at the base of the forebrain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   The basal ganglia receive information from other parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortical areas that send messages about the outside world.  Most of these messages are sensory, meaning what a person is physically feeling.  The basal ganglia then interpret this information and sends it on a path to the thalamus and the brainstem which both play large factors in physical movement. Therefore, the basal ganglia are the beginning of the process for somebody who is learning-by-doing to respond viscerally to the stimuli around them.  It is important once a skill is learned to practice it.  This can change how basal ganglia circuits participate in the performance of that skill and that synaptic plasticity is a basic neural mechanism enabling such changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The more a person practices, the more plasticity they develop.

The cerebral cortex is the brain tissue covering the top and sides of the brain in most vertebrates. It is involved in storing and processing of sensory inputs and motor outputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the human brain, the cerebral cortex is actually a sheet of neural tissue about 1/8th inch thick.  The sheet is folded so that it can fit inside the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The neural circuits in this area of the brain expand with practice of an activity, just like the synaptic plasticity grows with practice.  Clarification of some of the mechanisms of learning by neuro science has been advanced, in part, by the advent of non-invasive imaging technologies, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (FMRI). These technologies have allowed researchers to observe human learning processes directly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How People Learn: Brian, mind, Experience and School|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these types of technologies, we are now able to see and study what happens in the process of learning.  In different tests performed the brain being imaged showed a greater blood flow and activation to that area of the brain being stimulated through different activities such as finger tapping in a specific sequence.  It has been revealed that the process at the beginning of learning a new skill happens quickly, and later on slows down to almost a plateau.  This process can also be referred to as The Law of Learning.  The slower learning showed in the FMRI that in the cerebral cortex this was when the long term learning was occurring, suggesting that the structural changes in the cortex reflect the enhancement of skill memories during later stages of training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   When a person studies a skill for a longer duration of time, but in a shorter amount of time they will learn quickly, but also only retain the information into their [[short-term memory]].  Just like studying for an exam; if a student tries to learn everything the night before, it will not stick in the long run.  If a person studies a skill for a shorter duration of time, but more frequently and long-term, their brain will retain this information much longer as it is stored in the [[long-term memory]].  Functional and structural studies of the brain have revealed a vast interconnectivity between diverse regions of the cerebral cortex.  For example, large numbers of axons interconnect the posterior sensory areas serving vision, audition, and touch with anterior motor regions.  Constant communication between sensation and movement makes sense, because to execute smooth movement through the environment, movement must be continuously integrated with knowledge about one's surroundings obtained via sensory perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The cerebral cortex plays a role in allowing humans to do this.

The cerebellum is critical to the ability for a human or animal to be able to regulate movement.  This area of the brain wraps around the brainstem and is very densely packed with neurons and neural connections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This part of the brain is involved in timing as well as movement.  It assists in predicting events, especially in the formation, execution, and timing of conditioned responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The cerebellum plays a very important role in all forms of kinesthetic learning and motor function.  For a ballerina, it is important to be able to control their movements and time it exactly right for their routine.  For a football player it is important to be able to regulate movement when running throwing, and being able to have control over where the ball goes as well as the timing of it.

All three of these important systems in the brain function together as a team, one not being more important than the other.  They work together to allow for responding to sensory events, timing, controlling physical actions, and more.  However, it is important to remember than unless a person is actively practicing, these parts of the brain won't help them get to their full potential. Alterations in the brain that occur during learning seem to make the nerve cells more efficient or powerful. Studies have shown that animals raised in complex environments have a greater volume of capillaries per nerve cell—and therefore a greater supply of blood to the brain—than the caged animals, regardless of whether the caged animal lived alone or with companions. Overall, these studies depict an orchestrated pattern of increased capacity in the brain that depends on experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Lakehead University''' is a [[public research university]] with campuses in [[Thunder Bay]] and [[Orillia]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Lakehead University, shortened to 'Lakehead U', or 'LU', is non-denominational and provincially supported. It has undergraduate programs, graduate programs, the [[Lakehead University Faculty of Law|Bora Laskin Faculty of Law]], the only internationally accredited (AACSB) business school in northern Ontario, and is home to the western campus of the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]]. 

Lakehead has more than 45,000 alumni. The main campus in Thunder Bay has about 7,900 students. As of September 2006, a new permanent extension campus in Orillia, located about {{convert|150|km}} north of [[Toronto]], has about 1,400 students.

==History==

Lakehead University evolved from Lakehead Technical Institute and Lakehead College of Arts, Science, and Technology.
&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/lakehead-university/ "Lakehead University"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lakehead Technical Institute was established in response to a brief that outlined the need for an institution of higher education in northwestern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_6746_1.html|Ontario Heritage Trust  Lakehead University&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on June 4, 1946, by an Order-in-Council of the Province of [[Ontario]]. Classes commenced in January 1948, in temporary rented quarters in downtown [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]. In September of that same year, the first university courses were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref name="Harold S 1987"&gt;Harold S. Braun with William G. Tamblyn. 'A Northern Vision: The Development of Lakehead University.' Thunder Bay: Lakehead University, President's Office, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology was established by an Act of the [[Ontario Legislature]] proclaimed on August 1, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lakehead University Act board.lakeheadu.ca/wp/?pg=18&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences.&lt;ref name="Harold S 1987"/&gt; The Lakehead University Act, 1965, was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The ''Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology'', thereafter known as "Lakehead University," was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965. The first university chancellor was Senator [[Norman McLeod Paterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Thunder Bay campus===

The original college site comprised about 32 hectares of land in south-west [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land was purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.

[[Image:Lakehead University Summer Campus.jpg|thumb|right|Centennial Building]]

[[Image:Lakehead University Advanced Technology Centre.jpg|thumb|right| Advanced Technology &amp; Academic Centre.]]

In 2005 the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]] (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] organized within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across [[Northern Ontario]], including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses. NOSM is the only Canadian medical school to be established as a stand-alone not-for-profit corporation, with its own Board of Directors and corporation bylaws.

A new [[law school]] was established; the faculty accepted its first students in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lakehead-wins-approval-to-launch-law-school/article586735/ "Lakehead wins approval to launch law school"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', July 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is housed in the former [[Port Arthur Collegiate Institute]].  In 2014 it was named the [[Lakehead University Faculty of Law|Bora Laskin Faculty of Law]], after the fourteenth [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice of Canada]].

Lakehead University's physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds.

===Orillia campus===

Lakehead University opened a campus at Heritage Place in Downtown [[Orillia]] in 2006; during the first semester there were about 100 students.

In September 2010 the university expanded to its new 500 University Avenue location. A new academic building at this site represents the first phase in the development of Canada’s first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Platinum university campus.  A 271-bed student residence building and a cafeteria/bookstore facility opened in November 2012 at the University Avenue site.  Lakehead Orillia now has over 1,400 students studying at the Heritage Place and University Avenue sites.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lakeheadu.ca/about/orillia-campus&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate programs are offered at the 500 University Avenue site, while the professional year of Lakehead – Orillia’s education programs are offered at the downtown campus.

===Residence===
Accommodations at Lakehead are divided into three living styles: residence halls, apartments and townhouses. The Thunder Bay residence currently has a total of 1,196 beds and three cafeteria/dining halls. Students can choose from meal options that range from kitchenette, full-kitchen and complete meal plan depending on the residence styles.

The men's residence for 52 students was opened in fall of 1962, and has grown to include a residence village consisting of 10 new buildings. The village is situated on the banks of the McIntyre River within  five-minute walking distance of all university buildings and athletic facilities.

From 1989 to 1992, a complex of townhouses, including some handicap accessible units, was added to the residence facility.

A 271-bed residence in Orillia opened its doors in late Fall 2012. The Orillia residence has one mandatory meal plan for students, as well as one cafeteria, owned by Madison County.

===Agricultural Research Station===
The university supports a research station near Thunder Bay to test newly developed crop varieties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/agricultural-research-station-growing-new-and-exciting-ideas-3-photos-994830 "Agricultural Research Station growing new and exciting ideas"]. ''Thunder Bay Newswatch'',  Jul 25, 2018 by Doug Diaczuk &lt;/ref&gt; The station had been in operation for a number of years, and was officially taken over by the university in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbnewswatch.com/local-news/lakehead-university-officially-on-board-with-research-station-913788 "Lakehead University officially on board with research station"].

The university has nine faculties: Business Administration, [[Education]], [[Engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/lakehead-university-engineering-competition-1.4584233 "Lakehead University engineering students earn 1st place in national competition"]. Christina Jung · ''CBC News'' · Mar 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural Resources Management]], Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences, [[Science]] and [[Environmental Studies]], [[Social Sciences]] and [[Humanities]], [[Faculty of Medicine - Lakehead University|Medicine]], and [[Graduate Studies]]. The Faculty of Law welcomed its first students in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario/lakehead-wins-approval-to-launch-law-school/article2087762/ | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By full-time undergraduate enrollment, the Social Sciences &amp; Humanities is the largest faculty at Lakehead, with about 30% of the students, followed by Health and Behavioral Sciences, Science &amp; Environmental Studies, Engineering, Education, and Business Administration. Two small faculties are Natural Resources Management and Medicine, each with less than 2% of the student enrollment.

===Aboriginal===
[[Image:Lakehead University Which-Way Sign.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A [[bilingual sign]]. The languages are English and [[Anishinaabe language|Anishinaabe]].]]

As a percentage of total student population, Lakehead University has one of the largest aboriginal student communities in Canada. The university has a governing board with senate policies along with Aboriginal-governed councils within its university governance structure. Lakehead also offers Aboriginal support including the Office of Aboriginal Initiatives. Special first-year bridging programs for Aboriginal students are provided. Tutoring services are available within Lakehead’s Native Nursing Access Program. There is also the Superior Science Program which goes to remote Aboriginal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/cms-filesystem-action?file=pdfs/conferences/2007/aboriginal-rt-spring-report.pdf.|title=The University of Winnipeg|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakehead has Canada's only Department of Aboriginal Education to foster Native Language instruction and prepare teachers to meet the needs of Aboriginal students and communities.

===Scholarships and bursaries===

=== Alabama ===
In 1985, [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] began to offer a master's degree in the book arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama book arts program]&lt;/ref&gt; in the School of Library and Informational Studies. It emphasizes making books by hand.

[[Edith Frohock]] taught book arts at [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]. Frohock specialized in painting, printmaking and artist's books and was the first instructor to teach books as art in the South. [[Mary Ann Sampson]] credits Frohock for steering her in the direction of book arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230202400/http://www.uab.edu/art/PDFs/scholarships/UAB_Art_Frohock_Scholar.pdf |date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space One Eleven in Birmingham, Alabama is a not-for-profit under the direction of [[Anne Arrasmith]] and Peter Prinz. The organization has exhibited books as art on numerous occasions including the work of [[Larry Gens Anderson]], [[Pinky Bass]], [[Jon Coffelt]], [[Edith Frohock]], [[Ann Howard (author)|Anne Howard]], [[Joni Mabe]], [[Mary Ann Sampson]], [[David Sandlin]], [[Joel Seah]] and [[Marie Weaver]] among many others who have worked in book arts.

[[Agnes (gallery)|Agnes]] 1992–2001 was the first commercial gallery to show book arts in the South and one of only a handful in the country. During its eight years, the gallery, owned by Shawn Boley, [[Jon Coffelt]] and Janet Hughes exhibited the work of many noteworthy book artists including Sara Garden Armstrong, [[Pinky Bass]], Mare Blocker, Elisa Bryan, Denise Carbone, Al Edwards, [http://www.susanhenseldesign.com/artbooks.html Susan Hensel], [[Jenny Holzer]], Davi Det Hompson, [[Lee Isaacs]], Sally Johnson, Susan E.

=== California ===
The CODEX Foundation, founded in 2005 and located in Berkeley, holds The CODEX International Symposium and Artists' Book Fair every two years in early February, on the odd year.  It is the largest artists' book fair in the world with over 300 artists coming from more than 26 countries. The Codex Foundation exists to preserve and promote the contemporary hand-made book as a work of art in the broadest possible context and to bring to public recognition the artists, the craftsmanship, and the rich history of the civilization of the book. Their mission also carries with it a deep obligation to publish in an affordable format essays, manifestos, and theoretical writings that serve to promote and contextualize the work of contemporary artists of the book. The editorial strategy is to publish exemplary materials that showcase the state of the art of the book worldwide, and to provide a broader public platform for the artists, writers, and printers whose art, craft, and livelihoods depend largely on a healthy commercial environment for their work. To support its mission they have published Book Art Object Vol.s 1 &amp; 2 devoted to the exhibitors and symposia proceedings of CODEX events, both volumes are considered as valuable books of reference for the field, 14 Code(X)+1 monographs devoted to critical theory, and Alchimie du Verbe and Mapping the Artist’s Cosmos box set Assembly-Exchanges, original prints from 52 renowned book artists and printers.

The [[San Francisco Center for the Book]] was founded by Mary Austin and Kathleen Burch in 1996 and was the first Center of its kind on the West Coast. SFCB maintains a 6,358 square foot facility that houses a large print studio, book bindery, and classroom and administrative space. SFCB offers four to five book arts-related exhibitions each year, focused on artist's books, design bindings, fine press books, artist retrospectives, and private collections among other topics. Its workshop program presents 325 letterpress printing, bookbinding, and related arts workshops to nearly 2,000 students annually. SFCB is also home to the annual Roadworks Steamroller Printing Festival, a local artist/vendor street festival that celebrates printing by using the road surface as a printing bed and antique steamrollers as presses for large-scale linocut prints. Attendance at this street festival tops 3,000.

The [[Los Angeles]] art scene (see: [[:Category:Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area|Art in the Greater Los Angeles Area]]) is considered one of the founding homes of the artist's book. "Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations", created by [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1964 is one of the first artist's books. The [[Athenaeum Music &amp; Arts Library]] in [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]] has a large collection of artists' books, focusing on conceptual artists' books, and those created by California artists and presses. The library holds the complete collection of Ruscha's conceptual artist's books created during the 1960s and 70s.

The Women's Graphic Center, at the [[Woman's Building]], was founded in 1973, for women artists to create artist's books. Exhibitions were held there. The center closed in 1991. The Lab Press was founded in the 1970s by Woman's Building co-founder [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] to teach printing and the making of books.

The [[Otis College of Art and Design]] began collecting and exhibiting artists' books in the 1960s.

Mills College in Oakland offers undergraduate as well as graduate degrees in Book Arts. Mills College offers a unique MFA in Book Art and Creative Writing Program, the first such program in the country, which is designed to help develop the student as both a writer and a visual artist, to enhance the understanding of contemporary writing and its visual forms, and to encourage a deep exploration of the book as both a literary artifact and a material object that exists in space and time.

=== Florida ===
[[Florida Atlantic University]]'s Wimberly Library is home to the [http://www.library.fau.edu/depts/spc/jaffe.htm Jaffe Center for Book Arts] which revolves around a collection of books as aesthetic objects focused on artists' books and limited editions. In 1998, Arthur and Mata Jaffe donated their collection of 2,800 books to FAU and the Jaffe Collection opened in 2000. Since then, the collection has grown to over 6,000 cataloged materials, as well as thousands more yet to be cataloged. In 2007, an expanded Jaffe Center for Book Arts opened; it included a letterpress studio, book bindery and paper making lab. In 2011, poet and artist Helen M. Salzberg established JCBA's Artist in Residence (AIR) program which funds two residencies each academic year. The AIRs produce creative works utilizing JCBA facilities. They also teach workshops and provide mentoring opportunities to FAU students and staff. JCBA is based at a university, but the center's programming is community-based: JCBA offers workshops and presents educational book arts programming (as well as intimate concerts, films and other book art related events) for the students and faculty of FAU as well as the broader community.

The [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville, FL has a small collection of [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm book arts] in the [[Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject Guide to the Harold and Mary Jean Hanson Rare Book Collection |url=http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/rarebook/links.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; including engraving proofs from [[William Morris]], engraved wood blocks by [[Eric Gill]], and letterpress books by [[Julie Chen (book artist)]]. In addition, undergraduate and graduate courses in book arts and letterpress are offered in the [[University of Florida College of the Arts]].

The Virginia Arts of the Book Center was founded in 1995 in Charlottesville as a public-access book arts workshop providing cooperative use of presses and type for letterpress printing. Begun by Josef Beery, Cal Otto, and Terry Belanger, the Center became the locus of serious artistic activity during the years preceding and following the turn of the millennium when book artist, art theoretician, and author Johanna Drucker became its visiting artist for almost a decade. Partnership with the University of Virginia Art Department through the sponsorship of art professor and book artist Dean Dass opened the center to the activities of college students from surrounding academic institutions. Through the leadership of Kevin McFadden, the self-governed organization was absorbed by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities during this period and then in 2018 became a part of the Virginia Center for the Book. The current resident artist and program director is Garrett Queen who provides support to a vibrant group of book artists who teach classes and sponsor events encouraging and supporting the arts of the book. They describe themselves as "a community of artists exploring books, paper, and printmaking."

'''Management of dyslexia''' depends on a multiple of variables; there is no one specific strategy or set of strategies which will work for all who have dyslexia. 

Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

Several [[special education]] approaches have been developed for students with dyslexia. [[Adaptive technology]], such as specialized computer software, has resulted in recent innovations helpful to many people with dyslexia.

One factor that characterises the field of dyslexia remediation is the stream of [[alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities]]. These controversial treatments include nutritional supplements, special diets, [[homeopathy]], and [[osteopathy]]/[[chiropractic]] manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Lang Commun Disord |year=2008 |title= Survey of complementary and alternative therapies used by children with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia) |volume= 44 |author= Bull L |doi=10.1080/13682820802015643 |issue= 2 |pmid=18608596 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems and orthography==
[[File:Visual-dyslexia.jpg|thumb|290px|Corrective glasses are used to cure visual dyslexia]]
{{details|topic=Orthography|Orthographies and dyslexia}}
A [[writing system]] is a type of [[symbolic system]] used to represent elements or statements expressible in [[language]].
The [[orthography]] of a [[language]] specifies the correct way of using a specific [[writing system]] to write the language. Where more than one writing system is used for a language, for example for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], there can be more than one orthography.

===Alphabetic orthography===
Most teaching is geared to remediating specific areas of weakness, such as addressing difficulties with phonetic decoding by providing phonics-based tutoring.  Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite claims of some programs to be "research based", there is very little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular approach to reading instruction as compared to another when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torgesen (2004) emphasized the importance of explicit instruction for remediation as well as the need for intensity that is completely different from regular classroom instruction.  To make gains in reading, students need highly structured, sequential interactive activities and close monitoring, directly connecting the known with the new, with sufficient time for practice of new skills to build automaticity and fluency. The size of the instructional group is also important, ideally between 1:1 and 1:3.&lt;ref&gt;Birsh, Judith R. (2005).  Research and reading disability. In Judith R. Birsh (Ed), "Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills" (pp. 16-17). Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. Baltimore, Maryland. {{ISBN|978-1-55766-676-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions in a Latin alphabet writing system==

There is little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular program for reading instruction when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007/&gt;

In 2007 the researchers Joseph Torgesen and Richard Wagner have shown that, when teaching children with reading disabilities, programs including systematic and explicit instruction in phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence are far more successful than programs that do not.

==Academic remediations==
With appropriate instruction, dyslexics can become skilled readers. Appropriate remedial instruction includes using:

* Direct, explicit and comprehensive instruction in the structure of language
* A systematic sequence for teaching individual skills
* Structured information from the simple to the complex
* Simultaneous multisensory approaches, including combinations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities
* Interaction between student and teacher during instruction of new skills
* Reinforcement throughout the day of newly learned skills
* Integrated spelling and handwriting instruction sequence with reading instruction, so that they are mutually reinforcing
* Extended practice for each skill until the student overlearns the skill (see [[Overlearning]] and [[Automaticity]])
* Ongoing review of previously learned skills
* Careful pacing to avoid information overload
* Intensive instruction until reading, spelling and writing skills are at grade level.
* Repeated reading to help develop fluency and reading rate&lt;ref name="uhry"&gt;Uhry, Joanna Kellogg and Diana Brewster Clark (2004). Dyslexia: theory and practice of instruction. Pro-ed publishers. pp. 88-89. {{ISBN|1-4164-0115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paired reading to help develop fluency and enhance comprehension.

==Classroom accommodations==
Although there are no treatments or quick cures for dyslexia there are many techniques that can be used to assist dyslexic students in the classroom while reading skills are being remediated. These include such things as:
* Oral testing
* Untimed tests
* Audiobooks
* Eliminate or reduce spelling tests
* Minimizing the need to read out loud &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Gavin. Dyslexia 2nd edition. New York: Continuum International.(2007).Pages 41-95&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allow students to record the Teacher explaining homework (for example on a Dictaphone) to ensure an accurate account of the homework is made.
* Accept dictated homework
* Reduce homework load
* Grade on content, not spelling nor handwriting
* Reduce copying tasks
* Avoid or reduce essay tests
* Providing teacher handouts to supplement the notes taken
* Using materials that are not visually overcrowded
* To increase motivation, giving assignments in areas in which the student has a strong interest, for example, sports stories, biographies of inventors or rock musicians, or fiction about teenage issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allkindsofminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use an appropriate layout, including a larger font size, larger line spacing (1.5) and a clear font - sans-serif fonts are usually recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html Dyslexia Style guide from the British Dyslexia Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224433/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some dyslexic people are sensitive to the colour of the paper and may find off-white, pale green or pale purple paper can make reading easier. 
* Using appropriate font type and size.  It is suggested{{by whom|date=July 2011}} that [[Sassoon (typeface)|Sassoon]] and [[Comic Sans]] may be the easiest to read; [[Times New Roman]] may be one of the most difficult to read. The font should not be too small. There are several fonts and typefaces designed for dyslexia including ''Gill Dyslexic'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ Gill Dyslexic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924215435/http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Read Regular'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readregular.com/english/regular.html Read Regular] typeface&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexia Readable]],  ''Sylexiad'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html Sylexiad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709074857/http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html |date=2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDyslexic]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendyslexic.org/ OpenDyslexic]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cadman'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://pjmiller.deviantart.com/art/Cadman-732272890 Cadman] &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dyslexie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664561/dyslexie-a-typeface-designed-to-help-dyslexics-read Dyslexie] font&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin writing system only). However, although dyslexics may prefer some of these special fonts, there is no evidence that any of the fonts nominally designed for dyslexics helps them read more easily or better,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s-e-o.org/which-font-is-best-for-dyslexic-users-the-science-reviewed/|title=Which Font is Best For Dyslexic Users?

==Recent developments==
[[Accessible publishing]] works to make reading easier for all who struggle with the standard one-size-fits-all method of book publishing. Accessible publishing works with publishers and  [[Print on Demand]] technology which allows the reader to choose how the books will be published. Available format variations include choosing the font size (from 11 point font  through to 28 point font), whether the font is bold, italic or regular, and choosing the amount of line spacing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Format/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a variety of special fonts being developed for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ | work=The New York Times | title=Making Reading Easier | first=Dwight | last=Garner | date=2008-05-20 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some individuals with dyslexia report improved ease of reading with different fonts, these reports are anecdotal; there is little empirical evidence to support the use of "dyslexia fonts". 
Accessible publishers, such as ReadHowYouWant, also work to make books available in [[Braille]], [[e-books]], [[audiobook]]s and [[DAISY]].

New formats such as streamline text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx What is streamline text?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233331/http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that help dyslexic people to track (move from one line to the next) more fluently. These work by adding 'sign-posts' into the text to show where to go next.

Teachers are also using audiobooks as a way of teaching textbooks in an engaging way to those with dyslexia. In the UK, one of the biggest charities is [[Listening Books]], which offers members a streaming service over the internet. An Australian company, ReadHowYouWant is working to make all published books available in [[audiobook]] form.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the nonprofit [[Learning Ally]] offers the world's largest library of human-narrated audio textbooks, and a second organization,  [[Bookshare]], offers a wide selection of synthetic-read audiobooks. These audiobooks work well for individuals who have word reading accuracy and fluency difficulties (i.e. dyslexics).

Individuals with dyslexia require more practice to master skills in their areas of deficit. In the circumstances where typically developing children need 30 to 60 hours training, the number of hours that has resulted in optimistic conclusions concerning the remediation of dyslexia is between 80 and 100 hours, or less if the intervention is started sufficiently early. Only approximately 20% of adults with early reading difficulties have acquired fluent reading skills in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Lyytinen&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lyytinen, Heikki, Erskine, Jane, Aro, Mikko, Richardson, Ulla | contribution = Reading and reading disorders | editor-last = Hoff | editor-first = Erika | title = Blackwell Handbook of Language Development | pages = 454–474 | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4051-3253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fmri|Functional MRI]] ([[fMRI]]) studies have shown neurological changes in dyslexic children and adults who have used phonological interventions, with improved performance on tests of phonemic awareness and text decoding.&lt;ref name=ClinicalTrial&gt;{{cite journal | title=Neural Changes following Remediation in Adult Developmental Dyslexia (Clinical Study) | journal=Neuron | date=2004-10-28 | first1=Guinevere | last1=Eden |first2=Karen M. |last2=Jones |first3=Katherine |last3=Cappell |first4=Lynn |last4=Gareau |first5=Frank B. |last5=Wood |first6=Thomas A. |last6=Zeffiro |first7=Nicole A.E. |last7=Dietz |first8=John A. |last8=Agnew |first9=D.

[[fMRI]] studies have also shown changes in the brain and spelling improvement of dyslexic children taught [[spelling]] phonetically in an [[orthography|orthographic]] manner.&lt;ref name=Dahms2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahms, Joel. | year = 2006| title = Spelling Out Dyslexia | journal = Northwest Science &amp; Technology |url = https://depts.washington.edu/nwst/issues/index.php?issueID=fall_2006&amp;storyID=800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study has shown that the usage of an FM system drives neural plasticity in children with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hornickel J, Zecker S, Bradlow A, Kraus N |title=Assistive listening devices drive neuroplasticity in children with dyslexia|journal=[PNAS] |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1206628109|pmc=3478599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FM system is a personal assistive listening device, consisting of a wireless microphone worn by the teacher, and a wireless receiver similar to a Bluetooth receiver worn on the ears by the pupil. Measurements of the brain’s response to speech sounds showed that the children who wore the device for one year responded more consistently to the very soft and rapidly changing elements of sounds that help distinguish one consonant from another (cat, bat, pat etc.). That improved stability was linked with reading improvement based on standardized measures of readability – which, as a long-term benefit, points to brain plasticity.

==National statutory provision and support structures==
{{details|topic=National statutory provision and support structures|:Category:Dyslexia support by country}}
Each country has adopted and developed a [[writing system]] of choice.
Each country has their own Statutes relating to the [[:Category:Education by country|provision of Education]], and special educational needs. The statutory provision framework of support in each country is usually complemented by many independent and voluntary support agencies providing more specialised information and support.

'''Marlene F. Kramer''' is an American nurse, educator and author. She wrote a 1974 book, ''Reality Shock: Why Nurses Leave Nursing'', which examined burnout in the nursing profession. Her book has been widely cited in subsequent studies on retention and satisfaction within nursing.

==Biography==
Marlene Kramer received an undergraduate degree in nursing from [[St. Louis University]] in 1953. She completed a master of science in nursing at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1958 and a PhD in sociology and education at [[Stanford University]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaker's Profile: Marlene Kramer, PhD, RN, FAAN|url=http://www.prolibraries.com/amsn/?select=speaker&amp;speakerID=47218|publisher=[[Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years after completing the doctorate, Kramer taught at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. Kramer left UCSF to become dean at the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=Morning&gt;{{cite news|title=Kramer Named|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1ddHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_f8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1338,2324082&amp;dq=marlene+kramer+nursing&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 5, 2013|newspaper=The Morning Record and Journal|date=June 14, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, while still serving as dean at Connecticut, Kramer filed a libel lawsuit against seven of the university's nursing faculty members and the director of the faculty union. The faculty members had previously submitted complaints to the university alleging that Kramer plagiarized material and mismanaged the department.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=David|title=Nursing School Dean at UConn Files Libel Suit Against Faculty|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ae8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5941,6955&amp;dq=marlene+kramer+nursing&amp;hl=en|accessdate=June 5, 2013|newspaper=The Day|date=September 1, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer remained at UConn until 1987.&lt;ref name=SON&gt;{{cite web|title=First 50 Years of UConn SON|url=http://nursing.uconn.edu/about/50-years-uconn-son|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130820195617/http://nursing.uconn.edu/about/50-years-uconn-son|archivedate=August 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer developed the concept of ''reality shock'' while studying the retention of new nurses. She identified [[role conflict]] as a major stressor for new nurses as they struggled to balance the needs of each patient with the pressures and responsibilities imposed by the work setting.&lt;ref name=Graduate&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halfer|first=Diana and Elaine Graf|title=Graduate Nurse Perceptions of the Work Experience|journal=Nursing Economics|year=2006|volume=24|issue=3|pages=150–155|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/541778|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After 1910, a Higher Education Office and a Libraries Inspection Office were established. During the [[Turkish War of Independence|War of National Liberation]], there were two ministries of education.
The Ministry of Education of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Grand National Assembly]] was in '''Ankara''', the Ministry of Education of the [[Ottoman Government]] in '''Istanbul'''. After the Turkish Grand National Assembly was opened on 23 April 1920 a "Ministry of Education" was established by Law no. 3 of 2 May 1920 as one of the eleven ministries working under the [[Council of Ministers of Turkey|Council of Ministers]].&lt;ref name="meb1-16"&gt;Background written by the Ministry of National Education at the beginning of 2002 [http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/apk2002ing/apage01_16.htm OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL EDUCATION]; accessed on 3 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 the Ministry of Education consisted of the following five units:

# The Program Committee
# Department of Primary Education
# Department of Secondary Education
# Office of Turkish Antiquities
# Registry and Statistics Office
In 1923, the Ministry of Education in Istanbul was closed and the Ministry of Education in Ankara was expanded and reorganized to include eleven units. In the Republican period, organization of the Ministry of Education gradually developed and was reorganized with the Law no 2287 issued in 1933.&lt;ref name="meb1-16"/&gt;

The Ministry of National Education; has been organized under the following names:
* "The Ministry of Education" from 1923 to December 27, 1935,
* "The Ministry of Culture" from December 28, 1935 to September 21st 1941,
* "The Ministry of Education" from September 22, 1941 to October 9, 1946,
* "The Ministry of National Education" after October 10, 1946,
* "The Ministry of Education" after 1950,
* "The Ministry of National Education" after May 27, 1960,
* "The Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sports" after 1983,
* "The Ministry of National Education" after 1989.

==Structure==
According to Law no. 3797 on the organization and duties of the Ministry of National Education, the Ministry today consists of three divisions called: central, provincial and overseas organization. The Ministry of National Education has provincial organizations in 81 cities and 850 towns, 58 of them being the central towns of metropolitan cities. The Ministry of National Education has representation offices in 22 countries with 21 education undersecretaries and 17 education attaches.

The office of the Ministry consists of the Training Council, main service units, counselling and inspection units and auxiliary units. Chairmanship of the Occupational and Technical Training Research and Development Center and Chairmanship of the Project Coordination Board Center are also included in the central organization.&lt;ref name="meb1-16"/&gt;

==Controversy==

The '''National Professional Science Master's Association (NPSMA)''' is a collaborative of program directors, faculty, administrators, alumni, and students of [[Professional Science Master's (PSM) Degree Programs]] that supports PSM degree program initiatives. It engages businesses, industries, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and professional associations in the development of PSM degree programs and with internship and job placement for PSM degree program students and graduates.

==History==
In July 2007, the NPSMA was awarded a development grant by the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], bylaws were adopted, and the first board of directors elected. Bogdan Vernescu, professor and head of the Mathematical Sciences Department at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (WPI), served as the first president of the NPSMA from July 2007 through December 2008. Stephen J. Lemire was hired as the first executive director, October 2007.

==Founding Members==
In addition to Vernescu, the other founding board members were Ursula Bechert, Dave Bieber, Lisbeth Borbye, Jung Choi, Loida Escote-Carlson, Elizabeth Friedman, Alaina Levine, and Peiru Wu.

==Advisory board==
The NPSMA has a national Advisory Board of leaders in academia, industry, and graduate education who further the connection between universities and employers supporting PSM degree programs.

==Products and services==
The NPSMA provides national conferences and quarterly workshops for those in the PSM community to network, share experiences, and develop best practices. The NPSMA offers PSM constituents information on PSM developments through its website, newsletter, and listserv calls-to-action. PSM advocates may also network electronically through any of the NPSMA’s various social media pages. The NPSMA has also established an Alumni Connection designed to provide professional development opportunities for PSM graduates and students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npsma.org/network_overview.html Alumni Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; The NPSMA provides the PSM community with one common PSM marketing brand and invites programs to be represented by the NPSMA at regional and national conferences, career fairs, and tradeshows.

One of the strategic goals of the NPSMA is to collect data on all of the PSM degree programs nationwide and serve as a clearinghouse for these data. Informing government, industry, and institutions of higher education is part of its mission.

==Endorsement==
In 2008, the [[United States National Research Council]] endorsed the NPSMA in its publication "Science Professionals: Master's Education for a Competitive World":

"We encourage the further development of the National Professional Science Master's Association (NPSMA)...The NPSMA has a unique opportunity to strengthen the national PSM movement by engaging all its constituents in a synergistic collaboration.”

'''Nuffic''' is the Dutch organisation for internationalisation in education. It is an independent, non-profit organisation based in [[The Hague]], [[the Netherlands]].

Its most important contract partners are the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture &amp; Science]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Nuffic plays an important role in fostering international cooperation in education between the Netherlands and other countries.

Nuffic is part of the Dutch education field. Its goal is to support Dutch institutions and the Dutch government in internationalisation activities. The focus of its service lies in the Netherlands, even though its mission extends beyond that. To this end Nuffic cooperates with foreign partners, institutions and governments. The organisation dedicates itself primarily to the Dutch [[knowledge economy]], but at the same time it stimulates [[capacity building]] in developing countries.

==Activities==
Nuffic focuses on the following activities:
* managing programmes by order of the Dutch government, the [[European Union]] and third parties;
* encouraging international experience for students of all ages;
* strengthening the position and reputation of Dutch higher education and scientific research;
* evaluating diplomas and furthering transparency of education systems;
* joining and presenting knowledge and expertise.

==History==
Nuffic was founded on 11 January 1952 by the president curators of the then Dutch universities. The goal was primarily to organise English education for students from developing countries that had recently gained independence. For this purpose the Institute of Social Studies (ISS) was established, initially as part of Nuffic, but it became an independent institute in 1956. This is where the current role of Nuffic in [[development cooperation]] – management of scholarship programmes and institutional cooperation programmes – finds its roots.

The first official president was [[Prince Bernard of the Netherlands]], who remained in that position for two years. After [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] moved to [[Het Loo Palace]], Nuffic relocated to [[Noordeinde Palace]] until 1977. Currently, Nuffic is situated in another famous building in The Hague: the former headquarters of the PTT (Post, Telegraph, Telephone), an organisation that used to be state owned, on the Kortenaerkade. The building is a national monument.

Over the years Nuffic acquired a great number of other tasks. Since 1958 the organisation is involved in the recognition of international diplomas and making comparisons of education systems. Its efforts to support educational cooperation in Europe increased during the 1980s. That is when both The Hague and Brussels set up stimulation programmes, among which the well-known [[Erasmus Programme]]. 

On 5 November 2012 Fedde Klaas (Freddy) Weima took up the position of Director-General of Nuffic.
Mr Weima succeeds Mr S.P. van den Eijnden, who left Nuffic in the spring of 2012 to become President of the Executive Board of the [[Open University of the Netherlands]].

In 2015 Nuffic merged with Europees Platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26612">'''Parent management training''' ('''PMT'''), also known as '''behavioral parent training''' ('''BPT''') or simply '''parent training''', is a family of treatment programs that aims to change parenting behaviors, teaching parents [[positive reinforcement]] methods for improving pre-school and school-age children's behavior problems (such as aggression, hyperactivity, [[tantrum|temper tantrums]], and difficulty following directions).&lt;ref name=Maliken2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maliken AC, Katz LF |title=Exploring the impact of parental psychopathology and emotion regulation on evidence-based parenting interventions: a transdiagnostic approach to improving treatment effectiveness |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=173–86|date=June 2013|pmid=23595362 |doi=10.1007/s10567-013-0132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMT is one of the most investigated treatments available for disruptive behavior, particularly [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD) and [[conduct disorder]] (CD);&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Menting2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Michelson2013/&gt; it is effective in reducing child disruptive behavior&lt;ref name=Michelson2013/&gt; and improving parental mental health.&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt;  PMT has also been studied as a treatment for disruptive behaviors in children with other conditions.  Limitations of the existing research on PMT include a lack of knowledge on mechanisms of change&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt; and the absence of studies of long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt; PMT may be more difficult to implement when parents are unable to participate fully due to psychopathology, limited cognitive capacity, high partner conflict, or inability to attend weekly sessions.&lt;ref name=Pfiffner2014/&gt;

PMT was initially developed in the 1960s by child psychologists who studied changing children's disruptive behaviors by intervening to change parent behaviors.&lt;ref name=Forehand2013/&gt; The model was inspired by principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[applied behavioral analysis]]. Treatment, which typically lasts for several months, focuses on parents learning to provide positive reinforcement, such as praise and rewards, for children's appropriate behaviors while setting proper limits, using methods such as removing attention for inappropriate behaviors.

== Technique ==
Poor parenting, inadequate parental supervision, discipline that is not consistent, and parental mental health status, stress or substance abuse all contribute to early-onset conduct problems; the resulting costs to society are high.&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt; In the context of developing countries in particular, family socio-economic disadvantage is a significant predictor of abusive parenting that impacts adolescent's psychological, behavioural and physical health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meinck|first=Franziska|last2=Cluver|first2=Lucie Dale|last3=Orkin|first3=Frederick Mark|last4=Kuo|first4=Caroline|last5=Sharma|first5=Amogh Dhar|last6=Hensels|first6=Imca Sifra|last7=Sherr|first7=Lorraine|date=2016-10-25|title=Pathways From Family Disadvantage via Abusive Parenting and Caregiver Mental Health to Adolescent Health Risks in South Africa|journal=The Journal of Adolescent Health: Official Publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.08.016|issn=1879-1972|pmid=27793729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative parenting practices and negative child behavior contribute to one another in a "coercive cycle", in which one person begins by using a negative behavior to control the other person's behavior. That person in turn responds with a negative behavior, and the negative exchange escalates until one person's negative behavior "wins" the battle.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|161}} For example, if a child throws a temper tantrum to avoid doing a chore, the parent may respond by yelling that the child must do it, to which the child responds by tantruming even louder, at which point the parent may give in to the child to avoid further disruption. The child's tantrums are thereby reinforced; by throwing a tantrum, she/he has achieved the end goal of getting out of the chore. PMT seeks to break patterns that reinforce negative behavior by instead teaching parents to reinforce positive behaviors.&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;

The content of PMT, as well as the sequencing of skills within the training, varies according to the approach being used. In most PMT, parents are taught to define and record observations of their child's behavior, both positive and negative; this may involve the use of a [[progress chart]]. This monitoring procedure provides useful information for the parents and therapist to set specific goals for treatment, and to measure the child's progress over time.&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|216}}&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|166}} Parents learn to give specific, concise instructions using eye contact while speaking in a calm manner.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|167}}

Providing positive [[reinforcement]] for appropriate child behaviors is a major focus of PMT. Typically, parents learn to reward appropriate behavior through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child).&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|216}} In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called "successive approximations").&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|216}}&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|162}}

PMT also teaches parents to appropriately set limits using structured techniques in response to their child's negative behavior. The different ways in which parents are taught to respond to positive versus negative behavior in children is sometimes referred to as differential reinforcement. For mildly annoying but not dangerous behavior, parents practice ignoring the behavior. Following unwanted behavior, parents are also introduced to the proper use of the [[time-out (parenting)|time-out]] technique, in which parents remove attention (which serves as a form of reinforcement) from the child for a specified period of time.&lt;ref name=Barkley&gt;Barkley RA  (2013). ''Defiant children: A clinician's manual for assessment and parent training.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} Parents also learn to remove their child's privileges, such as television or play time, in a systematic way in response to unwanted behavior. Across all of these strategies, the therapist emphasizes that consequences should be administered calmly, immediately, and consistently, and balanced with encouragement for positive behaviors.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|168}}

In addition to positive reinforcement and limit setting in the home, many PMT programs incorporate collaboration with the child's teacher to track behavior in school and link it to the reward program at home.&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|216}}&lt;ref name=Barkley/&gt;{{rp|151}} Another common element of many PMT programs is preparing parents to manage problem behaviors in situations that are typically difficult for the child, such as being in a public place.&lt;ref name=Barkley/&gt;{{rp|151}}

The training is usually delivered by therapists (psychologists or social workers) to individual families or groups of families, and is conducted primarily with the parents rather than the child, although children can become involved as the therapist and parents see fit.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|162}}  A typical training course consists of 12 core weekly sessions;&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010&gt;Kazdin AE (2010).

''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 211&amp;ndash;226. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|215}}  with different programs ranging from four to twenty-four weekly sessions.&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt;

PMT is underutilized and training for therapists and other providers has been limited; it has not been widely used outside of clinical and research settings.&lt;ref name=Jones2013&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jones DJ, Forehand R, Cuellar J, etal |title=Harnessing innovative technologies to advance children's mental health: behavioral parent training as an example |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=241–52 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23313761 |pmc=3566281 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2012.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

The theory behind PMT has been "repeatedly validated", and many programs have met the "gold-standard criteria for well-established interventions".&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;  All of the established programs teach better parenting skills and emphasize that the parent-child relationship is "bidirectional".&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;

Specific treatment programs that can be broadly characterized as PMT include [[Parent–child interaction therapy]] (PCIT),&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt; the [[Incredible Years parent training]] (IYPT),&lt;ref name=Menting2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menting AT, Orobio de Castro B, Matthys W |title=Effectiveness of the Incredible Years parent training to modify disruptive and prosocial child behavior: a meta-analytic review |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=901–13 |date=December 2013 |pmid=23994367 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Triple P (parenting program)|Positive parenting program]] (Triple P),&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt; and Parent management training – Oregon model (PMTO).&lt;ref name= Eyberg2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eyberg SM, Nelson MM, Boggs SR |title=Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents with disruptive behavior |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=215–37 |date= January 2008 |pmid=18444059 |doi=10.1080/15374410701820117 |url=http://pcit.phhp.ufl.edu/Literature/EybergNelsonBoggs%282008%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCIT, IYPT, Triple P and [[Helping the non-compliant child]] (HNC) are among the most frequently used PMTs;&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt; according to Menting ''et al'' (2013), IYPT "is considered a 'blueprint' for violence prevention".&lt;ref name=Menting2013/&gt;

The per family cost of group parent training programs to bring an average child into a non-clinical range of behavioral disruption was estimated in 2013 to be US$2,500, which according to the authors of a Cochrane review was "modest when compared with the long-term health, social, educational and legal costs associated with childhood conduct problems".&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt;

==Effects==

=== Childhood disruptive behaviors ===
PMT is one of the most extensively studied treatments for childhood disruptive behaviors.&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furlong2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furlong M, McGilloway S, Bywater T, Hutchings J, Smith SM, Donnelly M |title=Cochrane review: behavioural and cognitive-behavioural group-based parenting programmes for early-onset conduct problems in children aged 3 to 12 years (Review) |journal=Evid Based Child Health |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=318–692 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23877886 |doi=10.1002/ebch.1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lundahl&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lundahl B, Risser HJ, Lovejoy MC |title=A meta-analysis of parent training: moderators and follow-up effects |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=86–104  |date=January 2006 |pmid=16280191 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.07.004 |url=http://www.akip.uk-koeln.de/studium_und_promotion/masterseminar-kinder-und-jugendlichenpsychotherapie/hautmann_lundahl2006_pmtmetaanalysis1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMT tended to have larger effects for younger children than older children, although the differences between age groups were not statistically significant.&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt; Improvement in parental mental health (depression, stress, irritability, anxiety, and sense of confidence)&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt; as well as parental behavior is noted.&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt;  Improvements in child and parent behavior were maintained up to one year after PMT, although the effects were small; very few studies have been done on the durability of the effects of PMT.&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt;

Families from economically disadvantaged backgrounds were less likely to benefit from PMT than their more advantaged counterparts, but this difference was attenuated if the low-income families received individual rather than group treatment.&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt; Overall, group formats of PMT delivery were less effective than individual formats,&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt; and the addition of individual therapy for the child did not improve outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lundahl/&gt;  Parental psychopathology, substance abuse, and maternal depression are associated with less successful outcomes;&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt; this may be because the "parents' ability to learn and consolidate the skills being taught" is affected, or parents may not be able to stay engaged in the program or translate the skills acquired to the home.&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;

Furlong ''et al'' (2013) concluded that group-based PMT is cost-effective in reducing conduct problems, and improving parental health and parenting skills, but that there is not enough evidence that it is effective on the measures of "child emotional problems and educational and cognitive abilities".&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt;

=== Other childhood-onset conditions ===
Although the bulk of the research on PMT examines its impact on disruptive behavior, it has also been studied as an intervention for other conditions.

Conflict is high in families of children with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), with parents showing "more negative and ineffective parenting (e.g., power assertive, punitive, inconsistent) and less positive or warm parenting, relative to parents of children without ADHD".&lt;ref name=Pfiffner2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pfiffner LJ, Haack LM |title=Behavior management for school-aged children with ADHD |journal=Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=731–46  |date=October 2014|pmid=25220083 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2014.05.014 |pmc=4167345}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMT targets dysfunctional parenting and school-related problems of children with ADHD, such as work completion and peer problems.&lt;ref name=Pfiffner2014/&gt; Pfiffner and Haack (2014) say PMT is well-established as a treatment for school-age children with ADHD, but that questions persist about the best methods for delivering PMT.&lt;ref name=Pfiffner2014/&gt; A meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment in children further supports this, as researchers found wide variability in how PMT was carried out across previous studies.&lt;ref name="Evans, Owens &amp; Bunford"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Evans SW, Owens JS, Buford N|title=Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=4|pages=527–51|pmid=24245813|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.850700|pmc=4025987}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis also noted that the clinicians involved in these studies often modified the training based on the needs of the family. This variation however, did not create significant differences in effectiveness of PMT across studies.&lt;ref name="Evans, Owens &amp; Bunford" /&gt; A 2011 Cochrane review found some evidence that PMT improves general child behavior and parental stress in treating ADHD, but has limited effects on ADHD-specific behavior.&lt;ref name=Zwi2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zwi M, Jones H, Thorgaard C, York A, Dennis JA |title=Parent training interventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children aged 5 to 18 years |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=12 |pages=CD003018 |date=2011 |pmid=22161373 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003018.pub3 |url= http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535216.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors concluded that there was a lack of data to evaluate school achievement, and a risk of bias in the studies due to poor methodology; existing evidence was not strong enough to form clear clinical guidelines with regard to PMT for ADHD, or to say whether group or individual PMT was more effective.&lt;ref name=Zwi2011/&gt;

A 2009 review of long-term outcomes in children with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) said that, in those children with TS who have other [[comorbidity|comorbid conditions]], PMT is effective in dealing with explosive behaviors and anger management.&lt;ref name=Bloch2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bloch MH, Leckman JF |title=Clinical course of Tourette syndrome |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=497–501 |date= December 2009  |pmid=19913654 |pmc=3974606 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Institute of Mental Health]] has designated the "gap between evidence-based treatments and community services" as an area critically in need of more research;&lt;ref name=Brookman2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brookman-Frazee L, Stahmer A, Baker-Ericzén MJ, Tsai K |title=Parenting interventions for children with autism spectrum and disruptive behavior disorders: opportunities for cross-fertilization |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=9 |issue=3–4 |pages=181–200 | date=December  2006 |pmid=17053963 |pmc=3510783 |doi=10.1007/s10567-006-0010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMT for disruptive behaviors in children with [[autism spectrum]] disorders is an area of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=Bearss2013&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bearss K, Lecavalier L, Minshawi N, etal |title=Toward an exportable parent training program for disruptive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuropsychiatry (London) |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=169–180 | date=April  2013 |pmid=23772233 |pmc=3678377 |doi=10.2217/npy.13.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Reichow2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Riechow  B, Kogan C, Barbul C, et al |title=Parent skills training for parents of children or adults with developmental disorders: systematic review and meta-analysis protocol |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e005799 |journal=BMJ Open |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e005799 |date=27 August 2014 |pmid=25164537 |pmc=4156800 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005799}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
There is a great deal of support for PMT in the research literature, but several limitations of the research have been noted. A common concern with implementing evidence-based treatments in community (as opposed to research) contexts is that the robust effects found in clinical trials may not generalize to complex community populations and settings.&lt;ref name=Michelson2013/&gt; To address this concern, a meta-analysis of PMT studies coded across "real-world" criteria found no significant differences in the effectiveness of PMT when it was delivered to clinic versus study-referred populations, in routine service versus research settings, or by non-specialist versus specialist therapists (such as those with direct links to the program developers).&lt;ref name=Michelson2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michelson D, Davenport C, Dretzke J, Barlow J, Day C |title=Do evidence-based interventions work when tested in the "real world?" A systematic review and meta-analysis of parent management training for the treatment of child disruptive behavior |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=18–34  |date=March 2013 |pmid=23420407 |doi=10.1007/s10567-013-0128-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased attention to the impact of cultural diversity on PMT outcomes – especially given that parenting practices are deeply rooted in culture – was called for in the 1990s;&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|224}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forehand R, Kotchick BA | year = 1996 | title = Cultural diversity: A wake-up call for parent training  | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 187–206 | doi = 10.1016/S0005-7894(96)80014-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  a 2013 review said the emphasis on ethnic and cultural differences was unjustified in terms of efficacy.&lt;ref name=Ortiz2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ortiz C, Del Vecchio T |title=Cultural diversity: do we need a new wake-up call for parent training? |journal=Behav Ther |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=443–58 |date=September 2013|pmid=23768671 |doi=10.1016/j.beth.2013.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other limitations of the existing research is that studies tend to focus on statistically significant rather than clinically significant change (for example, whether the child's daily functioning actually improves);&lt;ref name=Kazdin1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kazdin AE | year = 1997 | title = Parent management training: Evidence, outcomes, and issues | url = | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 36 | issue = 10| pages = 1349–56 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-199710000-00016 | pmid = 9334547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  there is no data on long-term sustainability of treatment effects;&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt; and little is known about the processes or mechanisms through which PMT improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=Kazdin2010/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Training programs other than PMT may be better indicated for "parents with significant psychopathology (such as anger management problems, ADHD, depression, substance abuse), limited cognitive capacity, or those
in highly conflicted marital/partner relationships", or those parents unlikely or unable to attend weekly sessions.&lt;ref name=Pfiffner2014/&gt;

==History==
Parent management training was developed in the early 1960s in response to an urgent need in American child guidance clinics. Research across a national network of these clinics revealed that the treatments being used for young children with disruptive behaviors, who constituted the majority of children served in these settings, were largely ineffective. Several child psychologists, including Robert Wahler, Constance Hanf, [[Martha E. Bernal]], and Gerald Patterson,&lt;ref name=Forehand2013/&gt; were inspired to develop new treatments based on behavioral principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[applied behavioral analysis]]. Between 1965 and 1975, a behavioral model of parent training treatment was established, that emphasized teaching parents to positively reinforce prosocial child behavior (such as praising a child for following directions) while negatively incentivizing antisocial behavior (such as removing parental attention after the child throws a tantrum).&lt;ref name=Forehand2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forehand R, Jones DJ, Parent J |title=Behavioral parenting interventions for child disruptive behaviors and anxiety: what's different and what's the same |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=133–45 |date= February 2013 |pmid=23178234 |pmc=3534895 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2012.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PMTO&gt;Forgatch MS, Patterson GR (2010). Parent management training — Oregon model: An intervention for antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. ''Evidence-based psychotherapies for children and adolescents (2nd ed.),'' 159–78. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169–170}} The early work of Hanf and Patterson hypothesized that "teaching parents the principles of behavioral reinforcement would result in effective, sustainable change in child behavior".&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt;  Early studies of this approach showed that the treatment was effective in the short-term in improving parenting skills and reducing children's disruptive behaviors.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;Forehand R, Kotchick BA, Shaffer A, McKee LG (2010). Parent management training. ''Corsini encyclopedia of psychology.'' Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0639/full&lt;/ref&gt; Patterson and colleagues theorized that adverse environmental contexts lead to disruptions in parent practices, which then contribute to negative child outcomes.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|161}}

Following the initial development of PMT, a second wave of research from 1975 to 1985 focused on the longer-term effects and generalization of treatment to settings other than the clinic (such as home or school), larger family effects (such as improved parenting with siblings), and behavioral improvements outside of the targeted areas (such as improved ability to make friends).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; Since 1985, the literature on PMT has continued to expand, with researchers exploring such topics as application of the treatment to serious clinical problems, dealing with client resistance to treatment, prevention programs, and implementation with diverse populations.&lt;ref name=PMTO/&gt;{{rp|170–174}}

Evidence in support of PMT has not always been rigorously examined;&lt;ref name=Furlong2013/&gt;  future research should examine the effectiveness of PMT on the families most at risk, address parental psychopathology as a factor in outcomes, examine whether gains from PMT are maintained in the long-term,&lt;ref name=Maliken2013/&gt; and better account for variability in outcomes dependent on practices under "real-world" conditions.&lt;ref name=Michelson2013/&gt;

A '''prodromus''' ('forerunner' or 'precursor') aka '''prodrome''' is a term used in the [[natural sciences]] to describe a preliminary publication intended as the basis for a later, more comprehensive work.

It is also a medical term used for a [[premonitory]] symptom, that is, a symptom indicating the onset of a disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers'' (2007, Saunders)&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word is from the 19th century: via French from New Latin prodromus, from Greek prodromos forerunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Dictionary|title=Collins Dictionary|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/prodrome|website=http://www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable prodromi were ''[[Prodromus Entomology]]'', ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis]]'' and [[Nicolas Steno]]'s ''De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus'', one of the early treatises attempting to explain the occurrence of fossils in solid rock.

'''Sideling Hill Tunnel''' is one of three original [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] [[tunnel]]s abandoned (this one in 1968) after two massive realignment projects.  The others are nearby [[Rays Hill Tunnel]], and farther west, the [[Laurel Hill Tunnel]].  It was less expensive to realign the Turnpike than to bore a second tube for four lane traffic. Sideling Hill Tunnel is {{convert|6782|ft|m}} long. It was the longest of the original tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The Ray's Hill Tunnel and  Sideling Hill Tunnel are now part of the Pike2Bike Trail. Together, the two tunnels as well as the roadway are commonly known as the [[Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike]].&lt;ref name="pahighways" /&gt;

From the Turnpike's opening in 1940 until the realignment projects, the tunnels were bottlenecks; opposing traffic in the same tubes reduced speeds.  Four other tunnels on the Turnpike – [[Allegheny Mountain Tunnel|Allegheny Mountain]], [[Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel|Tuscarora Mountain]], [[Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel|Kittatinny Mountain]], and [[Blue Mountain Tunnel|Blue Mountain]] – each had a second tube bored, the least expensive option.  All of the original tunnels except for the [[Allegheny Mountain Tunnel]] were part of "Vanderbilt's Folly", the never-completed [[South Pennsylvania Railroad]].

==History==

===Construction===
The Sideling Hill Tunnel's original plans date back to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885.&lt;ref name="book1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book3" /&gt; The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from [[Rhinebeck, New York]].&lt;ref name="obrien"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/12/10/109779761.pdf |title= The Aqueduct Bids |date= December 10, 1884 |work= The New York Times |page= 2 |accessdate= February 13, 2009 | format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred at the end of the Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast.&lt;ref name="obriendeath"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/07/07/103062591.pdf |title= Three Killed and Several Injured |date= July 7, 1885 |work= The New York Times |page= 5 |accessdate= February 13, 2009 | format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] worker, along with two [[African-Americans]], two [[Italians]], and one [[Irishman]]. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable.&lt;ref name="jul22explosion"&gt;{{cite news |title= Killed By Premature Blast |date= July 23, 1885 |work= The New York Times |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately [[William H. Vanderbilt]], who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission]] took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite book |last2= Binzen |first2= Peter |last1=Daughen |first1= Joseph R. |year= 1971 |title= The Wreck of the Penn Central |location= Boston |publisher= Little Brown |oclc= 208610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rainey |first1= Lee |first2=Frank |last2= Kyper |title= East Broad Top |origyear= 1982 |year= 1996 |publisher= [[Golden West Books]] |location=San Marino, California |isbn=0-87095-078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taber |first= Thomas T., III |year= 1987 |title= Railroads of Pennsylvania Encyclopedia and Atlas |publisher= Thomas T. Taber III |isbn=0-9603398-5-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission started construction on a new toll highway from [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]] to [[Irwin, Pennsylvania]] in 1938. When the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened on October 25, 1940, the Sideling Hill Tunnel was one of the seven original tunnels along the highway, six of which were built from the old railroad tunnels from the 1880s. The [[Allegheny Mountain Tunnel]] was constructed from scratch rather than from the tunnels because of structural concerns.&lt;ref name="book1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book3" /&gt; 
[[File:Sideling Hill Tunnel 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The eastern portal of the Sideling Hill Tunnel in 2009]]
&lt;section begin=LaurelHillTunnelBottleneck /&gt;
Beginning in 1951, the eastbound traffic at the [[Laurel Hill Tunnel]] would back up during the summer weekends. By 1958, the Laurel Hill experienced congestion anytime from June to November. Because of the long bottlenecks, the Commission started looking into ways to remove the congestion. There were studies that began in the mid-1950s to decide on what to do with the tunnels. The studies looked into the major tunnels, the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain, and the possibility of adding a second tube, or "[[Dual carriageway|twinning]]", to them. &lt;section end=LaurelHillTunnelBottleneck /&gt;

===Tunnel bypass actions===
&lt;section begin=tunnelactions /&gt;
Studies were completed for the remaining five mainline tunnels to determine the cost benefit of [[Dual carriageway|twinning]] of the tunnels, or complete bypass.&lt;ref name="pahighways"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pahighways.com/toll/PATurnpike.html |title= Pennsylvania Turnpike |last= Kitsko |first= Jeffrey J. |year= 2009 |work=Pennsylvania Highways |publisher= Self-published |accessdate= February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the studies completed, the decision was made to go ahead with a [[United States dollar|US $]]100 million {{#tag:ref|In 1962 the contract cost on average of $100 million.  This is equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1962|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}|group=lower-alpha|name="100m"}}{{Inflation-fn|US}} construction project to work with the tunnels. Construction began on September 6, 1962, with the first subproject being a bypass of the Laurel Hill Tunnel. On October 30, 1964, just two years after construction began, the Laurel Hill Bypass was completed and opened. The Laurel Hill Tunnel was permanently closed on that day. However, this was not the last bypass to occur for tunnels along the turnpike. Two years after the closing of the Laurel Hill, the Allegheny Mountain became the first tunnel to be twinned, and opened on August 25, 1966. With the twinning of the Blue Mountain, Kittatinny Mountain and Tuscarora Mountain tunnels under construction, the Commission turned its focus to the remaining two mainline tunnels, the Rays Hill Tunnel (the shortest tunnel) and the Sideling Hill Tunnel (the longest tunnel).&lt;ref name="pahighways" /&gt;
[[File:Cove Valley.jpg|thumb|right|The site of the former Cove Valley Travel Plaza. The Sideling Hill Tunnel is about a half mile to the west]]
An engineering report dating back to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels was the best way to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million{{#tag:ref|In 1966 the contract cost on average of $17.2 million. This is equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|17200000|1966|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}|group=lower-alpha|name="17.2m"}} for roadway and another $2.5 million{{#tag:ref|In 1966 the contract cost on average of $2.5 million. This is equivalent to ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2500000|1966|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}|group=lower-alpha|name="2.5m"}} for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million&lt;ref name="2.5m" group=lower-alpha /&gt; project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).&lt;ref name="pahighways" /&gt;

In 2001, the Turnpike Commission gave control of the {{convert|13.5|mi|km}} length of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels and other roadways to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy, who began work to convert the stretch into a bicycle trail. The trail is used by hundreds of bicycle riders, and studies occurred in 2004 and 2005 to figure how to best safely construct the trail. Because there is a lack of good lighting in the tunnels the conservancy wants to look into how to solve it. The system is called the Pike2Bike Trail and is planned to be an {{convert|18|mi|km}} mountain bicycle loop that serves access to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]]'s [[BicyclePA Route S]].&lt;ref name="pike2bike"&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.pike2bike.org/ |work=Pike2Bike |title= History |year= 2009 |publisher= Southern Alleghenies Conservancy |accessdate= February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;section end=tunnelactions /&gt;

'''steeluniversity''' is a collection of free-to-use [[E-learning]] resources and interactive simulations covering major aspects of iron and steelmaking. It provides the underlying scientific, metallurgical and engineering principles and environmental aspects of the production, use and recycling of steel. These internet-delivered resources are aimed at undergraduate students of metallurgy, materials science and engineering subjects as well as graduate employees in the steel industry supply chain.

==Objectives==
The basic objective of steeluniversity.org is to inform university students and their teachers about steel technologies and to attract young people to the global steel industry. Another major aim is to reduce the cost of in-service training at steel companies by providing them with freely available training and professional development material. In view of the decline in metallurgy-related courses in universities and the retirement of professors and steel industry experts, it aims to sustain knowledge of ferrous metallurgy by joint efforts of academia and the steel industry.

==Background==
A gradual decline in the number of students enrolling in science subjects such as physics and mathematics can be seen in many industrialized countries. This phenomenon has been indicated in several studies. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) Global Science Forum reports in a study that the relative share of science and technology graduates declined in 10 out of 16 member countries between 1993-2003.&lt;ref&gt;OECD Science Technology and Industry Outlook 2006, {{ISBN|978-92-64-02848-7}} pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Metallurgy is one of the most affected disciplines in this trend in terms of available courses, overall enrolments and the number of graduates. An important factor relating to this change in US universities is described as transformation in the late twentieth century of metallurgy departments into ‘material sciences’ departments.&lt;ref&gt;Trillo E.; Stafford S. W.; Murr L. E. (1998). ''Recruiting and retaining students in metallurgy and materials: One university's experience''. JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society. Vol. 50, No. 4. pp. 13-14. (Springer Boston). ISSN 1543-1851&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flemings M. C. (2001). ''Why materials science and engineering is good for metallurgy''. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A.  Vol. 32, No. 4. pp. 853-860 (Springer Boston). {{ISSN|1543-1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mechii M. (2006). ''Thoughts on the Occasion of the Second Transformation in Material Science''. Material Science Forum. Vol. 512. pp. 1-4 (Trans Tech Publications Switzerland). {{ISSN|0255-5476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern in other Western European countries e.g. in the UK &lt;ref&gt;Cottrell A. (1976), ''The Task for the Educator''. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A (Mathematical and Physical Sciences). Vol. 282. No. 1307. pp. 467-471.&lt;/ref&gt; is reported during the same time span. 
Steel industry, once an attractive career destination for metallurgy graduates is directly affected by these changes and now faces the challenge of replacing the retiring work force. The idea of preserving knowledge of metallurgy and attracting young people towards career in the steel industry was born out of this challenge.

==History==
In response to the declining skilled workforce in the steel industry, the [[International Iron and Steel Institute]] (IISI) took the initiative by creating a collection of web-based [[E-learning]] resources on metallurgy in a pilot project named Internet Learning of Steel Applications and Processes (ILSAP). Initially two introductory modules; Secondary Steelmaking and Steel for Automotive Applications were launched in partnership with the MATTER project at the [[University of Liverpool]] on 1 August 2002&lt;ref name="IISI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsteel.org/?action=newsdetail&amp;jaar=2002&amp;id=64|title=Make advanced steels online!|publisher=IISI Newsletter 1 August 2002|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the success of the pilot project, the [[IISI]] board of governors approved a budget of €2.5 million for development of an extensive set of [[E-learning]] resources and the project was renamed steeluniversity.org in October 2003.&lt;ref name="IISI-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsteel.org/?action=newsdetail&amp;jaar=2003&amp;id=80|title=IISI-37 / 07 / IISI Board of Directors approve € 2.5 million for Internet-based 'steel university' learning facility.|publisher=IISI Newsletter 6 October 2003|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel applications===
The modules in this section address the selection of steels for different steel markets – such as automotive, construction, engineering and offshore applications. Acting as the materials advisor in a multidisciplinary team, the user aims to select suitable steel in order to satisfy design specifications for a particular application. The major engineering design equations are studied during this process in order to select and compare the performance of steel and other metals and materials.  
[[File:Process Overview-steeluniversity.JPG|thumb|right|4-D Process Overview of a Steel Plant]]
[[File:EAF-steeluniversity.JPG|thumb|right|EAF Steelmaking simulation]]
[[File:Secondary steelmaking steeluniversity.JPG|thumb|right|Secondary Steelmaking simulation]]

===Steel processing===
This section contains a series of interactive simulations of major steelmaking processes from raw materials, [[Basic oxygen steelmaking]] (BOS) and [[Electric arc furnace]] (EAF) steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, [[Continuous casting]] and [[Hot rolling]]. Different steel grades can be processed using two levels of operation which are suitable for students and graduates in the industry. The ‘student level’ provides a basic functionality enabling the user to understand and control the process principles without too many operational complications, whereas the ‘industry level’ has advanced functionality and the user needs to deal with practical disturbances that are not anticipated in advance. Real-time feedback is given on the composition and quality of the steel, on process time and temperature and incurred costs, to allow the process to be optimized. A user guide and more conventional supporting e-learning units are also available within each module to enable the learner to better understand the reactions. For example, in the secondary steelmaking module, there are sections on deoxidation, desulphurization, [[decarburization]] and [[dehydrogenation]].

===Ferrous metallurgy===
The section on ferrous metallurgy contains modules on [[thermodynamics]] and kinetics, including strengthening mechanisms, [[phase transformation]], recrystallisation and grain growth, [[heat treatment]] and steel properties. An introduction is provided on steel specifications, with exercises to ensure that they can be accurately interpreted. The learner can check mechanical properties of a given grade of steel by conducting virtual tensile, [[Charpy impact]] and hardness tests as well.

===Sustainability===
This section introduces the environmental aspects of steelmaking, usage and recycling processes. The learner gets a basic idea of Life Cycle Thinking and the method of [[Life Cycle Assessment]] (LCA), and its practical application. In addition selected LCA scenarios facing the steel industry and its customers in the automotive and construction sectors can be explored.

==Available languages==
The e-learning modules were initially only available in English. Currently, several modules can be found in different languages such as Spanish, Chinese (traditional &amp; simplified), Korean, Russian and German. The process of translation is not yet complete and a number of modules are in various stages of proof reading.

==steelChallenge==
The ''[[steelChallenge]]'' is an annual competition organized by steeluniversity.org for students and steel industry employees. Using one or more of the steelmaking simulations on the steeluniversity.org website, the entrants are to produce a particular steel grade at the lowest cost. The competition runs for a 24-hour period during which multiple attempts are allowed. Awards are given for the best, one for the best industry entry and the other for the best university entry. Other local prizes sponsored by steel companies are also presented at the event.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/172987368.html|title=Steelmaking challenge enables simulating production online|publisher=Advanced Materials &amp; Processes:EMERGING TECHNOLOGY, Entrepreneur.com; Dec 2007|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tes''''', formerly known as the '''''Times Educational Supplement''''', is a weekly [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[publication]] aimed primarily at school teachers in the UK. It was first published in 1910 as a pull-out supplement in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper. Such was its popularity that in 1914, the supplement became a separate publication selling for one penny.

''TES'' focuses on school-related news and features. It covered higher education until the '''''Times Higher Education Supplement''''' (now ''[[Times Higher Education]]'') was launched as a sister publication in 1971. Today its editor is [[Ann Mroz]]. Since 1964, an alternative version of the publication, '''''TESS''''', has been produced for Scotland.&lt;ref name="TES centenary special"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6057671|title=TES centenary special|work=TES website}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edition for Wales, '''''TES Cymru''''', was also published between 2004 and 2011.&lt;ref name="TES centenary special" /&gt; All are produced by London-based company TES Global, which has been owned by [[United States|US]] investment firm [[TPG Capital]] LLP since 2013. The ''TES'' no longer has a connection with ''The Times'' newspaper. 

''TES'' is published weekly on Fridays, at a cover price of [[Pound sterling|£]]2.90. Data from the National Readership Survey Jan–Dec 2012 suggested that the average yearly readership was around 362,000, of which around 90 per cent of the readership were in the [[NRS social grade|ABC1 category]].

The publication has developed a popular website featuring teaching jobs, forums, and classroom resources that are uploaded by teachers.&lt;ref name="tes connect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.com/|title=TES|work=TES website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea for a regular section on education in ''The Times'' was first proposed in 1905 by J E G de Montmorency, a [[barrister]] and [[writer]] who later composed leader articles for ''The TES''. The first issue of the monthly educational supplement appeared on 6 September 1910, opening with a witty weather forecast for the UK’s school systems. [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] had recently begun his reign, and the paper noted that “some great resettlement of the English school system seems likely to take place”.

Over its first decade, ''The TES'' established itself as a paper for teachers, though it was primarily aimed at those in [[Private school|private]] and [[grammar school]]s. However, it pressed for [[education reform]] from its early years, calling in 1913 for “Secondary Education for All”.

In 1914, ''The TES'' became a stand-alone publication, noting on the outbreak of the [[First World War]] that “every great war in the modern world has been followed by changes in education”. Two years afterwards, while the war still raged, the paper began to be published weekly. ''The TES'' later explained that “the decision to change into a weekly periodical was taken in order to lend the support of ''The Times'' more effectively to the movement for reform in education which culminated in the [[Education Act 1918|Fisher Reform Act of 1918]]”.

Notable editors of ''The TES'' included George Sydney Freeman, who was editor for its first 28 years and Harold Dent, a progressive former schoolteacher who became acting editor in 1940. He put the newspaper together practically single-handedly during [[the Blitz]]. His editorials pressed for “total reform” of the education system, “based on a new conception of the place, status and function of education in a democratic State, not a patching and padding of the present system”. This attitude chimed with the radical thinking then going on within the Board of Education. Mr. Dent had regular meetings with its president, [[Rab Butler]], in the years building up to the [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education Act]].

The readership of ''The TES'', once primarily private and grammar school teachers, broadened during the 20th century.  During the 1970s, the paper became more supportive of [[Comprehensive school]]s, when it had once defended grammars.

In the 1980s, it became increasingly concerned that political reforms might overload or restrict teachers, particularly the launch of the national curriculum and league tables with the [[Education Reform Act 1988]]. Its then editor, Stuart Maclure, noted in 1985 that “the irony of the last 10 years, in which the politicians and industrialists have clamoured for reform and accused the educationists of blocking it, was not lost on anyone who cares to look back”.

When the newspaper reached its [[century|centenar]]y in 2010, its former editor Gerard Kelly, wrote: “If there is one phenomenal, outstanding, amazing development of the past century in this country, it has to be that education has liberated women in a way that was never anticipated by the most liberal of reformers, even by those far-sighted individuals on ''The TES'' in 1910”.&lt;ref name="TES centenary special" /&gt;

==Ownership==
At its start, ''TES'' was owned, like its parent paper, by [[Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]]. After his death in 1922, the newspapers were sold to the [[Astor family]], and it was sold on again in 1966 to the [[Canada|Canadian]] newspaper [[Business magnate|tycoon]] [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/article.aspx?storycode=6057671|title=TES centenary special|last=|first=|date=17 September 2010|website=TES|publisher=|access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=May 2014}}

[[Rupert Murdoch]] took ownership of the newspaper in 1979. Murdoch’s [[News International]] restructured its newspapers to set up 'Times Supplements Limited' and by 1999, this became 'TSL Education Ltd', which also published ''THE'' and ''[[Nursery World]]''.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In October 2005, the group was sold to Exponent, a private equity group,{{cn|date=May 2014}} who in turn sold it to Charterhouse in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.tesglobal.com/content/tsl-announces-it-has-been-acquired-charterhouse|title=TSL announces that it has been acquired by Charterhouse |date=14 May 2007|publisher=TES Global |access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TES'' online is run by the London-based 'TES Global', which claims to be "The largest network of teachers in the world", and has been owned by the US-based [[TPG Capital]] (formerly Texas Pacific Group) global investment company since July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.tesglobal.com/content/tsl-education-announces-acquisition-tpg|title= TSL Education Announces Acquisition by TPG|date=18 July 2013|publisher=TES Global|accessdate=26 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/08/us-tpg-tsleducation-idUSBRE9670MT20130708| title= U.S. buyout firm TPG to buy TSL Education for $600 million | author= Sebastian Sadr-Salek, Anjuli Davies and Claire Ruckin | publisher=Reuters | date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
TES first established a website in 1997, when it briefly experimented with a [[paywall]].&lt;ref name="BBC news Magazine"&gt;{{cite news | title = The first wave of internet pay walls |first=Sean |last=Coughlan | work = BBC News Magazine| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8720282.stm | date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revamped after the newspaper’s relaunch in 2007 and is now split into distinct sections, including 'Community', 'Jobs', 'Resources' and 'School News'. ''Community'' offers online forums where trainees, teachers and other education professionals can connect with like-minded people, discuss best practice, gain peer to peer advice and support, and have their say on the issues that matter to them. ''Jobs'' is home to all the vacancies listed in the ''TES'' magazine and is updated daily.

The ''Resources'' section is a platform for teachers to share original classroom resources, including lesson plans, [[PowerPoint]] presentations, interactive whiteboard resources, worksheets, and activities. As of the 21 March 2016, more than 1.5 million pieces of content have been uploaded by teachers.

In February 2015, TES Global launched an open marketplace, which allowed teachers to buy and sell teaching resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.tesglobal.com/content/tes-launches-new-resources-marketplace-fast-growing-global-teaching-community |title=TES Launches New Resources Marketplace for Fast Growing Global Teaching Community |date=25 February 2015 |publisher=TES Global |access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Non-Violence Project Foundation''' (NVP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonviolence.com/about#thefoundation |title=The Global Foundation on |publisher=Nonviolence.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-profit organisation]] whose mission is to inspire, motivate and engage young people on how to solve conflicts peacefully. It holds violence prevention and [[nonviolence]] education programs for schools and sports clubs around the world.

NVP, which was registered in 1993 in [[Bagnes, Switzerland]], and has offices in 15 countries around the world.  Its logo is the iconic Knotted Gun sculpture named ''[[Non-Violence (sculpture)|Non-Violence]]''.

NVP has educated eight million students, teachers, and sports coaches with programs covering three main subjects: conflict management, self-esteem building, and nonviolence.

[[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Yoko Ono]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iobffp.com/ |title=Yoko Ono greetings for NVP |publisher=Iobffp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; are, among others, ambassadors of the Non-Violence Project.

==The symbol==

NVP's signature logo is the [[Non-Violence (sculpture)|Non-Violence]] also known as the Knotted Gun. It has been created by the Swedish artist, [[Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd]] as a memorial tribute to [[John Lennon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iobffp.com/en/NonViolence/Symbol/ |title=The Non-Violence Symbol, a tribute to John Lennon }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he was shot and killed on December 8, 1980, in [[New York City]]. One of the 3 original bronze sculptures is displayed at the [[United Nations headquarters]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork-un.mae.lu/en/Non-Violence-The-Knotted-Gun |title=The Non-Violence Symbol outside of the United Nations in New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City. The Knotted Gun has become a worldwide symbol of the non-violence movement. Several replicas of this sculpture can be found around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assistedthinking.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/non-violence-and-the-knotted-gun-worldwide/ |title=The Non-Violence Symbol around the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Olympic Museum]] in Lausanne, at [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]] in Cape Town and in the [[Chaoyang Park]] in Beijing, China.

==History==

===Establishment===
NVP was born with the idea to use the [[Non Violence|Non-Violence]] to inspire, motivate and engage the young community in positive action and give them the tools and skills to solve conflicts peacefully. In 1993, Jan Hellman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.divinecaroline.com/33/33362-point-nonprofit-helps-youth-find |title=Interview of Jan Hellman, co-founder of NVP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rolf Skjöldebrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr0CdeeHWXA |title=Interview of Rolf Skjöldebrand, co-founder of NVP}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the Non-Violence Project. The best way to achieve the Non-Violence mission was to convince schools and sports clubs to include violence prevention and life skills programs into their basic education schedule.
NVP's concept was first piloted in Sweden with great success. NVP invited the business community to partner in their endeavor and toured roughly 100 cities, spreading the non-violence message. A year later NVP had reached 100 000 students and initiated 300 local projects in Sweden. In 1995, a crowd of people gathered at the Sergel's Square in central Stockholm lighting candles in the shape of the Knotted Gun &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZynBs-pF1c. |title=NVP event, crowd lighting candles in the shape of the Knotted Gun }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several celebrities participated at the event like model [[Emma Wiklund]], singer [[Siw Malmkvist]], [[Lill-Babs]] and the actress [[Lena Olin]]. The television host [[Kristin Kaspersen]] organized the event.

===Worldwide development===
[[File:NVP Uganda.jpg|thumb|Schools for Peace, NVP Uganda, 2011]]

During the years,  NVP has increased its international activities from 10 to 31 countries on five continents around the world including the USA, the UK, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, China, Pakistan, Mexico, Sweden, Uganda, Peru, Guatemala, Tanzania, the Bahamas, Liberia, Kenya, Italy and nov 2017 India opened an office. The headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.

In 2008, the first Knot Violence Campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvCnUl80eoo |title=BBC about NVP  with David James}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in Portsmouth, United Kingdom with the support of the England football goalkeeper, [[David James (footballer)|David James]] and the presence of local pupils. The campaign helped to introduce the Non-Violence Creativity Program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonviolence.com/library |title=The Creativity Box}}&lt;/ref&gt; into local schools. The initiative was an arts-based education program whose main tool was the Non-Violence Box. The box includes a violence prevention module as well as a one-meter fiberglass replica of the Knotted Gun.  Students, teachers and sports coaches are challenged to give their interpretation of the symbol and of what it communicates. David James has worked closely with pupils from City of Portsmouth Boys' School &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prlog.org/10148834-portsmouths-david-james-launches-clubs-support-for-non-violence-campaign-in-schools.html |title=The Knot Violence Campaign with local pupils in Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help them paint their own knotted gun sculptures. He also did his own interpretation which is displayed outside the [[Fratton Park]] stadium in Portsmouth.
During the 2010 [[FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa, under the campaign theme "Futbol For Peace" and in close cooperation with the [[Western Cape]] and [[Gauteng]] Education Departments, NVP engaged several prominent football players such as the Italian goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]], German captain [[Michael Ballack]], [[Wilson Palacios]] from Honduras, [[Alex Song]] from Cameroon, [[Aaron Mokoena]] from South Africa and football legend [[Gus Poyet]] to paint and interpret the Non-Violence symbol. This became an exhibition at the Waterfront in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://10and5.com/2010/06/28/futbol-for-peace-campaign/ |title=The Non-Violence Tour, FIFA Worldcup, Cape Town, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painted sculptures communicated a global vision of peace and non-violence and created awareness of the education programs which took place at several youth hubs and schools in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The campaign included daily football tournaments, violence prevention education, life skills training and a "Train the Trainer" program to secure continuity after the World Cup. In 2011, Italian goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] donates his self-designed Non-Violence sculpture to former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] on [[Mandela Day]], July 18,  in recognition of his lifelong work to bring peace and non-violence in South Africa and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iobffp.com/news-buffonmandela |title=Mandela Day, Gianluigi Buffon donates his Non-Violence sculpture to Nelson Mandela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education initiatives==
NVP has educated and trained more than eight million students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxxi.com/non-violence-project-peaceful-world/|title=Interview of NVP-USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; teachers and sports coaches around the world. The NVP programs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonviolence.com/education#insports |title=NVP Education programs for schools and sports clubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide tools for schools and sports clubs to get started. The programs which cover three main subjects - conflict management, self-esteem building, and violence prevention - are constructed to inspire, motivate and engage teachers and students to increase their knowledge of how violence emerges, why conflicts escalate, the importance of a strong self-esteem, and the nonviolent keys to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. The same approach is used to address the sports community. NVP focus on issues of non-violence, peace, youth participation, interactive exercises, life skills and community development.

The Train the Trainer Program works with teachers and sports coaches. The program attempts to give future trainers the competence and tools to implement the Non-Violence Project education model into their respective schools and sports clubs.

A pilot program has been done at the [[University of St Andrews]], in Scotland and at the UNAM ([[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]]), in Mexico. The project NVP St Andrews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standrewsradio.com/news/1337/st-andrews-non-violence-project-launch |title= Launch of NVP St Andrews in presence of Dustin Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched on October 3, 2012 at the University of St Andrews in presence of the golfer [[Dustin Johnson]]. University of Tsukuba, in Japan started official education in 2018. The project equips university students with the tools to go out into their local communities and inspire conflict resolution and promote non-violence in schools and on playing fields.

==Imagine One Billion Faces For Peace (IOBFFP)==
The Non-Violence Project launched a call for peace and non-violence online to honor the legacy of John Lennon and to strengthen the outreach of NVP education programs.

==The Non-Violence Tour==
The Tour, featuring fiberglass Non-Violence sculptures interpreted and painted by children from throughout the world and by internationally renowned role models within sports, music and art, are displayed in cities around the world. The Tour promotes the presence of the Non-Violence Symbol and secures local distribution of the NVP education programs to schools and sports clubs. The former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated;

"The Non-Violence Symbol has not only endowed the United Nations with a cherished work of art; it has enriched the consciousness of humanity with a powerful symbol. It is a symbol that encapsulates, in a few simple curves, the greatest prayer of man: that which asks not for victory, but for peace".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">In [[developmental psychology]], '''thematic coherence''' is an organization of a set of meanings in and through an event.&lt;ref name=bloome&gt;{{cite|last=Bloome|title=Discourse analysis &amp; the study of classroom language &amp; literacy events: a microethnographic perspective|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|page=33|isbn=978-0-8058-5320-9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[education]], for example, the thematic coherence happens when a child during a classroom session understands what all the talking is about.&lt;ref name=bloome/&gt;

This expression was termed by Habermas and Bluck (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Habermas|first1=T|last2=Bluck|first2=2|year=2000|title=Getting a life: The development of the life story in adolescence|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|pages=748-769}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other terms such as ''temporal coherence'', ''biographical coherence'', and ''causal coherence'', to describe the coherence that people talk about while narrating their own personal experiences (the many different episodes in their life, most especially in childhood and adolescence) which need to be structured within a [[Context principle|context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first1=Robyn|last1=Fivush|first2=Catherine A|last2=Haden|title=Autobiographical memory and the construction of a narrative self: developmental and cultural perspectives|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|page=192|isbn=978-0-8058-3756-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[conversation]] — although this technique also can be found in literature — the thematic coherence is when a person (or character) "is able to derive a general theme or principle about the self based on a narrated sequence of events."&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite|first=Dan P|last=McAdams|title=The redemptive self: stories Americans live|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-19-517693-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Van Leer Jerusalem Institute''' (VLJI) is a center for the interdisciplinary study and discussion of issues related to philosophy, society, culture, and education. The Institute was established in order to create a body of knowledge and discourse which gives expression to the wide range of disciplines and opinions in Israel. The contribution of a core of renowned scholars facilitates the implementation of reforms and new approaches in various social spheres.

The Institute is located in Jerusalem's [[Talbiya]] neighborhood, next door to the official residence of the [[President of Israel]]. Its campus also houses the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] and the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel|Council for Higher Education]].

According to Daniel Gutwein it used to popularize [[post-Zionist]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Left and right post‐Zionism and the privatization of Israeli collective memory Left and right post‐Zionism and the privatization of Israeli collective memory | author=Daniel Gutwein | doi=10.1080/13531040108576157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Van Leer Institute was established in 1959 by the [[Lia Van Leer|Van Leer]] family of the [[Netherlands]]. The stated goals of the institute are to "advance knowledge in the realms of philosophy, society, and culture", to enhance ethnic and cultural understanding, ease social tensions and promote democratic values through academic research, public policy analysis, advocacy and civil society projects. The institute organizes domestic and international conferences, symposia and workshops, and publishes books and periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanleer.org.il/heb/content.asp?id=6 About the Van Leer Institute], Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Leer organizes domestic and international conferences, symposia and workshops, publishes periodicals, books and monographs, and promotes pluralistic public dialogue. It houses a 27,000-volume library devoted to philosophy, philosophy of science, historical sociology and political theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanleer.org.il/eng/content.asp?id=27 Van Leer website]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105062118/http://www.vanleer.org.il/eng/content.asp?id=27 |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ofira Seliktar, a scholar specializing in anti-Israeli activities of Israeli scholars, it was used to give a measure of respectability to Post-Zionist scholars.&lt;ref name="Radicals" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The Institute is active in four main areas: Advanced Studies, Jewish Culture and Thinking, Israeli Civil Society, and Mediterranean Neighbours. A variety of methods and approaches are employed in each of these areas with projects, discussion groups, and collaborations with academic institutions, civil society organizations, and government bodies. Activities include conducting studies of public policy and applied social research, developing and running educational programs as well as training programs for educators and community leaders, hosting cultural activities for the general public, and publishing books, anthologies, and journals. The Institute cooperates with a large number of Israeli and international research institutions and conducts joint projects with visiting scholars from around the world. The campus houses two libraries and a variety of different sized halls which host conferences and events.

=== Advanced Studies ===
The Advanced Studies Unit is headed by Dr. Yochi Fischer and is committed to multidisciplinary and comparative research in the fields of humanities and social sciences.

Activities include research groups, workshops, international conferences, and a summer seminar with participants comprising senior scholars in Israel, their international colleagues, and young scholars and intellectuals.

The unit focuses on issues of religion, secularism, and democracy; equality, pluralism, and racism; the state of higher education, especially in the humanities; and issues of history, memory, and reconciliation from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective.

=== The Polonsky Academy for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences ===
The Polonsky Academy, spearheaded by Dr. [[Leonard Polonsky]] and inaugurated in 2014, is an international center for humanities and social sciences that supports young international and Israeli scholars. The Polonsky Program provides these scholars with facilities and full financial support for up to five years to enable them to further their research and better prepare them for their future academic careers.

=== Mediterranean Neighbours ===
VLJI has established the academic discipline of Mediterranean studies which focuses on the study of cultures and societies of countries in the region. This decision was based, inter alia, on the 1995 Barcelona Declaration and on the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which redefined the idea of the Mediterranean and cooperation in the Mediterranean basin as an economic, political, and cultural plan of action.

The Mediterranean Neighbours Unit, is headed by Dr. Abigail Jacobson. It was established to promote the study of the region, to influence the way in which the region is portrayed and understood, and to encourage understanding and dialogue between Israelis and their neighbours. Israeli and Palestinian scholars lead pioneering studies and cross-border projects including academic discussion groups, workshops, conferences, and publications.

Specific areas of activity include research, the Journal of Levantine Studies, regional dialogue, and involvement in the Anna Lindh Foundation.

=== Manarat: The Van Leer Center for Jewish-Arab Relations ===
The Manarat Center, headed by Dr. Yonatan Mendel, was established in 2015 to highlight a variety of issues, including the status and rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, the ramifications of the protracted Israeli-Arab conflict for both Jewish and Arab societies, and Israel’s place in the Middle East. The center is involved in research and discourse regarding the challenges facing Israeli and Palestinian society in an attempt to discover the methods and principles likely to promote understanding, a shared life, mutual respect, reconciliation, justice, and peace. The Manarat Center, aims to promote partnerships between Jewish and Arab organizations.

=== Jewish Culture and Thinking ===
VLJI's Jewish Culture and Thinking Program is headed by Prof. Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin and promotes interdisciplinary research and public events concerning Jewish culture and thought in Israel and the Diaspora. The programs focus on the identity of communities, the streams and phenomena of contemporary Judaism, Judaism and democracy, and expressions of Jewish culture, thought, and creativity. The Jewish Culture and Thinking Program is a home for both established and young scholars in the humanities and social sciences, as well as thinkers, rabbis, and educators from Israel and abroad.

=== Israeli Civil Society ===
The Israeli Civil Society Unit, headed by Prof. Moshe Justman, focuses on creating a body of knowledge on citizenship and civic policy to be incorporated in public discourse and used by decision-makers. Projects — including research groups, discussion groups, round-tables on key current issues relating to social change, local and international conferences, and public symposiums — are thematically clustered around the basic issues of citizenship, social justice, relations between the state and civil society, Arab society in Israel, gender, economics, and education.
