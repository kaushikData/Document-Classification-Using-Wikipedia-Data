'''Alec Donald Ross OAM''' (6 April 1936 - 30 March 2017) was an Australian tour guide, member of the [[stolen generation]] and custodian of the story of the [[Alice Springs Telegraph Station]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].

==Early life==

Ross was born on 6 April 1936 at Mosquito Creek near [[Barrow Creek]] at [[Neutral Junction Station]] the son of the Scottish cattle station owner.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memories of the Alice Telegraph Station, Northern Territory, Australia|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjrEWmV5yc|website=Youtube|publisher=Northern Territory, Australia’s Outback|accessdate=24 May 2017|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross is the great-grandson of explorer [[John Ross (explorer)|John Ross]], who came to Central Australia as part of the surveying teams for the [[Overland Telegraph Line]], its most famous repeater station, the place where his great-grandson Alec later worked for a large part of his life. He fell seriously ill at the age of three and was taken from his mother to [[The Bungalow]], a institution for part-Aboriginal children based near the telegraph station in [[Alice Springs]]. He lived there for most of his childhood, attending school.&lt;ref name="Icons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Shirley|title=Icons of the Territory: twenty-two characters of outback Australia|date=2006|publisher=Shirley Brown|location=Alice Springs, NT.|isbn=0646461311}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ross was moved to [[Croker Island]] in 1941. When the Japanese started bombing northern Australia in 1942, he and the other children, walked from Barklay Bay on the Arnhem Land coast right to [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] through the bush. From there he was transferred to Alice Springs where he took the train to Adelaide and on to Sydney. He was then returned to Croker Island after the war, but when he was old enough returned to Sydney. He was eventually reunited with his mother, just two years before she died. Of the meeting he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The truth is that I only felt sad for my mother. There was no bond of any type there because we just didn't know each other.''

==Working life==

Ross married in 1994, and although separated, remained good friends with his wife.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

Ross worked as a tour guide at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station. He retired in 2004 but returned for special events.&lt;ref name="Icons" /&gt; He then worked as a house parent at Wangkana Kari Aboriginal Hostel in [[Tennant Creek]].&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Ross was awarded an Order of Australia in 2013. He is the subject of a book, ''Alec, A Living History of the Alice Springs Telegraph Station'' by [[Shirley Brown (Australian author)|Shirley Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grimm|first1=Dorothy|title=HISTORIAN PUTS INTO PRINT TALES 'BUNGALOW' GUIDE|url=http://www.territorystories.nt.gov.au/bitstream/10070/231955/1/asn_v10_issue25_2003.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2017|agency=Alice Springs News|publisher=Territory Stories, Northern Territory Library|date=23 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annette  Lemieux''' (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists ([[David Salle]], [[Jack Goldstein]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Richard Prince]]). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological [[minimalism]].  Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.
Lemieux has been the recipient of awards from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Monserrat College]] of Art.  Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at [[Harvard University]] in the area of visual and environmental studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/07/annette-lemieux-html|title=Annette Lemieux|date=1 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in [[New York City|New York]].

==Early life==

Annette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Annette|title=The Strange Life of Objects|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, she received her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7002021784|title=Lemieux, Annette – Grove Art|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

In early works like ''[[It’s a Wonderful Life]]'', 1986 [named after the 1946 [[Frank Capra]] film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;  Following the legacies of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[John Cage]], she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”.  Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amalfitano|first1=Lelia|last2=Hoos Fox|first2=Judith|title=The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand.  As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Annette, Lelia Amalfitano, Judith H. Fox, Rosetta Brooks, Peggy Phelan, Robert Pincus-Witten, and Lucy Flint-Gohlke. The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux. Champaign, Ill: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/index.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions – Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective "The Strange Life of Objects," Elizabeth Michelman explains that, "[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=32&amp;a=2|title=Elizabeth Michelman. "The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux." artscope New England.|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her recent show entitled ''Unfinished Business'' at the [[Carpenter Center]], Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades.  Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.
With representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the [[Krannert Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/checklist.cfm.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions - Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvard University.

The '''Ayarmaca''' are an [[ethnic group]] located northwest of [[Cuzco]] in the area of modern [[Maras, Peru|Maras]]. The Ayarmaca were subjugated by the [[Inca]] during their earliest period of state expansion, ca. AD 1300.  After losing their power under Inca rule, the Ayarmaca people were resettled in various communities in the Cuzco region.

'''Bachelor's Degree Examination for Self-Education'''('''BDES''', {{lang-ko|독학학위제}}) makes it possible to obtain a [[bachelor's degree]] without attending a regular [[college]] or [[university]] by passing the [[Test (assessment)|examination]] administered by the [[government]].

The [[Constitution]] of the [[Republic of Korea]] states the government should promote [[lifelong education]]. To actualize this, "the Law of Bachelor’s Degree Examination for Self-Education" was established on 7 April 1990.

*psychology
*information &amp; communications engineering
*Childhood Education (Only 3rd and final exam)
*Nursing (Only final exam)
*Chinese Language &amp; Literature (Closed)
*Mathematics (Closed)
*Agriculture (Closed)

Three major fields(Chinese Language &amp; Literature, Mathematics, and Agriculture) were closed because of the decrease in the number of applicants. But, those who already passed more than a course in the three major fields are still allowed to apply for their further examinations.

Childhood education is established only in the 3rd and the final examination and Nursing is established only in the final examination because it needs [[practicum]].

==Process==

There are 4 exams for obtaining a bachelor's degree. Applying each exam needs [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]. For example, a person who is eligible for applying 2nd exam don't need to pass 1st exam.

*1st exam: Qualifying Examination for Liberal Arts
*2nd exam: Qualifying Examination for Major-Basic
*3rd exam: Qualifying Examination for Major-Advanced
*Final exam: Comprehensive Examination

Each exam is once in a year. So it takes a year at least to obtain a bachelor's degree.

{{Life in Egypt}}
'''Baladi''' ({{lang-ar|بلدي}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|baladī}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:3px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|relative]]-adjective "of town", "local", "rural", comparable to English "[[:wikt:folk#Adjective|folk]]", with a lower-class connotation) can refer to an Egyptian musical style, the folk style of [[Egypt]]ian [[bellydance]] (Raqs Baladi), or the Masmoudi Sogheir rhythm, which is frequently used in baladi music. It is also sometimes spelled in English as 'beledi' or 'baladee'.

In [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://bellydanceu.net/styles/bellydance-styles-egyptian-baladi|title=Egyptian Baladi}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term baladi does not only apply to local music and dance, and can also apply to many other things that are considered native, rural, rustic or traditional, for example '[[Egyptian cuisine#Bread|baladi bread]]' or 'Aish Baladi".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.karenskitchenstories.com/2017/06/aish-baladi-egyptian-flatbread.html|title=Aish Baladi - Egyptian Flatbread, EatLikeAnEgyptian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also applied to kinds of food and mostly to fruits and vegetables coming from rural villages.

==Baladi music and dance==

''Baladi'' means “of the country” and is a style of Egyptian folk dance from the early 20th century which is still very popular. Thus, ‘Egyptian Beledi’ means ‘of the country of Egypt’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantabellydance.com/Overview/EgyptianFolkloric.html|title=Overview of Belly Dance: Egyptian Folkloric style belly dancing|website=www.atlantabellydance.com|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came about when farmers moved to the city and began dancing in small spaces. Egyptians have Baladi people, Baladi bread, Baladi rhythms, Baladi music and Baladi dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bellydanceu.net/styles/bellydance-styles-egyptian-baladi/|title=Learn Bellydance Styles: Egyptian Baladi - Bellydance U|date=2015-08-01|work=Bellydance U|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shira.net/baladi.htm|title="Baladi" by Hossam Ramzy|last=Elliot|first=Shira Julie|date=|website=www.shira.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baladi can take the form of traditional songs, often with a verse-chorus structure - some popular examples include 'That il Shibbak' and 'Hassan ya Koulli'. There is also an improvised musical form in the baladi style.

===Baladi Improvisation===

This is a structured form of musical improvisation, most usually between a [[Goblet drum|tabla]] player and an accordionist or saxophonist (although occasionally the [[ney]] may be the primary instrument). It is sometimes referred to as a baladi [[taqsim]], ashra baladi, or a baladi progression.

A baladi taqsim consists of a number of distinct sections. Each section has a traditional structure, and the ordering of the sections follows a loose pattern, although this is not always followed. The musicians will not generally include all of the possible sections, but will choose some of them to build a structure for the piece.

Most baladi improvisations will begin with an instrumental solo ([[taqsim]]) by the primary instrument. Following this, there is usually a call and response between the instrument and the drummer, flowing into a slow rhythmic section. Further call and response sections and quicker rhythmic sections may follow. The middle part of the piece may include melodies from popular songs, or a section in the [[Saidi]] style. The final section is normally the 'tet', which has a quick tempo, and staccato accents on the off-beat.

===Raqs baladi===
Raqs baladi is the folk/social form of [[bellydance]]. It is more stationary than [[Raqs Sharqi|raqs sharqi]], with little use of the arms, and the focus is on hip movements. Baladi dance has a 'heavy' feeling, with the dancer appearing relaxed and strongly connected to the ground. It is performed to baladi or folk music.

Typical costuming for performances of this dance style is a long dress covering the midriff, which may be plain and traditional, or heavily embellished. Traditionally, a baladi dress would resemble a theatrical version of traditional Egyptian clothing. The most common version has a straight skirt with side slits, long sleeves which may be slit to the elbows, and a scooped or shirt-style neckline. Striped fabrics or [[Tulle bi telli|tulle bi-telli]] are popular. A sash may be worn around the hips, and a headscarf is often also worn. A baladi-style performance may include the use of [[Sagat (musical instrument)|sagat]], or the dancer may perform with a cane (assaya).

[[Fifi Abdou]], one of the legends of 20th-century Egyptian bellydance, is often described as a baladi-style dancer.

==='Baladi' rhythm===
In the West, the Masmoudi Sogheir ('small Masmoudi') rhythm in Arabic music is often referred to as 'baladi', because it is commonly used in baladi music. This is somewhat misleading, as there are several other rhythms commonly found in the baladi style (including [[Maqsoum]], Saiidi and Fellahi), and this rhythm is also found in other musical styles.

The basic structure of this rhythm, played on the [[darbuka]], is as follows:

 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
 D-D---T-D---T--

Capitals represent stressed beats. Dum (D) is the dominant hand on the middle of the drum, Tek (T) either the dominant or the non-dominant hand on the rim of the drum. Ka (k) is usually the non-dominant hand on the rim of the drum.

The drummer has freedom to “fill” in between these stressed beats as he/she sees fit to interpret the music. A common fill is:

 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
 D D tkT D tkT	
 D D tkT D tkT tk

Here, the second version has a "bridge" to lead it into the next bar.

==Baladi fruits and vegetables==
In some [[middle east]]ern countries, in the markets, some fruits and vegetables are sold and announced as "baladi" products, i.e. native, natural, fresh, un-cultivated and un-engineered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">'''Bouffon''' (English originally from French: "farceur", "comique", "Donovan", "[[jester]]") is a modern French theater term that was re-coined in the early 1960s by [[Jacques Lecoq]] at his [[L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq]] in [[Paris]] to describe a specific style of performance work that has a main focus in the art of mockery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Clowning with the audience|first=Lavanya|last=Ramanathan|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/05/AR2011010505738.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word gave rise to the English word '''[[buffoon]]'''.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Etymology and early history==
The word bouffon comes from a [[Latin verb]]: {{lang-la|buffare}}, to puff (i.e., to fill the cheeks with air); the word "Buffo" was used in the [[Theatre of ancient Rome]] by those who appeared on the stage with their cheeks blown up; when they received blows that they would make a great noise causing the audience to laugh.&lt;ref&gt;p.780 ''Encyclopædia Britannica; or A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature, Volume 4'' Archibald Constable and Company, 1823&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the word bouffon comes from French and has entered English theatrical language through the work of [[Jacques Lecoq]] and his pedagogic inquiry into performance approaches of [[comedy]], leading him to create dynamic classroom exercises that explored elements of [[burlesque]], [[commedia dell'arte]], [[farce]], [[gallows humor]], [[parody]], [[satire]], [[slapstick]], etc. that collectively influenced the development of modern bouffon performance work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Philippe Gaulier]] a contemporary of LeCoq explains bouffon in his book ''The Tormentor''.

Worley graduated cum laude from the [[University of North Texas]] with a degree in Radio, Television, and Film.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

==Career==

Worley launched his first business in fashion with B Worley Designs, a clothing design company that expanded its business to stores throughout Texas. Although thriving as a new clothing company at the time, he pursued his true passion in wedding and event planning.

Worley began his career working with “Entertainment Tonight,” [[MTV]], numerous award shows, and high-profile personalities. Worley was soon donned the “event guru” and budget specialist, known to turn any ordinary event into an extraordinary event.&lt;ref&gt;Azzopardi, Chris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5872">In the [[Color psychology|psychology of color]], '''color preferences''' are the tendency for an individual or a group to [[prefer]] some [[color]]s over others, such as having a '''favorite color'''.

==Introduction==
An 'ecological [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] theory' (EVT) has been suggested to explain why people have preferences for different colors. This is the idea that the preference for color is determined by the average [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] response to everything the individual associates with the color. Hence, positive emotional experiences with a particular color are likely to increase the propensity to develop a preference for that color and vice versa. Social and cultural factors also factor into this affective response. A study in 2011 on the effects of "school spirit" and color preferences found members of Berkeley were more likely to favor the school's official colors than rival university Stanford. This degree of preference was also correlated with their self-reported level of "school spirit". The researchers conducting the study concluded that this was evidence for the EVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Karen B.|last2=Poggesi|first2=Rosa M.|last3=Palmer|first3=Stephen E.|title=Effects of university affiliation and "school spirit" on color preferences: Berkeley versus Stanford|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|publisher=PubMed|pages=498–504|doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0073-1|date=5 March 2011|volume = 18|issue = 3|pmid=21380587|pmc=3098359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
The age when infants begin showing a preference for color is at about 12 weeks old. Generally, children prefer the colors red/pink and blue, and cool colors are preferred over warm colors. Purple is a color favored more by girls than by boys. Color perception of children 3–5 years of age is an indicator of their developmental stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn colors|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpwOwri-jcVCf5R9IvppTaA|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color preferences tend to change as people age.&lt;ref&gt;Read, M., &amp; Upington, D. (2009). Young Children's Color Preferences in the Interior Environment. ''Early Childhood Education Journal,'' 36(6), 491-496. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1007/s10643-009-0311-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different societies==
Favoritism of colors varies widely. Often societal influences will have a direct impact on what colors we favor and disdain. In the West, the color black symbolizes mourning and sadness, red symbolizes anger and violence, white symbolizes purity and peace, and yellow symbolizes joy and luck (other colors lack a consistent meaning). From a recent study, it was discussed that [[associative learning]] is the process where an individual develops color preferences. In different countries, color preference vary. In China, red indicates luck, while in Nigeria and Germany it means the exact opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Paul|author2=Akcay, Okan|title=Color:  Cross Cultural Marketing Perspectives As To What Governs Our Response To It.|journal=American Society of Business and Behavioral Sciences|date=February 2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=950–954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diplomats may be honorary [[Consul (representative)| consuls]], or members of the country's [[diplomatic service]].

Such assistance may take the form of:
* provision of replacement [[travel document]]s
* advice and support in the case of an accident, serious illness or death
* advice and support to victims of serious crime overseas, and arranging for next-of-kin to be informed
* visitation contact with incarcerated nationals
* liaison with local police officials in the case of nationals abducted or missing overseas
* loans to distressed travellers
* help during crises, such as civil unrest and natural disasters 
* facilitating the overseas payment of social welfare benefits
* registering [[citizen]] births abroad
* providing a list of local doctors and lawyers
* supervising their flag vessels in foreign harbours

Such assistance commonly does not extend to:
* storing luggage or valuables
* intervening in commercial disputes on behalf of their nationals
* providing travel agency, banking, or postal services
* money changing
* translation and interpreting services
* legal advice or advocacy
* negotiation of special treatment, bail, or early release from prison

'''Corpus linguistics''' is the [[study of language]] as expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (bodies) of "real world" text. The text-corpus method is a digestive approach that derives a set of abstract rules that govern a [[natural language]] from texts in that language, and explores how that language relates to other languages. Originally derived manually, corpora now are automatically derived from source texts. Corpus linguistics proposes that reliable language analysis is more feasible with corpora collected in the field in its natural context ("realia"), and with minimal experimental-interference.

The field of corpus linguistics features divergent views about the value of corpus annotation. These views range from [[John McHardy Sinclair]], who advocates  minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J. 'The automatic analysis of corpora', in Svartvik, J. (ed.) ''Directions in Corpus Linguistics (Proceedings of Nobel Symposium 82)''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Survey of English Usage]] team ([[University College, London]]), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. 'Annotation, Retrieval and Experimentation', in Meurman-Solin, A. &amp; Nurmi, A.A. (ed.) Annotating Variation and Change. Helsinki: Varieng, [University of Helsinki]. 2007. [http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/journal/volumes/01/wallis e-Published]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Linguistics}}
Some of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance.  For example, [[Pratisakhya|Prātiśākhya]] literature described the sound patterns of [[Sanskrit]] as found in the [[Vedas]], and 
[[Pāṇini]]'s grammar of [[classical Sanskrit]] was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus.  Similarly, the early [[Arabic grammar#History|Arabic grammarians]] paid particular attention to the language of the [[Quran]].  In the Western European tradition, scholars prepared [[Bible concordance|concordances]] to allow detailed study of the language of the Bible and other canonical texts.

A landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]] of ''Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English'' in 1967, a work based on the analysis of the [[Brown Corpus]], a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, language teaching, [[psychology]], statistics, and [[sociology]]. A further key publication was [[Randolph Quirk]]'s 'Towards a description of English Usage' (1960)&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R. 'Towards a description of English Usage', ''Transactions of the Philological Society''. 1960. 40–61.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced [[Survey of English Usage|The Survey of English Usage]].

Shortly thereafter, Boston publisher [[Houghton-Mifflin]] approached Kučera to supply a million-word, three-line citation base for its new ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'', the first [[dictionary]] compiled using corpus linguistics. The AHD took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements (how language ''should'' be used) with descriptive information (how it actually ''is'' used).

Other publishers followed suit. The British publisher Collins' [[COBUILD]] [[monolingual learner's dictionary]], designed for users learning [[English language learning and teaching|English as a foreign language]], was compiled using the [[Bank of English]]. The [[Survey of English Usage]] Corpus was used in the development of one of the most important Corpus-based Grammars, the ''Comprehensive Grammar of English'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech, G. and Svartvik, J. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brown Corpus]] has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora: the [[LOB Corpus]] (1960s [[British English]]), Kolhapur ([[Indian English]]), Wellington ([[New Zealand English]]), Australian Corpus of English ([[Australian English]]), the Frown Corpus ([[early 1990s]] [[American English]]), and the FLOB Corpus (1990s British English). Other corpora represent many languages, varieties and modes, and include the [[International Corpus of English]], and the [[British National Corpus]], a 100 million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts, created in the 1990s by a consortium of publishers, universities ([[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]]) and the [[British Library]]. For contemporary American English, work has stalled on the [[American National Corpus]], but the 400+ million word [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (1990–present) is now available through a web interface.

The first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in 1971 by the Montreal French Project,&lt;ref&gt;Sankoff, D. &amp; Sankoff, G. Sample survey methods and computer-assisted analysis in the study of grammatical variation. In Darnell R. (ed.) ''Canadian Languages in their Social Context'' Edmonton: Linguistic Research Incorporated. 1973. 7–64.&lt;/ref&gt; containing one million words, which inspired [[Shana Poplack]]'s much larger corpus of spoken French in the Ottawa-Hull area.&lt;ref&gt;Poplack, S. The care and handling of a mega-corpus. In Fasold, R. &amp; Schiffrin D. (eds.) ''Language Change and Variation'', Amsterdam: Benjamins. 1989. 411–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these corpora of living languages, computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages. An example is the [[Francis Andersen|Andersen]]-Forbes database of the Hebrew Bible, developed since the 1970s, in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax, and every segment tagged with seven fields of information.&lt;ref&gt;

This is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, [[part-of-speech tagging]], and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, K., Atwell, E. and Habash, N. 'Supervised Collaboration for Syntactic Annotation of Quranic Arabic'. ''Language Resources and Evaluation Journal''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides pure linguistic inquiry, researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields, such as the emerging sub-discipline of [[Law and Corpus Linguistics|law and corpus linguistics]], which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools.

== Methods ==
Corpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods, which attempt to trace a path from data to theory. Wallis and Nelson (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. and Nelson G. ''Knowledge discovery in grammatically analysed corpora''. ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', '''5''': 307–340. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced what they called the 3A perspective:  Annotation, Abstraction and Analysis.

* '''Annotation''' consists of the application of a scheme to texts. Annotations may include structural markup, [[Lexical category|part-of-speech]] tagging, parsing, and numerous other representations.
* '''Abstraction''' consists of the translation (mapping) of terms in the scheme to terms in a theoretically motivated model or dataset. Abstraction typically includes linguist-directed search but may include e.g., rule-learning for parsers.
* '''Analysis''' consists of statistically probing, manipulating and generalising from the dataset. Analysis might include statistical evaluations, optimisation of rule-bases or knowledge discovery methods.

Most lexical corpora today are part-of-speech-tagged (POS-tagged). However even corpus linguists who work with 'unannotated plain text' inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms. In such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search.

The advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus (through [[corpus manager]]s). Linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators' can exploit this work. By sharing data, corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate, rather than as an exhaustive fount of knowledge.

Recent studies have suggested treatment outcome in adolescents with [[social anxiety disorder]] can also be assessed by analysing language by means of Corpus Linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Lopez, L. J, Bedmar, MB, Perez-Paredes, P, &amp; Tornero, E. (2011). TREATMENT CHANGE IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER: INSIGHTS FROM CORPUS LINGUISTICS. Ansiedad y Estres, 17, 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna - Rebel Heart Tour Cologne 2 (23219532496) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Madonna, seen here on the [[Rebel Heart Tour]] (2015), has had a social-cultural impact on the world through her artistic endeavors.]]
Since the beginning of her career in the early 1980s, American singer and songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has had a social-cultural impact on the world through her recordings, attitude, clothing and lifestyle. Called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]", Madonna is labeled by international authors as the greatest woman in music, as well as the most influential and iconic female recording artist of all time.

Accepted as a global [[cultural icon]], Madonna has built a legacy that goes beyond music and has been studied by [[sociologists]], [[List of historians|historians]] and other [[social scientists]].&lt;ref name="Batanga"/&gt; Her impact is often compared with that of [[The Beatles' influence on popular culture|The Beatles]] and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley]]; they are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best selling acts of all time]] in the general, solo male and female category respectively.&lt;ref name="Herman"&gt;{{harvnb|Herman|2009|pp=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna is a key figure in [[popular music]]; critics have retrospectively credited her presence, success and contributions with paving the way for every female artist and changing forever the music scene for women in the music history, as well as for today's pop stars. Even [[Bibliography of Madonna|reviews of her work]] have served as a roadmap for scrutinizing women at each stage in their music career.&lt;ref name="Noisey"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/madonna-bedtime-stories-20th-anniversary-sex-sexuality-feminism|title=WHY MADONNA'S UNAPOLOGETIC 'BEDTIME STORIES' IS HER MOST IMPORTANT ALBUM|date=October 24, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2013|last=von Aue|first=Mary|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna is the first multimedia [[pop icon]] in history and professionals agree that she has become the world's biggest and most socially significant pop icon, as well as the most controversial. However, some intellectuals, like the Frenchman [[Georges Claude Guilbert]], felt that she has greater cultural importance, like a [[myth]], that has apparent universality and timelessness. References to Madonna in [[popular culture]] are found in the arts, food, science and each branch of entertainment. In a general sense, journalist [[Peter Robinson (journalist)|Peter Robinson]] noted that "Madonna invented contemporary pop fame so there is a little bit of her in the DNA of every modern pop thing."&lt;ref name="GuardianPopstars"/&gt;

However, she is not only an omnipresent figure, but also a [[Polarization (psychology)|polarizing]] one. During her career, Madonna has attracted contradictory cultural social attention from family organizations, feminist "anti-porn" and religious groups worldwide with boycott and protests. Although this attracted unprecedented world media attention, the reviews have been negative, resulting sometimes in censorships.

== Cultural and social impact ==
Madonna has been described as an "omnipresent" character and one of the most recognizable names and faces in the world.&lt;ref name="RockHall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/madonna/bio/|title=Madonna Biography|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|year=2008|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcovitz"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1604138599|title=Madonna: Entertainer (Women of Achievement) Library Binding – November 1, 2010|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESMT"/&gt; Tetzlaff felt that "the power of the omnipresent Madonna has to do with [[hyperreality]], but an infinite accumulation of simulacra, an overabundance of information".&lt;ref name="Claudeochoyocho"&gt;{{harvnb|Claude|2002|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Quico Alsedo from ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' in Spain felt that Madonna has build a nation, landless but densely populated.&lt;ref name="ElMundoNation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/blogs/elmundo/rockandblog/2013/09/05/madonna-bachar-el-asad.html|title=Madonna = Bachar El Asad|first=Alsedo|last=Quico|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|location=Spain|date=September 5, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic T. Cole Rachel, stated in 2015, that "there’s an approximate 100% probability that any living human over the age of, say, 25 has some sort of specific Madonna-related memory... Even if you aren’t a super fan—or even a fan at all—there’s no escaping Madonna. She is everywhere."&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9604-pop-sovereign-a-conversation-with-madonna/|title=Pop Sovereign: A Conversation with Madonna|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=April 15, 2015|author=T. Cole Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Madonna As Postmodern Myth'' (2002), French academic [[Georges Claude Guilbert]] explains how Madonna reflects today's society,&lt;ref name="Claudenopage"&gt;{{harvnb|Claude|2002|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while William Langley from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' feels that "Madonna has changed the world's [[social history]], has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/profiles/2530197/Madonna-mistress-of-metamorphosis.html|title=Madonna, mistress of metamorphosis|first=William|last=Langley|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American poet [[Jane Miller]] compares her functions as an [[archetype]] directly inside contemporary culture with the [[Black Madonna]].&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{harvnb|Benson|2000|pp=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor John R. May concludes that Madonna is a contemporary "[[gesamtkunstwerk]]",&lt;ref name="May"&gt;{{harvnb|May|1997|pp=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic [[Sergio Fajardo]] labels her "a very powerful [[symbol]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.com/portal/resultados/detalles/?idx=207402|trans-title=Fans waiting for Madonna|first=Giselle|last=Tatiana|first2=Rojas |last2=Pérez|work=[[El Mundo (Colombia)|ElMundo]]|location=Colombia|date=November 25, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2015|language=Spanish|title=Fans esperan a Madonna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Belén González Morales of the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] comments, "'The infinite dissection' of Madonna is like a body [[paradigmatic]] of the global age that emanating a tremendous amount of meanings&amp;nbsp;... Madonna has been become a [[cultural artifact]].&lt;ref name="dissection"&gt;{{harvnb|Clúa Ginés|Pitarch|2008|pp=81,84,90}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strawberry Saroyan]] states that she's a storyteller and a cultural pioneer, and emphasizes the important thing is her message: "And all of those things have been brilliantly of a piece. Madonna's ability to take her message beyond music and impact women's lives has been her legacy".&lt;ref name="salon2000"&gt;{{cite news|title=So-called Chaos|work=Salon|author=[[Strawberry Saroyan]] and [[Michelle Goldberg]]|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/10/10/madonna_4/|date=October 10, 2000|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors note that Madonna has proved a master of [[cultural appropriation]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland"/&gt; She is also considered "a barometer of culture that directs the attention to cultural shifts, struggles and [[Transformation of culture|changes]]."&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt; The [[American Library Association]], in a review of music journalist Adam Sexton's book ''Desperately Seeking Madonna: In Search of the Meaning of the World's Most Famous Woman'', remarks: "Love her or hate her, Madonna is an inescapable figure in the contemporary cultural landscape".&lt;ref name="AdamSexton"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st Printing January 1993|title = Desperately Seeking Madonna: In Search of the Meaning of the World's Most Famous Woman|publisher = Delta|date = December 1992|location = New York|isbn = 9780385306881|editor-first = Adam|editor-last = Sexton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicologist [[Susan McClary]] suggests that Madonna is engaged in rewriting some very fundamental levels of Western thought.&lt;ref name="john"&gt;{{harvnb|Shepard|2003|pp=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; One academic from [[Lehigh University]] expressed that she stands behind all people and helps them fight against being ostracized in society.&lt;ref name="Gaugler"/&gt; Contribuitor from company [[Spin Media]] felt that "Madonna has changed society through her fiery ambition and unwillingness to compromise".&lt;ref name="DeathandTaxes"/&gt; Professor [[Karlene Faith]] accerted Madonna's peculiarity is that she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains. She has been a 'cult' figure within self-propelling [[subculture]]s just as she became a major". She also concluded that as fans, moral critics, media journalists, or university scholars, we mediate what Madonna means to our society.&lt;ref name="Faith"/&gt; In general, academic radicals turned Madonna into the "[[cottage industry]]", most notable in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cullen85"&gt;{{harvnb|Cullen|2001|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In United States ===
Madonna is part of the [[Culture of United States]] and an American icon. Authors in ''American Icons'' (2006) felt that "like [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]] or [[Coca-Cola]], Madonna image is immediately recognizable around the world and instantly communicates many of the values of U.S. culture".&lt;ref name="HallUS"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2006|pp=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rodrigo Fresán]] commented: "saying that Madonna just is a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a [[Soft drink|soda]]. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of [[Made in USA]]".&lt;ref name="Fresan88"&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilar Guzmán|2010|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was included in the book ''100 Entertainers Who Changed America: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture'' of [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]. Historian professor Glen Jeansonne, said that "Madonna freed Americans from their inhibitions and made them feel good about having fun".&lt;ref name="Jeansonne"&gt;{{harvnb|Jeansonne|2006|pp=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor Erin Skarda from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt that essentially redefined what it meant to be famous in America.&lt;ref name="TimeFashionICon"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2110513_2110627_2110639,00.html|title=Madonna - All-TIME Top 100 Icons in Fashion, Style and Design|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Erin|last=Skarda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author in ''Shaded Lives: African-American Women and Television'' (2002), said that only Madonna rivaled the space [[Oprah Winfrey]] occupied in the late twentieth century and in the psyche of national culture.&lt;ref name="Shaded"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith-Shomade|2002|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Lac in her Madonna's biography concluded that she is one of those rare people who have become a part of American culture itself.&lt;ref name="Lac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008R53QE2|title=Madonna: Biography of the World's Greatest Pop Singer [Kindle Edition]|accessdate=February 7, 2015|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Cullen wrote in ''Restless in the Promised Land: Catholics and the American Dream'' (2001) "few figures in [[American Dream|American life]] have manage to exert as much control over their destinies as she has, and the fact that se has done so as a woman is all the more remarkable. That Madonna has done this is indisputable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cullen|2001|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Society of the United States|American society]], she is often referenced by her sexual [[Feminist political theory|feminist political movement]]. For example, [[Sara Marcus]] from [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] felt that with the height of her career, Madonna brought the changes to American culture and expressed that "her revelatory spreading of sexual liberation to [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]], changed this country for the better. And that's not old news; we're still living it.... as we can see in everything from the ubiquity of pop stars to [[Rihanna]]'s career. She ends saying that "the woman [Madonna] remade American culture".&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/04/how_madonna_changed_america/|title=How Madonna liberated America|first=Sara|last=Marcus|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew O'Hagan]] felt that "Madonna is like a heroic opponent of cultural and political authoritarianism of the American "[[The Establishment|establishment]]".&lt;ref name="Claude"&gt;{{harvnb|Claude|2002|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural critic [[Annalee Newitz]] commented that Madonna has given to American culture, and culture throughout the world, is not a collection of songs; rather, it is a collection of images.&lt;ref name="Newitz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1993/09/newitz.html|title=Madonna's Revenge|first=Newitz|last=Annalee|authorlink=Annalee Newitz|publisher=[[EServer.org]]|date=November 1993|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' dubbed her as "our lady of constant makeovers".&lt;ref name=Cullen85 /&gt; And [[Lynn Spigel]] wrote that Madonna intervened "America's notions of sex, gender and power. Madonna publicized her appropriation of the unspoken and taboo areas of Americas's moralist rhetoric and capitalized on it through the scandalization and titillation of the consumer".&lt;ref name="Spiegel122"&gt;{{harvnb|Spigel|2007|pp=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madonna as an icon ==
Dubbed as the most iconic female artist of all time,&lt;ref name="WMA"/&gt; Madonna is a synonym of vanguard in the fields of she work.&lt;ref name="Moma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/86958.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203021938/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/86958.html|title=Impone tendencia la 'Chica material'|trans-title=Imposes trend, the Material Girl|language=Spanish|location=Mexico|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|archivedate=December 3, 2013 |date=November 2008|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her impact and contributions, she [[Bibliography of Madonna|has been analyzed]] from the point view of [[Madonna Studies|several studies]], including feminist, sexual, gay, [[Queer studies|queer]], musical, [[Social studies|social]] and [[postmodern]] etc., becoming known as an icon in all these branches. Reader editor Brian McNair wrote that "Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence".&lt;ref name="McNair"&gt;{{harvnb|McNair|2002|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Dennis Hall said that "the fact that not only her work but her person was open to multiple interpretations contributed to the rise of [[Madonna Studies]]".&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; As Hall, [[Hao Huang]] in his 1999 book ''Music in the 20th Century'' wrote that Madonna has made a career as well as an art out of reinventing herself — as a rock diva, stage and screen star, video vixen, fashion icon, and cultural phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{harvnb|Huang|1999|pp=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonnaicon.jpg|thumb|left|Icon of Madonna, taken in 1990 at the [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]]. Is created by [[Alan Light]].]]
Academics felt that [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'s recent definition of "icon" as a "person or thing" or an "institution", etc., considered worthy of admiration or respect or "regarded as a representative symbol", esp. of a culture or movement” (OED 2009), and this include Madonna.&lt;ref name="Heindelber University"/&gt; Alyson Welsh from ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that "she is an amazing role model, and a [[cultural icon]]".&lt;ref name="GuardianWels"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/09/why-madonna-is-still-my-style-icon-despite-the-look-at-me-lingerie|title=Why Madonna is still my style icon (despite the look-at-me lingerie)|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015|first=Alyson|last=Welsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program [[Australasian Journal of American Studies]] (AJAS) remember that it's not an accident that [[Mickey Mouse]] and Madonna are worldwide icons.&lt;ref name="AJAS"&gt;{{cite journal|title=AJAS|date=July 1, 1996|accessdate=June 18, 2015|volume=15|work=[[Australasian Journal of American Studies]] (AJAS)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oelKAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=It's+not+an+accident+that+Mickey+Mouse+and+Madonna+are+worldwide+icons&amp;dq=It's+not+an+accident+that+Mickey+Mouse+and+Madonna+are+worldwide+icons&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=22CDVc20GcGz-AGc14K4CA&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ|page=60|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors from [[Heidelberg University]] shows how Madonna's "iconicity" is indeed that of a "meta-icon" in the sense that the self-reflexive imitation of celebrity poses. Calls this strategy "iconizing", in analogy to the concept of "vogueing". The essay also inquires into the blend of biography and performativity that can be said to underlie Madonna's "iconizing" in relation to the performance artists.&lt;ref name="Heindelber University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.uni-heidelberg.de/personen/Leypoldt/files/LeypoldtEnglerAmericanCulturalIconsIntroduction.pdf|title=Cultural Icons, Charismatic Heroes, Representative Lives|publisher=[[Heidelberg University]]|accessdate=June 17, 2015|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Goldberg]] said that "[[Andy Warhol]] did an enormous amount to change that idea in highbrow circles, but Madonna made it conventional wisdom to conflate art and commerce. She pioneered this kind of multimedia, 'life as performance art'."&lt;ref name="salon2000"/&gt;

Before closing the 20th century, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine declared her as one of the most important cultural figures of this century.&lt;ref name="cultural icon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wexter|first=Erica|title=Reviews Madonna Ray of Light|date=April 1998|accessdate=April 7, 2013|volume=21|issue=3|work=ThirdWay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56sBy_z9eUC&amp;pg=PA28|page=28|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miranda Sawyer]], [[Jefferson Hack]]  and others authors called to her as a 21st-century icon.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0752890514|title=Madonna|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/21252/1/madonna-21st-century-icon|title=Madonna: 21st Century Icon|first=Jefferson|authorlink=Jefferson Hack|last=Hack|work=[[Dazed]]|year=2008|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] wrote in his book ''[[Madonna (book)|Madonna]]'' (2002) that "she is the undisputed female icon of the [[modern age]]".

To experts in the 1990s, her use of fashion was even more eclectic.&lt;ref name="Oh"&gt;{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|1994|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Michael Pye felt that "the face that launched a thousand fashions. To a large extent Madonna not only makes fashion, she is fashion.&lt;ref name="Claude37"&gt;{{harvnb|Claude|2002|pp=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine [[Anna Wintour]] declared:
{{Quote|She's a perfect example of how popular culture and street style now influence the world of fashion. Over the years, Madonna has been one of the most potent style setters of our time. She, just as much as [[Karl Lagerfeld]], makes fashion happen.&lt;ref name="Claude37"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Professors in ''Oh Fashion'' (1994) book wrote that "the Madonna phenomenon suggests that in a postmodern image culture identity is constructed through image and fashion, involving one's look, pose, and attitude. Fashion and identity for Madonna are inseparable from her aesthetic practices, from her cultivation of her image in her music videos, films, TV appearances, concerts, and other cultural interventions".&lt;ref name="Oh2"&gt;{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|1994|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' declared that "no pop diva has reinvented her fashion image with the consistency and creativity of Madonna... she evolved into a fashion-forward icon whose sense of style became as influential as her chart-topping tunes".&lt;ref name="BillboardFashion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/428558/madonnas-fashion-evolution-her-most-iconic-looks|title=Madonna's Fashion Evolution: Her Most Iconic Looks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 22, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, editor of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' Dana Oliver comments why Madonna is the ultimate style chameleon and added that "no one has transformed herself like Madonna. She has had about as many looks as she has records. Her ability to constantly reinvent herself and her music has helped to secure her status as an icon, and she has influenced a generation of copycats. In short, no one has had more diverse looks than Madonna".&lt;ref name="THP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/15/madonna-style-transformation-photos_n_3763575.html|title=Why Madonna Is The Ultimate Style Chameleon|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=June 19, 2015|last=Oliver|first=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chloe Wyma from [[Louise Blouin Media]] commented that Madonna's chameleon attitude in transforming her fashion has become a universally recognized fact.&lt;ref name="Blouin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/950144/madonna-a-los-55-anos-de-edad-existe-otro-momento-mejor-para|title=Madonna a los 55 años de edad: ¿existe otro momento mejor para examinar sus contribuciones a la moda y el feminismo?|trans-title=Madonna to 55 years: Is there another better moment to examine her contributions to fashion and feminism?|accessdate=June 10, 2015|publisher=[[Louise Blouin Media]]|first= Wyma|last=Chloe|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ana Laglere from [[Batanga Media]] expressed that "each new Madonna's style is a trend and is used by major designers as inspiration, flooding our world with innovative ideas".&lt;ref name="Batanga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musica.batanga.com/9637/9-razones-que-explican-por-que-madonna-es-la-reina-del-pop-de-todos-los-tiempos|title=9 razones que explican por qué Madonna es la Reina del Pop de todos los tiempos|trans-title=9 reasons explain why Madonna is the Queen of Pop of all time|first=Laglere|last=Ana|publisher=[[Batanga Media|Batanga.com]]|date=April 14, 2015|accessdate=June 10, 2015|language=Spanish|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cynthia Robins from ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that "when Madonna came along, all fashion hell broke loose. Thus far, her influence on fashion  —high, low and otherwise— has transmogrified from 'Who's That Girl?' to what in the world will Madonna wear next?".&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/The-Material-Girl-Madonna-s-fashion-sense-has-2882599.php|title=The Material Girl Madonna's fashion sense has|first=Cynthia|last=Robins|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 2, 2001|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Codinha from ''Vogue'' named as "the master of reinvention".&lt;ref name="VogueM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13253338/madonna-ghosttown-music-video-look/|title=Exclusive!

=== Feminism ===
Madonna as a feminist icon has generated variety of opinions worldwide. She is frequently associated with the [[feminist movement]] and she is considered a revolutionary figure who questioned the boundaries of gender. She is also responsible for influencing the mentality and behavior of women and how society interprets these changes.&lt;ref name="Batanga"/&gt; Professor [[Sut Jhally]] felt that "Madonna is as an almost sacred feminist icon".&lt;ref name="Sut Jhally"&gt;{{harvnb|Jhally|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic [[Camille Paglia]] from [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] called Madonna a "true feminist" and noted that "she exposes the puritanism and suffocating ideology of [[American feminism]], which is stuck in an adolescent whining mode". According to her, "Madonna has taught young women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising total control over their lives".&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paglia|first=Camille|authorlink=Camille Paglia|title=Madonna – Finally, A Real Feminist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/14/opinion/madonna-finally-a-real-feminist.html|accessdate=June 17, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Jule Eisenbud in ''Sex Symbols'' (1999) noted that Madonna's refusal to accept that power and femininity is equivalent to masculinity has allowed her to maintain her status as a sex symbol.&lt;ref name="Eisenbud"&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|Leigh-Kile|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Valenti]] wrote in her book ''[[Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop]]'' (2012) "sure, one [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] gave birth to Jesus... but our Madonna gave birth to "femme-inism".&lt;ref name="Barcella2"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1593764294|title=Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop Paperback – March 6, 2012|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish newspaper ''[[Periódico Diagonal]]'' convened a researchers panel discussion her as a feminist icon.&lt;ref name="Totem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/culturas/madonna-icono-feminista-o-totem-consumista.html|title=Madonna: ¿icono feminista o tótem consumista?|author=Victor Lenore &amp; Irene G. Rubio|work=[[Periódico Diagonal]]|trans-title=Madonna: feminist icon or consumerist totem?|date=June 26, 2012|accessdate=June 18, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the comments, included that "she democratized the idea of women as protagonists and as agents of their own action", while some ambiguous ones stated that she contributed to women's empowerment of a few Western women, straight and gay middle class, but that empowerment is not feminism, because it is individualistic. Madonna was included in ''[[The Guardian]]'' list of the Top 100 women and editor Homa Khaleeli declared "no matter the decade or the fashion, she has always been frank about her toughness and ambition". She is still one of the most famous women on the planet and "she inspires not because she gives other women a helping hand, but because she breaks the boundaries of what's considered acceptable for women".&lt;ref name="QReinvention"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/08/madonna-100-women|title=Madonna |date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=June 18, 2015|work=The Guardian|first=Homa|last=Khaleeli}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the 25 most powerful women in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

=== Sex symbol ===
Madonna has been referred to as a sexual icon,&lt;ref name="Shaded"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith-Shomade|2002|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex icon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Madonna|url=http://newint.org/features/1991/08/05/reviews/|accessdate=June 17, 2015|newspaper=[[New Internationalist]]|date=August 5, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sex symbol]]; most notable in the decade of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Various"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregg|McDonogh|Wong||p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she is cited as an icon of sexual freedom and expression.&lt;ref name="ReginadelPop"/&gt; Author Courtney E. Smith in the 2011 book ''Record Collecting for Girls'' noted that most people associate Madonna with sex.&lt;ref name="SmithGaga"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2011|pp=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck Klosterman]] in his book ''[[Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs]]'' (2003) wrote that "whenever I hear intellectuals talk about sexual icons of the present day, the name mentioned most is Madonna".&lt;ref name="Chris"&gt;{{harvnb|Klosterman|2003|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even, Karen Fredericks from socialist newspaper ''[[Green Left Weekly]]'' in comment with her sexual attitude said that Madonna capturing an enormous mainstream audience, has had a perhaps surprising impact in progressive circles.&lt;ref name="GreenLeftWeekly"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2766|title=and ain't i a woman?: Madonna: sexual revolutionary?|work=[[Green Left Weekly]]|last=Fredericks|first=Karen|date=October 22, 1992|issue=77|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists Adam Geczy and Vicki Karaminas in ''Queer Style'' (2013) noted Madonna transmogrified from virgin to dominatrix to ''Über Fran'', each time achieving iconic status. Added Madonna was the first woman to do so-and with mainstream panache and approbation.&lt;ref name="Shaded2"&gt;{{harvnb|Geczy|Karaminas|2013|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]] teach that her "power to the pussy" credo worked only to solidify Madonna's positioning on the backs of the marginalized. The sexual icon she constructed may indeed, then, accord power to the pussy.&lt;ref name="Shaded2"/&gt; Academics from [[European School of Management and Technology]] felt that Madonna became one of the world's first performers to manipulate the juxtaposition of sexual and religious themes.&lt;ref name="ESMT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.esmt.org/fm/13/Madonna_article.pdf|title=Madonna – Strategy on the Dance Floor|publisher=[[European School of Management and Technology]] (ESMT)|year=2006|author=Jaime Anderson &amp; Martin Kupp|accessdate=June 18, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529022945/http://www.esmt.org/fm/13/Madonna_article.pdf|archivedate=May 29, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; American editor [[Janice Min]] wrote that "long before ''[[Sex and the City]]'', Madonna owned her sexuality. She made people cringe but also think differently about female performers. Her role as a provocateur changed boundaries for ensuing generations. She was a one-woman reality show."&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt; As Min, Shmuel Boteach, author of ''Hating Women'' (2005), felt that Madonna was largely responsible for erasing the line between music and pornography. He stated: "Before Madonna, it was possible for women more famous for their voices than their cleavage to emerge as music superstars. But in the post-Madonna universe, even highly original performers such as [[Janet Jackson]] now feel the pressure to expose their bodies on national television to sell albums".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boteach|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career, Madonna has several provocative works. Perhaps, her book ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'' is most notorious, considered by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period.&lt;ref name="Cambio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambio.com.co/entretenimientocambio/791/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR_CAMBIO-4470108.html|title=Madonna, vigente a los 50|date=November 2, 2008|accessdate=February 21, 2013|language=Spanish|trans-title=Madonna, still got it at 50|publisher=Cambio.com ([[AOL]])|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515143201/http://www.cambio.com.co/entretenimientocambio/791/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR_CAMBIO-4470108.html|archivedate=May 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors noted that ''Sex'' helped Madonna make a name in the [[porn industry]],&lt;ref name="Kirk Davidson"/&gt; and earned her the title of [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]]'s first [[cultural ambassador]].&lt;ref name="Nyissue SM"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 18, 1994|title=S&amp;M offers a safe haven for ex "classy" topless bars|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|page=40|volume=27|issue=47|issn=0028-7369|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Bachmann, on his book ''Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity'' pointed out that "perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise".&lt;ref name="Bachman 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Bachmann|2002|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian McNair, author of ''Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire'' (2012) praised this period of Madonna's career, saying that she had "porno elegance" and that "''Sex'' is the author of a cultural phenomenon of global proportions [due to the critics] and thanks to this Madonna established her iconic status and cultural influence.&lt;ref name="McNair267"&gt;{{harvnb|McNair|2012|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors in ''Oh Fashion'' (1994) book felt that "Madonna is a toy for boys, but on another level boys are toys for her".&lt;ref name="Oh" /&gt;

[[File:Madonna Impersonator by David Shankbone.jpg|upright|thumb|LGBT [[Madonna wannabe|Madonna impersonator]].]]

According to ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Madonna is the greatest gay icon of all time.&lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/print-issue/cover-stories/2012/02/02/madonna-truth-she-never-left-you|title=Madonna: The Truth Is She Never Left You|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=June 17, 2015|first=Ari|last=Karpel}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Statesman]]'' reported that Madonna became the supreme gay icon, and the [[Madonna Studies]] analyzed and support these.&lt;ref name="Statesman"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Madonna|year=2000|accessdate=June 23, 2015|volume=129|issue= 4493—4505|work=[[New Statesman]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_yFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Madonna+a+gay+icon&amp;dq=Madonna+a+gay+icon&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eZ2JVZvTEIaYNovuk-AI&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzge|page=46|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars Carmine Sarracino and Kevin Scott in ''The Porning of America'' (2008), wrote that Madonna "gained particular popularity with gay audiences, signaling the creation of a career-long fan base that would lead to her being hailed as the biggest gay icon of all time".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarracino|Scott|2002|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine wrote that Madonna "stuck her neck out and positioned herself to be a gay icon before it was cool to be one".&lt;ref name="out"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Your Letters continued|year=2005|accessdate=June 23, 2015|volume=13|issue=7—12|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_kiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Madonna+is+a+gay+icon&amp;dq=Madonna+is+a+gay+icon&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aqyJVbLjGcKyggT8sZnABA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAzgK|page=178|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Associate professor]] Judith A. Peraino wrote that "no one has worked harder to be a gay icon than Madonna, and she has done so by using every possible taboo sexual in her videos, performances, and interviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peraino|2005|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, Alex Hopkins from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine denoted that gay community labeled her as [Their] 'Glorious Leader', "Madge is part of our subculture's rich history of diva worship. She has referenced every sacred monster from Dietrich to Monroe, revelled in upfront, often transgressive sexuality and demonstrated a highly developed sense of camp. No wonder we loved her". Also, her lack of inhibition helped inspire a generation of gay men and women to live on their own terms.&lt;ref name="TimeOut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/lgbt/is-madonna-still-the-ultimate-gay-icon|title=Is Madonna still the ultimate gay icon?|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=August 11, 2011|accessdate=June 23, 2015|first=Alex|last=Hopkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna is also referred to as a queer icon and icon of queerness. [[Theologist]], [[Robert Goss]] wrote: "For me, Madonna has been not only a queer icon but also a Christ icon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goss|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar Sheila Whiteley from ''Sexing the Groove: Popular Music and Gender'' (2013) felt that "Madonna came closer to any other contemporary celebrity in being an above-ground queer icon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whiteley|2013|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postmodern ===
According to [[Lucy O'Brien]]: Much has been made of Madonna as a postmodern icon, yet all her reference points have been resolutely modernist—from Steinbeck and Fitzgerald to Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath, to her predilection for narrative and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian editor [[Richard Appignanesi]] wrote that for some "Madonna is the cyber-model of the New Woman.&lt;ref name="Appignanesi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Appignanesi|Garratt|2014|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, [[senior lecturer]]s Stéphanie Genz and Benjamin Brabon in ''Postfeminism: Cultural Texts and Theories'' (2009) felt that "whether it is as a woman, mother, pop icon or fifty year old, the American singer challenges our preconceptions of who 'Madonna' is and, more broadly, what these identity categories mean within a postmodern context".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Genz|Brabon|2009|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pop icon and honorific nicknames and titles on popular culture ===
{{see also|Honorific nicknames in popular music}}
Madonna as a [[pop icon]] and figure on popular culture has generated scrutine analysis, but some journalists and critics like Carol Clerk wrote that "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon".&lt;ref name="culturalicontwo"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/reviews/review-madonna-style/|title=Review: Madonna Style|work=[[M (magazine)|M]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015|date=November 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503083842/http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/reviews/review-madonna-style/|archivedate=May 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academics from [[Rutgers University]] comments that "Madonna has become the world's biggest and most socially significant pop icon, as well as the most controversial".&lt;ref name="Rutgers University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialogues.rutgers.edu/all-journals/volume-2/86-madonna-rebel-with-a-cause/file|title=MADONNA: REBEL WITH A CAUSE?|first=Duyen|last=Pham|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|date=January 9, 2015|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical theorist [[Douglas Kellner]] described her as "a highly influential pop culture icon" and "the most discussed female singer in popular music".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even, in 2012 Latin critics felt that Madonna is the most influential presence of current popular culture.&lt;ref name="Totem"/&gt; Historian [[Jasmina Tešanović]] like others authors, noted that Madonna's changes are well-calculated in order to be ahead of the curve, of the game, to dictate the fashion, to be a trendsetter and called her as one of the most honest performers in pop culture.&lt;ref name="Cleveland"/&gt; [[VH1]] listed her behind [[David Beckham]] as the greatest pop icon of all time.&lt;ref name="Beckham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/225856/becks-greatest-pop-icon-of-all-time|title=Becks: Greatest Pop Icon Of All Time|publisher=[[Sky News]]|location=United Kingdom|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna has several titles, subjectives and superlatives, many of them explain and explore her large impact in many fields. Blogger Richard Pérez-Feria posted on ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that "over the course of her remarkable career, Madonna has been called many things... whore, which, for vastly different reasons. What Madonna ultimately achieved is nothing less than reigning as the universe's Queen of Pop, as in music, culture, life".&lt;ref name="Huffin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-perezferia/madonna-the-worlds-bigges_b_5967112.html|title=Madonna: The World's Biggest Star Is Just Hitting Her Stride|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=October 10, 2014|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean newspaper of politics, economy and culture, ''[[:es:Qué Pasa|Qué Pasa]]'' stated in 1996, that "to Madonna can be attributed many titles and never be exaggerated.

Professors in ''American Icons'' noted that she was not only an omnipresent figure but a [[Polarization (politics)|polarizing]] one. For example, in 1993, she was the subject of the ''I Hate Madonna Handbook'' and the following year the inspirations for ''I Dream of Madonna''.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2006|pp=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Spigel]] noted that Madonna is a producer of cultural ambiguity and openness.&lt;ref name="Spiegel23"&gt;{{harvnb|Spigel|2007|pp=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rabbi]] Isaac Karudi —the highest authority of the Orthodox [[Kabbalah]]— described her as a "depraved [[cultural icon]]".&lt;ref name="ElMundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2004/461/1092757010.html|title=Los pecados que ya no cometerás|last=Vidal|first=Jose Manuel|work=El Mundo|location=Spain|accessdate=April 15, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social critic and [[Critical theory|critical theorist]], [[Stuart Sim]] noted that "Madonna now attained the status of cultural icon, she is however, an extremely problematic one, as her delight in simultaneously evoking and transgressing cultural stereotypes of feminity makes her exceedingly difficult to categorize; depending on one's point of view".&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{harvnb|Sim|2013|pp=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural critic]] Fausto Rivera Yánez from ''[[:es:El Telégrafo|El Telégrafo]]'' said that "Madonna has labeling usurper, since much of its aesthetic and musical approach draws on religious imagery of [[African-American culture|black cultures]], discourses of [[sexual diversity]] and circumstantial [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] contexts".&lt;ref name="ElTelegrafo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/cultura/carton-piedra/item/madonna-quiero-controlar-el-mundo.html|title=Madonna: 'Quiero controlar el mundo'|trans-title=Madonna: 'I want to control the world'|last=Rivera Yánez|first=Fausto|work=[[:es:El Telégrafo|El Telégrafo]]|location=Ecuador|date=September 16, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maureen Orth]] explain her the contradiction as a cultural and social impact:&lt;ref name="Wonderland"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1992/10/madonna199210|title=Madonna in Wonderland|date=October 1992|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|authorlink=Maureen Orth|first=Maureen|last=Orth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|quote="Madonna’s celebrity is unique in that it seems to depend as much on repugnance as on acceptance.

Perhaps it’s not surprising that even academics are doing a brisk trade in 'Madonna-ology'.|source=}}

American [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Michiko Kakutani]], felt that Madonna is incredibly popular. Or: "Clearly, Madonna is not universally loved."

During her career, Madonna attracted the attention of family organizations, feminist "[[Opposition to pornography|anti-porn]]" and religious groups worldwide with boycott and protests. Professor Bruce David Forbes author of ''Religion and Popular Culture in America'' (2005) felt that "some of the most important and interesting texts in recent American culture which have overlapping concerns with liberation theologies are by Madonna".&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|2005|pp=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Fredericks from socialist newspaper ''[[Green Left Weekly]]'' questioned if does the "Madonna phenomenon" advance the cause of women's liberation within [[Western societies]]? she said that clearly, there's no point going to Madonna for help. She asserted that the artist is a commodity in a [[capitalist]] market which has been influenced, at least to some extent, by the demands of the women's movement.&lt;ref name="GreenLeftWeekly"/&gt; Sociologist John Shepherd wrote that Madonna's cultural practices highlight the sadly continuing social realities of dominance and subordination.&lt;ref name="john" /&gt; In 1988, one Italian sculptor planned a statue of Madonna in [[Pacentro]], where are from her paternal grandparents, who said "Madonna is a symbol of our children and represents a better world in the year 2000".

Academic Audra Gaugler from [[Lehigh University]] advocated for Madonna, wrote that "she has faced much criticism throughout her career, but much of it is unjust. Instead of Madonna's actions eliciting criticism, they should elicit praise because she radically tries to change society by blurring the boundaries that separate different groups of people in society and she urges all people to gain power in their lives and lift themselves out of subordinate positions. Madonna blurs the boundaries that exist in society and separate people in society in two distinct ways". She noted that there exists a large band of critics that at first praised her, but then became disillusioned with her as she became more and more controversial.&lt;ref name="Gaugler"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1662&amp;context=etd|title=Madonna, an American pop icon of feminism and counter-hegemony : blurring the boundaries &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; of race, gender, and sexuality by Audra Gaugler.|year=2000|accessdate=June 18, 2015|publisher=[[Lehigh University]]|first=Audra|last=Gaugler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6254">A '''curb stomp''', also called curbing, curb checking, curb painting, or making someone '''bite the curb''' is a form of [[assault]] in which a victim's mouth is forcefully placed on a [[curb]] and then [[Stomp (strike)|stomped]] from behind, causing severe [[injury|injuries]] and sometimes [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/more-arrests-in-curb-stomping-death-1.246543|title=More arrests in curb stomping death|publisher=CBC News|date=2000-06-03|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=Gangland |title=VolksFront|date=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable incidents ==
* In July 2002, 16-year old German Marinus Schöberl was tortured by young, underage neo-Nazis in an abandoned pigsty in [[Oberuckersee]] (in the German state of [[Brandenburg]]) and killed after curb-stomping. The main perpetrator, who was 17 at the time of the killing, was released after serving eight years in prison.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.presseportal.de/pm/2790/1736137&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, [[Tacoma, Washington]] resident Randall Townsend was murdered by four people. David Nikos Pillatos, Scotty James Butters, and Tristain Lynn Frye beat and kicked Townsend while Kurtis William Monschke delivered the final blow: curb-stomping. Monschke had recently been named head of the Washington chapter of [[Volksfront]]. "Prosecutors said the attack was meant to lift Monschke's status in the [[white supremacist]] movement and to earn Frye a pair of red shoelaces, with the red signifying the drawing of blood." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1197904.html|title=''STATE v. MONSCHKE'', No. 31847-4-II (WN. 2006).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/kurtis-monschke-and-other-racists-commit-violent-killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tristain Lynn Frye was sentenced to 13 years, nine months for [[second-degree murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lmtribune.com/northwest/woman-sentenced-in-transient-s-killing/article_d1a9e5cb-caa2-59d0-a0ed-480a7452cd4e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Scotty James Butters and David Nikos Pillatos pled to [[first-degree murder]], accepted a plea agreement and testified against Monschke in exchange for being able to request that their imprisonment be no more than approximately 30 years. in June 2004, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled "a sentence longer than the standard range could not be ordered by a judge without action by a jury, meaning Butters and Pillatos could face no more than 31 years in prison."

Kurtis William Monschke was convicted of aggravated first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.
The incident has been described as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/soundlife/v-printerfriendly/story/201056.html|title=Tacoma murder revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On August 26, 2011, Dane Hall was curb stomped in an attack outside a [[gay bar]] in Salt Lake City, Utah. He lost six teeth and suffered a broken jaw as a result of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705390124/Gay-man-severely-beaten-outside-club-says-he-was-victim-of-hate-crime.html?pg=all|title=Gay man severely beaten outside club says he was victim of hate crime|publisher=Deseret News|author=Pat Reavy|date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Junko Furuta]], a Japanese high school girl, was curb stomped among the various other tortures inflicted on her before her death.

[[WWE]] professional wrestler [[Seth Rollins]] previously used a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Curb stomp|Curb Stomp]] as his finishing move. Rollins said that he stopped using the move as "from a PR standpoint... it was too perceptually violent... I never hurt anyone with it.

'''''Death Without Denial Grief Without Apology: A Guide for Facing Death and Loss''''' by former [[Governor of Oregon|Oregon Governor]] [[Barbara Roberts|Barbara K. Roberts]] is a personal narrative of the author's experiences during her husband, [[Frank L. Roberts|Frank]]'s battle with [[cancer]], the final year of his life, and the subsequent years of grieving.

At the time of Frank Roberts' fatal recurrence of the illness, both he and his wife were in public office, Barbara as governor, and Frank as [[state senator]].  They turned to hospice for guidance and assistance once Frank decided to stop medical intervention.

Touching on matters of life with terminal illness, death with dignity, and both the personal and societal issues surrounding death, chapter titles include “A Culture in Denial,” “Hospice,” and “Permission to be Weird.”

'''''Death by Design''''' is a 1995 [[science]] [[documentary]] directed by Peter Friedman and Jean-François Brunet of the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris]] which focuses on [[cell biology]], with an emphasis on [[programmed cell death]] and why our lives depend on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix - Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online |url=http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Death-by-Design-The-Life-and-Times-of-Life-and-Times/70033351 |website=www.netflix.com |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured are prominent [[biologist]]s such as [[Nobel prize laureate]] [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] (along with her artist [[twin]] sister [[Paola Levi-Montalcini]]), [[Martin Raff]], [[Polly Matzinger]], [[Pierre Goldstein]], and Nobel laureate[[Robert Horvitz]]. The documentary is notable for its combination of a whimsical use of metaphors with scientific rigor, and incorporates [[animation]], [[micro-cinematography]], and scenes from old [[Hollywood]] films and [[stock footage]], including [[Busby Berkley]]-choreographed [[dance]] routines. The opening scene features the trailer from the 1950s [[science fiction film]] ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Estampage''' or stamping, is a term commonly used in [[epigraphy]] to obtain the exact replica of an inscription that cannot be transported.

According to Jayanti Madhukar,&lt;ref name="jayanti_hindu_blr_2017"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/what-do-the-inscription-stones-of-bengaluru-say/article21670654.ece|title=What do the inscription stones of Bengaluru say?|last=Madhukar|first=Jayanthi|date=2017-12-16|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is defined as: {{Quote
|text=''a process of ‘lifting’ the inscriptions from the stone on to a piece of paper for a clearer read''
}} The [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] defines it as:&lt;ref name="dict_mw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/estampage|title=Definition of ESTAMPAGE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote
|text=''an impression of an inscription made on inked paper''
}}

== Etymology ==
According to T.S. Ravishankar, former director of the Epigraphy branch of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI), Estampage is a purely Indian term used by [[Epigraphist]]s.&lt;ref name="jayanti_hindu_blr_2017"/&gt;
However, a more linguistically correct explanation would be that it originated from the French word [[:wikt:fr:estampage|estampage]] (by itself of Proto-Germanic etymology) that literally means 'stamping' and in practice, can mean either of the two processes, namely industrial stamping of steel ([[forging]]) or the artistic stamping of various materials. The latter meaning seems to be have been adopted into epigraphy.

== Process of estampage ==
Estampage is typically obtained by pressing wet paper on to the rock face, over which any ink material (usually, coal or [[India ink|Indian ink]]) is wiped.&lt;ref name="Springer_ACCV14_process"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aswatha|first=Shashaank M.|last2=Talla|first2=Ananth Nath|last3=Mukhopadhyay|first3=Jayanta|last4=Bhowmick|first4=Partha|date=2014-11-01|title=A Method for Extracting Text from Stone Inscriptions Using Character Spotting|journal=Computer Vision - ACCV 2014 Workshops|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=598–611|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-16631-5_44|isbn=9783319166308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An representative procedure&lt;ref name="Springer_ACCV14_process"/&gt; is listed below: 
* Soak a brush in water
* Clean the surface of the stone (that holds the inscription) using the brush.
* Carpet the stone surface using a large piece of wet paper (or layers of paper)
* Pat the wet paper(s) gently, using a [[dabber]] made of soft material. 
* Use Indian ink (usually black-colored) to smear the paper with the dabber, in order to get the impression of the surface. 
* Allow the paper to dry on the stone surface. 
* When the paper becomes dry, take it off slowly.
* Observe and verify the ink impression (estampage) emerging as white-colored letters (grooves of the characters) against the dark (black) background.

Epigraphers usually take a long time (days to weeks) to post-process the generated estampages, as they try to decipher, analyze, transliterate and translate the inscribed text.

== Usage ==
Within India, estampages have been made for numerous items and inscriptions of archaeological significance.&lt;ref name="book_indian_epigraphy"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Epigraphy : a Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages.|last=1948-|first=Salomon, Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195356663|location=New York|oclc=466425560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnarch.gov.in/epi.htm|title=EPIGRAPHY - ARCHAEOLOGY|website=www.tnarch.gov.in|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of them include:
* [[Edicts of Ashoka]] and [[Edicts of Ashoka#Estampages of Girnar Edicts|Estampages of Girnar Edicts]] in particular
* [[Madho Sarup Vats]]
* Works by [[Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department]]
* Works by [[M. G. S. Narayanan]]
* [[Syriac language|Syriac]]/[[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] inscriptions of [[Kerala]] &lt;ref name="jstor_pahlavi_kerala"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winckworth|first=C. P.

== Museums and displays ==
In 2016, the epigraphy branch of the ASI Southern Zone opened a new, permanent museum and exhibition of estampages  named ''Eugen Julius Theodor Hultzsch Memorial Museum and Epigraphical Photo Exhibition'' at the historic [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] at [[Chennai]], South India. This museum is named after [[E.

The '''flag of [[Bulgaria]]''' ({{lang-bg|знаме на България}}, {{IPA-mk|znamɛ nɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ|}}, ''zname na Bǎlgariya'') is a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] consisting of three equal-sized horizontal bands of (from top to bottom) white, green, and red. The flag was first adopted after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War]], when Bulgaria gained independence. The [[national flag]] at times was charged with the state emblem, especially during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist era]]. The current flag was re-established with the 1991 [[Constitution of Bulgaria]] and was confirmed in a 1998 law.

==History==
After the liberation of Bulgaria following the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, the flag was described in the [[Tarnovo Constitution]] of 1879 as follows:

{{cquote|Art. 23. The Bulgarian people's flag is three-coloured and consists of white, green and red colours, placed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infotel.bg/juen/arh/i4240002.htm |title=Tarnovo Constitution of 1879 |publisher=Juridical Encyclopedia |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2007-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911122019/http://www.infotel.bg/juen/arh/i4240002.htm |archivedate=2007-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1946 until 1990 the [[Emblem of the People's Republic of Bulgaria|emblem]] of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] was placed on the left side of the white stripe. It contained a lion within a wreath of wheat ears below a [[red star]] and above a ribbon bearing the date 9 September 1944, the day of [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]] which led to the establishment of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]. In 1971, it was changed so the ribbon bearing the years 681, the year of the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]] and 1944.

Following the fall of communism in 1990, the then-enforced [[Zhivkov Constitution]] was amended so the flag can be reverted to the pre-communism era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationbulgaria.com/bulgarian_flag.html |title=Understanding the Bulgarian Flag |publisher=Information Bulgaria |accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Constitution of Bulgaria]], adopted in 1991, describes the Bulgarian flag as follows:

{{cquote|Art. 166. The flag of the Republic of Bulgaria shall be a tricolour: white, green and red from top, placed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.bg/?page=const&amp;lng=en |title=Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria |publisher=National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A popular version of the flag, which has no official status, is also commonly known. It has the full coat of arms on the left of the flag, placed across the white and green fields only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dariknews.bg/uploads/news_images/201306/photo_verybig_1107050.jpg Unofficial flag], taken from [http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=1107050 2013 Bulgaria Summer Protests], ''Darik News'', 26 June 2013, and [https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/26026/article/width668/ff8jnhxz-1372017632.jpg unofficial flag], taken from [http://theconversation.com/protests-in-bulgaria-the-unnoticed-uprising-15442 Protests in Bulgaria: the unnoticed uprising], ''TheConversation.com'', 24 Jun 2013.

==Flag law==
According to the Law for the State Seal and National Flag of the Republic of Bulgaria, promulgated on 24 April 1998:

{{cquote|Art. 15. (1) The national flag of the Republic of Bulgaria is a national symbol which expresses the independence and sovereignty of the Bulgarian state.

(2) The national flag of the Republic of Bulgaria is tricolour: white, green and red fields, placed horizontally from the top downwards. On fixing the national flag in a vertical situation of the carrying body the colours shall be arranged from left to right - white, green, red.

(3) The national flag is of a rectangular shape. The fields of the individual colours shall be equal in size and shall be situated along the horizontal of the rectangular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.bg/?page=history&amp;lng=en&amp;hid=8 |title=Law for the State Seal and National Flag of the Republic of Bulgaria |publisher=National Assembly of the Republic |accessdate=2007-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Great Bell of Dhammazedi''' ({{lang-my|ဓမ္မစေတီခေါင်းလောင်းကြီး}} {{IPA-my|dəma̰zèdì kʰáʊɴláʊɴ dʑí|}}) is a [[bronze]] [[Bell (instrument)|bell]], believed to be the largest bell ever cast. It was cast on 5 February 1484 by order of King [[Dhammazedi]] of [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Hanthawaddy Pegu]], and was given as a present to the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] of [[Dagon Township|Dagon]] (today's [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]]).&lt;ref name=Blag&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[http://www.russianbells.com/ Blagovest Russian Church Bells]
|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In 1484, prior to the casting of the bell, King Dhammazedi's [[astrologer]] advised him to postpone the date, because it was at the astrologically [[Auspice|inauspicious]] time of the [[Draco (constellation)|Crocodile constellation]], and the resulting bell would not produce any sound. After the bell was completed, it reportedly gave an unpleasant sound.&lt;ref name=Blag /&gt;

According to texts of the time, the bell was cast of 180,000 [[Burmese units of measurement#Mass|viss]] (294&amp;nbsp;t) of metal which included [[silver]] and [[gold]], as well as [[copper]] and [[tin]]. The bell was said to be twelve [[cubit]]s high and eight cubits wide.&lt;ref name=MMnet /&gt;

In 1583, [[Gasparo Balbi]], a [[Venice|Venetian]] gem merchant, visited ancient Dagon and the Shwedagon Pagoda. He wrote in his diary about the King Dhammazedi Bell. His description of the Great Bell said that it had writing engraved from top to bottom around its circumference that he could not decipher at that time:{{quote|"I found in a faire hall a very large bell which we measured, and found to be seven paces and three hand breadths and it is full of letters from the top to the bottom but there was no Nation that could understand them."&lt;ref name=MMnet /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64288.pdf|title=

==Theft from Shwedagon Pagoda==
European explorers and merchants began to make contacts in [[Lower Burma]] in the early 16th century. [[Philip de Brito|Filipe de Brito e Nicote]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] warlord and [[mercenary]] known as ''Nga Zinka'' to the Burmese, arrived in Lower Burma sometime in the 1590s. At that time, [[Thanlyin|Syriam]] (now known as Thanlyin) was the most important seaport in the Burmese [[Taungoo Dynasty|Kingdom of Taungoo]].

In 1599, de Brito led an [[Rakhine people|Arakanese]] force which sacked Syriam and [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (now known as Bago), the capital of Lower Burma. The King of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] appointed de Brito as governor of Syriam. By 1600, de Brito had extended his power across the [[Bago River]] to Dagon and the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name=MMnet /&gt; De Brito declared independence from the Arakanese king in 1603 and established Portuguese rule under [[Aires de Saldanha]], [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India]].

In 1608 De Brito and his men removed the Dhammazedi bell from the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] and rolled it down [[Singuttara Hill]] to a raft on the [[Pazundaung Creek]]. From here, the bell was hauled by elephants to the Bago River. The bell and raft were lashed to de Brito's flagship for the journey across the river to Syriam, to be melted down and made into ships' cannons.&lt;ref name=MMnet /&gt; The load proved to be too heavy however: at the confluence of the Bago and [[Yangon River]]s, off what is now known as Monkey Point, the raft broke up and the bell went to the bottom, taking de Brito's ship with it.&lt;ref name=MMnet /&gt;

Burmese forces under King [[Anaukpetlun]] recaptured Syriam in September 1613. De Brito was executed by [[impalement]] on a wooden stake.&lt;ref name=Lach1993&gt;{{cite book

Many people have tried to save the bell, thus far without success. Professional deep sea diver, James Blunt, has made 115 dives to find the bell, using [[sonar]] images of objects in the area for guidance.&lt;ref name=MMnet&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Making it even harder to find is the fact that there are also 3 shipwrecks in the area. The water is muddy and visibility is extremely poor under the surface. The Dhammazedi Bell is thought to be buried in {{convert|25|ft|m}} of mud. The great Bell rests between the wrecks of two [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[East Indiaman]] ships: ''Komine'' and ''[[Koning David (1653)|Koning David]]'', along with small pieces of De Brito's [[galleon]].

In 2000, the Burmese government asked an English marine scientist named Mike Hatcher and his team to raise the bell; they wanted to see it restored to the Pagoda. Hatcher agreed to undertake the project, which has involvement from Japanese, Australian and American companies. [[Richard Gere]] is involved in raising funds.

The project is not without its opponents: Some pro-democracy campaigners say the salvage operation might be misconstrued as an endorsement by the international community of Myanmar's military dictatorship, and should wait until talks with the regime have progressed or until such time as a democratic government is in place.

One of seven salvage projects forecast for Mike Hatcher and his team in 2001, Mike's team was slated to begin the search for the precise location of the Dhammazedi Bell in March that year. After a flurry of excitement stirred up by BBC's announcement of the project, however, it apparently did not get off the ground, perhaps due to complications involved in his discovery in June 2000 of a huge sunken wreck in Indonesian waters, with the largest collection of porcelain ever found.

If the project ever does go forward, divers will use some combination of sub-bottom profilers, personal mounted sonar, [[night vision device]]s, and [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulphate]] detectors to locate the bell (since the mud around all that bronze would be expected to have a high concentration of copper sulphate). About nine months after the survey they expect to lift the bell from the river. To do this, they will have to build a small version of a [[North Sea oil]] platform in the muddy rapids of the confluence of two rivers, and assemble a large crane to lift the bell out of the water. Once it is lifted, they will construct a railway to transport it uphill about half a mile to the Shwedagon Pagoda. This final operation will take about four months.

In July 2010, the ''[[Myanmar Times]]'' reported an Australian documentary filmmaker and explorer [[Damien Lay (Director)|Damien Lay]] to be another foreigner who had decided to take it up as his new project.  Lay and his team, conducted extensive side scan sonar surveys and diving operations, covering approximately four square kilometers of river floor in the area where it was believed the bell may be located. Lay and his team, identified and confirmed the presence of fourteen shipwrecks in the area where the bell is believed to be located. Lay and his team identified two significant targets and acquired sonar imagery of both the bell and the galleon ship. Both targets are visible to sonar and resting on the sea floor. The location of these targets has not been released. Both targets are well outside the area where the bell was previously thought to be. Lay had stated that the location of the bell was not where most people thought, that the myths and legends surrounding the location of the bell was not supported by evidence and that the location of the bell had been significantly overlooked by the misinterpretation of the history. "The location of the bell was quite surprising", Lay said.

Lay had conducted the bell search as part of the Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition, an ongoing operation privately funded operation conducted over the past eight years by Lay. The bell search was conducted as return to gesture to people and Government of Myanmar for their assistance and support in allowing Lay to search for and recover the wreckage of the ''Lady Southern Cross'' and remains of Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and John Thompson "Tommy" Pethybridge, who disappeared off the coast of Myanmar on November 8, 1935.

Previous attempts to locate the bell, by both domestic and foreign teams since 1987, either failed or did not materialize. Some treasures from the Shwedagon, part of the loot, are also believed to be there guarded by [[Nats (spirits), outer|''nat'' spirits]], and some locals have claimed to have sighted the bell surfacing on a full moon night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/531/news013.html|title=

At the end of June 2012, the Historical Research Department of the Ministry of Culture and SD Mark International LLP Co of [[Singapore]] held a workshop in Yangon for a renewed attempt with the Singaporean firm pledging USD 10 million for the non-profit project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/culture/2012-07/01/c_131688023.htm?|title=Myanmar vows to accomplish mission on salvaging ancient bell|author=Feng Yingqiu|date=July 1, 2012|publisher=''[[Xinhua News Agency]]''|accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, searcher San Linn claimed that the bell has been found and that preparations were being made for salvaging it and bringing it to land shortly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7341:search-team-confirms-fabled-great-bell-of-dhammazedi-discovered&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384 |title=Great Bell of Dhammazedi located, search team claims. |date=August 27, 2014 |work=Eleven |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903054209/http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7341%3Asearch-team-confirms-fabled-great-bell-of-dhammazedi-discovered&amp;catid=44%3Anational&amp;Itemid=384 |archive-date=September 3, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims were found to be false, and searches for the bell continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/nay-pyi-taw/12958-the-bell-tolls-for-a-new-search-team.html|title=New team resumes search for bell|last=Times|first=The Myanmar|website=www.mmtimes.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''hiragasy'' (''hira'': song; ''gasy'': Malagasy) is a [[music of Madagascar|musical tradition in Madagascar]] and particularly among the [[Merina]] ethnic group of the Highland regions around the capital of [[Antananarivo]]. 
The '''hiragasy''' is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and ''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]'' oratory performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes.

==Origins and history==
[[File:HiragasyAmpefy.JPG|350px|thumb|right|Hiragasy performance near Ampefy, Madagascar, in July 2008.]]
The tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince [[Andrianampoinimerina]] first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches (''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]''); these troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances.  The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval.&lt;ref name = Mauro&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mauro | first = Didier | title = Madagascar, l'opéra du peuple: anthropologie d'un fait social total: l'art Hira Gasy entre tradition et rébellion | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-2-84586-019-3|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.&lt;ref name = Edkvist&gt;{{Cite book | last =

After independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands.  Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning.  While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar [[Rossy (musician)|Rossy]] authored his 1995 song "Lera."  The song was critical of the [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment.&lt;ref name = Mauro/&gt; The most famous troupe is [[Ramilison Besigara|Ramilison Fenoarivo]], Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President [[Didier Ratsiraka]].

==Structure and performance==
The performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar.  Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]] cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the [[list of Malagasy monarchs|Imperial period]]); and which instruments are used.  Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned.  Instead, the most common instruments are [[violin]]s, [[trumpet]]s, and [[snare drum|snare]] and [[bass drum]]s; the [[sodina]], [[accordion]], [[kabosy]] or [[clarinet]] may occasionally make an appearance.

Hiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]].  &lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' '''The Sasitehaka''': Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm.  The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary)''':  One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle.  He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (''indray miditra'') of the show through ''kabary'' - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating [[ohabolana]] (proverbs).   &lt;br /&gt;
'''3. The Renihira (Queen Song)''': The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them.  This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions.  &lt;br /&gt;
'''4. The Dihy (Dance):''' The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes.  A [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]] (''kabarindihy'') is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it.  There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed.  The true ''Dihy'' is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts.  The ''Tsikandihy'' or ''Dihy Irery'' is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer.  The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.&lt;br /&gt;
'''5. The Zanakira or Vakodrazana''':  A short performance lasting approximately 20 minutes that concludes the spectacle.&lt;ref name = Jourde&gt;{{Cite book | last = Raison-Jourde | first = Françoise | title = Bible et pouvoir à Madagascar au XIXe siècle | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 1991 | pages = 714–732 | isbn = 978-2-86537-317-8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2G5SZ0XqM48C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate = March 27, 2011 | language = French}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

When two or more troupes are competing, each troupe takes its turn at each stage before all proceed to the next stage of the performance.  The troupes may all complete the entire cycle (this first round is termed the Vakisehatra) before repeating the entire process in a second round with a new set of themes (the second round being known as the Adi-Kiha) before all conclude with the Vakodrazana.  In these competitive performances, troupes may have as many as three or more themes to explore and the competition may last from early morning until nightfall.

'''''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''''' is a 1989 American [[Comic science fiction|comic science fiction]] film. The directorial debut of [[Joe Johnston]] and produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], it tells the story of an inventor who accidentally shrinks his and his next door neighbor's kids to a quarter of an inch with his electromagnetic shrinking machine and accidentally throws them out with the trash, where they must venture into their backyard to return home while fending off insects and other obstacles.

[[Rick Moranis]] stars as Wayne Szalinski, the inventor who accidentally shrinks his kids, Amy ([[Amy O'Neill]]) and Nick ([[Robert Oliveri]]). [[Marcia Strassman]] portrays his wife, Diane, to whom he delivers the titular line. [[Matt Frewer]], [[Kristine Sutherland]], [[Thomas Wilson Brown]], and [[Jared Rushton]] star as Russ, Mae, Russ Jr., and Ron Thompson, the Szalinskis' next door neighbors.

The film became an unexpected box office success, grossing in excess of $222 million worldwide, and became the [[1989 in film|highest-grossing live-action Disney film ever]], a record it held for five years. It was met with positive reviews from both critics and audiences, who praised the story, visuals and innovation. Its success spawned two sequels ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'' in 1992 and the direct-to-video ''[[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves]]'' in 1997, which both received mixed critical reception, as well as leading to the creation of a [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show|TV show]] that ran from 1997 to 2000.

==Plot==
Scientist and [[Invention|inventor]] Wayne Szalinski lives in his suburban home attempting to perfect a ray gun capable of [[Resizing (fiction)|shrinking]] objects, but it keeps blowing up the apples he uses as test subjects instead. After an argument between him and his wife, Diane, she spent the previous night with her mother and is currently at work, worrying their daughter, Amy, and son, Nick, who has inherited Wayne's inventive ingenuity and intelligence. Their next door neighbors, the Thompsons, are getting ready for a fishing trip, but their oldest son, Russ Jr., is less than enthusiastic, as his and Russ' interests often clash, resulting in him feeling belittled, and he is more interested in meeting Amy than spending the weekend camping. Their younger son, Ron, however, is enthusiastic, though his relationship with Russ is strained when he inadvertently sets off a booby trap in the yard.

Wayne instructs Amy and Nick to clean the house in preparation for Diane's return before leaving for his conference. Nick is assigned to mow the lawn, but he makes a deal to let his friend, Tommy Pervis, do it with the remote-controlled lawnmower, but he (Tommy) has to leave and promises to do it later. Later, Ron accidentally hits his baseball through the Szalinskis' attic window, which inadvertently activates the machine and blocks its targeting laser. Caught by Russ Jr., he is made to confess to Amy and Nick, and Amy has Nick take Ron to retrieve the ball and pay for the window. They come upon the machine and are hit by its beam, thus shrinking them. 

At his conference, Wayne is laughed at for failing to provide proof of his shrinking machine and leaves in frustration, while back at home Amy and Russ Jr. go to check on Ron and Nick and are shrunk by the ray as well. When Wayne returns home, they try to get his attention, but their voices are too small and he is unable to hear them. Frustrated by his day and the broken window he discovers, he takes it out on the machine, damaging it and nearly crushing the kids with the fragments. He then sweeps the debris (and the kids) into a dust pan and takes them out in a trash bag. They escape from it, but are forced to cross the uncut yard's wilderness to get back to the house. 

Meanwhile, Diane returns home and she and Wayne make up, but they soon grow concerned about Amy and Nick. While trying to summon their dog, Quark, Nick falls into a flower, he and Russ Jr. are carried away by a pollen picking [[honey bee]], and are nearly killed by Wayne as he tries to swat it with a baseball bat, causing it to crash land. Wayne realizes that a baseball was what caused the attic window to break since Nick doesn't play sports. Once there, he realizes what happened to the kids; afraid to step on the lawn, he uses stilts to search for them and accidentally activates the sprinklers, which causes chaotic torrents to come down on them. Amy nearly drowns when she is knocked into a pool of mud, but Russ Jr. saves her with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. 

Meanwhile, Wayne arranges a sling to hover over the lawn and search for the kids. Next door, Russ and Mae are forced to call off their trip because their sons haven't returned yet, and they call the police to report them missing. Wayne tells Diane about what happened to the kids, and she joins in the search after a short panic attack. Eventually, she convinces Wayne to tell Russ and Mae, who are extremely skeptical. Russ angrily threatens Wayne, but leaves his porch light on just in case.

Soon, the kids' hunger is saved by one of Nick's oatmeal creme cookies, but their meal is interrupted by an [[ant]] scouting it. Ron decides to tame it in order to take them home. Soon they grow attached to "Antie" and try to set him free, but he instead decides to follow Ron like a loyal pet. The kids find a [[Lego]] to camp in for the night, and after a heartfelt conversation about their feelings for each other, Russ Jr. and Amy kiss. However, they are attacked by a [[scorpion]], which traps Ron in the Lego. Nick tells the others to hurry. Antie comes to rescue Ron, but is fatally stung before the kids unite and wound the scorpion, driving it off.

The next morning, Tommy returns to mow the lawn. Nick recognizes the danger and they run, seeking shelter in an [[earthworm]] burrow; Wayne and Diane stop Tommy just in time to save the kids, who are blown out of the burrow by the lawnmower's blades. Quark chances upon them, and while riding him into the house, Nick loses his grip and falls into Wayne's bowl of [[Cheerios]]; he is nearly eaten before Quark bites Wayne in the ankle, making him aware of Nick and the others' presence.

Back in the attic, the kids make Wayne realize that the laser was generating too much heat, causing things to blow up, until it was blocked by the baseball. He corrects the mistake, and Russ volunteers as a subject for a successful test. The kids are then returned to their normal sizes and reunited with their parents. Months later, at [[Thanksgiving]], the Szalinskis and Thompsons, now close friends, are toasting over an enlarged turkey. Russ Jr. and Amy are apparently dating now, while Ron and Nick are friends, and Quark is eating from an enlarged [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]] bone. Nick finally gets a joke that Russ Jr. told him about learning CPR in [[French kiss|"French" class]], at which he laughs.

==Production==
The project was originally brought to [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]] by [[Stuart Gordon]] and [[Brian Yuzna]]. Gordon was hired to direct the film and Yuzna to produce. The film was written as ''Teeny Weenies'' by [[Stuart Gordon]], [[Ed Naha]], and [[Brian Yuzna]]. [[Tom Schulman]] was later added as a screenwriter. Gordon originally prepped the film but had to drop out as director shortly before filming began due to illness. [[Joe Johnston]] was brought in to replace him.

As ''Teeny Weenies'' seemed to appeal more to a child demographic, the name was changed to ''Grounded'' to appeal to a more mature audience. That name was later rejected in favour of ''The Big Backyard''. 
''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'', a line of dialogue from the film, ultimately became its title.

The film was heavily influenced by '50s fare such as ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQgaJ1MZFg
|title=The Making of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'
|year=1989
|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Judy Taylor, Mike Fenton, and Lynda Gordon were the casting directors. Before [[Rick Moranis]] was cast as Wayne Szalinski, the script was written with [[Chevy Chase]] in mind because of his popularity in ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''. He was filming the second sequel, ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', and was too busy to portray Wayne.

[[John Candy]] was also considered for the role of Wayne. He declined, but suggested to director [[Joe Johnston]] that his friend, (and costar of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]''), [[Rick Moranis]], would be a good choice. [[Marcia Strassman]] portrays Wayne's wife, Diane, who is having marital troubles with him.

[[Matt Frewer]] and [[Kristine Sutherland]] portray Russ and Mae Thompson, the Szalinskis' next door neighbors and parents of Russ Jr. and Ron. Russ is very demanding of Russ Jr. and can't understand why he isn't more interested in [[Masculinity|masculine]] things such as football and fishing (until the end of the film, when he learns to accept him for who he is). He is dimwitted and clumsy and secretly takes to cigarettes when he is nervous or scared. On the other hand, Mae is a very nice person and friendly with the Szalinskis.

The film needed four teenagers to play the leads. Russ Jr., portrayed by [[Thomas Wilson Brown]] seems to be interested in Amy, and less in football, while Ron, [[Jared Rushton]], appears to be more straightforward and a [[Bullying|bully]] toward Nick, though he warms towards him. Rushton has quoted that he took the role after thinking that the script was "appealing" and he thought his character had progressed throughout the film with his personality.

[[Amy O'Neill]] and [[Robert Oliveri]] were cast as Amy and Nick Szalinski, Wayne and Diane's kids. Oliveri commented that he was in awe about watching his stunt double do his stunts. He later starred as Kevin Boggs in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''. O'Neill thought the film was a fun experience and that doing off-set activities, such as swimming or playing cards, was fun to do with the other younger cast members. She accepted the role because it was a "Disney movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grHP-67CkXM&amp;feature=related

|year=1986
|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direction===
[[Joe Johnston]] was selected to direct the film for his directorial debut, having been mostly working on films as an effects illustrator and art director. It was filmed at the backlot of [[Churubusco Studios]] in [[Mexico City]]. [[Gregg Fonseca]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284668/ Sometimes referred as "Greg Fonseca"].&lt;/ref&gt; was the production designer and was in charge of managing several different sets for the scenes in it.

Some filming took place in and around [[Beverly Hills, California]]. In the scene where Diane walks out of the mall to the pay phone, a sign says "Beverly Hills Mall". It is unclear if the whole film takes place there or just that scene, as this contradicts one assertion in the [[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid|sequel]] that Wayne was originally from, and thus the Szalinski residence depicted in this one is in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].

Special effects were heavily used for the film, such as the electronically controlled ants and bees. For the most part, the production team tried to use practical effects that would work in camera. For the scene where Wayne lands in the Thompsons' pool, Moranis jumped off a flying board in the form of a teeter-totter on a swing set. A stuntman pushed the board, sending him flying through the air and landing on a mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy85AUFF9kE&amp;NR=1
|title=The Making of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Part 2
|year=1986
|accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous storyboards were used for the film, particularly in the sprinkler and bee scenes.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Scale models were also used for the bee scene, with miniature Russ Jr. and Nick plastic figures attached. [[Forced perspective]] was used in the giant cookie scene, to make it seem bigger.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; The child actors were strapped in for the scene with the broom. The bristles were actually pieces of foam that were carved and tied to a rig system.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened on June 23, 1989, in 1,498 theatres. It opened at #2 on opening night, behind ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', with a total of $14,262,961. It earned $130,724,172 domestic and $92,000,000 overseas, earning a grand total of $222,724,172.&lt;ref name="box office" /&gt; Attached to it was Disney and Amblin Entertainment's first [[Roger Rabbit]] short, ''[[Roger Rabbit short films#Tummy Trouble|Tummy Trouble]]'', executively produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], produced by [[Don Hahn]], directed by [[Rob Minkoff]], and also composed by [[James Horner]].

===Critical reception===
The film has earned a 75% "fresh" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 32 reviews. Caryn James, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', gave a positive review, saying: "As sweet, funny, and straightforward as its title." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave another positive review stating, "[It's] in the best tradition of Disney -- and even better than that, because it is not so juvenile that adults won't be thoroughly entertained." A rare negative review came from [[Roger Ebert]], of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'', who stated: "The special effects are all there, nicely in place, and the production values are sound, but the movie is dead in the water."

===Awards===
[[James Horner]] won an [[ASCAP Award]] for Top Box Office Films and was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]]. The film was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. [[Thomas Wilson Brown]], [[Jared Rushton]], [[Robert Oliveri]] and the Special Effects Crew were also nominated for a Saturn Award. The Special Effects Crew won a [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Special Visual Effects. [[Amy O'Neill]] and Jared Rushton were each nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] and director [[Joe Johnston]] was nominated for a [[Fantasporto]] Award.

The film was presented in the ''100 Greatest Family Films'', in which Amy O'Neill and Thomas Wilson Brown talked about it for [[MTV]].

After years without releasing [[James Horner]]'s soundtrack to the film, [[Intrada Records]] released it on March 6, 2009. The song that Amy dances to in the kitchen is "Turn It Up" by [[Nick Kamen]], written by Jeffrey Pescetto and Patrick DeRemer.

The soundtrack was limited to a 3,000 copies release. Horner's main title music incorporates cues from the score by [[Nino Rota]] from [[Federico Fellini]]'s film ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973)  and [[Raymond Scott]]’s piece "[[Powerhouse (song)|Powerhouse B]]" (1937), the latter often referenced in [[Carl Stalling]]’s [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon scores. Scott's piece was used without payment or credit, leading his estate to threaten legal action against Disney. Disney paid an undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement and changed the film's cue sheets to credit Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://raymondscott.com/#913/custom_plain

With 15 tracks, Horner produced the record with longtime engineer Simon Rhodes while it was originally performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

==Sequels==
In 1992, Disney released the first sequel, ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'', with Moranis, Strassman, O'Neill, and Oliveri reprising their roles as Wayne, Diane, Amy and Nick Szalinski. As the title suggests, Wayne succeeds in [[Enlargement (in fiction)|enlarging]] his two-year-old son, Adam, to gigantic proportions as one of his size-changing experiments goes awry.

A [[3D film|three-dimensional film]] called ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience]]'' complete with physical effects such as wind and water was created as an attraction at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] in 1994, and later [[Disneyland]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]]. It is a mock award show by "The Imagination Institute" that is intended to honor Wayne as "Inventor of the Year". Instead, the audience is "shrunk" and threatened by Quark, Gigabyte (Nick's pet [[Pythonidae|python]]), Diane, and even Adam, among other thrills. It reprises most of the original cast and adds [[Eric Idle]] as the host of the award show. It is currently closed at all of its locations due to the return of ''[[Captain EO]]'' (which was originally replaced by it in 1994). Currently no return dates have been confirmed.

In 1997, Disney produced the second sequel, ''[[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves]]'', as a direct to video release. [[Rick Moranis]] was the only returning actor from the previous films who reprised his role, with Amy and Nick having gone off to college and Quark's disappearance never being explained. Many new characters were added such as Wayne's brother, Gordon, and his family. This time, the parents are shrunk and need to be rescued by their kids.

The last incarnation of the franchise was the television program ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show]]''. [[Peter Scolari]] took over as Wayne and Nick and Amy both returned as characters, roughly the same age as in the original film, and played by new actors. Its plots involved other wacky Szalinski inventions (rarely the shrinking machine) that do not work quite as expected and land the family in some type of humorous mixed-up adventure.

==Remake==
In February 2018, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' revealed that remakes of several films are in development as exclusive content for [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' [[Disney streaming service|upcoming streaming service]]; with one of those named in the announcement being this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/disney-planning-muppets-reboot-streaming-service-1086800 |title=Disney Planning Another 'Muppets' Reboot for Its Streaming Service (Exclusive) |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 21, 2018 |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5890">The '''Imperial Academy''' was the [[national academy]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], first established by the [[Ministry of Education (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Education and Fine Arts]] in 1942.&lt;ref name=Janko&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hordofa Janko|first1=Kebede|title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha|page=410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X38lxaUjm1MC&amp;pg=PA411|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was tasked with preserving the "traditional genius" of the country; among other things, the native [[Ethiopic script]] and the literary and scholarly tradition it enabled, as well as the "promotion of research in languages and fine arts".&lt;ref name=Janko /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fishman /&gt;

In 1956 [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie]] promulgated a decree chartering the Academy as an independent organisation.&lt;ref name=Fishman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fishman|first1=Joshua A.|title=In Praise of the Beloved Language. A Comparative View of Positive Ethnolinguistic Consciousness|date=2011|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-11-081324-1|pages=186–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy, as a single body, eventually ceased to operate during the time of the [[Derg]] regime in the 1980s, although some of its constituent organizations have persisted- directly or indirectly- to the present.&lt;ref name=Fishman /&gt;

==Constituent bodies==
At the time of its foundation, the Academy comprised three subsidiary groups: The '''Language and Literature Council''', the '''Fine Arts Council''', and the '''Science and Technology Council'''.&lt;ref name=Janko /&gt;  

===Language and Literature===
The role of the Language and Literature Council, after its establishment, over time shifted from the academic study of languages and literature towards that of a [[Language regulator]] (i.e. the ''[[Académie française]]'' or the ''[[Real Academia Española]]'') for the [[Amharic language]]. In light of this, it was reorganised into the '''National Academy of the Amharic Language''' in 1972. It was charged with setting the national [[language policy]] as to "foster the growth of the Amharic language" and to "encourage the development of its literature".&lt;ref name=Janko /&gt; To this end, it designed a programme of [[spelling reform]] (albeit unimplemented), published compilations of Ethiopian proverbs (in multiple language), volumes of translated [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez-language]] poetry, technical and bi-lingual dictionaries, and multiple [[Professional journal|professional journals]].&lt;ref name=Janko /&gt;

After the overthrow of the imperial government by the left-wing ''[[Derg]]'' (Coordinating Council of the Armed Forces) in the [[1974 Ethiopian coup d'état|1974 coup d'état]] and the installation of a [[Socialist state|socialist]] [[military government]], the Language Academy was seen as a [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] vehicle of [[linguistic imperialism]], and one that favoured of the tongue of the ruling elite at the expense of the [[Languages of Ethiopia|country's eight dozen other languages and dialects]]. As a result, in 1979 it was transformed into the '''Academy of Ethiopian Languages''' under the [[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]], whose regulatory remit extended to all Ethiopian languages.&lt;ref name=AELCWebsite&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Ethiopian Languages and Cultures|url=http://www.aau.edu.et/aelc/|website=Addis Ababa University|publisher=[[Addis Ababa University]]|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had four academic subcommittees: lexicography, linguistics, terminology, and literature- both written and oral (the inclusion of the latter signifying a significant break with the prior emphasis on Ge'ez and its literary tradition).&lt;ref name=Janko /&gt;

It continued to operate after the fall of the military regime as an independent organization until 1997, when it became a research body of [[Addis Ababa University]], known as the '''Ethiopian Languages Research Centre''' until 2010, when it was restored to the status of an autonomous academy and language regulator and renamed as '''Academy of Ethiopian Languages and Cultures'''.&lt;ref name=AELCWebsite /&gt; In 2013, however, the entirely separate [[Regional Somali Language Academy]], based in [[Djibouti City|Djibouti]], was set up by multinational agreement- including Ethiopia- as the international regulator of [[Somali language]].

===Fine Arts===
The Fine Arts Council, later the '''Academy of Fine Arts''', counted, among others, [[Baalu Girma]], [[Afewerk Tekle]], and [[Ashenafi Kebede]] as members. It had ceased to operate by the time of the fall of the Derg in 1991.

===Science and Technology===
The Science and Technology Council, later the '''Academy of Sciences and Technology''', became defunct some time during the rule of the Derg. However, it can be considered to have a partial successor in the form of the [[Ethiopian Academy of Sciences]], which was founded in 2010 following the efforts of academics, such as the historian [[:fr:Bahru Zewde|Bahru Zewde]], over several years to establish such an organisation.&lt;ref name=EAS&gt;{{cite web|title=History - About us|url=http://www.eas-et.org/new/index.php/about-us/history|website=Ethiopian Academy of Sciences|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was declared as to "advance the development of all the sciences, including the natural sciences, mathematics, the health sciences, agricultural sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities, fine arts and letters, making its envisioned scope closer to that of the entire Imperial Academy than just the sciences.&lt;ref name=EAS /&gt;

'''[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s influence and reception''' varied widely and may be roughly divided into various chronological periods. Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early.

==Overview==
Beginning while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by [[mental illness]], many Germans discovered his appeals for greater heroic individualism and personality development in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', but responded to those appeals in diverging ways. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890. Nietzsche's anarchistic influence was particularly strong in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;O. Ewald, "German Philosophy in 1907", in The Philosophical Review, Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400-426; T. A. Riley, "Anti-Statism in German Literature, as Exemplified by the Work of John Henry Mackay", in PMLA, Vol. 62, No. 3, Sep., 1947, pp. 828-843; C. E. Forth, "Nietzsche, Decadence, and Regeneration in France, 1891-95", in Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 54, No. 1, Jan., 1993, pp. 97-117&lt;/ref&gt; 

By World War I, German soldiers even received copies of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' as gifts during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Steven E. Aschheim notes that "[a]bout 150,000 copies of a specially durable wartime ''Zarathustra'' were distributed to the troops" in ''The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany, 1890-1990'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1992, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dreyfus Affair]] provides another example of his reception: the French anti-semitic Right labelled the Jewish and leftist intellectuals who defended [[Alfred Dreyfus]] as "Nietzscheans".&lt;ref&gt;Schrift, A.D. (1995). ''Nietzsche's French Legacy: A Genealogy of Poststructuralism''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-91147-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Such seemingly paradoxical acceptance by diametrically opposed camps is typical of the history of the reception of Nietzsche's thought. In the context of the rise of French fascism, one researcher notes, "Although, as much recent work has stressed, Nietzsche had an important impact on "leftist" French ideology and theory, this should not obscure the fact that his work was also crucial to the right and to the neither right nor left fusions of developing French fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Frese Witt, ''The Search for Modern Tragedy'', Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, as [[Ernst Nolte]] proposed, [[Charles Maurras|Maurrassian]] ideology of "aristocratic revolt against egalitarian-utopian 'transcendence'" (transcendence being Nolte's term for the ontological absence of theodic center justifying modern "emancipation culture"), the interrelation between Nietzschean ideology and [[proto-fascism]] offer extensive space for criticism and the Nietzschean ambiance pervading French ideological fermentation of extremism in time birthing formal fascism, is unavoidable.

Many political leaders of the 20th century were at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche's ideas. However, it is not always possible to determine whether or not they actually read his work. Regarding Hitler, for example, there is a debate. Some authors claim that he probably never read Nietzsche, or that if he did, his reading was not extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver Santaniello, ''Nietzsche, God, and the Jews'', SUNY Press, 1994, p. 41: "Hitler probably never read a word of Nietzsche"; Berel Lang, ''Post-Holocaust: Interpretation, Misinterpretation, and the Claims of History'', Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 162: "Arguably, Hitler himself never read a word of Nietzsche; certainly, if he did read him, it was not extensively"; Jacob Golomb, ''Nietzsche and Jewish Culture'', Routledge, 1997, p. 9: "To be sure, it is almost certain that Hitler either never read Nietzsche directly or read very little."; Andrew C. Janos, ''East Central Europe in the Modern World'', Stanford University Press, 2002, p. 184: "By all indications, Hitler never read Nietzsche. Neither ''Mein Kampf'' nor Hitler's ''Table Talk'' (''Tischgesprache'') mentions his name. In all fairness, one may say Hitler did read Nietzsche in some capacity, but not in a scholarly fashion. In any case, Nietzschean ideas reached him through the filter of Alfred Rosenberg's ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'', and, more simply, through what was coffeehouse ''Quatsch'' in Vienna and Munich. This at least is the impression he gives in his published conversations with Dietrich Eckart."&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler more than likely became familiar with Nietzsche quotes during his time in Vienna when quotes by Nietzsche were frequently published in pan-German newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, others point to a quote in ''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]'', where the dictator mentioned Nietzsche when he spoke about what he called "great men", as an indication that Hitler may have been familiarized with Nietzsche's work.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb &amp; Robert S. Wistrich (2002), "''Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism? On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy''", [[Princeton University]] Press, 2007. Retrieved on June 8th, 2013. "In ''Hitler's Table Talk'', [Hitler] refers to Nietzsche, saying: "''In our part of the world, the Jews would have immediately eliminated [[Schopenhauer]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. If the [[Bolsheviks]] had dominion over us for 200 years, what works of our past would be handed on to posterity? Our great men would fall into oblivion, or else they'd be presented to future generations as criminals and bandits.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors like Melendez (2001) point out to the parallels between Hitler's and Nietzsche's titanic anti-[[egalitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Meléndez Germán (2001), ''Nietzsche en perspectiva'', [[National University of Colombia|Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], pages 255-258. Chapter "Poder y Anti-igualitarismo en Nietzsche y Hitler", by [[Ernst Tugendhat]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea of the "[[übermensch]]",&lt;ref&gt;Star Alexander, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/american-nietzsche-by-jennifer-ratner-rosenhagen-book-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 January 13, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; a term which was frequently used by Hitler and Mussolini to refer to the so-called "[[Aryan race]]", or rather, its projected future after fascist engineering.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=A Contemporary Introduction to Sociology |edition=2nd |year=2011|publisher=Paradigm|isbn=978-1-61205-029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alfred Rosenberg]], an influential Nazi ideologist, also delivered a speech in which he related [[National Socialism]] to Nietzsche's ideology.&lt;ref name="Alexander 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg is quoted "''In a truly historical sense, the movement eclipses the rest of the world, much as Nietzsche, the individual, eclipsed the powers of his times.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, despite Nietzsche's hostility towards anti-semitism and nationalism, the [[Nazi]]s made very selective use of Nietzsche's philosophy, and eventually, this association caused Nietzsche's reputation to suffer following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Arévalo Martínez]] (1943), ''Nietzsche el conquistador: (la doctrina que engendró la segunda guerra mundial.)'', Tipografía Sánchez &amp; De Guise, 170 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it is known that [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] early on heard lectures about Nietzsche, [[Vilfred Pareto]], and others in ideologically forming fascism. A girlfriend of Mussolini, [[Margherita Sarfatti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarfatti|title=The Life of Benito Mussolini|isbn=1-4179-3962-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was Jewish, relates that Nietzsche virtually was the transforming factor in Mussolini's "conversion" from hard socialism to spiritualistic, ascetic fascism,&lt;ref&gt;Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi, ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy'', University of California Press, 2000, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;: "In 1908 he presented his conception of the superman's role in modern society in a writing on Nietzsche entitled, "The Philosophy of Force."

Nietzsche's influence on [[Continental philosophy]] increased dramatically after the Second World War.

== Nietzsche and anarchism ==
{{main|Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche}}
During the 19th century, Nietzsche was frequently associated with [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movements, in spite of the fact that in his writings he definitely holds a negative view of [[egalitarian]] anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (6.2:126), to only cite one volcanic attack against anarchists of modernity, he refers to "anarchist dogs"&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Nietzsche's ideas generated strong interest from key figures from the historical anarchist movement which began in the 1890s. According to a recent study, "[[Gustav Landauer]], [[Emma Goldman]] and others reflected on the chances offered and the dangers posed by these ideas in relation to their own politics. Heated debates over meaning, for example on the [[will to power]] or on the status of women in Nietzsche’s works, provided even the most vehement critics such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] with productive cues for developing their own theories. In recent times, a newer strand called [[post-anarchism]] has invoked Nietzsche’s ideas, while also disregarding the historical variants of Nietzschean anarchism. This calls into question the innovative potential of post-anarchism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miething|first1=Dominique|title=Anarchistische Deutungen der Philosophie Friedrich Nietzsches. Deutschland, Großbritannien, USA (1890-1947)|date=2016|publisher=Nomos|location=Baden-Baden|isbn=978-3-8487-3711-6|page=15ff.|url=https://doi.org/10.5771/9783845280127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hypothesize on certain grounds Nietzsche's violent stance against anarchism may (at least partially) be the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nietzsche's possible reading, knowledge, and plagiarism of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1845) has been a contentious question and frequently discussed for more than a century now." Thomas H. Brobjer, "Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question", in ''[[The Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'', Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109-114&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, no plagiarism has been detected at all, but a probable concealed influence in his formative years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html |first=Bernd A |last=Laska |title=Nietzsche's initial crisis |journal=Germanic Notes and Reviews |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=109–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer Sunshine writes "There were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of "herds"; his anti-Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the state on cultural production; his desire for an "overman" — that is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, "Yes" to the self-creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the "transvaluation of values" as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"&gt;[http://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/ Spencer Sunshine, "Nietzsche and the Anarchists"]&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking in Nietzsche is the anarchist utopian-egalitarian belief that every soul is capable of epic greatness: Nietzsche's aristocratic elitism is the death-knell of any Nietzschean conventional anarchism. 

According to Sunshine: "The list is not limited to culturally oriented anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]], who gave dozens of lectures about Nietzsche and baptized him as an honorary anarchist. Pro-Nietzschean anarchists also include prominent Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]–[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] members in the 1930s such as [[Salvador Seguí]] and [[anarcha-feminist]] [[Federica Montseny]]; [[anarcho-syndicalist]] militants like [[Rudolf Rocker]]; and even the younger [[Murray Bookchin]], who cited Nietzsche's conception of the 'transvaluation of values' in support of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] project." Also in [[European individualist anarchist]] circles his influence is clear in thinker/activists such as [[Emile Armand]]&lt;ref name="armand"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html ''The Anarchism of Émile Armand'' by Emile Armand]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref name="novatore"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html ''Toward the Creative Nothing'' by [[Renzo Novatore]]]&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Also more recently in [[post-left anarchy]], Nietzsche is present in the thought of [[Hakim Bey]] and Wolfi Landstreicher.

== Nietzsche and fascism ==
{{see also|Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche's criticism of anti-Semitism and nationalism}}

The Italian and German fascist regimes were eager to lay claim to Nietzsche's ideas, and to position themselves as inspired by them. In 1932, Nietzsche's sister, [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche]], received a bouquet of roses from [[Adolf Hitler]] during a German premiere of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''100 Days'', and in 1934 Hitler personally presented her with a wreath for Nietzsche's grave carrying the words "To A Great Fighter". Also in 1934, Elisabeth gave to Hitler Nietzsche's favorite walking stick, and Hitler was photographed gazing into the eyes of a white marble bust of Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;John Rodden, ''Repainting the Little Red Schoolhouse: A History of Eastern German Education, 1945-1995'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 289&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s popular biography ''Hitler as Nobody Knows Him'' (which sold nearly a half-million copies by 1938) featured this photo with the caption reading: "The Führer before the bust of the German philosopher whose ideas have fertilized two great popular movements: the national socialist of Germany and the fascist of Italy."&lt;ref&gt;Hans D. Sluga, ''Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany'', Harvard University Press, 1993, p 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche was no less popular among French fascists, perhaps with more doctrinal truthfulness, as [[Robert S. Wistrich]] has pointed out

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The "fascist" Nietzsche was above all considered to be a heroic opponent of necrotic Enlightenment "rationality" and a kind of spiritual vitalist, who had glorified war and violence in an age of herd-lemming shopkeepers, inspiring the anti-Marxist revolutions of the interwar period. According to the French fascist [[Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]], it was the Nietzschean emphasis on the autotelic power of the Will that inspired the mystic voluntarism and political activism of his comrades. Such politicized readings were vehemently rejected by another French writer, the socialo-communist anarchist Georges Bataille, who in the 1930s sought to establish (in ambiguous success) the "radical incompatibility" between Nietzsche (as a thinker who abhorred mass politics) and "the fascist reactionaries." He argued that nothing was more alien to Nietzsche than the pan-Germanism, racism, militarism and anti-Semitism of the Nazis, into whose service the German philosopher had been pressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb, Robert S. Wistrich, ''Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On The Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, 2002, p 162&lt;/ref&gt; Bataille here was sharp-witted but combined half-truths without his customary dialectical finesse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], who was (with great harm to his subsequent reputation) an active member of the Nazi Party, himself noted that everyone in his day was either 'for' or 'against' Nietzsche while claiming that this thinker heard a "command to reflect on the essence of a planetary domination." Alan D. Schrift cites this passage and writes, "That Heidegger sees Nietzsche heeding a command to reflect and prepare for earthly domination is of less interest to me than his noting that everyone thinks in terms of a position for or against Nietzsche. In particular, the gesture of setting up 'Nietzsche' as a battlefield on which to take one's stand against or to enter into competition with the ideas of one's intellectual predecessors or rivals has happened quite frequently in the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift (Ed.), ''Why Nietzsche still?'', University of California Press, 2000, pp 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;

Marching in ideological warfare against the arrows from Bataille, [[Thomas Mann]], the far more centrist [[Albert Camus]] and others, the Nazi movement, despite Nietzsche' virulent hatred of both volkist-[[populism|populist]] socialist and nationalism ("national socialism"), did, in certain of its emphases, share an affinity with Nietzsche's ideas, including his ferocious attacks against [[democracy]], [[egalitarianism]], the [[communistic]]-socialistic social model, popular [[Christianity]], [[parliamentary]] government, and a number of other things. In ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' Nietzsche praised – sometimes metaphorically, other times both metaphorically and literally – the sublimity of war and warriors, and heralded an international ruling race that would become the "lords of the earth". Here Nietzsche was referring to [[pan-Europeanism]] of a Caesarist type, positively embracing Jews,{{According to whom|date=October 2017}} not a Germanic master race but a neo-imperial elite of culturally refined "redeemers" of humanity, otherwise wretched and plebeian and ugly in its mindless existence.

The Nazis appropriated, or rather received also inspiration in this case, from Nietzsche's extremely old-fashioned and semi-feudal views on women: Nietzsche despised modern feminism, along with democracy and socialism, as mere egalitarian leveling movements of nihilism. He forthrightly declared, "Man shall be trained for war and woman for the procreation of the warrior, anything else is folly"; and was indeed unified with the Nazi world-view at least in terms of the social role of women: "They belong in the kitchen and their chief role in life is to beget children for German warriors."&lt;ref&gt;William Lawrence Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', Simon and Schuster, 1960, pp 99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is one area where Nietzsche indeed did not contradict the Nazis in his politics of "aristocratic radicalism."

During the [[interbellum]] years, certain Nazis had employed a highly selective reading of Nietzsche's work to advance their ideology, notably [[Alfred Baeumler]], who strikingly omitted the fact of Nietzsche's anti-socialism and anti-nationalism (for Nietzsche, both equally contemptible mass herd movements of modernity) in his reading of ''The Will to Power''. The era of Nazi rule (1933–1945) saw Nietzsche's writings widely studied in German (and, after 1938, Austrian) schools and universities. Despite the fact that Nietzsche had expressed his disgust with plebeian-volkist anti-Semitism and supremacist German nationalism in the most forthright terms possible (e.g. he resolved "to have nothing to do with anyone involved in the perfidious race-fraud"), phrases like "the will to power" became common in Nazi circles. The wide popularity of Nietzsche among Nazis stemmed in part from the endeavors of his sister, [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], the editor of Nietzsche's work after his 1889 breakdown, and an eventual Nazi sympathizer. [[Mazzino Montinari]], while editing Nietzsche's posthumous works in the 1960s, found that Förster-Nietzsche, while editing the posthumous fragments making up ''The Will to Power'', had cut extracts, changed their order, quoted him out of context, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mazzino Montinari]], ''"La Volonté de puissance" n'existe pas'', [[Éditions de l'Éclat]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's reception among the more intellectually percipient or zealous fascists was not universally warm. For example, one "rabidly Nazi writer, Curt von Westernhagen, who announced in his book ''Nietzsche, Juden, Antijuden'' (1936) that the time had come to expose the 'defective personality of Nietzsche whose inordinate tributes for, and espousal of, Jews had caused him to depart from the Germanic principles enunciated by Meister Richard Wagner'."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb, Robert S. Wistrich, ''Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?: On The Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, 2002, p 149&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The real problem with the labelling of Nietzsche as a fascist, or worse, a Nazi, is that it ignores the fact that Nietzsche's aristocratism seeks to revive an older conception of politics, one which he locates in Greek ''agon'' which [...] has striking affinities with the philosophy of action expounded in our own time by [[Hannah Arendt]]. Once an affinity like this is appreciated, the absurdity of describing Nietzsche's political thought as 'fascist', or Nazi, becomes readily apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ansell-Pearson, ''An Introduction to Nietzsche as Political Thinker: The Perfect Nihilist'', Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Nietzsche and Zionism ==
Jacob Golomb observed, "Nietzsche's ideas were widely disseminated among and appropriated by the first Hebrew [[Zionist]] writers and leaders."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb, ''Nietzsche and Zion'', Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steven Aschheim, "Classical Zionism, that essentially secular and modernizing movement, was acutely aware of the crisis of Jewish tradition and its supporting institutions. Nietzsche was enlisted as an authority for articulating the movement's ruptured relationship with the past and a force in its drive to normalization and its activist ideal of self-creating Hebraic New Man."&lt;ref&gt;Steven E. Aschheim, ''The Nietzsche legacy in Germany, 1890-1990'', University of California Press, 1994, p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis R. Nicosia notes, "At the height of his fame between 1895 and 1902, some of Nietzsche's ideas seemed to have a particular resonance for some Zionists, including [[Theodore Herzl]]."&lt;ref&gt;Francis R. Nicosia, ''Zionism and Anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other facts that show Herzl had a serious interest in Nietzsche, at least for a time (including the fact that under his editorship the ''Neue Freie Presse'' dedicated seven consecutive issues to Nietzsche obituaries), Golomb points out that Herzl's cousin [[Raoul Auernheimer]] claimed, in a memorial tribute, that Herzl was familiar with Nietzsche and had "absorbed his style".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb, ''Nietzsche and Zion'', Cornell University Press, 2004, pp 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Gabriel Sheffer suggests that Herzl was too bourgeois and too eager to be accepted into mainstream society to be much of a (even if "aristocratic") revolutionary, and hence could not have been strongly influenced by Nietzsche, but remarks, "Some East European Jewish intellectuals, such as the writers [[Yosef Haim Brenner|Yosef Hayyim Brenner]] and [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]], followed after Herzl because they thought that Zionism offered the chance for a Nietzschean 'transvaluation of values' within Jewry".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Sheffer, ''U.S.-Israeli Relations at the Crossroads'', Routledge, 1997, p 170&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche also influenced [[Theodor Lessing]].

[[Martin Buber]] was fascinated by Nietzsche, whom he praised as a heroic figure, and he strove to introduce "a Nietzschean perspective into Zionist affairs." In 1901, Buber, who had just been appointed the editor of ''Die Welt'', the primary publication of the [[World Zionist Organization]], published a poem in ''Zarathustrastil'' ( a style reminiscent of Nietzsche's ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'') calling for the return of Jewish literature, art and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Golomb (Ed.), ''Nietzsche and Jewish Culture'', Routledge, 1997, pp 235–236&lt;/ref&gt;

However, praise for Nietzsche was not by any means universal among Zionists. [[Max Nordau]], an early Zionist orator and controversial racial anthropologist, insisted that Nietzsche had been insane since birth, and advocated "branding his disciples [...] as hysterical and imbecile."&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2007, p 158&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nietzsche, analytical psychology and psychoanalysis ==

[[Carl Jung]], the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology, recognized Nietzsche's profundity early on. "From the time Jung first became gripped by Nietzsche’s ideas as a student in Basel to his days as a leading figure in the psychoanalytic movement, Jung read, and increasingly developed, his own thought in a dialogue with the work of Nietzsche. … Untangling the exact influence of Nietzsche on Jung, however, is a complicated business. Jung never openly addressed the exact influence Nietzsche had on his own concepts, and when he did link his own ideas to Nietzsche’s, he almost never made it clear whether the idea in question was inspired by Nietzsche or whether he merely discovered the parallel at a later stage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rensma|first1=Ritske|title=Jung’s Reception of Friedrich Nietzsche|url=http://www.depthinsights.com/Depth-Insights-scholarly-ezine/e-zine-issue-3-fall-2012/jungs-reception-of-friedrich-nietzsche-a-roadmap-for-the-uninitiated-by-dr-ritske-rensma/|website=Depth Insights|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Jung held a lengthy and insightful seminar on Nietzsche's ''Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jung.freudfile.org/timeline.html Jung Timeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523020655/http://jung.freudfile.org/timeline.html |date=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Jung explained that Germans of the present day had been ''seized'' or possessed by the psychic force known in [[Germanic mythology]] as [[Wotan]], "the god of storm and frenzy, the unleasher of passions and the lust of battle"—Wotan being synonymous with Nietzsche's [[Dionysus]], Jung said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Carl Gustav|title=Essays on Contemporary Events|date=1958|publisher=Routledge Classics|location=London|isbn=0-415-27835-X|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 12th-century stick found among the [[Bryggen inscriptions|Bryggen inscriptions, Bergen, Norway]] bears a runic message by which the population called upon [[Thor]] and Wotan for help: Thor is asked to receive the reader, and Wotan to ''own'' them.&lt;ref name="MCLEOD-MEES-30"&gt;McLeod, Mees (2006:30).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nietzsche provided Jung both with the terminology (the Dionysian) and the case study (Zarathustra as an example of the Dionysian at work in the psyche) to help him put into words his thoughts about the spirit of his own age: an age confronted with an uprush of the Wotanic/Dionysian spirit in the collective unconscious. This, in a nutshell, is how Jung came to see Nietzsche, and explains why he was so fascinated by Nietzsche as a thinker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rensma|first1=Ritske|title=Jung’s Reception of Friedrich Nietzsche|url=http://www.depthinsights.com/Depth-Insights-scholarly-ezine/e-zine-issue-3-fall-2012/jungs-reception-of-friedrich-nietzsche-a-roadmap-for-the-uninitiated-by-dr-ritske-rensma/|website=Depth Insights|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche had also an important influence on [[psychotherapist]] and founder of the school of [[individual psychology]] [[Alfred Adler]]. According to [[Ernest Jones]], biographer and personal acquaintance of [[Sigmund Freud]], Freud frequently referred to Nietzsche as having "more penetrating knowledge of himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Jones also reports that Freud emphatically denied that Nietzsche's writings influenced his own psychological discoveries; in the 1890s, Freud, whose education at the University of Vienna in the 1870s had included a strong relationship with [[Franz Brentano]], his teacher in philosophy, from whom he had acquired an enthusiasm for Aristotle and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], was acutely aware of the possibility of convergence of his own ideas with those of Nietzsche and doggedly refused to read the philosopher as a result. In his excoriating — but also sympathetic — critique of psychoanalysis, ''The Psychoanalytic Movement'', [[Ernest Gellner]] depicts Nietzsche as setting out the conditions for elaborating a realistic psychology, in contrast with the eccentrically implausible Enlightenment psychology of Hume and Smith, and assesses the success of Freud and the psychoanalytic movement as in large part based upon its success in meeting this "Nietzschean minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ''The Psychoanalytic Movement. The Cunning of Unreason'', with a foreword by José Brunner, orig. 1983, Oxford: Blackwell, 2003, pp. 17ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early 20th-century thinkers ==

Early twentieth-century thinkers who read or were influenced by Nietzsche include: philosophers [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Georg Brandes]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]]; sociologists [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] and [[Max Weber]]; composers [[Richard Strauss]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Gustav Mahler]], and [[Frederick Delius]]; historians [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Fernand Braudel]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Fernand Braudel]]'s preface to ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', where he says he had been largely influenced by the Second ''[[Untimely Meditations|Untimely Meditation]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Veyne]], theologians [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Thomas J.J. Altizer]]; the occultists [[Aleister Crowley]]; and [[Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff]]. Novelists [[Franz Kafka]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[André Malraux]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[André Gide]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[August Strindberg]], [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Vladimir Bartol]]; psychologists [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Gross]], [[C. G. Jung]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Carl Rogers]], [[Rollo May]] and [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski]]; poets [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[William Butler Yeats]]; painters [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Mark Rothko]]; playwrights [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Eugene O'Neill]]; and authors [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Olaf Stapledon]], [[Menno ter Braak]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Robert E. Howard]], and [[Jack London]]. American writer [[H. L. Mencken]] avidly read and translated Nietzsche's works and has gained the sobriquet "the American Nietzsche". Mencken presented in his book on Nietzsche the "hard Nietzsche" little-known today; Nietzsche's actual, realistic philosophy of anti-egalitarian aristocratic revolution, Mencken's work standing in contrast positively to the "post-modernist" theoreticians of "linguistic schizo-analysis today", who try to turn Nietzsche into an all-American liberal without fangs. Nietzsche was declared an [[anarchist]] by [[Emma Goldman]] rather disputably, and he influenced other anarchists such as [[Guy Aldred]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Max Cafard]] and [[John Moore (anarchist)|John Moore]].

The popular conservative writer, philosopher, poet, journalist and theological apologist of Catholicism [[G. K. Chesterton]] expressed contempt for Nietzsche's ideas, deeming his philosophy basically a poison or death-wish of Western culture:

{{Quotation|I do not even think that a cosmopolitan contempt for patriotism is merely a matter of opinion, any more than I think that a Nietzscheite contempt for compassion is merely a matter of opinion. I think they are both heresies so horrible that their treatment must not be so much mental as moral, when it is not simply medical. Men are not always dead of a disease and men are not always damned by a delusion; but so far as they are touched by it they are destroyed by it.|May 31, 1919'', Illustrated London News}}

[[Thomas Mann]]'s essays mention Nietzsche with respect and even adoration, although one of his final essays, "Nietzsche's Philosophy in the Light of Recent History", looks at his favorite philosopher through the lens of Nazism and World War II and ends up placing Nietzsche at a more critical distance. Many of Nietzsche's ideas, particularly on artists and [[aesthetics]], are incorporated and explored throughout Mann's works. The theme of the aesthetic justification of existence Nietzsche introduced from his earliest writings, in "The Birth of Tragedy" declaring sublime art as the only metaphysical consolation of existence; and in the context of fascism and Nazism, the Nietzschean aestheticization of politics void of morality and ordered by caste hierarchy in service of the creative caste, has posed many problems and questions for thinkers in contemporary times. One of the characters in Mann's 1947 novel ''[[Doktor Faustus]]'' represents Nietzsche fictionally. In 1938 the German existentialist [[Karl Jaspers]] wrote the following about the influence of [[Kierkegaard and Nietzsche comparisons|Nietzsche and Søren Kierkegaard]]:

{{Quotation|The contemporary philosophical situation is determined by the fact that two philosophers, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, who did not count in their times and, for a long time, remained without influence in the history of philosophy, have continually grown in significance. Philosophers after Hegel have increasingly returned to face them, and they stand today unquestioned as the authentically great thinkers of their age. [...] The effect of both is immeasurably great, even greater in general thinking than in technical philosophy |Jaspers|''Reason and Existenz''}}

[[Bertrand Russell]] in his ''History of Western Philosophy'' was scathing in his chapter on Nietzsche, calling his work the "mere power-phantasies of an invalid" and referring to Nietzsche as a "megalomaniac". Russell is here depicting the "hard Nietzsche" very few today would recognize. Russell's psychological daggers against Nietzsche are unbalanced, but worth considering. In one particularly harsh section, he says:

{{Quotation|It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all of the men he admires were military.  His opinion of women, like every man's, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear.  "Forget not thy whip"-- but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks. [...] [H]e is so full of fear and hatred that spontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible.  He has never conceived of the man who, with all the fearlessness and stubborn pride of the superman, nevertheless does not inflict pain because he has no wish to do so. Does any one suppose that Lincoln acted as he did from fear of hell? Yet to Nietzsche, Lincoln is abject, Napoleon magnificent. [...] I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die.  But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-conscious ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions.  Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world.  His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.|Russell|''History of Western Philosophy''}}

Likewise, the fictional valet [[Reginald Jeeves]], created by author [[P.G. Wodehouse]], is a fan of [[Baruch Spinoza]], recommending his works to his employer, [[Bertie Wooster]] over those of Friedrich Nietzsche:
{{Quotation|You would not enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is fundamentally unsound.|Wodehouse|''Carry On Jeeves''}}

== Nietzsche after World War II&lt;!--'French Nietzscheanism' redirects here--&gt; ==
The appropriation of Nietzsche's work by the Nazis, combined with the rise of [[analytic philosophy]], ensured that British and American academic philosophers would almost completely ignore him until at least 1950. Even [[George Santayana]], an American philosopher whose life and work betray some similarity to Nietzsche's, dismissed Nietzsche in his 1916 ''Egotism in German Philosophy'' as a "prophet of Romanticism". Analytic philosophers, if they mentioned Nietzsche at all, characterized him as a literary figure rather than as a philosopher. Nietzsche's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Nietzsche translations by the Jewish-German, American philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and the British scholar R.J. Hollingdale.

Nietzsche's influence on [[Continental philosophy]] increased dramatically after the Second World War, especially among the French intellectual Left and [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]].

According to philosopher [[René Girard]],&lt;ref&gt;René Girard, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2905504 "Dionysus versus the Crucified"], ''MLN'', Vol. 99, No. 4 (Sep., 1984), pp. 816–835.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche's greatest political legacy lies in his 20th-century French interpreters, among them [[Georges Bataille]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] (and [[Félix Guattari]]), and [[Jacques Derrida]]. This philosophical movement (originating with the work of Bataille) has been dubbed '''French Nietzscheanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift, ''Poststructuralism and Critical Theory's Second Generation'', Routledge, 2014, ch. 1: French Nietzscheanism.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault's later writings, for example, revise Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop [[anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] theories of power that divide and fragment rather than unite polities (as evinced in the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition of political theory). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's Leftist interpreters, used the much-maligned "will to power" thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such as the [[Rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]] and other "outsides" to state power as traditionally conceived.

Gilles Deleuze and Pierre Klossowski wrote monographs drawing new attention to Nietzsche's work, and a 1972 conference at Cérisy-la-Salle ranks as the most important event in France for a generation's reception of Nietzsche. In Germany interest in Nietzsche was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]], who has devoted several essays to Nietzsche. [[Ernst Nolte]] the German historian, in his literature analyzing fascism and Nazism, presented Nietzsche as a force of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]] and foe of all modern "emancipation politics", and Nolte's judgment generated impassioned dialogue.

In recent years, Nietzsche has also influenced members of the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, such as [[Bernard Williams]] in his last finished book, ''Truth And Truthfulness: An Essay In Genealogy'' (2002).  Prior to that [[Arthur Danto]], with his book, ''Nietzsche as Philosopher'' (1965), presented what was the first full-length study of Nietzsche by an analytical philosopher. Then later, [[Alexander Nehamas]], came out with his book, ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' (1985).

An '''instructional theory''' is "a theory that offers explicit guidance on how to better help people learn and develop."&lt;ref name="Reigeluth"&gt;Reigeluth, C.M. (1999). What is instructional design theory? In C.M. Reigeluth (Ed.) Instructional design theories and models: A new paradigm of instructional theory (Vol. 2, pp. 5-29). Manwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructional theories focus on how to structure material for promoting the education of [[human beings]], particularly youth. Originating in the [[United States]] in the late 1970s, ''instructional theory'' is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: [[behaviorism]], the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and [[constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]], the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowden|first=Randell|date=March 2008|title=Linking Premise to Practice: An Instructional Theory-Strategy Model Approach|journal=Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning|volume=5|issue=3|pages=69–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructional theory is heavily influenced by the 1956 work of [[Benjamin Bloom]], a [[University of Chicago]] professor, and the results of his  [[Taxonomy of Education Objectives]]—one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. One of the first instructional theorists was [[Robert M. Gagne]], who in 1965 published ''[[Conditions of Learning]]'' for the Florida State University's Department of Educational Research.

==Definition==
Instructional theory is different than [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. A learning theory ''describes'' how learning takes place, and an instructional theory ''prescribes'' how to better help people learn.&lt;ref name="Reigeluth"/&gt; Learning theories often inform instructional theory, and three general theoretical stances take part in this influence: behaviorism (learning as response acquisition), cognitivism (learning as knowledge acquisition), and constructivism (learning as knowledge construction).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E. (1992). Cognition and instruction:O n their historic meeting within educational psychology. Journal of Educational Psychology, 84, 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructional theory helps us create conditions that increases the probability of learning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appliedidt.com/blog/2013/07/03/instructional-theory-versus-learning-theory/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Instructional theories identify what [[Teacher|instruction]] or [[teaching]] should be like.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reigeluth.net/#!pubsinsttheor/c22eq&lt;/ref&gt; It outlines strategies that an educator may adopt to achieve the [[learning]] objectives. Instructional theories are adapted based on the educational content and more importantly the [[learning]] style of the students. They are used as teaching guidelines/tools by teachers/trainers to facilitate [[learning]]. Instructional theories encompass different instructional methods, models and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/19919560/Instructional%20Approaches&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paradigm&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reigeluth|first1=Charles M|title=Instructional theory and technology for the new paradigm of education|journal=RED, Revista de Educación a distancia|date=2012|volume=32|issue=1|page=1|url=http://www.um.es/ead/red/32/reigeluth.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Task-Centered Principle - instruction should use a progression of increasingly complex whole tasks.
* Demonstration Principle - instruction should guide learners through a skill and engage peer discussion/demonstration.
* Application Principle - [[Teacher|instruction]] should provide intrinsic or corrective feedback and engage peer-collaboration.
* Activation Principle - instruction should build upon prior [[knowledge]] and encourage learners to acquire a structure for organizing new knowledge.
* Integration Principle - instruction should engage learners in peer-critiques and synthesizing newly acquired knowledge.

'''Core ideas for the Post-industrial Paradigm of Instruction:'''&lt;ref name="paradigm" /&gt;
* Learner centered vs. teacher centered instruction – with respect to the focus, instruction can be based on the capability and style of the learner or the teacher.
* Learning by doing vs. teacher presenting – Students often learn more by doing rather than simply listening to instructions given by the teacher.
* Attainment based vs. time based progress – The instruction can either be based on the focus on the mastery of the concept or the time spent on learning the concept.
* Customized vs. standardized instruction – The instruction can be different for different learners or the instruction can be given in general to the entire classroom
* Criterion referenced vs. norm referenced instruction – Instruction related to different types of evaluations.
* Collaborative vs. individual instruction – Instruction can be for a team of students or individual students.
* Enjoyable vs. unpleasant instructions – Instructions can create a pleasant learning experience or a negative one (often to enforce discipline). Teachers must take care to ensure positive experiences.

==Critiques ==
[[Paulo Freire]]'s work appears to critique instructional approaches that adhere to the knowledge acquisition stance, and his work ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'' has had a broad influence over a generation of [[United States|American]] educators with his critique of various "banking" models of [[education]] and analysis of the teacher-student relationship.&lt;ref name=Freire&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dsa-atlanta.org/pdf_docs/Macedo_intro_POTO.pdf|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|contribution=Introduction|contributor=Macedo, Donaldo|author=Freire, Paulo|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122142203/http://www.dsa-atlanta.org/pdf_docs/Macedo_intro_POTO.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freire explains, "Narration (with the teacher as narrator) leads the students to memorize mechanically the narrated content. Worse yet, it turns them into "containers", into "receptacles" to be "filled" by the teacher. The more completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are."&lt;ref name=Freire/&gt; In this way he explains educator creates an act of depositing knowledge in a student. The student thus becomes a repository of knowledge. Freire explains that this system that diminishes creativity and knowledge suffers. Knowledge, according to Freire, comes about only through the learner by inquiry and pursuing the subjects in the world and through interpersonal interaction.

Freire further states, "In the banking concept of [[education]], [[knowledge]] is a gift bestowed by those who consider themselves knowledgeable upon those whom they consider to know nothing. Projecting an absolute ignorance onto others, a characteristic of the ideology of oppression, negates [[education]] and [[knowledge]] as processes of inquiry. The teacher presents himself to his students as their necessary opposite; by considering their ignorance absolute, he justifies his own existence. The students, alienated like the slave in the Hegelian dialectic, accept their ignorance as justifying the teacher's existence—but, unlike the slave, they never discover that they educate the teacher."
Freire then offered an alternative stance and wrote, "The raison d'etre of libertarian education, on the other hand, lies in its drive towards reconciliation. [[Education]] must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students."&lt;ref name=Freire/&gt;

In the article, "A process for the critical analysis of instructional theory", the authors use an ontology-building process to review and analyze concepts across different instructional theories. Here are their findings:
* Concepts exist in theoretical writing that theorists do not address directly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostwick|first=Jay A.|last2=Calvert|first2=Isaac Wade|last3=Francis|first3=Jenifer|last4=Hawkley|first4=Melissa|last5=Henrie|first5=Curtis R.|last6=Hyatt|first6=Frederick R.|last7=Juncker|first7=Janeel|last8=Gibbons|first8=Andrew S.|date=2014-08-19|title=A process for the critical analysis of instructional theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-014-9346-5|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|language=en|volume=62|issue=5|pages=571–582|doi=10.1007/s11423-014-9346-5|issn=1042-1629}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* These tacit concepts, which supply the ontological categories, enable a more detailed comparison of theories beyond specific terminologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Divergences between theories can be concealed behind common terms used by different theorists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* A false sense of understanding often arises from a cursory, uncritical reading of the theories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Discontinuities and gaps are revealed within the theoretical literature when the tacit concepts are elicited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Integration''' is the annual techno-cultural fest of [[Indian Statistical Institute]], usually held during last three weekends of January each year. It is one of the biggest campus events in Kolkata, and attracts participation from all over the world.

==Introduction==
Integration is a relatively new addition to the set of Kolkata fests, and yet, it has already carved out a niche for itself. Integration is already one of the biggest fests in the city and is entirely organised by the students and research scholars of Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). The fest is held in three parts, namely, the Tech Chapter, the Sports Chapter and the Cultural Chapter.  

The Tech Chapter is generally held on the second weekend of January. In this part of Integration, they hold competitive events such as [[hackathon]]s, [[scavenger hunt]]s, and [[esports]] tournaments. The Tech Quiz, which is organised during this part of Integration, is one of the biggest of its kind in West Bengal. Apart from these, there are workshops and seminars on various technical fields, conducted by eminent personalities from the academia.

The Cultural Fest is held within one week after the Tech Chapter. This part of Integration witnesses the active involvement of stalwarts from various fields, like Mr. [[Sourav Ganguly]],&lt;ref name="sa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topic/person/arun-shourie-sourav-ganguly-in-isi-kolkata-15-jan-2011-video-j96Hi8uCjWc-30849-7.html|title=Sourav Ganguly in ISI, Kolkata_ 15 Jan, 2011|author=First post|date=15 Jan 2011|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodmantra.com/video/sourav-ganguly-in-isi-kolkata-15-jan-2011/#|title=Sourav Ganguly in ISI, Kolkata|author=Bollywood Mantra|date=15 Jan 2011|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Pranab Mukherjee]],&lt;ref name="pa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/phsmall.asp?phid=33051|title=Expectations from future leaders|author=Press Information Bureau|date=15 Jan 2011|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/i-m-like-an-antique-piece-in-indian-politics-pranab-mukherjee-79556|title=I'm like an antique piece in Indian politics: Pranab Mukherjee|author=Press Trust of India|date=15 Jan 2011|work=|publisher=NDTV |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Pranab-says-he-is-like-an-antique-piece-in-Indian-politics/articleshow/7292274.cms?referral=PM|title=Pranab says he is like an antique piece in Indian politics|newspaper=The Times of India|author=Press Trust of India|date=15 January 2011|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. [[Anupam Kher]], Mr. [[Arun Shourie]],&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/shourie-pranab-best-pm-india-yet-have-473|title=Shourie: Pranab best PM India is yet to have|author=The Asian Age|date=16 Jan 2011|work=|publisher=Parwez Hafeez |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. [[Harsha Bhogle]] and others.

'''Kainnilai''' (Tamil:கைநிலை), and '''Innilai''' (Tamil:இந்நிலை) are [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic works belonging to the ''[[Pathinenkilkanakku]]'' anthology of [[Tamil literature]]. These two books together form the eighteenth book in the anthology, belonging to the 'post [[Sangam period]]' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. ''Kainnilai'' contains sixty poems written by the poet Pullangkaathanaar and ''Innilai'' contains 45 poems and was written by the poet Poigayaar.

The poems of ''Innilai''  deal with the ethical concepts of ''aram'' – propriety, ''porul'' – wealth, ''inpam'' – love and ''veedu'' – salvation. In this respect it is similar to ''[[Tirukkural]]'' which also concerns with these concepts.

''Kainnilai'' is available in a much-damaged condition with many of its poems only partially available. ''Kainnilai'' deals with the subjective (''agam'') concepts. ''Agam'' in the [[Sangam literature]] denotes the subject matters that deal with the intangibles of life such as human emotions, love, separation, lovers' quarrels, etc. The poems of ''Kainnilai'' are categoriesed into twelve poems for each of the five ''thinai'', or [[Sangam landscape|landscape]] of Sangam poetry and describe in detail the situation and emotions specific to each landscape. The five landscapes of Sangam poetry are ''mullai'' – forest, ''kurinji'' – mountains, ''marutham'' – farmland, ''paalai'' – arid land and ''neithal'' – seashore.

{{nihongo|'''''Kanon'''''|カノン}} is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] released on June 4, 1999 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Personal computers|PCs]]. Key later released versions of ''Kanon'' without the erotic content, and the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The [[gameplay]] in ''Kanon'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the [[player character]]. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. ''Kanon'' has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.

Following the game's release, ''Kanon'' made several transitions into other media. Two [[manga]] series were serialized in ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age Pure]]''. [[Comic anthology|Comic anthologies]], [[light novel]]s and [[art book]]s were also published, as were [[audio drama]]s and several music albums. [[Toei Animation]] produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an [[original video animation]] (OVA) episode in 2003. [[Kyoto Animation]] produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by [[ADV Films]] in 2008, but the license was given to [[Funimation]] after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between ''Kanon'' and the musical term [[Canon (music)|canon]] by using [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]]'s ''Kanon D-dur'', or ''[[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D major]]'', as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Kanon Ayu screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Typical dialogue and narrative in ''Kanon'', depicting the main character Yuichi talking to Ayu.]]
''Kanon'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa.&lt;ref name="visual-book"&gt;{{cite book|publication-date=June 2000|title=Kanon Visual Fan Book|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|isbn=978-4-7577-0039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. ''Kanon'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.&lt;ref name="Kanon-PSP" /&gt;

There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's [[back-story]]. [[Jun Maeda]], who worked on the scenario for ''Kanon'', commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of ''Kanon'''s influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on ''Kanon'' who thought that.&lt;ref name="Air-interview"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605054025/http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm|url= http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm|title=カラフル・ピュアガール 2001年3月号 Keyシナリオスタッフ ロングインタビュー |trans-title=''Colorful Pure Girl'' March 2001 Issue Key Scenario Staff Long Interview|publisher=Colorful Pure Girl|date=March 2001|archivedate=June 5, 2008|accessdate=August 11, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hentai|adult]] versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual [[Computer graphics|CGs]] depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Key-official" /&gt; Later, Key released versions of ''Kanon'' without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; Outside of these, there are two scenes with [[nudity]].&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in ''Kanon'' are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with [[Human reproduction|reproduction]] in mind.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and themes===
There are several important locations featured in the ''Kanon'' story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The [[Shōtengai|shopping district]] is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006–2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as [[overture]] and [[introit]]. [[Miracle]]s play a large part in the story; ''Kanon''{{'}}s plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 起きないから、奇跡って言うんですよ&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen."&lt;/ref&gt; The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 約束、だよ&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "It's a promise."&lt;/ref&gt; Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

One of the [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] in the story is [[amnesia]], or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. ''[[Newtype USA]]'' stated in an article on ''Kanon'' that "it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nakagami |first=Yoshikatsu |last2=Ikeda |first2=Kazumi |last3=Takeda |first3=Akiyo |last4=Miyata |first4=Kana |last5=Unoguchi |first5=Joh |date=January 2007 |title=Kanon |journal=[[Newtype USA]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=62–63 |publisher=[[A.D. Vision]] |location=Houston, TX |issn=1541-4817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These five foods of choice are: [[taiyaki]] (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), [[nikuman]] (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and [[gyudon]] (Mai).&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

===Principal characters===
{{main article|List of Kanon characters}}
The player assumes the role of [[List of Kanon characters#Yuichi Aizawa|Yuichi Aizawa]], the protagonist of ''Kanon''. He is a cynical 17-year-old high school student, and is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. [[Ayu Tsukimiya]], the main heroine of ''Kanon'', is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|masculine first-person pronoun]] {{Nihongo|''[[Japanese pronouns|boku]]''|僕}}. She has a fondness for eating [[taiyaki]], and is notorious for her [[catchphrase]], {{Nihongo|"ugū"|うぐぅ}}, which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi's first cousin [[List of Kanon characters#Nayuki Minase|Nayuki Minase]], another of ''Kanon'''s heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

Yuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by ''Kanon'''s third heroine [[List of Kanon characters#Makoto Sawatari|Makoto Sawatari]], a young girl who has [[Amnesia|lost her memories]], but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 春がきて･･･ずっと春だったらいいのに&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "If only spring would come and stay forever."&lt;/ref&gt; Yuichi coincidentally runs into [[List of Kanon characters#Shiori Misaka|Shiori Misaka]], another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in ''Kanon'' is [[List of Kanon characters#Mai Kawasumi|Mai Kawasumi]], a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she "punishes" someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light [[karate]] chop to the head.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

===Story===
''Kanon''{{'}}s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to ''Kanon'''s beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.

On the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with [[taiyaki]] after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has [[Amnesia|lost her memories]], though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.

Another girl who is connected to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat [[demon]]s at night while the school is deserted.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 私は魔物を討つ者だから &lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "I'm a demon hunter."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.

==Development==
Most of ''Kanon''{{'}}s development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher [[Nexton]] under the brand [[Tactics (brand)|Tactics]]. After the release of the brand's third game ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'', most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|journal=Key 10th Anniversary Book|title=Jun Maeda Long Interview|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|pages=48–60|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at [[VisualArt's]] once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book" /&gt; Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on ''Kanon''.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book" /&gt; The planning for the visual novel was headed by [[Naoki Hisaya]] who was also one of two scenario writers with [[Jun Maeda]].&lt;ref name="staff1"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228084754/http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=187|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=187|archivedate=December 28, 2007|title=''Kanon'' ErogameScape－エロゲー批評空間－|trans-title=''Kanon'' ErogameScape - Eroge Commentary Room -| publisher=Erogamescape|accessdate=October 19, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai.

==Adaptations==

===Light novels===
Five [[Erotic literature|adult]] [[light novel]]s written by Mariko Shimizu and published by [[Paradigm (publisher)|Paradigm]] were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894900580/|title=Kanon 雪の少女|trans-title=Kanon Yuki no Shōjo|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 29, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894900947/|title=Kanon 日溜まりの街|trans-title=Kanon Hidamari no Machi|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 29, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by [[Itaru Hinoue]], the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were {{Nihongo|''Yuki no Shōjo''|雪の少女|Girl in the Snow|Nayuki}} and {{Nihongo|''Egao no Mukougawa ni''|笑顔の向こう側に|Beyond the Smile|Shiori}} in December 1999. The third was {{Nihongo|''Shōjo no Ori''|少女の檻|Girl's Prison|Mai}} released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled ''The Fox and the Grapes'' (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled {{Nihongo|''Hidamari no Machi''|日溜りの街|A Sunny City|Ayu}} was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with [[VisualArt's]] under their VA Bunko [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], which removed the erotic scenes, starting with ''Yuki no Shōjo'' on June 27, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894906236|title=Kanon 雪の少女|trans-title=''Kanon: Yuki no Shōjo''|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4894906236|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with ''Hidamari no Machi'' on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume. A sixth novel titled {{Nihongo|''Kanojotachi no Kenkai''|彼女たちの見解|The Girls' Opinions}} for the supporting character Sayuri Kurata written by Shimizu and illustrated by Zen was released on March 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894906287|title=Kanon ~彼女たちの見解~|trans-title=''Kanon: Kanojotachi no Kenkai''|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4894906287|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama CDs and radio shows===
A set of five drama CDs were released between September 29, 2000 and April 27, 2001, with each volume focusing on a different heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowing.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=MACB-6001|title=Kanon-カノン- Vol.1　沢渡真琴ストーリー|trans-title=Kanon Vol. 1 Makoto Sawatari Story|publisher=Neowing|accessdate=February 28, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowing.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=MACB-6005|title=Kanon-カノン- Vol.5　月宮あゆストーリー|trans-title=Kanon Vol. 5 Ayu Tsukimiya Story|publisher=Neowing|accessdate=February 28, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of five anthology drama CDs were released between December 22, 2001 and May 25, 2002, with each volume again focusing on a different heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowing.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=MACP-1001|title=公認アンソロジードラマCD「Kanon-anthology.1」 プロローグ・美坂 栞 「約束をしたこと」|trans-title=Official Anthology Drama CD "Kanon Anthology 1" Prologue: Shiori Misaka "Things Promised"|publisher=Neowing|accessdate=February 28, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowing.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=MACP-1005|title=公認アンソロジードラマCD「Kanon-anthology.5」|trans-title=Official Anthology Drama CD "Kanon Anthology 5"|publisher=Neowing|accessdate=February 28, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[radio show]] to promote the Dreamcast port of ''Kanon'' titled {{nihongo|''Kanon: The Snow Talk Memories Yuki Furu Machi no Monogatari''|Kanon -The snow talks memories- 雪降る街の物語}} broadcast 13 episodes between October 6 and December 29, 2000.

===Manga===
The first ''Kanon'' [[manga]] illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' manga magazine ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dengeki Daioh]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|issue=February 2000|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dengeki Daioh]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|issue=July 2002|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual chapters were later collected into two separate ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes published by MediaWorks under their ''[[Dengeki Comics]]'' imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840216789/|title=Kanon 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840221308/|title=Kanon 2|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the [[prologue]] in volume one and the [[epilogue]] in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in.&lt;ref name="kanonmanga1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kanonmanga2" /&gt; The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely.&lt;ref name="kanonmanga1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga |volume=1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanonmanga2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga |volume=2|publisher= [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.

The second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title {{Nihongo|''Kanon: Honto no Omoi wa Egao no Mukōgawa ni''|Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に|Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face}} with the subtitle ''each regret of Kanon'', was serialized between volumes two and seven of [[Fujimi Shobo]]'s ''[[Dragon Age Pure]]'' magazine sold between June 29, 2006 and October 20, 2007, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622041253/http://www.fujimishobo.co.jp/pure/2006/06/post_75.php|url=http://www.fujimishobo.co.jp/pure/2006/06/post_75.php|archivedate=June 22, 2007|script-title=ja:大人気ゲーム｢Ｋａｎｏｎ｣をコミカライズ!!|trans-title=Highly Popular Game ''Kanon'' Becomes a Comic!!|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=October 19, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dragon Age Pure]]|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|volume=2|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dragon Age Pure]]|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|volume=7|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007 and focused on Nayuki's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/comic/bk_detail.php?pcd=200701000223|title=Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に1|trans-title=''Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face'' 1|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|accessdate=December 3, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume was released on December 8, 2007 and focused on the other four heroines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/comic/bk_detail.php?pcd=200707000422|title=Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に2|trans-title=''Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face'' 2|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|accessdate=December 3, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two.

The first ''Kanon'' anime was produced by the Japanese animation studio [[Toei Animation]] and directed by [[Naoyuki Itō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/kanon/staff.html|script-title=ja:東映アニメーション|trans-title=Toei Animation|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]| accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/kanon/arasuji.html|title=First ''Kanon'' anime official episode listing|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; were produced and aired in Japan on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] between January 31 and March 28, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/lineup/tv/kanon/|title=カノン - TOEI ANIMATION|trans-title=''Kanon'' - TOEI ANIMATION|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also later aired on [[Kansai Telecasting Corporation|Kansai TV]]. Later, a single [[original video animation]] (OVA) episode titled "Kanon Kazahana" was released in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108184258/http://www.animate.tv/pv/detail.php?id=p000000008|url=http://www.animate.tv/pv/detail.php?id=p000000008|title=TVアニメーション『Kanon』DVD・CDキャンペーン　プレゼントAコース用 特典映像『風花』|trans-title=TV Animation ''Kanon'' DVD/CD Campaign: Present Bonus Footage ''Kazahana''|publisher=[[Animate]]|archivedate=January 8, 2006|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime series and OVA used the songs "Florescence" and "Flower" for the opening and ending themes, respectively. While it does not appear as the ending theme in the first 12 episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme "Where the Wind Reaches" is used as the ending theme for the series in episode 13.&lt;ref name="2002anime13"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Where the Wind Leads|series=Kanon|episodelink=List of Kanon episodes#ep13|episode=13|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]| date=March 28, 2002|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the game's opening theme "Last regrets" is played near the end of episode 13 during the flashback scene.&lt;ref name="2002anime13" /&gt;

Starting in 2006, [[Kyoto Animation]], the animators of another [[Key (company)|Key]] game-turned-anime, ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', decided to animate a new adaptation of ''Kanon''. This version, directed by [[Tatsuya Ishihara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/kanon/02stca/stca.html|title=TVアニメ「Kanon」公式HP|trans-title=TV Anime ''Kanon'' Official HP|publisher=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and written by [[Fumihiko Shimo]], aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on [[BS-TBS|BS-i]], containing 24 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/kanon/03story/story.html|title=TVアニメ「Kanon」公式HP|trans-title=TV Anime ''Kanon'' Official HP|publisher=[[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]|accessdate=June 9, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was later rebroadcast on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]. [[ADV Films]] announced on September 21, 2007 at the [[Anime Weekend Atlanta]] [[anime convention]] that they have officially licensed the second ''Kanon'' anime series.&lt;ref name="ADVlicense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-09-22/adv's-acquisition-of-2nd-kanon-series-confirmed-at-awa|title=ADV's Acquisition of 2nd Kanon Series Confirmed at AWA|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 22, 2007|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been spread on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-08-08/adv-films-posts-trailers-for-second-kanon-tv-series|title=ADV Films Posts Trailers for Second Kanon TV Series (Updated)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 8, 2007| accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at [[Anime News Network]] between December 23 and December 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-28/kanon-episode-1-preview-2-days-left|title=''Kanon'' - Episode 1 Preview - 2 Days Left|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 28, 2007|accessdate=December 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second ''Kanon'' anime were transferred from ADV to [[Funimation Entertainment]] who continued to produce the series in North America.&lt;ref name="Fun-license"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-04/funimation-picks-up-over-30-former-ad-vision-titles|title=Funimation Picks Up Over 30 Former AD Vision Titles|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 4, 2008|accessdate=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second TV ''Kanon'' animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same [[Seiyū|voice acting]] cast as the first anime, with the exception of [[List of Kanon characters#Yuichi Aizawa|Yuichi]] and [[List of Kanon characters#Kuze|Kuze]]. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the ''Kanon'' game are used for the second anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled "Last regrets (X'mas floor style)" by [[Eiko Shimamiya]] from [[I've Sound]]'s first album ''[[Regret (album)|Regret]]''. Other songs are used from the [[Arrangement|arrange]] albums released over the years, which include ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Anemoscope|Anemoscope]]'', ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Recollections|Recollections]]'', ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Re-feel|Re-feel]]'', and ''[[Ma-Na]]''.

==Music==
{{main article|Music of Kanon}}
The visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme "Last regrets", and the ending theme {{Nihongo|"Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho"|風の辿り着く場所|Where the Wind Reaches}}, both sung by [[Ayana]]. The lyrics for both songs were written by [[Jun Maeda]], and arranged by Kazuya Takase of [[I've Sound]]. The five heroines have [[leitmotif]]s. Ayu's theme is {{Nihongo|"Hidamari no Machi"|日溜りの街|A Sunny City}}; Nayuki's theme is {{Nihongo|"Yuki no Shōjo"|雪の少女|Girl in the Snow}}; Makoto's theme is "The Fox and the Grapes"; Shiori's theme is {{Nihongo|"Egao no Mukōgawa ni"|笑顔の向こう側に|Beyond the Smile}}; lastly, Mai's theme is {{Nihongo|"Shōjo no Ori"|少女の檻|Girls' Prison}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Kanon Original Soundtrack |titlelink=Music of Kanon#Kanon Original Soundtrack |year=2002 |first=Jun|last=Maeda|authorlink=Jun Maeda|first2=Shinji|last2=Orito|authorlink2=Shinji Orito|type=booklet |publisher=[[Key Sounds Label]]|location=[[Osaka]]|id=KSLA-0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first music album released was ''[[Music of Kanon#Anemoscope|Anemoscope]]'' which came bundled with the original release of ''Kanon'' in June 1999. The next release was a single, "[[Music of Kanon#Last regrets / Place of wind which arrives|Last regrets/Place of wind which arrives]]", which contained the opening and ending themes plus [[Arrangement|arranged]] versions of three [[background music]] tracks and a male vocal version of the opening theme. A compilation album containing tracks from the two albums was released in December 2001 called ''[[Music of Kanon#Recollections|Recollections]]''.&lt;ref name="key-disc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://key.soundslabel.com/discography.htm |title=Key Sounds Label's discography |publisher=[[Key Sounds Label]] |accessdate=April 25, 2008 |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418030319/http://key.soundslabel.com/discography.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Music of Kanon#Kanon Original Soundtrack|game's original soundtrack]] was released in October 2002 containing 22 different tracks along with short versions of the two theme songs.&lt;ref name="key-disc" /&gt; A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called ''[[Music of Kanon#Re-feel|Re-feel]]'' which contained five tracks from ''Kanon'' and five from ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]''.&lt;ref name="key-disc" /&gt; Excluding the first two albums, each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's [[record label]] [[Key Sounds Label]]; this is due to the first two albums being released before the label was formed.&lt;ref name="key-disc" /&gt;

The [[Music of Kanon#TV Animation Edition Kanon Soundtrack Volume 1|first anime's first original soundtrack]] was released in May 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000063L17/|title=TVシリーズ Kanon~カノン~サウンドトラック 第1巻|trans-title=TV Series ''Kanon'' Soundtrack 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Music of Kanon#TV Animation Edition Kanon Soundtrack Volume 2|a second followed]] in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0000677N9/|title=TVアニメーション版 Kanonサウンドトラック第2巻|trans-title=TV Series ''Kanon'' Soundtrack 2|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first anime's opening theme is "Florescence" and the ending theme is "Flower", both sung by Miho Fujiwara; the [[maxi single]] containing the anime's opening and ending themes was released in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000065BG7/|title=Kanon ~カノン~ - florescence [Limited Edition] [Maxi]|trans-title=''Kanon'' "Florescence" (Limited Edition) (Maxi)|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; An album containing [[Musical box|music box]] arranged tracks of music from the first anime was released in July 2003 called ''[[Music of Kanon#Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Shū|Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Shū]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00009V9OR/|title=オルゴールで聴く TVアニメーション版 Kanon 作品集 [Soundtrack]|trans-title=Orgel de Kiku TV Animation Version ''Kanon'' Work Collection|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=June 11, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The albums released for the first anime were produced by [[Frontier Works]] and [[Movic]].

==Reception and legacy==
According to a national ranking of how well [[bishōjo game]]s sold nationally in Japan, the original ''Kanon'' release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking.&lt;ref name="rank2-45-46"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227192346/http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank102.htm |url=http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank102.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2005 |title=PEAKS　PCnewsWEB |publisher=Peakspub |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks.&lt;ref name="rank2-45-46" /&gt; The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002.&lt;ref name="rank41"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307102139/http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank103.html |url=http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank103.html |title=PEAKS　PCnewsWEB |publisher=Peakspub |archivedate=March  7, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2007 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kanon'' Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings.&lt;ref name="rank16"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617202907/http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank160161.html |url=http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank160161.html |title=PEAKS　PCnewsWEB |publisher=Peakspub |archivedate=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2007 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kanon'' Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35.&lt;ref name="rank47-35"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227192606/http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank163.html |url=http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank163.html |title=PEAKS　PCnewsWEB |publisher=Peakspub |archivedate=December 27, 2005 |accessdate=March 13, 2007 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The all ages version of the ''Kanon'' Standard Edition premiered at number 42 on the national ranking, went up to 35 the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that.&lt;ref name="rank42-35"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227181834/http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank165.html |url=http://www.peakspub.co.jp/ranking/rank165.html |title=PEAKS　PCnewsWEB |publisher=Peakspub |archivedate=December 27, 2005 |accessdate=March 13, 2007 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/085/085779p1.html|title=Now Playing in Japan|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 29, 2000|accessdate=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kanon'' has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms, not counting the PSP release.&lt;ref name="sega" /&gt;

Five days before the first PS2 release for ''Kanon'', a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. ''Kanon'' was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being ''America Ōden Ultra Quiz'' from [[DigiCube]] and ''Marle de Jigsaw'' from [[Nippon Ichi Software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111195733/http://www.allrpg.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=1-02|url=http://www.allrpg.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=1-02|title=A PlayStation 2 Printer|publisher=Allrpg.com|archivedate=January 11, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Famitsu Scores for the Week of 02/20/2002|journal=[[Famitsu]]|date=February 2002|quote=Kanon (PS2, NEC Interchannel): 7 / 8 / 7 / 7 - (29/40)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yūichi Suzumoto]] commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of ''Kanon'''s story could be summed up as "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; In the October 2007 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, ''Kanon'' ranked fifth with 71 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213916/http://gs.dengekinet.com/ranking/index.html|url= http://gs.dengeki.com/ranking/index.html|title=読者が選ぶ MY BEST ギャルゲーランキング 電撃G'smagazine.com|trans-title=Reader Chosen MY BEST Girl Game Ranking Dengeki G's magazine.com|publisher= [[ASCII Media Works]]|archivedate=October 11, 2007|accessdate=January 3, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters from ''Kanon'' have appeared in several [[Dōjin soft|dōjin games]] not directly based on the ''Kanon'' series such as the ''[[Eternal Fighter Zero]]'' game by [[Twilight Frontier]] where most of the playable characters either came from ''Kanon'' or from ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Eternal Fighter Zero]]|developer=[[Twilight Frontier]]|publisher=[[Twilight Frontier]]|platform=PC|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dōjin game ''[[Glove on Fight]]'' featured at least two ''Kanon'' characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a [[Versus fighting game|fighting]] style game along with various other characters taken from other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Glove on Fight]]|developer=[[Twilight Frontier]]|publisher=[[Twilight Frontier]]|platform=PC|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character [[Ayu Tsukimiya]] in particular is known to appear in works outside ''Kanon'', such as in strip 67 of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Megatokyo]]'' where Ayu is shown eating ''[[taiyaki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Gallagher|url= http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=67|title=MegaTokyo - (67) Saving Points|publisher=Fredart Studios|accessdate=June 15, 2009|authorlink= Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second ''Kanon'' anime series was reviewed at [[Anime News Network]] where Theron Martin commented how the series is a "formulaic moe haremfest", and how the [[Moe (slang)|moe]] aspects of the series may make viewers "feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', saying "Like ''Air'', the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike ''Air'', however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-1|title=Kanon DVD 1 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin also compares ''Kanon'' to the anime adaptation of ''[[Shuffle!]]'' which is described as "bombing" where ''Kanon'' "works". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters "endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what ''Shuffle!'''s do." Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvds-2|title=Kanon DVDs 2-3 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 8, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it "overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times" causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being "too erratic to be fully credible" or easily believable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-5|title=Kanon DVDs 4-5 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 29, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as "one of the best moe-centric series to date" and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making ''Kanon'' "one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year". Martin adds another series comparison, citing ''Kanon'' as the "polar opposite of ''[[Gurren Lagann]]''", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-6|title=Kanon DVD 6 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 29, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Langley Academy''' is an [[Academy (England)|academy]] in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], east of [[Slough]] in [[Berkshire]], south east [[England]].&lt;ref name="About_The_Langley_Academy" /&gt; It opened in September 2008, replacing the former Langleywood Secondary School. The building was designed by [[Foster and Partners]], led by the architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]]&lt;ref name="e-architect_12_Nov_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levolux_PR_Langley_Academy" /&gt; and by [[Buro Happold]].&lt;ref name="Buro_Happold_PR_Langley_Academy" /&gt; The school is supported by the [[Arbib Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Joint consultation"/&gt; It has a specialism of [[science]] and a [[museum education]] theme, including exhibits in the school building. It also promotes sport, notably [[cricket]] and [[rowing (sport)|rowing]].

==History==
'''Langleywood Secondary School''' was created in 1982 on the site of the former Langley [[Secondary Modern]] School following a merger with the former Holmewood Secondary Modern School. As of 2005 Langleywood had about 800 pupils. From 2003 to 2005, Langleywood was in [[Ofsted]] 'special measures', but this period was successfully completed in November 2005. Upon the closure of Langleywood Ofsted were invited into the school by the outgoing Headmaster, Mr Paul McAteer, to give a final report. This final report described Langleywood as "a good school with outstanding features."{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}


In July 2004, [[Slough Borough Council]], the [[local education authority]], agreed to support the establishment of an academy on the Langleywood site.&lt;ref name ="Joint consultation" /&gt; Langleywood closed in July 2008 and was replaced by The Langley Academy in September 2008. The new academy opened in new buildings designed by Foster and Partners and was sponsored by the Arbib Foundation.

The Langley Academy under the leadership of its first Principal, Mr Chris Bowler, quickly established itself as the most popular non-selective secondary school in Slough as judged by parental preferences.  It set very high standards of behaviour and discipline and set about the process of raising attainment and expectations as well as giving students a real voice in the way that the academy was run.  It became well known in the area and beyond for its focus on science (it is a science specialist academy) and for being the only museum learning school in the UK.  It also had a major focus on rowing, helped by Olympic double gold medallist [[Andy Holmes]].

The impressive progress made in the first two years was noted by OFSTED in the Section 8 report from July 2010, where the academy was classed as having made 'good progress', in contrast to many other academies that opened at the same time.  Its exam results rose significantly during the first three years, outperforming the school it had replaced.

The Principal, Mr Bowler, left the academy before the full OFSTED inspection in July 2011. He was replaced by Mr Peter Blewett as Acting Principal until a permanent appointment was made in the autumn term when Mr Rhodri Bryant was appointed as the new Principal.

==Houses==
All students in the Langley Academy are assigned to one of six houses each with their own foci:

* Arbib – Museum Learning 
* Darwin – Science
* Gaia – Sustainability
* Globe – Internationalism
* Grace – Cricket
* Henley – Rowing

Since the early 1970s, a legend of '''Rainbow Warriors''' has inspired some [[environmentalists]] and [[hippie]]s with a belief that their movement is the fulfillment of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] prophecy. Usually the "prophecy" is claimed to be [[Hopi]] or [[Cree]]. However, this "prophecy" is not Native American at all, but rather from a 1962 [[evangelical Christianity|Evangelical Christian]] [[Tract (literature)|religious tract]], titled ''Warriors of the Rainbow'' by William Willoya and Vinson Brown from Naturegraph Publishers.&lt;ref name="NimanInterview"&gt;[http://www.johntarleton.net/niman.html Interview with Michael Niman]&lt;/ref&gt; Brown is the founder and owner of Naturegraph Publishers.&lt;ref name="NimanInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "niman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Niman|first=Michael|title=People of the Rainbow: Nomadic Utopia|year=1997|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|isbn=978-0870499890|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturegraph.com/about.html About Naturegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The roots of that myth go back to a book called ''Warriors of the Rainbow''. It was basically an evangelical Christian tract which was published in 1962. If anything, it was an attack on Native culture. It was an attempt to evangelize within the Native American community.&lt;ref name="NimanInterview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
The modern story has been misrepresented as ancient prophecy. While this falsification may have been done consciously by the creators of the story, those who pass the story on may sincerely believe the story is authentic. This phenomenon is an example of what scholar Michael I. Niman calls "[[fakelore]]."&lt;ref name="NimanInterview"/&gt;

While there are variations on the theme, especially as it has become popularized in [[Internet meme]]s, the common thread in all versions of the story is that a time of crisis will come to the Earth, that people of many races will come together to save the planet, and it is always erroneously credited as being a Native American or [[First Nations]] prophecy: "It is said there will be a time when the trees are dying, blah, blah, blah. There will be a tribe of people who come and save the Earth and they will be called the Rainbows."&lt;ref name="NimanInterview"/&gt; Some modern versions of the fictitious story specifically state that this new "tribe" will inherit the ways of the Native Americans, or that Native ways will die out to be replaced by the new ways of the "Rainbow" people.&lt;ref name=Skulls&gt;
Morton, Chris and Thomas, Ceri Louise (1998) ''The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: A Real Life Detective Story of the Ancient World''. Vermont, [[Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company|Bear &amp; Company]] {{ISBN|978-1879181540}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The legend said [the Native Americans] would also be joined by many of their light-skinned brothers and sisters, who would in fact be the reincarnate souls of the Indians who were killed or enslaved by the first light-skinned settlers. It was said that the dead souls of these first people would return in bodies of all different colours: red, white, yellow and black. Together and unified, like the colours of the rainbow, these people would teach all of the peoples of the world how to have love and reverence for Mother Earth, of whose very stuff we human beings are also made.&lt;ref name=Skulls/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Warriors of the Rainbow'' relates these fictitious "Indian" prophecies to the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and has been described as purveying "a covert anti-Semitism throughout, while evangelizing against traditional Native American spirituality."&lt;ref name = "niman"/&gt;

The book ''The Greenpeace Story'', states that [[Greenpeace]] co-founder [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Bob Hunter]] was given a copy of ''Warriors of the Rainbow'' by a wandering dulcimer maker in 1969 and he passed it around on the first expedition of the [[Don't Make a Wave Committee]], the precursor of Greenpeace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Michael|title=The Greenpeace Story|year=1989|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-1879431027|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend inspired the name of three Greenpeace ships, ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'', used in environmental protection protests as well as the name of the [[hippie]] group, the [[Rainbow Family]].

Native American author and poet [[Sherman Alexie]] has addressed this belief in the "inner Indian" and the ways "American whites have co-opted Indian culture,"&lt;ref name=Alexie1&gt;Aull, Felice (2009)[http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=12968 Alexie, Sherman "How to Write the Great American Indian Novel"]. New York University, ''Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database''.&lt;/ref&gt; notably in his poem, "How to Write the Great American Indian Novel":

{{poemquote|White people must carry an Indian deep inside themselves.
If the interior Indian is male
then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man.

... 

In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written,
all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.&lt;ref name=Alexie2&gt;Alexie, Sherman (1996) "How to Write the Great American Indian Novel" from ''The Summer of Black Widows''. Hanging Loose Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Response==
In 2015, a group of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] academics and writers issued a statement against the [[Rainbow Family]] members who are "appropriating and practicing faux Native ceremonies and beliefs. These actions, although Rainbows may not realize, dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking." The signatories specifically named this [[Cultural misappropriation|misappropriation]] as "cultural exploitation."&lt;ref name=HeSapa&gt;{{cite web |last=Estes |first=Nick; et al |title = Protect He Sapa, Stop Cultural Exploitation |publisher = [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |date=14 July 2015 | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303091719/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation

==History==

===Early estimates===
[[Image:Francis Galton.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Sir Francis Galton]]]]
[[Sir Francis Galton]] was one of the first scientists to apply the lexical hypothesis to the study of personality,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; stating:

{{quote|I tried to gain an idea of the number of the more conspicuous aspects of the character by counting in an appropriate dictionary the words used to express them... I examined many pages of its index here and there as samples of the whole, and estimated that it contained fully one thousand words expressive of character, each of which has a separate shade of meaning, while each shares a large part of its meaning with some of the rest.&lt;ref name="Galton"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1884-fort-rev-measurement-character.pdf | title=Measurement of Character | author=Galton, F. | journal=Fortnightly Review | year=1884 | volume=36 | pages=179–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} |Francis Galton |''Measurement of Character'', 1884}}

Despite Galton's early ventures into the lexical study of personality, over two decades passed before English-language scholars continued his work. A 1910 study by [[George E. Partridge|G. E. Partridge]] listed approximately 750 English adjectives used to describe mental states,&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/PartridgeGE-1910 |title=An Outline of Individual Study | publisher=Sturgis &amp; Walton | author=Partridge, G. E. | year=1910 | location=New York | pages=106–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 1926 study of [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]] by M. L. Perkins provided an estimate of 3,000 such terms.&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_pdf/v06/p344_347.pdf | title=The teaching of ideals and the development of the traits of character and personality | author=Perkins, M. L. | journal=Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Sciences | year=1926 | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=344–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early explorations and estimates were not limited to the English-speaking world, with philosopher and psychologist Ludwig Klages stating in 1929 that the German language contains approximately 4,000 words to describe inner states.&lt;ref name="klages"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Science of Character | publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin | author=Klages, L. | year=1929 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psycholexical studies===

====Allport &amp; Odbert====
[[File:Gordon Allport.gif|right|thumb|[[Gordon Allport]]]]
Nearly half a century after Galton first investigated the lexical hypothesis, Franziska Baumgarten published the first psycholexical classification of personality-descriptive terms. Using dictionaries and [[characterology]] publications, Baumgarten identified 1,093 separate terms in the German language used in the description of personality and mental states.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study. | publisher=Psychological Review Company | author1=Allport, G. W.|author2=Odbert, H. S. | year=1936 | location=Albany, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this figure is similar in size to the German and English estimates offered by earlier researchers, [[Gordon Allport]] and Henry S. Odbert revealed this to be a severe underestimate in a 1936 study. Similar to the earlier work of M. L. Perkins, they used [[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's New International Dictionary]] as their source. From this list of approximately 400,000 words, Allport and Odbert identified 17,953 unique terms used to describe personality or behavior.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

This is one of the most influential psycholexical studies in the history of [[Trait theory|trait psychology]].&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; Not only was it the longest, most exhaustive list of personality-descriptive words at the time,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; it was also one of the earliest attempts at classifying English-language terms with the use of psychological principles. Using their list of nearly 18,000 terms, Allport and Odbert separated these into four categories or "columns":&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column I'': This group contains 4,504 terms that describe or are related to personality traits. Being the most important of the four columns to Allport and Odbert and future psychologists,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; its terms most closely relate to those used by modern personality psychologists (e.g., [[Aggression|aggressive]], [[introverted]], sociable). Allport and Odbert suggested that this column represented a minimum rather than final list of trait terms. Because of this, they recommended that other researchers consult the remaining three columns in their studies.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column II'': In contrast with the more stable [[disposition]]s described by terms in Column I, this group includes terms describing present states, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion]]s, and [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] (e.g., rejoicing, frantic). Reflecting this focus on temporary states, [[Present participle#Modern English|present participles]] represent the majority of the 4,541 terms in Column II.

:''Column III'': The largest of the four groups, Column III contains 5,226 words related to social evaluations of an individual's character (e.g., worthy, insignificant). Unlike the previous two columns, this group does not refer to internal psychological attributes of a person. As such, Allport and Odbert acknowledged that Column III did not meet their definition of trait-related terms. Predating the [[person-situation debate]] by over 30 years,&lt;ref name="person-sit2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The person-situation debate in historical and current perspective | author1=Epstein, S.|author2=O'Brien, E. J. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=November 1985 | volume=98 | issue=3 | pages=513–537 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.3.513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allport and Odbert included this group to appease researchers in [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and ethics.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

:''Column IV'': The last of Allport and Odbert's four columns contained 3,682 words. Called the "miscellaneous column" by the authors, Column IV contains important personality-descriptive terms that did not fit into the other three columns. Allport and Odbert offered potential subgroups for terms describing behaviors (e.g., pampered, crazed), [[Somatotype and constitutional psychology|physical qualities associated with psychological traits]] (e.g., lean, roly-poly), and talents or abilities (e.g., gifted, prolific). However, they noted that these subdivisions were not necessarily accurate, as: (i) innumerable subgroups were possible, (ii) these subgroups would not incorporate all of the miscellaneous terms, and (iii) further editing might reveal that these terms ''do'' fit into the other three columns.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

Allport and Odbert did not present these four columns as representing [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] concepts. Many of their nearly 18,000 terms could have been differently classified or placed into multiple categories, particularly those in Columns I and II. Although the authors attempted to remedy this with the aid of three outside editors, the average level of agreement between these independent reviewers was approximately 47%. Noting that each outside judge seemed to have a preferred column, the authors decided to present the classifications performed by Odbert. Rather than try to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] this decision, Allport and Odbert presented the results of their study as somewhat arbitrary and unfinished.&lt;ref name="allport and odbert" /&gt;

====Warren Norman====
Throughout the 1940s, researchers such as [[Raymond Cattell]]&lt;ref name="cattell 1943"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The description of personality: Basic traits resolved into clusters | author=Cattell, R. B. | journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |date=October 1943 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=476–506 | doi=10.1037/h0054116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald W. Fiske|Donald Fiske]]&lt;ref name="fiske 1949"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Consistency of the factorial structures of personality ratings from different sources | author=Fiske, D. W. | journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |date=July 1949 | volume=44 | issue=3 | pages=329–344 | doi=10.1037/h0057198}}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[factor analysis]] to explore the overarching structure of the trait terms in Allport and Odbert's Column I. Rather than rely on the factors obtained by these researchers,&lt;ref name="personality determinants" /&gt; Warren Norman conducted an independent analysis of Allport and Odbert's terms in 1963.&lt;ref name="norman 1963"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1964-00986-001 | title=Toward an adequate taxonomy of personality attributes: Replicated factor structure in peer nomination personality ratings | author=Norman, W.

T. | year=1967 | location=Ann Arbor, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 1961 edition of Webster's International Dictionary, Norman added relevant terms and removed those from Allport and Odbert's list that were no longer in use. This resulted in a source list of approximately 40,000 potential trait-descriptive terms. Using this list, Norman then removed terms that were deemed archaic or obsolete, solely evaluative, overly obscure, dialect-specific, loosely related to personality, and purely physical. By doing so, Norman reduced his original list to 2,797 unique trait-descriptive terms.&lt;ref name="normans descriptors" /&gt; Norman's work would eventually serve as the basis for Dean Peabody and [[Lewis Goldberg|Lewis Goldberg's]] explorations of the Big Five personality traits.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite book | title=Problems with Language Imprecision: New Directions for Methodology of Social and Behavioral Science | publisher=Jossey-Bass | author=Fiske, D.

====Juri Apresjan and the Moscow Semantic School====
In the 1970s, [[:ru:Апресян, Юрий Дереникович|Juri Apresjan]], a thought leader of the Moscow Semantic School, developed the systemic, or systematic, approach to [[lexicography]] which utilizes the concept of ''the language picture of the world''. Also the concept is called ''the naive picture of the world'' in order to stress the non-scientific view of the world which is imprinted in natural language.&lt;ref name="Apresian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Apresi͡an|first=I͡Uriĭ Derenikovich|title=Systematic Lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWPf0c024E8C|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823780-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book "Systematic Lexicography", which was published in English in 2000, J.D.Apresjan puts forward the idea of building dictionaries on the basis of "reconstructing the so-called naive picture of the world, or the "world-view", underlying the partly universal and partly language specific pattern of conceptualizations inherent in any natural language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex1992_1/006_Jurij%20D.%20Apresjan%20-Systemic%20lexicography.pdf |title=Apresjan J. (1992). Systemic Lexicography. In Euralex-92 Proceedings (part 1). p.4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the general world-view can be fragmented into different more local pictures of reality, such as naive geometry, naive physics, naive psychology, and so forth. In particular, one chapter of the book Apresjan allots to the description of lexicographic reconstruction of ''the language picture of the human being'' in the Russian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Apresi͡an|first=I͡Uriĭ Derenikovich|title=Systematic Lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WWPf0c024E8C|accessdate=14 January 2014|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823780-8|pages=101–143|chapter=The Picture of Man as Reconstructed from Linguistic Data: An Attempt at a Systematic Description}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Apresjan's work laid basis for Sergey Golubkov's further attempts to build "the language personality theory"&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/golubkov.html ''the language personality theory'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golubkov S.V. (2002). The language personality theory: An integrative approach to personality on the basis of its language phenomenology. Social Behavior and Personality, 30 (6), 571-578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/expert/psychnews/5_1/pn5_1d.htm Golubkov S. (2000). The Language Model of Personality and its Perspectives Within Psychology. PsychNews International, 5 (1).]&lt;/ref&gt; which would be different from other lexically-based personality theories (e.g. by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, etc.) due to its [[Meronomy|meronomic (partonomic)]] nature versus the [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] nature of the previously mentioned personality theories.&lt;ref&gt;Golubkov S.V. (2002). The language personality theory: An integrative approach to personalityon the basis of its language phenomenology. SocialBehavior and Personality, 30 (6), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts==

===Philosophy===
Concepts similar to the lexical hypothesis are at the root of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref name="de raad"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five big, Big Five issues: Rationale, content, structure, status, and crosscultural assessment | author=De Raad, B. | journal=European Psychologist |date=June 1998 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=113–124 | doi=10.1027/1016-9040.3.2.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the use of the lexical hypothesis to understand personality, ordinary language philosophers propose that philosophical problems can be solved or better understood through an exploration of everyday language. In his essay "A Plea for Excuses," [[J. L. Austin]] cited three main justifications for this approach: words are tools, words are not only facts or things, and commonly used words "embod[y] all the distinctions men have found worth drawing...we are using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our perception of, though not as the final arbiter of, the phenomena."&lt;ref name="philosophical papers"&gt;{{cite book | title=Philosophical Papers | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Austin, J. L. | authorlink=A Plea for Excuses | year=1970 | location=London | pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}}

==Criticism==
Despite its widespread use in the study of personality, the lexical hypothesis has been challenged for a number of reasons. The following list describes some of the major critiques levelled against the lexical hypothesis and personality models founded on psycholexical studies.&lt;ref name="defence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de raad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="history of pers"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Personality Psychology: Theory, Science, and Research from Hellenism to the Twenty-first Century | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Dumont, F. | authorlink=Trait theories and the psychology of individual differences. | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=149–182 | isbn=978-0-521-11632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the lexical hypothesis uses verbal descriptors in investigation of behavioural individual differences is viewed as a methodological flaw in this method when applied to personality theory.&lt;ref name=Plos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2014|title=Observer bias: an interaction of temperament traits with biases in the semantic perception of lexical material.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9 | issue = 1 | pages=e85677. |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677|pmid=24475048|pmc=3903487}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there is a natural pro-social bias of language in people’s verbal evaluations. Language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization, the exchange of information and the synchronization of group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behaviour: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into a largest factor in any language, and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in [[emotionality]] (i.e., most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language. Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Plos"/&gt; This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model of personality (i.e., Extraversion and Neuroticism) might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed. 
* Many traits of psychological importance are too complex to be encoded into single terms or used in everyday language.&lt;ref name="block"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A contrarian view of the five-factor approach to personality description. | author=Block, J. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=March 1995 | volume=117 | issue=2 | pages=187–215 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.187 | pmid=7724687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, an entire text may be the only way to accurately capture and reflect some important personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="mccrae openness"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Openness to experience: Expanding the boundaries of Factor V | author=McCrae, R.

* Laypeople use personality-descriptive terms in an ambiguous manner.&lt;ref name="westen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psychsystems.net/Publications/1996/2.%20uncovering%20the%20nomothetic%20from%20the%20idiographic_Westen_jrnl%20of%20research%20in%20pers%201996.pdf | title=A model and a method for uncovering the nomothetic from the idiographic: An alternative to the Five-Factor Model | author=Westen, D. | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | date=September 1996 | volume=30 | issue=3 | pages=400–413 | doi=10.1006/jrpe.1996.0028 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507121610/http://www.psychsystems.net/Publications/1996/2.%20uncovering%20the%20nomothetic%20from%20the%20idiographic_Westen_jrnl%20of%20research%20in%20pers%201996.pdf | archivedate=7 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many of the terms used in psycholexical studies are too ambiguous to be useful in a psychological context.&lt;ref name="ordinary language"&gt;{{cite book | title=Personality Description in Ordinary Language | publisher=WIley | author=Bromley, D. B. | year=1977 | location=London | isbn=9780471994435}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The lexical hypothesis relies on terms that were not developed by experts.&lt;ref name="history of pers" /&gt; As such, any models developed with the lexical hypothesis reflect lay perceptions rather than expert psychological knowledge.&lt;ref name="westen" /&gt;
* Language accounts for a minority of communication and is inadequate to describe much of human experience.&lt;ref name="mehrabian"&gt;{{cite book | title=Silent Messages | publisher=Wadsworth | author=Mehrabian, A. | year=1971 | location=Belmont, CA | isbn=0-534-00910-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mechanisms that led to the development of personality lexicons are poorly understood.&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;
* Personality-descriptive terms change over time and differ in meaning across dialects, languages, and cultures.&lt;ref name="lexical history" /&gt;
* The methods used to test the lexical hypothesis are unscientific.&lt;ref name="westen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="versus"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Big Five versus nobody? | author1=Shadel, W.

* Personality-descriptive language is too broad to be captured with a single [[Part of speech|word class]],&lt;ref name="de raad 2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Personality-descriptive verbs | author1=De Raad, B.|author2=Mulder, E.|author3=Kloosterman, K.|author4=Hofstee, W.

Any novel with over 500,000 words has a justified place in this article. Removing qualified entries would simply encourage other editors to revoke the change or lead to an unnecessary edit war. Please do not add any more novels under 500,000 words in length. This is an article on the longest novels, not just any long novel. --&gt;
This is a '''list of the longest novels''' over 500,000 words published through a mainstream publisher. The longest [[novel]] is ''[[Artamène|Artamène ou le Grand Cyrus]]'', originally published (1649–54) in ten parts, each part in three volumes. ''Artamène'' is generally attributed to [[Madeleine de Scudéry]].&lt;ref&gt;The name of her brother [[Georges de Scudéry|Georges]] appeared on the title page, and he is sometimes credited as a co-author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composing a list of longest novels yields different results depending on whether pages, words or characters are counted. Length of a book is typically associated with its size—specifically page count—leading many to assume the largest and thickest book equates to its length. [[Word count]] is a direct way to measure the length of a novel in a manner unaffected by variations of format and page size.

==Comparison of methods==
Three possible ways to determine length exist and each has its own method for determining length. Character counts are at best estimations of spaces, written characters and punctuation; Guinness World Records uses this criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/1/longest-novel | title=Longest novel | publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com | date=1912-01-01 | accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word counts is another method that counts each word and omits punctuation, but still considered an estimation for length. Using computer software to count words is the current preferred method for academia and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agentquery.com/format_tips.aspx | title=Find the Agent Who Will Find You a Publisher | publisher=AgentQuery | accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An arbitrary way is to assume that a standard formatted page with 12 pt Courier font and double-spaced lines is 250 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/hitting-the-target-word-count-in-your-college-admi.html | title=Hitting the Target Word Count in Your College Admission Essay – For Dummies | publisher=Dummies.com | date=2008-11-07 | accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to formatting, page counts are subject to change from font, style, formatting or paper size of the published work and cannot be considered a measure of length despite it being the easiest physical indicator of length. For the purposes of this list, word counts are ideal. Page counts are a relative indicator of length; for proper comparison the page size will be included.

Some difficulty is created when comparing word counts across different writing systems. The logographic [[Chinese characters]] used to write East Asian languages each represent one ''morpheme'' and are not separated by spaces. The same character may at times stand for one word, and other times form part of a larger word. For instance the characters ''zhong'' 中 and ''guo'' 囯 can be used independently to mean "middle" and "kingdom", respectively, but can also be combined into ''Zhongguo'' 中囯, "China" (i.e. "The Middle Kingdom"). One could theoretically construct a noun phrase ''Zhongguo zhong guo'' 中囯中囯 meaning "kingdoms in the middle of China". The absence of any formal marking of word boundaries means that it would be difficult to mechanically determine if such a phrase consists of two, three, or four words without knowing [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. East Asian bibliographies therefore generally give only the ''character count'' without attempting any ''word count''.

While a rough approximation might seemingly be gotten from citing the word count of a ''translation'' into a Latin alphabet language like [[English language|English]], this is hazardous as the great grammatical and stylistic differences between the languages might cause one to require more or fewer words to convey the same meaning as the other. Citing a translation only indicates how many words are required to convey the same ''meaning'' in the target text, not how many words the source text actually consists of.

==Definitions==
What counts as a novel is another variable. For the purposes of the list, a "novel" is defined as a single work in print or electronic form that has been published through a mainstream publisher, one that has acquired publishing rights from authors. A "single work" includes works thought of as one novel by the author, but published in multiple volumes for reasons of convenience.

Excluded are [[self-published]], [[print on demand|printed-on-demand]], [[Vanity press|vanity]] works, unpublished novels like [[Henry Darger]]'s, [[novel sequence]]s like the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]'', novel cycles such as those set in the ''[[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond]]'' universe, and record-grabbing stunts. Also not included are any Internet novel (mainly in China).{{clarify|date=June 2015}}

'''''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Metaru Gia Soriddo Faibu Fantomu Pein''|メタルギアソリッドV ファントムペイン|extra="Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain"}}}} is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game]] developed by [[Kojima Productions]] and published by [[Konami]]. It was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 1, 2015. It is the ninth installment in the [[Metal Gear series|series]] that was directed, written and designed by [[Hideo Kojima]] following ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes]]'', a stand-alone prologue released the previous year, as well as his final work at Konami.

Set in 1984, nine years after the events of ''Ground Zeroes'' and a decade before the events of the original ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', the story follows mercenary leader [[Venom Snake|Punished "Venom" Snake]] as he ventures into [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-occupied [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Angola]]–[[Zaire]] border region to exact revenge on the people who destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax of ''Ground Zeroes''. It carries over the tagline of ''Tactical Espionage Operations'' first used in ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker]]''.

''The Phantom Pain'' was critically acclaimed upon release, with its gameplay drawing praise for featuring a variety of [[Game mechanics|mechanics]] and interconnected systems which allow a high degree of player freedom in approaching objectives. While the story was acknowledged for its emotional power and exploration of mature [[Theme (narrative)|themes]], it drew criticism from some critics for its lack of focus, with further scrutiny over its second half and ending that left several plot points unresolved; this was linked to conclusive evidence of removed content, which led some to suggest that the game was released unfinished. Despite this, ''The Phantom Pain'' received perfect review scores from several publications and was described by some critics to be the greatest stealth game of all time. A complete edition that bundles ''The Phantom Pain'' and ''Ground Zeroes'' together, titled ''Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience'', was released in October 2016.

== Gameplay ==
''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]], [[Stealth game|stealth]] game in which players take the role of Punished "Venom" Snake from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-10-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-reveals-open-world-gameplay|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain reveals open world gameplay|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=October 6, 2013|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay elements were largely unchanged from ''Ground Zeroes'', meaning that players will have to sneak from several points in the game world, avoiding enemy guards, and remaining undetected.&lt;ref name="Bino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/why_metal_gear_solid_5_the_phantom_pain_isnt_just_a_bigger_ground_zeroes_2.html|title=Why Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain isn't just a bigger Ground Zeroes|first=Steven|last=Burns|work=VideoGamer.com|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905141052/http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/why_metal_gear_solid_5_the_phantom_pain_isnt_just_a_bigger_ground_zeroes_2.html#|archive-date=2015-09-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in Snake's repertoire are binoculars, maps, a variety of weapons, explosives, and stealth-based items such as cardboard boxes and decoys.&lt;ref name="Bino"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/metal-gear-solid-5-delivers-spectacular-open-world-stealth/|title=Metal Gear Solid 5 delivers spectacular open world stealth|first=Matthew|last=Pellett|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following one of the series traditions, ''The Phantom Pain'' encourages players to progress through the game without killing, using non-lethal weapons such as tranquilizer darts to subdue enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/metal-gear-solid-gets-bigger-and-better-in-the-phantom-pain/|title=Metal Gear Solid gets bigger and better in The Phantom Pain|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may traverse the game world with vehicles such as jeeps and tanks, in addition to traveling on foot or on horseback, and as certain locations are mountainous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2459312,00.asp|title=Eyes On With 'Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'|first=Jeffery|last=L.

As in ''Peace Walker'', ''The Phantom Pain'' features a base-building system that allows players to develop weapons and items from their home base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-11-managing-mother-base-in-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain|title=Managing Mother Base in Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment of enemy soldiers and [[prisoner of war|prisoners]] has also returned for this purpose, allowing the base to grow through organization. The player is given the option to access their base from their real-life smartphones and other devices via a companion app.&lt;ref name="demo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes to feature base-building, will support multiple devices|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-27-metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-to-feature-base-building-will-support-multiple-devices|first=Jonathan|last=Toyad|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in ''Peace Walker'' where players can only see Mother Base from the air, they can control Snake as he explores the complex on foot. The [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], an item introduced into gameplay in ''Peace Walker,'' returns as well, with players able to transport captured soldiers and other objects such as animals and vehicles back to Mother Base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/06/12/recruiting-goats-and-researching-cardboard-in-metal-gear-solid-5/|title=Recruiting goats and researching cardboard in Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain|first=Xav|last=De Mato|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money for upgrading Mother Base's defenses and technology can be collected from objects found all over the map, such as diamonds, shipping containers, and special blueprint boxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/how-mother-bases-units-help-snake-mgs-5/|title=How Mother Base’s units help Snake in MGS 5|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=June 28, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sending recruited soldiers on combat missions around the world. The income is invested in upgrades to the appearance and abilities, weapons and equipment of Snake, his AI companions, and vehicles. For example, Snake's prosthetic arm can be modified with a taser, echolocation function, or remote controls that allow it to fly as a drone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEqdbKg3K8Y|title=Metal Gear Solid V - African Jungle Gameplay w/ Dev Commentary|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MGSV: TPP - Freedom of Infiltration Gameplay Demo|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=pqu0nRb0puM?t=1365|website=YouTube|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enemy AI has improved in terms of situational awareness. If players frequently use particular weapons or tactics to subdue enemy soldiers, this will see the enemy increase in numbers and be outfitted with better equipment; for example, the frequent use of headshots will see enemy soldiers don metal helmets to make targeting the head harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/gamescom-2014-metal-gear-solid-5s-tower-defence-style-multiplayer|title=Gamescom 2014: Metal Gear Solid 5's Tower Defense Style Multiplayer|first=Alex|last=Simmons|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 13, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle that runs in real-time.&lt;ref name="Gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-includes-mother-base-day-night-cycle-6397373 |title=Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes includes Mother Base, day/night cycle |last=Cocker |first=Guy |date=28 September 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016015329/http://www.gamespot.com/news/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-includes-mother-base-day-night-cycle-6397373 |archivedate=October 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle is able to be fast-forwarded when Snake lights a "Phantom Cigar", a type of [[electronic cigarette|electronic cigar]]; a digital silver [[Seiko]] [[watch]] panel appears on screen to denote time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-15-hours-in-af/1100-6427900/|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain - 15 Hours in Afghanistan|first=Peter|last=Brown|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of time enables players to analyze the movement of marked enemy forces in the area, such as shifts in sentry patrols and individual patrol routes. Weather effects, such as sandstorms and rain, affects the gameplay environment by reducing visibility or masking the sound of footsteps.&lt;ref name="africa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-we-learned-from-the-metal-gear-solid-5-/1100-6422426/|title=Everything We Learned From the Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain TGS 2014 Trailer|last=Hindes|first=Daniel|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A game design direction allows the player to choose in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order they like, and yet still "understand the encompassing message by the end".&lt;ref name="Nyxus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metalgearsolid.nl/?p=4571 |title=Interviews from Dubai: Kojima on Gray Fox game, story telling in Ground Zeroes, next gen and more |last=Nyxus |date=20 January 2013 |publisher=Metal Gear Solid Unofficial Site |accessdate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208224458/http://metalgearsolid.nl/?p=4571 |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saudigamer.com/2013/01/19/hideo-kojima-meeting/|title=My meeting with one of the greatest game directors: Hideo Kojima|last=Dubayan|date=19 January 2013|publisher=Saudi Gamer|accessdate=20 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515102539/http://saudigamer.com/2013/01/19/hideo-kojima-meeting |archive-date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojima spoke about the restrictive nature of previous ''Metal Gear Solid'' titles, saying that they "set [the player] on one rail to get from point A to point B, with a certain amount of freedom between". In stark contrast, ''The Phantom Pain'' offers players new ways of traversal and sneaking methods, such as taking a motorcycle, plane or helicopter to the mission area (however, usage of the former two vehicles was later dropped during development). Players are able to traverse the game world or deploy directly to landing zones that allow for different approaches. A video published after the E3 2015 convention showcased this, with the same mission played four times in a number of different ways: with the player opting for stealth, launching a direct assault via helicopter gunship, attempting to assassinate a target with a sniper rifle, and smuggling an explosive device into an enemy base by way of an unsuspecting patrol vehicle crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MGSV: TPP - Freedom of Infiltration Gameplay Demo|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=pqu0nRb0puM?t=27m19s|website=YouTube|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's actions affect the wider game world; for example, sabotaging a radar installation will open up new entry points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinha|first=Ravi|title=Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes: "Ultimate Goal is To Give Players More Freedom"|url=http://gamingbolt.com/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-ultimate-goal-is-to-give-players-more-freedom|publisher=GamingBolt|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The playable world in ''The Phantom Pain'' is two hundred times larger than that of ''Ground Zeroes'', featuring a variety of climate conditions and environments. This allows the players to freely roam the map while proceeding to either story missions or sidequests, as in other games with [[nonlinear gameplay]]. In addition, players who have previously played ''Ground Zeroes'' are able to import save data into ''The Phantom Pain'' and gain special perks.&lt;ref name="Famitsu feature"&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-04-10|url=http://gematsu.com/2014/04/famitsu-feature-truth-rumors-2014|title=Famitsu feature: The Truth of the Rumors 2014|publisher=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'' includes two multiplayer modes: first, the new ''[[Metal Gear Online]]'', developed by Kojima Productions' newly formed Los Angeles division (now known as Konami Los Angeles Studio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/414360/interviews/e3-interview-kojima-on-mgs-5|title=E3 Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first footage for multiplayer was revealed in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/06/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-multiplayer-revealed|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain Multiplayer Revealed|work=IGN.com|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-kojimaremoved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/19/8257283/metal-gear-solid-konami-branding|title=Metal Gear Solid creator's involvement in series questioned, Konami removes branding|website=Polygon|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally set for launch alongside the release of ''The Phantom Pain'', ''Metal Gear Online'' was postponed to October 6 for consoles and January 2016 for Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid 5's Multiplayer Won't Be Available at Launch|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-5s-multiplayer-wont-be-available-/1100-6429413/|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second multiplayer mode is an extension of the Mother Base base-building feature. Players are able to expand their operations to include "Forward Operating Bases" which can be used to generate resources and income for the single-player campaign.&lt;ref name="GIFOBMGO3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/metal_gear_solid_v_the_phantom_pain/b/playstation4/archive/2015/06/18/new-intel-for-metal-gear-online.aspx|title=[Update] The Real Intel On Metal Gear V's Forward Operating Bases|first=Matthew|last=Kato|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities can be attacked by other players, making a player-versus-player mode available whereby the attacking team attempts to steal resources and/or soldiers and the defending team tries to protect the Forward Operating Base from the intruder. Defenders are able to call on their friends to aid in the defense, especially if their Forward Operating Base is attacked during a story mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/08/06/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-mmo-fob-invade-players/|title=Invade other players’ worlds in FOB, Metal Gear Solid 5’s "MMO mode"|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are able to customize the security, staffing, and layout of their Forward Operating Bases, allowing for a large number of compound configurations. Following the success or failure of the intrusion, the location of the attacking player's Forward Operating Base is revealed to the defending player;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-s-mother-base-3423047|title=Everything you need to know about Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain's Mother Base|first=Mike|last=Splechta|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, defending players can only launch a retaliatory strike if the attacker was discovered during their infiltration. The Forward Operating Base feature is an entirely separate multiplayer experience to ''Metal Gear Online''&lt;ref name="GIFOBMGO3"/&gt; and is also needed to increase the number of combat units the player can deploy.

During development, Kojima Productions and Konami attracted criticism for their decision to include [[microtransactions]]; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players who may not have the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-5-gets-info-about-bases-microtran/1100-6429588/|title=Metal Gear Solid 5 Gets Info About Bases, Microtransactions, Online Functionality|first=Alex|last=Newhouse|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall,&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an [[Pay to win|accelerator]] rather than a paywall.&lt;ref name="refuted"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/mgs-5-the-phantom-pains-multiplayer-is-not-behind-a-paywall/|title=''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain''{{'s}} multiplayer is not behind a paywall|first=Phil|last=Savage|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the events of ''Ground Zeroes'' and the destruction of [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Outer Heaven|Militaires Sans Frontières]] (commonly abbreviated as MSF), [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]/[[Akio Ōtsuka]]) falls into a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ishaan|title=Metal Gear Solid V Trailer Is Ground Zeroes + The Phantom Pain|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/03/27/metal-gear-solid-v-trailer-is-ground-zeroes-the-phantom-pain/|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, he awakens and helps lead a new mercenary group, [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Diamond Dogs|Diamond Dogs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rich Stanton |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/17/metal-gear-solid-games-creator-hideo-kojima-konami |title=Whatever happened to Metal Gear Solid games creator Hideo Kojima? &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting the codename "[[Venom Snake]]", he ventures into [[Afghanistan]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan War]] and the [[Angola]]&amp;mdash;[[Zaire]] border region during the [[Angolan Civil War]] to track down the men responsible for MSF's destruction. Along the way, he becomes reacquainted with his former rival [[Revolver Ocelot|Ocelot]] ([[Troy Baker]]/[[Satoshi Mikami]]) and encounters [[Quiet (Metal Gear)|Quiet]] ([[Stefanie Joosten]]), an assassin and sniper with supernatural abilities. While he and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Master Miller|Kazuhira Miller]] ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]/[[Tomokazu Sugita]]) are initially driven to exact revenge, Snake soon unearths a plot by the [[Patriots (Metal Gear)|Patriots organization]] to develop a new model of the [[Metal Gear (weapon)|Metal Gear]] system known as the ST-84 "Sahelanthropus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wales |first=Matt |title=Metal Gear Solid 5 - Sahelanthropus boss fight and how to beat the final mission |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-02-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-skull-face-okb-zero-gates-sneaking-suit-4014?page=2 |date=March 10, 2017 |access-date=December 29, 2017 |journal=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of characters in the Metal Gear series}}
In contrast to previous ''Metal Gear'' installments, Kojima Productions conducted the [[voice acting]] and [[motion capture]] with English-speaking actors and stuntmen first. While [[facial motion capture|facial capturing]] was used before for ''Metal Gear Solid 4'', it was done separately from the actual voice acting. The Japanese voice acting was dubbed over the English cast's performance afterward, in contrast to previous releases in the series since ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', which had the characters' vocal and facial expressions lip-synched specifically to both, Japanese and English voice acting.

=== Synopsis ===
In 1984, nine years after the events of ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes]]'', [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]] awakens from a coma in a hospital in [[Cyprus]]. [[Quiet (Metal Gear)|Quiet]], a Cipher assassin, tries to kill him, but Big Boss is rescued by a heavily bandaged man called Ishmael. The pair escapes the hospital while evading pursuit from Cipher's soldiers and two superhumans, [[Psycho Mantis|Tretij Rebenok, the "Third Child"]] and [[Colonel Volgin|the "Man on Fire"]]. Although Big Boss loses sight of Ishmael, he is recovered by his ally [[Revolver Ocelot]] and brought aboard [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Diamond Dogs|Diamond Dogs]], a new mercenary group founded by [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Master Miller|Kazuhira Miller]] on an offshore platform near [[Seychelles]].

Big Boss adopts the code name "[[Venom Snake]]" and begins searching for Cipher. During his journey, Snake becomes involved in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-Afghan]] and the [[Angolan Civil War|Angolan Civil]] Wars, and he recruits Quiet, who no longer speaks and has gained superhuman abilities; scientist [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Huey|Dr. Huey Emmerich]]; and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Code Talker|Code Talker]], a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] expert on parasites forced to work for Cipher. [[Liquid Snake|Eli]], a British child believed to be [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Les Enfants Terrible|a clone of Snake]], who leads a band of child soldiers is brought to the base after an operation. Though there is speculation into whether or not he is Big Boss's son, a DNA test confirms that Venom Snake and Eli are not genetically related.

Snake learns that Cipher's leader Major Zero was usurped and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#XOF|XOF]], a rogue faction of Cipher, was responsible for destroying MSF. XOF's leader [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Skull Face|Skull Face]] considers Cipher's plan to unite the world for peace as the same as making it culturally American, obliterating other cultures. To avoid this, he intends to release a unique parasite that kills anyone who speaks [[English language|English]]. A modified parasite was used to give Quiet and Skull Face's elite soldiers, the Skulls, their unusual abilities. After releasing the English strain parasite, Skull Face plans to make nuclear weapons available to as many groups as he can, believing that [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]] will stop the weapons actually being used, attaining world peace while still protecting the integrity of each culture. However, he will secretly retain remote control of the weapons. Skull Face intends to use the threat of the latest Metal Gear system, known as ST-84 "Sahelanthropus", to make nuclear weapons desirable again, but as he cannot get it to function, he is dependent on the Third Child's psychic abilities to manipulate it.

During a test, the Third Child turns against Skull Face, having Sahelanthropus seriously wound him and crush the Man on Fire. Although Snake defeats the Metal Gear, he is only able to recover one of Skull Face's three parasite vials; one goes missing and the other is taken by the Third Child and given to Eli. Skull Face is left to die by Snake and Miller but Huey executes him. The Diamond Dogs return to their base with Sahelanthropus. Following their return, Eli, the Third Child, and the child soldiers steal Sahelanthropus and flee the base. It transpires that the Third Child was not consciously working for Skull Face, but his psychic powers enthralled him to the will of the most vengeful person nearby, meaning Sahelanthropus's attack was instigated by Eli.

An epidemic of parasites occurs on base forcing Snake to personally kill many of his own men to contain it. To honor them, he has their cremated remains turned into diamonds to carry into battle. Huey is accused of causing the epidemic while attempting to mutate the parasites to sell as weapons. Alongside suspicion of his role in MSF's destruction, and evidence that he murdered his wife [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove]] while arguing over using [[Otacon|their son]] in experiments, Snake exiles him from Diamond Dogs. Following this event, Quiet disappears in Afghanistan. Code Talker reveals that Quiet was infected with the English strain parasite with the intention of joining Diamond Dogs in order to spread it, but her allegiance shifted to Snake and so she remained silent to prevent an outbreak. Huey's mutation of the parasite convinced Quiet that she could not guarantee the safety of Diamond Dogs. Snake finds Quiet captured by Soviet soldiers and frees her only to be attacked an onslaught of armored vehicles. They defeat the wave but as another one approaches they are forced to hide in a sandstorm. Quiet is then forced to speak to summon help when Snake is bitten by a venomous snake. She disappears into the desert to avoid causing another epidemic.

It is later revealed that Venom Snake is not actually Big Boss but a loyal MSF medic caught in the same explosion that injured the real Big Boss, Ishmael. During his coma, the medic was transformed into a second Big Boss via [[plastic surgery]] and [[hypnotherapy]] to serve as a decoy for the actual Big Boss while he wages a covert war against Cipher. On behalf of the real Big Boss, Venom Snake goes on to set the events of the [[Metal Gear (video game)|Outer Heaven uprising]] in motion and dies at the hands of [[Solid Snake]]. The original Big Boss resurfaces during the [[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake|Zanzibar Land disturbance]]. Miller and Ocelot discuss Big Boss' plans to create Outer Heaven. While Ocelot remains supportive, Miller is disgusted at his former ally's deception but agrees to continue assisting Venom Snake and Big Boss's sons in hopes of contributing to the real Big Boss's downfall.

In February 2012, a site owned by Konami, "Development Without Borders", promoted development for a new ''Metal Gear'' title, for "The "next" MGS". The site was recruiting staff for the 2012 [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] pavilion in March, and requested applications for several positions for the latest ''Metal Gear Solid'' targeted for "high-end consoles" and "next-gen Fox engine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-next-metal-gear-solid-targets-high-end-consoles-next-gen-fox-engine|title=Next Metal Gear Solid targets "high-end consoles", "next-gen" Fox engine|last=Purchese|first=Robert|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=22 February 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/22/kojima-productions-hiring-for-next-metal-gear-solid|title=Kojima Productions Hiring For "Next" Metal Gear Solid|last=Reilly|first=Luke|publisher=IGN|date=22 February 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the year went on, screenshots and videos of the newly announced [[Fox Engine]] were unveiled by the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-02-hideo-kojima-shows-off-impressive-fox-engine-screenshots|title=Hideo Kojima shows off impressive Fox Engine screenshots|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=2 March 2012|publisher=EuroGamer.net|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This media demonstrated many random settings and characters, although none related to the ''Metal Gear'' series.

Konami unveiled ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes|Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes]]'' at a private function celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ''Metal Gear'' series on August 30, 2012.

In an interview with [[VG247]], Kojima expressed concerns over whether or not ''Ground Zeroes'' would be released. He claimed that his aim was to target taboos and mature themes, which he considered to be "quite risky", adding that his roles as creator and producer were in conflict with one another; as creator, Kojima wanted to take the risk of exploring themes that might alienate audiences, but as producer, he had to be able to tone down the content in order to sell as many copies of the game as possible. Ultimately, the role of creator won out, and Kojima described his approach as "prioritizing creativity over sales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/02/22/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-will-tackle-many-taboos-may-not-release/|title=Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes will tackle many taboos, may not release in its current state|last=Akerman|first=Nick|date=22 February 2013|publisher=VG247|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalgearsolidtv.com/2013/02/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-may-not.html|title=Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes - May Not Release In Its Current State And New Spin-offs, Possibly With The Boss|date=22 February 2013|publisher=MGSTV|accessdate=22 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225202222/http://www.metalgearsolidtv.com/2013/02/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes-may-not.html|archivedate=25 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latestnewsexplorer.com/mgs-ground-zeroes-tackles-lots-of-taboos/|title=Konami: Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes Tackles Lots of Taboos, Risky To Be Released|last=MoStWaNteD|date=22 February 2013|publisher=Latest News Explorer|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] in December 2012, a teaser trailer for a game known as ''The Phantom Pain'' was shown, credited to a new Swedish developer known as Moby Dick Studio, and was described as being "100% gameplay". Allegedly led by Joakim Mogren, the studio's mission statement read that it aimed to "deliver an uncompromising, exciting, and touching game experience to people all around the globe."&lt;ref name="Gamespot2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-phantom-pain-revealed-6401275 |title=The Phantom Pain revealed |last=Makuch |first=Eddie |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209075903/http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-phantom-pain-revealed-6401275 |archivedate=December 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the presentation, commentators speculated that ''The Phantom Pain'' was actually a ''Metal Gear'' game, noting the protagonist's resemblance to [[Big Boss (Metal Gear)|Big Boss]], graphics similar to those produced by the Fox Engine, the quote "V has come to" at the end of the trailer, and that the title ''Metal Gear Solid V'' fits in the [[negative space]] and indentations of the game's logo when using the same font.&lt;ref name="Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/08/the-phantom-pain-metal-gear-solid-v|title=The Phantom Pain = Metal Gear Solid V?|last=Moriarty|first=Colin|publisher=IGN|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Evangelho|first=Jason|title='The Phantom Pain' Is Kojima's Viral Teaser for 'Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2012/12/07/the-phantom-pain-is-kojimas-viral-teaser-for-metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes/|publisher=[[Forbes.com|Forbes]]|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Joakim" was an anagram of "Kojima", the [[domain name]] for the studio's website had only been registered about two weeks prior to the announcement, and that several people wearing Moby Dick Studio shirts were sitting in a VIP area intended for Konami staff.&lt;ref name="Info" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joystiq"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|title=The Phantom Pain speculation round-up: Metal Gear?!|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/08/the-phantom-pain-speculation-round-up-metal-gea|publisher=Joystiq|date=8 December 2012|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hideo Kojima stated he was impressed by the trailer and how Mogren was inspired by ''Metal Gear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/feature/7036/Hideo-Kojima-Talks-MGR-FOX-Engine-and-Phantom-Pain|title=Hideo Kojima Talks MGR, FOX Engine, and Phantom Pain|last=Abu Nahel|first=Hakim|publisher=IGN|date=1 January 2013|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An actor playing a heavily bandaged Mogren appeared in an interview on the March 14, 2013 episode of ''[[GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley|GameTrailers TV]]''; while stating that he could not reveal many details, he confirmed that more details about ''The Phantom Pain'' would be revealed at the upcoming Game Developers Conference, and showed a series of screenshots on an [[iPad]] to the show's host [[Geoff Keighley]]. After Keighley pointed out the Fox Engine logo in the screenshots, Mogren appeared nervous and the segment abruptly ended.&lt;ref name="The Phantom Pain runs on Fox Engine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/2m4qao/the-phantom-pain-joakim-mogren-interview|title=The Phantom Pain Video - Joakim Mogren Interview|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2013, at GDC 2013, Kojima confirmed that his studio was behind the trailer, and announced that ''Metal Gear Solid V'' would be two separate games; ''Ground Zeroes'' would now serve as a prologue for the main game, which was officially announced as ''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain''.&lt;ref name="groundzeroesseperate-gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Zeroes and Phantom Pain two different games|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ground-zeroes-and-phantom-pain-two-different-games/1100-6406157/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cvg-phantompain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain revealed|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/398237/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-revealed/|publisher=CVG.com|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently presented a trailer for the game and showcased the [[Fox Engine]].&lt;ref name="vg247-phantompainreveal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain – Kojima speaks|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/03/27/metal-gear-ground-zeroes-through-the-eyes-of-a-fox/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer featured the song "Not Your Kind of People" from [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]]'s 2012 [[Not Your Kind of People|album of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-v-is-official-fox-vs-xof-update-t-461177345|title=Metal Gear Solid V Is Official - FOX vs. XOF (UPDATE: Trailer added)|publisher=Kotaku|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/317195455392002049/photo/1 |title=Hideo Kojima on Twitter: Many people I met at party had already downloaded the song "Not your kind of people/Garbage", that I used in my MGS5 trailer.

While the official trailer announcing the game was running on a PC, the game was released for the seventh and eighth generations of video game consoles. In an interview during E3 2013, when asked about a PC release Kojima stated "We are making it, and it will be on par with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions."&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Metal Gear Solid 5's intro to hear Kiefer Sutherland as Snake|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/9/24/4768178/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-intro-kiefer-sutherland-snake|publisher=Polygon|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he made it clear that the PC port was not their priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E3 2013: Kojima Interview|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/lpco6n/metal-gear-solid-v--the-phantom-pain-e3-2013--kojima-interview|first=|last=|work=[[GameTrailers]]|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima confirmed that the visuals seen in the trailer would look close to those in the final game. He also stated that he would like ''Metal Gear Solid V'' to be his final ''Metal Gear'' game, noting that unlike previous titles where he had announced that he had finished making games in the series, only to return for subsequent games, his involvement with the franchise would be over this time around. Although the trailer had Snake suffering from hallucinations in the form of a flaming whale, Kojima assured that there would be a balance in realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Kojima Interview|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/84h9k6/metal-gear-solid-v--the-phantom-pain-kojima-interview|first=|last=|work=[[GameTrailers]]|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima later revealed that ''The Phantom Pain'' was initially presented as an independent game so as to assess the public and industry response to the [[Fox Engine]], as he felt that announcing the game as part of ''Metal Gear Solid V'' would bias reactions to the engine.

On June 10, 2013, at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013]], a fourth trailer was shown at the [[Microsoft]] press conference, demonstrating the new play mechanics, as well as the cast of characters. The development of an [[Xbox One]] version was also announced at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 2013: Metal Gear Solid V Coming To Xbox One|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/06/10/e3-2013-metal-gear-solid-v-coming-to-xbox-one|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[PlayStation 4]] version was announced the following day when Konami uploaded the red band version of the trailer on their YouTube channel in addition to the standard green band version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stanyon|first=Matt|title=Metal Gear Solid V E3 2013 Trailer Coming on 12th June 2013|url=http://www.hybridgames.co.uk/metalgearsolid/mgs5/news/e3-2013-trailer-coming-on-12th-june-2013/|publisher=Hybrid Games|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="konamipress_20130612"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konami-digital-entertainment.co.jp/en/news/release/2013/0612/|title=Next-Generation METAL GEAR "METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN" Cutting-Edge Game Consoles "PlayStation®4" and "Xbox One" Confirmed as Release Platform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailers for ''Metal Gear Solid V'' showed the game running on a PC hardware, but according to Kojima with textures and character models somewhat based on [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation hardware]]. The developers aimed to improve the technical quality for the versions released for the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation of consoles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=Kojima: Next-gen versions of Metal Gear Solid 5 will look better than E3 trailer|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4425442/next-gen-metal-gear-solid-5-smartphone-tablet-kojima|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kojima alluded to the game possibly being "too big to clear", adding that the game is "200 [times larger] than ''Ground Zeroes''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dyer |first=Mitch |date=5 March 2014 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/05/kojima-worried-the-phantom-pain-is-too-big-to-finish |title=Kojima Worried The Phantom Pain Is 'Too Big' to Finish |publisher=IGN |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima wanted the player to connect with Snake in ''The Phantom Pain''. To accomplish this, the loss of Mother Base, which the player developed throughout ''Peace Walker'', would serve as motivation for revenge for both Snake and the player. Kojima also tried making Snake relatable to newcomers of the series by making him unaware of what happened in the nine years during which he was in a coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/467996/interviews/interview-hideo-kojima-on-darker-themes-and-phantom-cigars/|title=Interview: Hideo Kojima on darker themes and phantom cigars|publisher=Computer and Video Games|author=Mike Jackson|date=2014-06-12|accessdate=25 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817122624/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/467996/interviews/interview-hideo-kojima-on-darker-themes-and-phantom-cigars/|archivedate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons, vehicles and other armaments are unlicensed and fictional in ''The Phantom Pain'', just as they were in ''Ground Zeroes'', unlike previous ''Metal Gear Solid'' games that included mostly real-world based weaponry.

On June 9, 2014, at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014|E3 2014]], a fifth cinematic trailer featuring [[Mike Oldfield]]'s song "[[Man on the Rocks#Singles and promotion|Nuclear]]" was shown at the [[Sony]] press conference, unveiling more plot details surrounding the Diamond Dogs and Snake's antagonistic descent. It was leaked a day earlier, due to an accidental post from Konami's official [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plunkett|first1=Luke|title=Metal Gear Solid V's E3 Trailer Isn't Waiting For E3|url=http://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vs-e3-trailer-isnt-waiting-for-e3-1587962381|website=Kotaku|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the new trailer, the official site for ''Metal Gear Solid V'' was updated and included new information and images such as the developmental progress of the in-game map and the evolution of Snake's design across all games in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress: ''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Paim'' &amp;mdash; Official Site|url=http://www.konami.jp/mgs5/tpp/en/progress/index.php5|website=Metal Gear Solid V - Official Site|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25, 2015, Kojima released a launch trailer showing "Metal Gear's Evolution and Harmony" with clips from the previous games along with the reveal of the new "Metal Gear Sahelanthropus".

Over $80 million was spent on the development of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin-Poole|first1=Wesley|title=New article on Konami paints a bleak picture|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-03-new-article-on-konami-paints-a-bleak-picture|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=3 August 2015|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Discography of the Metal Gear series#Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack}}

The music of ''The Phantom Pain'' was produced by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]], making it his fourth ''Metal Gear'' title, and composed by Ludvig Forssell, [[Justin Burnett]], and Daniel James. Also featured in ''The Phantom Pain'' are collectable music tapes the player can listen to in-game, with a mixture of licensed music from the era, and music from past ''Metal Gear'' titles.

''Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack'' was released on September 2nd, 2015, containing 50 tracks selected from both ''Ground Zeroes'' and ''The Phantom Pain''. Following this on December 23rd, 2015, was ''Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack'', containing 114 tracks again selected from both ''Metal Gear Solid V'' games. Finally, ''Metal Gear Solid V Original Soundtrack The Lost Tapes'' was released on March 30th, 2016, primarily consisting of tracks written by Ludvig Forssell for the in-game cassette tapes. The latter two releases also include music that went unused in the game, with ''Metal Gear Solid V Extended Soundtrack'' in particular containing two tracks from the cut ''Mission 51: Kingdom of the Flies''.

The game's soundtrack later won the award for Best Score/Soundtrack at [[The Game Awards 2015]].&lt;ref name="TGA: Nominees"/&gt; The event also had [[Stefanie Joosten]], Quiet's voice actress, on stage performing "Quiet's Theme".

=== Dispute between Konami and Kojima ===
{{Further|Kojima Productions#Closure}}
In March 2015, Konami announced plans for a corporate restructuring that saw them part ways with Hideo Kojima and his development studio Kojima Productions. As part of the separation, Kojima's name was removed from the game cover, all of its associated paraphernalia and future releases of ''Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes'' and ''Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection''.&lt;ref name="kojima credits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-20-konami-announces-plan-for-brand-new-metal-gear-solid-series|title=Konami announces plan for brand new Metal Gear series|publisher=Eurogamer|last1=Yin-Poole|first1=Wesley|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Gameplay videos have shown Kojima's name included within the game itself, with individual credits sequences for each mission.}} A Konami spokesperson stated that Kojima would still be involved with Konami and the ''Metal Gear'' franchise,&lt;ref name="polygon-kojimaremoved" /&gt; and despite the dispute, the company expressed confidence that the game would be declared [[Game of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-the-game-of-the-year-guaranteed-konami-says-ab/1100-6430162/|title="It's the Game of the Year--Guaranteed," Konami Says About MGS5|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|date=30 August 2015|work=GameSpot|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, series composer [[Rika Muranaka]] told ''Fragged Nation'' in an interview that over 30 commissioned songs for [[Metal Gear Solid]] were never used, with Muranaka believing that Kojima has a lack of business sense that played a part in his split from Konami.&lt;ref name="MGSV_Music"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nichegamer.com/2015/07/metal-gear-solid-composer-says-hideo-kojima-split-from-konami-over-budget-issues/|title=Metal Gear Solid Composer Says Hideo Kojima Split from Konami Over Budget Issues|first=Brandon|last=Orselli|publisher=[[nichegamer]]|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'' received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCXONE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;

Vince Ingenito of [[IGN]] awarded the game a score of 10/10, complimenting the way the gameplay mechanics worked together and the organic nature of the open-ended missions that allowed players to create their own memorable experiences, without being punished for deviating from stealth. The review concluded that ''The Phantom Pain'' is "a gameplay marvel, rewarding intelligence and creativity in a way few games do."&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; [[GameSpot]] also gave the game a 10/10, similarly praising its "near impeccable" gameplay, commenting that, alongside main and side missions, "emergent scenarios serve as the third pillar of ''The Phantom Pain''{{'s}} open-world gameplay experience". The review also highlighted the meaningful development of the characters despite being beholden to the original ''Metal Gear'' as the conclusion of Venom Snake's character arc.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; ''The Phantom Pain'' was the twenty-third game&amp;mdash;and the third in the ''Metal Gear'' series&amp;mdash;to ever receive a perfect 40/40 review rating from Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref name="Famitsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/08/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1395|title=Famitsu Review Scores: Issue 1395|date=August 25, 2015|website=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'' awarded the game 9.5/10, praising the story's emotional power and thematic concerns exploring the futility of war in a much more compelling and cohesive way than other franchises such as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', as well as the way in which the game world responded to the player's actions. However, the review was critical of the reliance on resource management, particularly in the way assaults on Forward Operating Bases could interrupt and distract from key missions.&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; [[Destructoid]] awarded it a score of 9/10, saying that the game is "equal parts tough and flashy, and it's fitting that if this is Kojima's last ''Metal Gear'', he goes on a high note."&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt;

''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Joe Juba awarded the game 9.25/10, praising the mission design for its flexibility and offering players multiple pathways to completion without restricting their choice of weapons or equipment. However, despite seeing the value in restructuring the narrative to compliment the open world platform and the episodic mission structure given the series' complex mythology, Juba felt that this went too far with the result being that the player could stumble into crucial story elements without context.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Michael McWhertor also awarded the game 9/10, similarly praising the game mechanics, but directing criticism at the convoluted storyline which it felt hinged on a detailed knowledge of the series' mythos to the point where it would be inaccessible to newcomers to the franchise.&lt;ref name="polygon" /&gt;

''The Phantom Pain'' was also positively received outside the traditional gaming media. In a five-star review, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Kirk McKeand stated that the game "takes the best of a great series and creates a series' best in the process". The review complimented the seamless integration of the gameplay modes and noted the way the game's Mother Base mode offered satisfactory and meaningful progress,&lt;ref name="kirk" /&gt; a sentiment echoed by ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]''{{'}}s Matt Peckham,&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; who also complimented the game's longevity, pacing and [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4005807/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-review/|title=After 30 Hours of ''Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain'', I’m Nowhere Near Finished|first=Matt|last=Peckham|work=time.com|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=29 August 2015|date=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of ''The Phantom Pain'' received plaudits, the game was criticized by some reviewers who felt it was lacking in terms of a focused and compelling narrative with interesting characters, especially when compared to prior ''Metal Gear'' titles. Ingenito opined that its story would be divisive for long-term fans, calling it "insubstantial and underdeveloped", with plot-related questions generally being answered in a "rushed and unsatisfying" way and a tendency for the game to gloss over its subject matter. He wrote how much of the characterization and memorable moments seen in previous installments had been replaced with individuals doing little more than appearing in scenes, giving information and then standing around. In addition, he called out the frequent lack of communication from Kiefer Sutherland as Venom Snake throughout important plot sections as "positively jarring".&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Jason Schreier argued that the story was "damn unfulfilling", having "terrible" pacing, "incoherent" dialogue, and "incomprehensible" character motivations. He echoed Ingenito's view of Snake, calling him in cutscenes "nearly silent to the point of awkwardness ... where his response to emotional events will often just be to look at people."&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain: The Kotaku Review|url=https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-the-kotaku-review-1728728287|website=Kotaku|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roberts, writing for ''[[GamesRadar]]'', described the story as "unconventional" and full of "loosely connected scenes", saying "a whole lot of nothing happens in between quick bursts of exposition". He praised Kiefer Sutherland as Snake, but criticized Skullface as being greatly undeveloped as a villain and being met with "one of the most anti-climactic showdowns in video game history". Roberts also wrote how the story "drifts along aimlessly" in the second half and which ultimately felt "hollow" from not giving closure to the end [[Plot_twist|twist]] that the player is not controlling Big Boss.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=David|title=Metal Gear Solid 5 is the best and most disappointing game of the year|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/metal-gear-solid-5-best-and-most-disappointing-game-year/|website=GamesRadar+|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the reveal and story ending also drew a [[Venom_Snake#Reception|polarizing response from other critics]].

''The Phantom Pain'' was also criticized for forcing players to replay missions on higher difficulty settings to unlock the final missions,&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Destruct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; with Schreier saying that it added unnecessary padding to a section of plot conveying the game's most emotional events.&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt;

=== Portrayal of Quiet ===
{{Main|Quiet (Metal Gear)}}
Before the release of the game, the presentation of the female character Quiet became a topic of controversy concerning her appearance. ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' designer David Ellis criticized her for being [[oversexualized]] and a negative affirmation of the stereotype of the game industry as "full of man babies".&lt;ref name="GameSpot: criticism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kojima addresses criticism over MGSV's 'sexy' Quiet character|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-addresses-criticism-over-mgsvs-sexy-quiet-characte1100-6414204/|website=GameSpot|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halo dev calls MGSV female character design "disgusting"|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-calls-mgsv-female-character-design-disgusting/1100-6414137/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/9/7/9272995/metal-gear-solid-5-voice-actress-lets-play|title=Metal Gear Solid 5 voice actress is doing a Let's Play of the game|author=|date=|website=polygon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima and Konami released Quiet figurines in May 2015 as part of the game's promotion.

The finished game drew more criticism of Quiet's portrayal in both reviews and opinion pieces.&lt;ref name="Tamburro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouner|first1=Jef|title=There is No 'Smart Reason' for Naked Women in Video Games|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/there-is-no-smart-reason-for-naked-women-in-video-games-7914860|website=Houston Press|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=Let’s Talk About THAT Quiet Scene in Metal Gear Solid|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/900837-lets-talk-quiet-scene-metal-gear-solid-v|website=Crave|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamesRadar]]''{{'}}s David Roberts described Quiet as "one of the most complex and conflicted characters in ''MGS5''", but that her depiction was an example of a "juvenile approach to sexuality" that typifies Kojima's work and the ''Metal Gear'' series as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=David|title=Quiet embodies Metal Gear's complex relationship with women|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/quiet-embodies-metal-gears-complex-relationship-women/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael McWhertor of ''Polygon'' described the justification for Quiet's lack of clothing as "inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story", and criticized how the game presented other female characters by "zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way."&lt;ref name="polygon"/&gt;

{{Further|Kojima Productions#Closure}}
Following the release of the game, those who had bought the Collector's Edition discovered that the bonus disc included cutscenes and concept art of an in-game mission, "Episode 51: Kingdom of the Flies", that continued on from the end of the campaign, having not been playable in the game. The story ending was criticised for feeling abrupt and leaving several plot points unresolved, and critics found that the removed mission tied up one such important plot thread whilst also providing closure to the relationship between two of the characters. Consequently, many agreed that the inclusion of Episode 51 would have given the game a more satisfactory conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/why-metal-gear-solid-vs-ending-was-so-disappointing-1729833383|title=Why Metal Gear Solid V's Ending Is So Disappointing|last=|first=|date=September 10, 2015|website=Kotaku|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/09/07/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-mission-51-cut-content-video/|title=Why was this mission cut from Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain?|website=VG24/7|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A.V.C"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/without-its-deleted-finale-metal-gear-solid-v-has--242845|title=Without its deleted finale, Metal Gear Solid V has no ending at all|last=Lee|first=Patrick|date=October 19, 2016|work=The A.V.

Critics attributed the missing content to the disclosed tensions between Konami and Kojima during development, the general consensus being that Konami had given strict deadlines for the game's release, having been dissatisfied with how much money Kojima had spent on development.&lt;ref name="Retrospective" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/one-of-metal-gear-solid-vs-most-important-story-scenes-1728467641|title=One Of Metal Gear Solid V's Most Important Story Scenes Was Cut|website=Kotaku|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Chris|title=So, let's talk about Metal Gear Solid V's ending|url=https://www.destructoid.com/so-let-s-talk-about-metal-gear-solid-v-s-ending-311489.phtml|website=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leack|first1=Jonathan|title=An Incomplete MGSV: The Phantom Pain Offers Clue to Why Kojima Was Let Go by Konami|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/11744-an-incomplete-mgsv-the-phantom-pain-offers-clue-to-why-kojima-was-let-go-by-konami#/slide/1|website=Game Revolution|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data miners also uncovered numerous other examples of lesser content that had not been included in the game, ranging from gameplay features to cutscenes, but what precisely had been removed as a result of the Konami-Kojima conflict, and what had simply been abandoned earlier in development out of choice, was open to discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shabana Arif|title=This is what the missing content from MGS5: The Phantom Pain looks like|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/09/22/this-is-what-the-missing-content-from-mgs5-the-phantom-pain-looks-like/#below-article|website=VG24/7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Was Cut from Metal Gear Solid 5?|url=https://gamerant.com/metal-gear-solid-5-story-cuts-512/|website=Gamerant.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Gear Solid V: Every Piece Of Cut Content You Need To See|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-every-piece-of-cut-content-you-need-to-see|website=whatculture.com|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, due to the removed story content and subsequent narrative flaws, the game was labeled by some critics as being unfinished.&lt;ref name="Retrospective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/09/17/5-questions-i-have-after-beating-metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain/|title=5 questions I have after beating Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain|last=|first=|date=September 15, 2015|website=VentureBeat|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-19-metal-gear-solid-5-the-unfinished-swan-song|title=Metal Gear Solid 5: The unfinished swan song|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2015|website=Eurogamer|publisher=|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid Sayed|title=Konami And Kojima Need To Give Answers Regarding Cut Content In Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain|url=https://gamingbolt.com/konami-and-kojima-need-to-give-answers-regarding-cut-content-in-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain|website=Gaming Bolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[GamesRadar]]'' argued that the game's incomplete state was deliberate on Kojima's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/mgs5-unfinished-s-entirely-point/|title=Metal Gear Solid 5 is unfinished?

After the announcement of ''Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience'', which would include all previously released downloadable content, several fans took this as an opportunity to voice their concerns via Twitter about the missing content that had been uncovered, particularly with regards to Episode 51. Konami responded that Episode 51 had been removed in the early development stages of the game as it had not been intended to be a pivotal ending to the story, and that there were no future plans to have the mission available to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/31/12733180/metal-gear-solid-5-mission-51-ending|title=Konami says MGS5's ending isn't missing, so everyone can calm down about it|date=31 August 2016|website=Polygon|publisher=Allegra Frank|access-date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Aspiring young actress Maggie Nelson ([[Anna Paquin]]), who lives in New York City, gains [[chameleon]]-like powers after she is exposed to an electrical storm and a magic rune which her father, an Interpol agent, had brought home to study after it was found at the scene of a murder at a New York City museum. Her powers are from a secret and ancient race known as the Chameliel, who are able to hide in plain sight of the public due to their shape shifting abilities, and she is told all about the Chameliel after meeting a young Chameliel named Mosaic ([[Kirby Morrow]]). The murder victim at the museum was a Chameliel who was killed by another Chameliel named Maniken, who is stealing some of the many powerful Chameliel stones that are hidden around the world, intent on using them to gain the alchemical powers of his dead wife Facade, and ruling the world. After Maniken kidnaps her father, Maggie becomes determined to help Mosaic to fight Maniken.&lt;ref group="Movie references"&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1170587-stan_lee_presents_mosaic/ Stan Lee Presents: Mosaic - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15733&amp;reviewer=392 Movie Review - Mosaic (2007) - eFilmCritic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

They go from New York City, to the catacombs of Rome, to a large radio dish at the magnetic North Pole, trying to stop Maniken as he plans to sacrifice Maggie's father to use the Chameliel stones in a ceremony that will transfer to Maniken the powers of his wife from her body and rule Earth like a god. As Maniken prepares to begin the ceremony on the radio dish, Maggie uses her acting skills and shape-shifting abilities to fool Maniken into believing she is his dead wife come back to life, to distract him from noticing Mosaic is planting explosives that destroy everything on the radio dish and render the ceremony impossible, and getting her father to safety. During the battle against Maniken, it is revealed that Mosaic is Maniken and Facade's son who had volunteered to the rest of the Chameliel to go after his father and to stop him. They both end up tumbling into an icy gorge, never to rise again. Maggie then sneaks aboard the Interpol copter her father is on, overhearing him vowing to destroy all Chameliel. Upon returning home, she plans to continue acting and agrees to her father's request to continue her studies, but at the same time, acknowledging her powers as the piece of the Chameliel within her, she vows to search for the remaining Chameliel stones and use their power for good, and honor Mosaic and the rest of the Chameliel by becoming the new Mosaic.

==Cast==
* [[Anna Paquin]] as Maggie Nelson/Mosaic
* [[Kirby Morrow]] as Morrow (Mosaic)
* [[Kathleen Barr]] as Facade and Mrs. Nottenmyer
* [[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]] as Nathan Nelson

==Maggie's powers==
Maggie's powers include shapeshifting, superhuman strength, the ability to cling to surfaces allowing for scaling walls and ceilings (much like [[Spider-Man]]), seeing the DNA of other creatures (which is how she can compare humans to apes), regeneration, infrared vision, camouflage, invisibility and the ability to mimic voices as well as a gift for understanding the Chameliel language (it is never explained if this ability shows that she can understand other languages or speak them but it makes sense). Strangely, when Maggie becomes invisible, her outline gives off the appearance that she is completely [[naked]], even though she is in fact wearing clothes. Why her clothes are not outlined when her body is invisible is never made clear.

== Reception ==
''Mosaic'' has received mixed reviews. Movie reviewer [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it an audience rating of 49%, based on 2 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mosaic|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stan_lee_presents_mosaic/|accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960–1990''''' was a major public art and archives exhibition, the first of its kind in the [[UK]], held at the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]], [[City of London]], over a six-month period (10 July 2015 – 24 January 2016),&lt;ref name=Huntleysonline&gt;[http://huntleysonline.com/f-h-a-l-m-a/exhibition/ "No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990"], The Radical Lives of Eric &amp; Jessica Huntley website.&lt;/ref&gt; with a future digital touring exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;FHALMA, [http://huntleysonline.com/f-h-a-l-m-a/volunteering-opportunities/ "Volunteers in Action"], Huntleys Online: "''No Colour Bar''′s presence and reach throughout 2016 is further extended via a digital touring exhibition at the [[Black Cultural Archives]], [[Hackney Community College]] and [[Hackney Museum]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and an associated programme of events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntleysonline.com/f-h-a-l-m-a/events/ "No Colour Bar: programme of events"], FHALMA, Huntleys Online.&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Colour Bar'' took its impetus from the life work and archives of [[Jessica Huntley (publisher)|Jessica Huntley]] (23 February 1927 – 13 October 2013)&lt;ref name=Busby&gt;[[Margaret Busby]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/27/jessica-huntley "Jessica Huntley obituary"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and Eric Huntley (born 25 September 1929),&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Andrews, ''Doing Nothing is Not An Option: The Radical Lives of Eric &amp; Jessica Huntley'', Middlesex, England: Krik Krak, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-908415-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guyanese-born campaigners, political activists and publishers, who founded the publishing company [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]] and the associated Walter Rodney Bookshop.&lt;ref name=Huntleysonline /&gt;

Comprising contemporary fine art combined with archive materials, the multi-media exhibition featured the work of seminal [[Black British]] artists and historically significant activists,&lt;ref name=Huntleysonline /&gt; and was described by Colin Prescod (chair of the [[Institute of Race Relations]]) as an "exposition of startling and radical imaginative works, addressing grand British cultural and historical matters, and touching on themes of existential and social restlessness".&lt;ref name=HLF /&gt; Participants in the [[Caribbean Artists Movement]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nocolourbar.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/the-caribbean-artist-movement.html "Caribbean Artists Movement"], NoColourBar blog, 25 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Winston Branch]], [[Aubrey Williams]], [[Ronald Moody]] and [[Errol Lloyd]], were featured together with other prominent artists, including [[Eddie Chambers (artist)|Eddie Chambers]], [[Sonia Boyce]], [[Sokari Douglas Camp]], [[Denzil Forrester]] and [[Chila Kumari Burman]], with works on display across all media: painting sculpture, painting, drawing, illustration, photography and film.&lt;ref name=Huntleysonline /&gt; In conjunction with the art and archives, panels and talks led by the exhibition curators, Makeda Coaston and Katty Pearce, and featuring individual artists, writers and publishers, including Eddie Chambers, Errol Lloyd, Denzil Forrester, Fowokan, [[Donald Hinds]], [[Kadija George]], [[Dorothea Smartt]], [[Arif Ali (publisher)|Arif Ali]], [[Sarah White (New Beacon Books)|Sarah White]], as well as Eric Huntley himself,&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntleysonline.com/team/ "No Colour Bar Exhibition Team"], FHALMA, Huntleys Online.&lt;/ref&gt; were programmed.&lt;ref name=events /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/1106834412680025/permalink/1106834836013316/ "Donald Hinds Talk"], 19 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nocolourbar.blogspot.co.uk/ "Denzil Forrester"], NoColourBar blog, 17 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://missbtakesawalk.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/literary-afternoon-no-colour-bar-black.html "LITERARY AFTERNOON ‘No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990’ at Guildhall Art Gallery"], Miss B Takes A Walk, 15 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the exhibition was a purpose-built interactive installation by [[Michael McMillan]], in conjunction with sound and visual specialists Dubmorphology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garystewart.org/dubmorphology/ "About"], Gary Stewart website.&lt;/ref&gt; that recreates the famed Walter Rodney Bookshop,&lt;ref name=Culture24&gt;William Axtell, [http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art531290-guildlhall-celebrates-black-british-artists-with-no-colour-bar-black-british-art-in-action-1960-1990 "Guildhall celebrates black British artists with No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action"], Culture24, 9 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which was formerly located in [[West Ealing]], functioning as a cultural hub of the community until it closed at the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, ''Doing Nothing is Not An Option'', 2014, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

''No Colour Bar'' took its impetus from the cultural and political work of [[Guyana|Guyanese]] activists Eric and Jessica Huntley, founders of the pioneering Black publishing house [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]] (commemorating Caribbean resistance heroes [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] of [[Haiti]] and [[Paul Bogle]] of [[Jamaica]]), whose papers, business and personal, archive materials and collections were deposited in 2005 at [[London Metropolitan Archives]] (LMA), the first significant deposit there of records from the African-Caribbean community in London. Funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],&lt;ref name=HLF&gt;[https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/news-features/reflecting-london%E2%80%99s-diversity-through-art "Reflecting London’s diversity through art"], Heritage Lottery Fund, 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition is a collaboration between LMA, the Friends of the Huntley Archives at LMA (FHALMA), and the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]], supported by the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name=CityofLondon&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visit-the-city/attractions/guildhall-galleries/Pages/Exhibitions.aspx "Exhibition: No Colour Bar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905094135/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/visit-the-city/attractions/guildhall-galleries/Pages/Exhibitions.aspx |date=2015-09-05 }}, The City of London.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition aimed to provide "an innovative look at Black British cultural identities, heritage and creative voices - and the struggle Black British artists faced to have their voices heard - from the 1960s to the 1990s"; according to project manager Beverley Mason: "To have created this culturally important archive and arts exhibition marks a valuable shift in thinking about the approach to opening up and enlivening archives and historical art collections worldwide."&lt;ref name=BHM&gt;[http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/news-views/no-colour-bar-black-british-art-in-action-1960-1990/ "No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990 – Ground Breaking Revolutionary Archive and Art Exhibition in the Heart of the City"], Black History Month 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was designed as a multimedia interactive experience, in which "art, sculpture, photographs and paintings can be explored next to letters and other artefacts illustrating how black artists were influenced by the emergence of independent African and Caribbean states, global liberation struggles and the struggle for dignified citizenship within Britain."&lt;ref name=Culture24 /&gt; With four themed areas — Elbow Room, Broad Shoulders, Clenched Fists and Open Arms — the exhibition "challenges visitors to question the meaning of 'black art'".&lt;ref name=Getwestlondon&gt;Emily Chudy, [http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/whats-on/arts/breath-taking-art-exhibition-celebrates-9836168 "'Breath-taking' art exhibition celebrates lives and works of Ealing cultural activists"], Getwestlondon, 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation at its centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidedwalksinlondon.co.uk/blog/read_130224/no-colour-bar-a-celebration-of-black-british-art-at-guildhall-art-gallery.html "Blog: No Colour Bar. A Celebration of Black British Art at Guildhall Art Gallery"], Guided Walks in London, 13 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (which necessitated the unprecedented covering up of the gallery's largest painting, [[John Singleton Copley]]'s ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782|The Siege of Gibraltar]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://missbtakesawalk.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/no-colour-bar-black-british-art-in.html "'No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990' new Exhibition at Guildhall Art Gallery"], Miss B Takes a Walk, 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guildhall Art Gallery and London's Roman Amphitheatre, [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.835508783187058.1073741838.186605081410768&amp;type=1 "No Colour Bar - The Copley cover up!"], Facebook.&lt;/ref&gt; recreated the bookshop named in honour of assassinated historian [[Walter Rodney]], and served to show something of the connection between the championing of black writers, such as [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] or [[Lemn Sissay]], and the support of black artists — such as [[Errol Lloyd]] and [[George "Fowokan" Kelly]] — through commissions for book covers, posters, greetings cards or the sale of works of art in the shop.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Jury, [https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/exhibitions/new-london-exhibition-recreates-pioneering-black-bookshop-10377583.html "New London exhibition recreates pioneering black bookshop"], ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 9 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angela Cobbinah, [http://www.camdenreview.com/node/989715 "No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990"], ''Camden Review'', 16 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;Amandla Thomas-Johnson, [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/preserving-britain%E2%80%99s-black-heroes "Preserving Britain’s Black Heroes"], ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'', 10 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Receiving wide media coverage&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntleysonline.com/media/ "No Colour Bar in the news"], Huntleys Online.&lt;/ref&gt; as a "new ground-breaking revolutionary archive and art exhibition in the heart of the City of London",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/markets/news/article.asp?docKey=600-201507021110M2______EUPR_____8b95000001669d3a_3600-1 "PRESS PREVIEW 'No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990'"], Bloomberg.com, 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Colour Bar'' was described as "breath-taking"&lt;ref name=Getwestlondon /&gt; and as showcasing "some of the important aspects of the Black British Experience as well as some of the important figures that helped shape Britain and Black Britain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewblackmagazine.com/view.aspx?index=3457 "Preview: 'No Colour Bar: Black British Art In Action 1960-1990'"], ''The New Black Magazine'', 11 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]]'s Jim Stenman reported on "one of the most comprehensive exhibitions on Black British art in recent years... [that] explores gender, race, representation and politics", interviewing Eric Huntley about the challenges of the past, in addition to Guildhall curator Katty Pearce, who said with reference to the exhibition: "This is part of British art history. This is the other story that maybe doesn't get told enough."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/07/09/no-colour-bar-black-british-art-orig.cnn "Black Britain's Cultural Revolution"], CNN, 9 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amandla Thomas-Johnson writing in ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'' pointed out "a very visible tension surrounding the exhibition. Its home, the Guildhall, has been the administrative centre of the City of London for hundreds of year and it was here much of the economic policy that steered the [[British Empire]] across the seas was driven, where the wealth coming back from the colonies was dished out and whose permanent art collection is the epitome of Imperial chic."&lt;ref name=Voice /&gt; Also highlighting the history of the venue, the ''[[New Humanist]]'' review by Lola Okolosie found that "holding an exhibition that celebrates black British art at the Guildhall, with its colonial legacy, is an act akin to resistance".&lt;ref&gt;Lola Okolosie, [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4967/we-are-here-because-you-were-there-a-retrospective-of-black-british-art "We are here because you were there: a retrospective of black British art"], ''New Humanist'', 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Soca News'' review, among others, drew attention to the monthly events&lt;ref name=events&gt;FHALMA, [http://huntleysonline.com/f-h-a-l-m-a/events/ "Radical. Engaging. Diverse. Inspirational Events"], Huntleys Online.&lt;/ref&gt; linked to the exhibition and different aspects of the Black experience in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Yaa Asantewa, [http://waywivewordzspiritualcreative.blogspot.co.uk/2015_07_01_archive.html "The bar the books and reflections on power"], Way Wive Wordz, 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including film, music, theatre, poetry, a conference and a Black Artists' Forum,&lt;ref name=BHM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socanews.com/articles/article.php?Black-British-culture-in-the-City-1159#.Ve2SrNJViko "Black British culture in the City"], ''Soca News'', 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Artlyst'' concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The realisation that Britain was changing forever is no better articulated than through the lens of the pioneers of what was to become Black British cultural heritage. The Huntleys were the publishing powerhouses that spawned a dynamic generation of cultural and political leaders, whose stories are told and celebrated for the first time in the UK at this fascinating exhibition.

2015 sees the 10th Anniversary of the Huntley Archives at the LMA, and 'No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960-1990' will be a fitting marker and visual record of the socio-cultural dynamics spanning the three decades"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/no-colour-bar-black-british-art-new-revolutionary-art-exhibition "No Colour Bar Black British Art: New Revolutionary Art Exhibition"], ''Artlyst'', 18 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Summing it up as the "Exhibition of the Year", independent curator Hamja Ahsan wrote: "This was an archival show with the fire of life, the air of authenticity and the buzz of a multi-generational community....  For this reason, this remained for me the most essential and inspiring exhibition of the year."&lt;ref&gt;Hamja Ahsan, [http://mediadiversified.org/2015/12/31/exhibition-of-the-year-no-colour-bar-black-art-in-action-1960-1990/ "Exhibition of the Year: No Colour Bar: Black Art in Action 1960-1990"], Media Diversified, 31 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulletin of the Supreme command of the [[Yugoslav Partisans|People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]] no. 12–13 (December 1941 and January 1942) announced the establishment of the [[title]] of "People's Hero" for heroic and self-sacrificing participants of the [[People's Liberation War (Yugoslavia)|People's Liberation War]]. The first person to be awarded the title was [[Petar Leković]]. A total of 22 persons were awarded this title. On 15 August 1943, the title was formalized as an order together with [[Order of the People's Liberation]], [[Order of Bravery]], [[Order of the Partisan Star]], [[Order of Brotherhood and Unity]] and the [[Medal for Bravery]]. At the same time, all the persons who already held the title of the People's Hero were awarded the order.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia7&gt;Encyclopedia, volume 1, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Order consists of an oval gold badge showing a soldier with rifle and banner superimposed upon a rayed star surrounded by a wreath of laurel. The badge is suspended from a red ribbon, with a narrow white stripe towards each edge. The design for this and the other Orders were undertaken by the painter [[Đorđe Andrejević Kun]] and the sculptor [[Antun Augustinčić]]. Before 29 November 1943, the title of People's Hero was awarded by the Central Comity of [[KPJ]], after 1945 it was awarded by the Presidium of the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|People's Assembly of Yugoslavia]], and starting in 1953 by the [[President of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia7/&gt;

From its inception until around 1993, the Order had been awarded nearly 1,400 times. Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] was awarded the Order three times: in 1944, 1972 and 1977. The holders of the order were entitled to certain benefits, like free fares on public transport, and pensions for the surviving family members of deceased people's heroes. Although the benefits have since been downscaled, post-Yugoslav countries still provide certain benefits to people's heroes. Many schools and streets in post-war Yugoslavia were named after people's heroes, and many of the names remain, to varying degrees in different successor countries.

Not only people, but cities, military units and organizations were also awarded the order. Eight cities in Yugoslavia were awarded the order and proclaimed "hero cities": [[Belgrade]], [[Cetinje]], [[Drvar]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Novi Sad]], [[Prilep]], [[Pristina]], and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia7/&gt;

===Serbia and Montenegro===
Following the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia]], [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was formed, and later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. In 1998, it passed a law that continued to use some of the decorations of former Yugoslavia, among them Order of the People's Hero,&lt;ref name="vreme-1999"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[Vreme]] | url = http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/vb7/13.html | title = Zakon o odlikovanjima | date = 1999-04-24 | language = Serbian | accessdate = 2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the fourth highest order after the [[Order of Yugoslavia]], [[Order of the Yugoslav Star]] and the [[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]].&lt;ref name=lukasz2&gt;[http://www.medals.pl/yu/yu3.htm Orders and Decorations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 1990-] by Lukasz Gaszewski 2000, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian media ridiculed several proposals to decorate [[Slobodan Milošević]] with the Order of the People's hero because he would have had to decorate himself.&lt;ref name="vreme-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blic-2000"/&gt; It was never given to any individuals, but several military units active in the [[Kosovo War]] were decorated:&lt;ref name="blic-2000"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/drustvo/130907/Milosevic-bi-morao-sam-sebe-da-odlikuje | language = Serbian | title = Milošević bi morao sam sebe da odlikuje | newspaper = [[Blic]] | date = 2000-06-08 | accessdate = 2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pilipinas Kay Ganda''' ({{literal translation|Philippines, So Beautiful}}) was a short-lived [[advertising campaign]] made by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] to promote [[Tourism in the Philippines|tourism in the]] [[Philippines]].  Launched in 2010, it replaced the [[WOW Philippines]] campaign that was launched in 2002.

The tourism slogan used in the campaign was controversial and received mostly negative reception from the Filipino public, even leading to the resignation of the country's then-Tourism Secretary, [[Alberto Lim]].  Pilipinas Kay Ganda was eventually replaced with "[[It's More Fun in the Philippines]]".&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/featured/46961/philippines-new-tourism-slogan-pilipinas-kay-ganda-fails-to-impress-netizens |title=New PH tourism slogan "Pilipinas Kay Ganda" fails to impress tourism industry, netizens &amp;#124; The Feed &amp;#124; VIDEOS &amp;#124; SPOT.ph: Your One-Stop Urban Lifestyle Guide to the Best of Manila |publisher=Spot.ph |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/21/10/%E2%80%98pilipinas-kay-ganda%E2%80%99-officially-dead&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Conception==
The advertising agency [[Campaigns &amp; Grey]] had advisory capacity over the campaign. The agency design the campaign's logo and theme line.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The agency designed the campaign materials free of charge in support of the President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s administration. The agency claimed that the released logo was just a study and was released prematurely by the Department of Tourism.&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged plagiarism==
The Pilipinas Kay Ganda campaign logo design was criticized for alleged plagiarism. Discussions on social media pointed out and suspected that the campaign logo was plagiarized from Poland's own tourism campaign, "Polska" ({{literal translation|Poland}}). The logos of Polska and Pilipinas Kay Ganda's font were similar. Both the letter "L" of the campaign slogans were stylized into trees. The difference is that Pilipinas Kay Ganda's letter "L" was stylized into a coconut tree with a smiley face as opposed to Polska's "L" which was stylized into generic tree.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tourism Secretary [[Alberto Lim]] acknowledged that the Philippine campaign slogan bare some similarities with the Polska logo and commented that the Philippine campaign logo was more colorful. Tourism Undersecretary Enteng Romano, in a text message forwarded by Palace Spokesperson Abi Valte, denied that the Philippine campaign logo was plagiarized and that the logo has enough elements to be distinct from Poland's campaign logo.&lt;ref name="absplag"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''product sample''' is a [[Sample (material)|sample]] of a [[consumer product]] that is given to the consumer free of cost so that he or she may try a product before committing to a purchase.

==Free samples==
A '''free sample''' or '''"freebie"''' is a portion of food or other product (for example beauty products) given to consumers in shopping malls, supermarkets, retail stores, or through other channels (such as via the Internet).&lt;ref Name="De_Bower"&gt;{{cite book
 | last =De Bower | first =Herbert Francis=
 | title =Advertising principles
 | publisher = [[Alexander Hamilton Institute]] (U.S.)
 | year =1919
 | location =Original from the University of California
 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YcxHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=%22Free+sample%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA156,M1
 | page =156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes samples of non-perishable items are included in [[direct marketing]] mailings. The purpose of a free sample is to acquaint the consumer with a new product, and is similar to the concept of a [[test drive]], in that a [[customer]] is able to try out a product before purchasing it.

Although an expensive method of targeting customers, conversions to sales can be as high as 90% making it one of the main marketing strategies for certain markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcg.ie/product-sampling-on-the-increase|work=FMCG Ireland|title=Product Sampling: Costly but Effective|accessdate=22 December 2013|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With effective sampling, marketers can create brand loyalty and assist in the launch of a product through the word of mouth.

Many consumer product companies now offer free samples through their websites, to encourage consumers to use the products regularly,&lt;ref Name="De_Bower"/&gt; and to gather data for [[mailing list]]s of potentially interested customers. [[Paint chip]]s are samples of paint colors that are sometimes offered as free samples.

[[Company|Companies]] such as C.A. Courtesy, [[Costco]], [[Sam's Club]], Food Courts and Grocery Stores give out free samples to customers to persuade a customer to buy the product.

The expansion of online marketing with regards to promotional giveaways has facilitated the rise of "Freebie sites" that seek to aggregate all promotional free sample offers in one place. These sites will often compile free product samples from all over the World Wide Web and categorize them by type. Some product sample offers may require consumers to complete a survey or refer a friend in order to qualify for the freebies. When all requirements are fulfilled, the product samples are shipped to the consumer.
Some sample products might be digital goods, where sample might be closely related to a product [[Evaluation|trial]].

==History==
19th Century soap manufacturer [[Benjamin T. Babbitt]] was one of the first known people, though not the first ever, to offer free samples of his products.&lt;ref name="grave"&gt;{{cite web |url=
https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6933515|title=Find a Grave |work=Benjamin T. Babbitt|accessdate= September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innkeepers are portrayed offering free samples in the 14th-century poem ''[[Piers Plowman]]:'' "Tauerners 'a tast for nouht' tolden the same" (Innkeepers said the same thing, 'A taste for free!').&lt;ref&gt;Piers Plowman, C-text, Passus I, line 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 C. A. Courtesy became the first demonstration company to secure exclusivity with a retailer.

==Other samples==
[[File:Color chips.jpg|thumb|250px|So-called "color chips" or color samples, used in the plastic industry to help designers visually identify available colors of plastic [[Microplastics|pellet]]s.]]
It is also possible to purchase products in small "'''trial size" '''containers. This is common with toiletries such as shampoo, which are useful for vacations or other travel, where large bottles or other containers would be impractical (or more recently, not permitted for air travel). These are also often provided in hotel and motel rooms for the guests. Samples may also be loaned to the customer if they are too valuable to be given for free, such as samples of a countertop or of carpet to be used for [[remodeling]].
Sometimes companies in [[Business-to-business|b2b]] market will offer sample of data or service for free before engaging business relationship.

Other type of samples may include industrial samples, such as in the [[plastic industry]], provided to companies for trial [[injection molding|molding]] to see if the selected material is suitable for manufacturing the application (testing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Q4X1ovFVBvoC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=sample+bags+material+selection+plastics&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5pP_6k-fQAhUlLsAKHeYYD5IQ6AEIbDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sample%20bags%20material%20selection%20plastics&amp;f=false|title=Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook: Plastic Part Manufacturing|author=Philip Mitchell|pages=2–63|quote=Displayed by permission of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers|year=1996|isbn=9780872634565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such samples may or may not be free of charge.

'''Rev:''' Five lines of ancient Hebrew script; reading ''"Yehochanan Kohen Gadol Chever Hayehudim"'' (Yehochanan the High Priest, Council of the [[Jews]]. ]]

'''Prutah''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: '''פרוטה''') is a word borrowed from the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]], in which it means "a [[coin]] of smaller value". The word was probably derived originally from an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word with the same meaning. 
 
The prutah was an ancient [[copper]] [[Jew]]ish coin with low value. A loaf of bread in ancient times was worth about 10 prutot (plural of prutah). One prutah was also worth two lepta (singular [[Greek lepton|lepton]]), which was the smallest denomination minted by the [[Hasmonean]] and [[Herodian Dynasty]] kings. 

Prutot were also minted by the [[Roman Procurator coinage|Roman Procurators]] of the [[Province of Judea]], and later were minted by the Jews during the [[First Jewish-Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]] (sometimes called [[Masada|'Masada coins']]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblicalmites.com/Prutah.html Prutah on Biblicalmites.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060127210216/http://biblicalmites.com/Prutah.html |date=2006-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pütchipü'ü''' or '''pütche'ejachi''' ([[Wayuu language|Wayuu]]: messenger of the word; {{lang-es|palabrero}}) is the central element in the traditional administration justice system of the [[wayuu people]]. The role of a pütchipü'ü is to solve conflicts through mediation and negotiation.  This can include conflicts between different members or clans of the wayuu community or  with people or organizations outside the Wayuu people. This negotiation includes material compensation to be paid by the aggravating family to the aggrieved family group.

"'''Radioactive Man'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'}} [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on September 24, 1995. The episode sees the film version of the comic book series ''[[The Simpsons Comics#Radioactive Man|Radioactive Man]]'' set up production in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Much to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s disappointment, the part of the hero's sidekick, [[Fallout Boy (The Simpsons)|Fallout Boy]], goes to [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]]. Milhouse, however, hates acting, so he quits the role, forcing the producers of the film to shut down production and go back to [[Hollywood]].

The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], and directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. [[Mickey Rooney]] guest starred as himself in the episode. "Radioactive Man" was the first episode of ''The Simpsons'' to be [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digitally colored]]. The episode features cultural references to the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, the 1995 film ''[[Waterworld]]'', and the song "[[Lean on Me (song)|Lean on Me]]" by [[Bill Withers]]. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from fans and television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.5, and was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.

==Plot==
Bart and Milhouse are thrilled to hear that a film version of their favorite comic book series, ''[[The Simpsons Comics#Radioactive Man|Radioactive Man]]'', is in production. [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Rainier Wolfcastle|Rainier Wolfcastle]], the star of the ''[[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#McBain|McBain]]'' films, is chosen to play [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Radioactive Man|Radioactive Man]], and even more excitingly for the [[Springfield Elementary School]] children, the production moves to their town. A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Fallout Boy|Fallout Boy]], and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.

A despondent Bart is told by [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] that he is still needed as Milhouse's friend and confidant, and Bart eagerly accepts this new role. However, Milhouse finds his own job intolerable and disappears, right during the filming of the most expensive scene in the movie. The film is suspended while the townspeople search for Milhouse. Eventually, Bart finds him in his treehouse, and despite encouragement from former child star [[Mickey Rooney]], Milhouse gives up on his acting career. With the film now cancelled and the producers bankrupt, the directors return to [[Hollywood]].

==Production==
[[File:Uso-show-mickey-rooney.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mickey Rooney]] guest starred as himself in the episode.]]
The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], and directed by [[Susie Dietter]]. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very funny because of all the [[visual gag]]s. Once the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]] was finished, she thought: "Hey, this is really funny!"&lt;ref name="Dietter"&gt;{{cite video |people=Dietter, Susie |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Radioactive Man" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first episode of ''The Simpsons'' to be [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digitally colored]]. The duties of that task went to [[USAnimation]], who would later work on "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]". Digital coloring would not be attempted again until [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season 12]]'s "[[Tennis the Menace]]", and again in [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season 14]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]". The show permanently switched to digital coloring later in that same season, beginning with "[[The Great Louse Detective]]".&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Radioactive Man" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was late for the session, she comments that he was "so full of pep" and very enthusiastic about the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy |last=Cartwright |first=Nancy |authorlink=Nancy Cartwright |chapter=The "Mickster" |pages=217–221 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7868-8600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
[[File:Ogfolliesof38.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The character [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] (right) from ''[[The Little Rascals]]'' is referenced in the episode.]]
The Radioactive Man character is based on [[Batman]], and several scenes in the episode reference the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series from the 1960s.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; A ''Radioactive Man'' antagonist, The Scoutmaster, is based on actor/comedian [[Paul Lynde]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The scene in the new ''Radioactive Man'' film where Radioactive Man and Fallout Boy are captured in Aquaworld is a reference to the 1995 film ''[[Waterworld]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The director of the ''Radioactive Man'' film says: "That Milhouse is going to be big, [[Gabby Hayes]] big!", in reference to the American actor Gabby Hayes.&lt;ref name="Mirkin"/&gt; [[Moe Szyslak]], the bartender of [[Moe's Tavern]], says that he, as a kid, played the part of Smelly on ''[[The Little Rascals]]'', until he killed [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] for stealing his schtick.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Radioactive Man" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Withers]]' song "[[Lean on Me (song)|Lean on Me]]" from 1972 is played at the end of the episode.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

In one scene, [[Comic Book Guy]] sends a message to other Internet nerds about who will star in the new ''Radioactive Man'' film, two of whom are the nerds Homer met in "[[Homer Goes to College]]", and one is [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] dressed in a purple suit. The last nerd is [[Curtis Armstrong]] with an appearance resembling his ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' character Booger. The [[usenet newsgroup]] which he posts the message to (alt.nerd.obsessive) is a reference to the [[alt.tv.simpsons]] newsgroup.{{sfn|Turner|2005|pp=282-283}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tossell |first=Ivor |title=Worst.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "Radioactive Man" finished 51st in the ratings for the week of September 18 to September 24, 1995. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 9.5.&lt;ref name=ratings&gt;{{cite news |title=How They Rate |date=September 29, 1995 |page=16 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] }} Retrieved on November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', and ''[[Melrose Place]]''.&lt;ref name=ratings/&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a "wonderful pastiche" on the [[Batman in film#Tim Burton / Joel Schumacher series|Tim Burton Batman films]], and added that Milhouse is an obvious candidate for Fallout Boy.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page2.shtml |title=Radioactive Man |accessdate=2007-02-27 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode, but he does not consider it a "classic". He said that it offers "more than a few amusing bits", and added that "spoofing the movie business isn't anything new, but the show does it well in this solid program".&lt;ref name=dvdmovieguide&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonseven.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season (1995) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2006-01-05 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Krusty tries to prove the "range" of different characters he can portray to the casting director. The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of A-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason7.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2006-01-16 |author=Malkowski, Judge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204055914/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason7.php |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Basile of [[About.com]] named it one of her twenty favorite episodes of the series, and said that she thinks the friendship between Bart and Milhouse in the episode is "endearing" and "touching". She added that she thinks the episode "pokes fun at Hollywood very effectively", and that "To top it off, funny favorite characters Rainier Wolfcastle [...] and Lionel Hutz are also in the episode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/thesimpsons/tp/top20simpsons.01.htm |title='The Simpsons' Top 20 Episodes |last=Basile |first=Nancy |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Beckwith of ''[[The Lantern]]'' singled out Rainier Wolfcastle's line "My eyes!

Prior to the 1990s, many celebrities chose their own red-carpet dresses, with the Oscars being remembered for some extraordinary and eccentric outfit choices, including torn denim, sequinned jumpsuits and even Indian headdresses.&lt;ref name=lenander/&gt; For ceremonies such as the Golden Globes, it was rare to see a star dressing up formally until the late 1990s, with many nominees turning up casually dressed.&lt;ref name=merle&gt;{{cite news|last=Ginsberg|first=Merle|title=The Psychology of the Golden Globes Dress|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/psychology-golden-globes-dress-71546|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Halle Berry]] came to the [[57th Golden Globe Awards|2000 ceremony]] in a glamorous white [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]] dress, it was described as a game-changer which set the standard for Golden Globe red carpet style, and according to [[Phillip Bloch]], her stylist at the time, "began the time when a dress could actually make a career."&lt;ref name=merle/&gt; The increasing dependence on [[fashion stylists]] was something that had emerged since the 1990s, leading to criticism that red carpet fashion, particularly at the Oscars, now appears "bland and homogeneous", following a model of "discreetly elegant [[gown]]s, softly swept-up hairdos and lots of diamond jewellery".&lt;ref name=lenander/&gt; The stylist's role is to try to ensure that the client only receives positive publicity for her appearance and is not featured on 'worst-dressed' lists.&lt;ref name=lenander/&gt;&lt;ref name="perla"&gt;{{cite news|last=La Ferla|first=Ruth|title=The Power Stylists of Hollywood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/fashion/hollywoods-power-stylists.html?_r=1|accessdate=21 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The New York Times]]'', asking "Does the glamour of the Golden Globes steal the scene from Oscar?", observed that the wider range of potential nominees of the "younger, hipper" Globes, from television as well as film, offered designers more opportunity to have their work featured on the red carpet.&lt;ref name=michault&gt;{{cite news|last=Michault|first=Jessica|title=Does glamour of the Globes steal the scene from Oscar?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/news/28iht-roscars_ed3_.html|accessdate=17 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Oscars, nominees for the Golden Globes and other events are under less pressure to choose an expensive, one-of-a-kind [[haute couture]] gown, which is also easier for the designers who can offer samples from their latest ready-to-wear lines.&lt;ref name=michault/&gt; One of the most widely publicised and talked-about red-carpet gowns was a ready-to-wear [[green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez|green Versace gown]] worn by [[Jennifer Lopez]] to the [[42nd Grammy Awards]] ceremony on February 23, 2000.&lt;ref name="PhillipsReay2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Phillips|editor-first=Kim M.|editor2-last=Reay|editor2-first=Barry|title=Sexualities in history: a reader|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz3bPMw_7h4C&amp;pg=PA407|last=Barrera|first=Magdalena|chapter=Hottentot 2000: ''Jennifer Lopez and Her Butt''|accessdate=16 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415929356|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity==
Having a dress featured on the red carpet, particularly one that attracts media attention, is very important to a designer, with [[Carmen Marc Valvo]] saying in 2000:

:"The dollar return of having some celebrity shot in your dress is worth a fortune, more than a five-page spread in ''Vogue'' or ''Harper's Bazaar'' that only appears once. That same image can be blasted repeatedly in newspapers and magazines across the country and around the world. That is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars."&lt;ref name=parnes&gt;{{cite news|last=Parnes|first=Francine|title=Dressing the Ladies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UmRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6516,476889&amp;dq=golden-globes+2000+fashions&amp;hl=en|accessdate=17 June 2012|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=22 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after [[Kate Winslet]] wore one of his dresses to the 2002 Oscars, designer [[Ben de Lisi]] said:

:"I can't possibly quantify how much publicity I got from that or how much money I made. And now, every time anyone writes about her they use the picture of her in the dress and so it just goes on and on."&lt;ref name=lisi&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kate Debate: Ben de Lisi credits Kate Winslet for his booming business|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2003/06/13/the-kate-debate|publisher=www.vogue.co.uk|accessdate=18 June 2012|date=13 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy is not without risk, as a designer may invest major labour and time into creating a unique dress (which could cost up to $100,000) for a celebrity, only to have their investment wasted when the star decides at the last moment to wear someone else's dress.&lt;ref name=lenander&gt;{{cite news|last=Lenander|first=Joanna|title=Why Oscar's Women All Look the Same|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/why-oscars-women-all-look-the-same/9747/|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=25 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt; Particularly high-profile celebrities are often loaned dresses by several different designers for the ceremony, meaning that the designer often does not know until the night whether his or her dress was chosen to receive the much-desired exposure.&lt;ref name=lenander/&gt;&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt; In addition, they run the risk of never getting the dress back, rejected or not.&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt; The choice for a designer may also be whether to dress one actress for the Oscars, or design an entire [[ready-to-wear]] collection.&lt;ref name=michault/&gt;

===Media===
Fashion commentary often forms a key part of the reportage of red-carpet events, both in dedicated programmes such as ''[[Live From the Red Carpet]]'' and news reports such as those from ''[[BBC News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC NEWS: In Depth: Oscars 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/entertainment/2002/oscars_2002/default.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News - Oscars 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12252017|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looks seen on the red carpet are also often featured in television programmes on fashion, such as ''[[Fashion Police (TV series)|Fashion Police]]''. Until they retired in 2011, [[Joan Rivers]] and her daughter [[Melissa Rivers|Melissa]] presented televised reviews of red carpet fashions from various ceremonies including the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, and the [[Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref name=hollywood-reporter&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Marisa|title=Joan Rivers Says Her Red Carpet Reporting Days Are Over|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joan-rivers-red-carpet-reporting-69545|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ram|first=Archana|title=Joan Rivers on her return to 'Fashion Police': 'The truth is very, very seldom said on television.'|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/08/27/joan-rivers-on-her-return-to-fashion-police-the-truth-is-very-very-seldom-said-on-television/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007 Joan Rivers was replaced by [[Lisa Rinna]] as the host of [[TV Guide Network]]'s red carpet coverage.&lt;ref name=hollywood-reporter/&gt;

==Cancelled events==
When the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony was cancelled and replaced with a press conference as a result of a [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]] which also threatened the Oscars, this was also seen as a threat to the fashion industry.&lt;ref name="Cieply"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cieply, Michael |author2=Carr, David |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/arts/television/08cnd-globes.html |title=No Golden Globes Show, Just a News Conference |accessdate=January 8, 2008 |date=January 8, 2008 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jolson|first=Jeffrey|title=NBC Cancels Globe Telecast, But will Stars Party On?|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2008/01/07/nbc-cancels-globe-telecast-but-will-stars-party-on/|accessdate=17 June 2012|newspaper=Hollywood Today|date=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strike&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=LaMont|title=Writers' strike is cutting fashion industry's red-carpet exposure|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/writers-strike-is-cutting-fashion-industrys-red-carpet-exposure-375885/|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|date=14 January 2008 (republished 16 March 2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only were established designers under threat, but the opportunity for up-and-coming designers to achieve widespread recognition through red-carpet exposure of their designs was severely limited.&lt;ref name=strike/&gt; In 2008, a number of events, including the threat of an actor's strike that would have led to cancellation of the [[81st Academy Awards|2009 Oscar ceremony]], and an upcoming star-studded [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|presidential inauguration]] had a visible effect on [[66th Golden Globe Awards|that year's Golden Globes ceremony]].&lt;ref name=mich09&gt;{{cite news|last=Michault|first=Jessica|title=Glamorous gowns win at the Golden Globes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/style/13iht-rglobe.html|accessdate=17 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stars dressed for the Globes in unique couture gowns that they might otherwise have reserved for the Oscars.&lt;ref name=mich09/&gt;

'''Sarah Jane Baines''' (30 November 1866 – 20 February 1951) was a British-Australian feminist, suffragette and social reformer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56217|title=Sarah Jane Baines, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Smart|first=Judith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/56217}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first suffragette to be tried by jury.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Sarah Jane Baines was born in [[Birmingham]], England, in 1866 to Sarah Ann (''née'' Hunt) and James Edward Hunt, a gun maker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She began work at [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s ordnance factory&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/baines-sarah-jane-jennie-5100|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Smart|first=Judith|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; aged eleven.

At age fourteen, she joined her parents in working with the [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]].  Upon attaining the rank of lieutenant, now aged twenty, she was sent to work as an evangelist in an independent working men's mission in Bolton.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this role, she was also called upon to act as a police court missionary caring for women who had been arrested.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Emmeline Pethick Lawrence, Jennie Baines, Flora Drummond and Frederick Pethick Lawrence, c. 1906-1910. (22545429328).jpg|alt=Emmeline Pethick Lawrence receiving a bouquet of flowers from Jennie Baines, Flora Drummond and Frederick Pethick Lawrence watching.|thumb|375x375px|[[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Baroness Pethick-Lawrence|Emmeline Pethick Lawrence]] receiving a bouquet of flowers from Jennie Baines, [[Flora Drummond]] and [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick Pethick Lawrence]] watching.]]
On 26 September 1888 in Bolton she married George Baines, a boot and shoemaker,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the couple had five children between 1888 and 1899&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE1128b.htm|title=Baines, Sarah Jane (Jennie) - Woman - The Australian Women's Register|last=Melbourne|first=National Foundation for Australian Women and The University of|website=www.womenaustralia.info|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; three of whom survived childhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between motherhood and working as a sewing machinist, there was little time for public activities. Yet her commitment never wavered. She joined the [[Independent Labour Party]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sarah Jane Baines - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095441558|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the feeding of school children committee and the unemployed committee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Campaigning for women's suffrage ==
In October 1905, she read about the arrest of suffragists [[Annie Kenney]] and [[Christabel Pankhurst]] for assault and this motivated Sarah to join the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Initially this was as a voluntary basis but in February 1908 she was made a paid organiser on a wage of £2 a week,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; organising open-air rallies, disrupting meetings and establishing new branches of the WSPU in the North of England and the Midlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later this same year, in November 1908, Sarah was to be tried of unlawful assembly at the Coliseum in Leeds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the first ever member of the WSPU to be tried by jury. Refusing to be bound over, she was convicted to six weeks imprisonment because "''she did ‘not recognise the laws of this Court administered by men''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the first to advocate militant methods, Sarah was imprisoned some fifteen times for her part in protests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In July 1912, she was part of an attempt, along with Gladys Evans and [[Mary Leigh]], to burn down the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Theatre Royal]] in [[Dublin]] the night before a scheduled visit from then prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith|H.H. Asquith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this she was sentenced to seven months hard labour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Joining her fellow suffragette prisoners on hunger strike, she was released after five days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The next year, on 8 July 1913, with her husband and son Wilfred, she was accused of attempting to bomb railway carriages at a Lancashire and Yorkshire railway siding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, Sarah was re-arrested under the '[[Cat and mouse act|Cat and Mouse act]]' and imprisoned at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]]. She again went on [[hunger strike]], refusing food and water, and was released in a 'very serious condition'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sarah suffered from [[St Vitus dance|St Vitus’ Dance]] brought on by emotional stress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; WSPU leaders determined that Sarah's health could not endure another stint in prison so Sarah and her family were smuggled into Wales as the 'Evans' family and set sail aboard t''he Ballarat'', bound for Australia,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a reward for all she had done as Australia had achieved the federal vote in 1902.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Later life in Australia ==
After being smuggled out of England, Sarah arrived in Melbourne, Australia in December 1913.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmhps.org.au/2016/03/jennie-baines-suffragette/|title=Jennie Baines – Suffragette|last=McLeavy|first=Lyn|date=8 March 2016|website=www.pmhps.org.au|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was forty-seven years old.

[[Adela Pankhurst|Adele Pankhurst]] would later arrive in 1914.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Upon settling in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the Baines family joined the [[Victorian Socialist Party]] and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labour Party]] while Sarah busied herself working with the [[Women's Political Association]] as early as January 1914&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and co-founded the [[Women's Peace Army]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With Adele Pankhurst, Sarah campaigned against [[World War I conscription in Australia|World War I conscription]] in 1916-1917 and against the spiralling cost of living.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both were sentenced to nine months imprisonment but both were freed on appeal on a legal technicality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sarah was again jailed in March 1919 for flying the prohibited red flag on the Yarra Bank&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and became the first prisoner in Australia to undergo hunger strike. A special Federal Cabinet meeting was held&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and her release was secured on the advice of the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1920, she helped establish the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]] in Victoria. Five years later, she would be expelled and this saw her rejoin the Labour Party.

In 1926, the family relocated to [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]] and Sarah was appointed special magistrate to the Children's Court there from 1928 to 1948.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Although her post [[World War II|Second World War]] activities were curtailed by her failing sight,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sarah Jane Baines continued her "''fiery eloquence on the hustings''" until her death from cancer, only giving up public speaking a few months before her passing on 20 February 1951 in Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Survived by her husband and her three children,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sarah's legacy could perhaps be summed up in her own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To fight for that which is better and nobler in this world is to live in the highest sense, but to submit and tolerate the evils which exist is to merely vegetate in the sewers of iniquity. Jennie Baines quoted in ''The Socialist'', 11 April 1919.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Requirements==
General Schaffer paragraphs have some requirements as follows:
*Must not be written in [[first-person narrative|first person]]
*Every paragraph must be at least five sentences long; however, there can be more as long as the same ratio of two CMs to every CD is kept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutvalley.k12.ca.us/dbhs/stenace/johnshaffer.htm|title=John Schaffer Paragraph Construction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Each section (TS, CD, CM, CS) is only one sentence in length
*Each section should also avoid past tense and only be written in present tense

==Paragraph Structure==
*Topic Sentence (TS) Otherwise known as a Topic Ghey
*Concrete Detail (CD)            
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

A basic Schaffer paragraph begins with the topic sentence—stating what the paragraph is about, then followed by a concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a closing sentence. This is called a one-chunk body paragraph and is the most basic Schaffer model.

One of the key elements in the Schaffer program is what is called the "ratio." Ratio is the amount of Concrete Detail in a paragraph compared to the amount of commentary. In the above paragraph the ratio is 1:2. The actual ratio for response to literature is 1:2+, which means there must be at least two sentences of Commentary for each sentence of Concrete Detail like so:

*Topic sentence (TS)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

Note that the ratio is still 1:2+ (At least twice as much Commentary as there is Concrete Detail)

===Topic sentence/statement (TS)===
This sentence should state the main point of the paragraph and be straight to the point
:''Example 1: Cinderella lives a miserable life.''
:''Example 2: Global warming is a world problem and needs to be stopped.''

===Concrete detail (CD)===
This sentence is the  "what" is happening.  It should be either facts, examples, illustrations, evidence, support, plot references, [[paraphrase]]s, [[citations]], quotations, plot summary, etc.  It should be a concrete detail and should start with ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;for example&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or a different [[Transition words|transition]].
:''Example 1: For example, she does all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. ''
:''Example 2: If it is not stopped, statistics show that the world will be drastically hurt. ''

===Commentary (CM)===
There are one or two [[wikt:commentary|commentary]] sentences in each chunk.  They contain no facts, rather, comments from the paragraph writer about the fact presented in the CD. This sentence contains analysis, interpretation, character feelings, opinions, inference, insight, reasons, or color commentator.   It is important that the commentary explain how the concrete detail helps prove the writer's point (the TS).
:''Example 1:''
::CM1: ''This shows that she feels taken advantage of by her selfish stepmother and stepsisters.''
::CM2: ''This is important because her horrible life gives her a present, her fairy godmother.''
:''Example 2:''
::CM1: ''Global warming should be man's greatest worry.''
::CM2: ''This is because the Earth can become negatively and drastically affected world wide.
::CM3  '' Commentary sentence is an opinion and a reaction.

General practice is that commentary sentences often start with a [[Transitions (linguistics)|transition]] such as the following:
*This (also) shows that
*This is (important) because
*In addition
*Furthermore,
*Therefore,
*Also
*For example,

===Concluding sentence / closing sentence (CS)===
The Concluding Sentence (CS) is the closing sentence that wraps up the TS and sums up the paragraph. It closes up the thoughts and gives insight to the next paragraph. Emotional or connotative words are preferred here usually beginning with "As a result" or another concluding sentence.
:''Example 1: As a result, she becomes a princess.''
:''Example 2: Therefore, global warming is top priority and cannot be ignored.''

'''''Sleep Like a Tiger''''', written by [[Mary Logue]] and illustrated by [[Pamela Zagarenski]], is a 2012 [[picture book]] published by [[HMH Books for Young Readers]]. ''Sleep Like a Tiger'' was a [[Caldecott Medal]] Honor Book in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC)  Caldecott Medal &amp; Honor Books, 1938 to present|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/sites/ala.org.alsc/files/content/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/Caldecott%20Medal%20%26%20Honor%20Books%202015.pdf|website=Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC)|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works of Zagarenski are ''[[Red Sings from Treetops: A Year in Colors]]'', which was also a [[Caldecott Medal]] Honor Book in 2010, and ''This Is Just to Say: Poems of Apology and Forgiveness'', which is a 2008 [[Lee Bennett Hopkins]] Poetry Award Honor Book.

==Description==
The story, written by Logue, told in [[present tense]], is a fiction book of 40 pages that follows a very awake little girl asking her parents if everything goes to sleep. The illustrations by Zagarenski show a family surrounded by images of crowns and ornate patterns while the parents coax the little girl to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanca|first1=Lynn|title=Sleep Like a Tiger|journal=School Library Journal|date=Dec 2012|volume=58|issue=12|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a whimsical story with universal appeal. Most of the text is found at the beginning of the book, allowing kids to become drowsy as the story continues making this book a perfect bed time story. ''Sleep Like a Tiger'' also uses different analogies to relate animals and their sleep behaviors to those of the little girl.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=R.L.|title=Sleep Like a Tiger|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=14&amp;sid=f1d20bf0-12c1-4546-9d5c-53d561479537%40sessionmgr120&amp;hid=105|website=Academic Search Complete|publisher=Horn Book Magazine|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents in this book practice the psychological art of [[paradoxical intention]], realizing that instead of forcing the little girl to go to sleep they let her naturally relax in bed knowing that sleep will come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heffron|first1=Thomas M.|title=Sleep Like a Tiger: Book review|url=http://www.sleepeducation.org/news/2013/09/20/sleep-like-a-tiger-book-review|website=Sleep Education|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Starting with the old adage "Once there was a little girl..." you come across a little girl and her parents, all wearing crowns. The little girl is wide awake claiming she is not tired. Her parents take this almost as a regular occurrence and require that she at least put on her pajamas, wash her face, brush her teeth. The little girl keeps repeating that she is not tired but climbs into bed and under the sheets since that is where she is the most comfortable. She then proceeds to ask her parents if everything thing goes to sleep. The parents then proceed to go through a list of animals and their habits of sleeping. They discuss the family dog, the cat, bats, snails, bears, and whales. The little girl proclaims that she knows an animal that sleeps a lot. We then finally come across the tiger in the jungle, where the little girl tells her parents that he sleeps to stay strong. The parents agree that sleep is good to stay strong then say goodnight even though the little girl claims she is still not sleepy. Her parents know what will happen and agree that she can stay awake all night long. After the long discussion, the little girl goes through all the processes that the animals go through and ends up fast asleep.

==Critical reception==
''Sleep Like a Tiger'' was published to very strong reviews. ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' claim that Zagarenski's illustrations are the perfect backdrop to the stories lyrical quality, with her use of different textures, busy lines, and tiny details, observant readers will be pleasantly rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danielson|first1=Julie|title=SLEEP LIKE A TIGER|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/mary-logue-pamela-zagarenskis-sleep-tiger/|website=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zagarenski usually has objects hidden in her illustrations having readers take closer looks and finding new objects even after the tenth time reading it, provides entertainment for both children and parents. Her work is a perfect combination of digitally created art and mixed media on wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanca|first1=Lynn|title=Sleep Like a Tiger|journal=School Library Journal|date=Dec 2012|volume=58|issue=12|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' claims that Zagarenski's soft-toned dreamscapes of moons and stars and toys perfectly match the lyrical text and magnifies the mood.

For the last several decades research in cross-cultural psychology has focused on the cultural patterning and positioning of values. Unfortunately, values have low predictive power for actual behavior. Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong decided to develop a questionnaire to measure beliefs, i.e., what is believed to be true about the world, to add to the power of values, i.e., what the person believes is valuable, in predicting behavior.

They administered the original '''Social Axioms Survey''' ('''SAS''') in five countries and used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the individual-level data. Five factors were found: Social cynicism, Social complexity, Reward for application, Religiosity and Fate control. However, analyzing the data on a country-wide level yielded only two factors: Societal cynicism and a combination of the other four factors labeled Dynamic externality. The SAS has proven useful in many research contexts, and eight years later the original  researchers developed an updated version, the SAS II, using a more complex methodology to increase the reliability of the various factors. The SAS II is currently being used in research as the more comprehensive and reliable measure of beliefs about the world.

==Definition of social axioms and their usefulness==

The study of values has a long history in psychological research, for instance Rokeach's value scale, which has been used widely.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. (1973). ''The nature of human values.'' Glencoe, IL: Free Press. Cited in Kwok Leung &amp; Michael Harris Bond. (2008)."Psycho-Logic and Eco-Logic: Insights from Social Axioms Dimensions."In Fons J. R. van de Vijver, Dianne A. van Hemert &amp; Ype H. Poortinga (Eds.) ''Multilevel Analysis of Individuals and Cultures,'' pp. `99-222. New York: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; That focus has also been transferred to the study of culture in psychology. The anthropologists Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck conducted a large-scale study of values in five Southwestern US cultures in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Kluckhohn, F. R. &amp; Strodtbeck, F.L. (1961). ''Variations in value orientations.'' Evanston, IL: Row, Peterson, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was Geert [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]] that really initiated the wave of cross-cultural research on values. His four (later increased to six) dimensions of cultural values have become a major tool in many kinds of cross-cultural research.&lt;ref name=Leung2002&gt;Leung, Kwok; Bond, Michael Harris; Carrasquel, Sharon Reimel de; Munoz, Carlos; Hernández, Marisela; Murakami, Fumio; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Bierbrauer, Gűnter; &amp; Singelis, Theodore M. (2002). "Social Axioms: The Search for Universal Dimensions of General Beliefs about How the World Functions." ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 33(3),'' 286-302.&lt;/ref&gt;
Values, however, have important limitations for predicting behavior. A value states that, "X is good/desirable/important," but it does not indicate if a person thinks that X is obtainable. A belief, on the other hand, is a statement about how things work in reality. A social axiom, according to Leung and Bond's (2002) definition, describes how the world and society are believed to work. In other words, "...a typical social axiom has the structure – A is related to B. A and B can be any entities, and the relationship can be causal or correlational." The strength of a belief can vary from person to person. Furthermore, a social axiom is different from a normative belief. Normative beliefs tell us what we ''ought'' to do, e.g., be polite to everyone. Social axioms are a guide as to what it is "possible" to do.&lt;ref name=Leung2008&gt;Leung, Kwok &amp; Bond, Michael Harris. (2008). "Psycho-Logic and Eco-Logic: Insights from Social Axioms Dimensions." In Fons J. R. van de Vijver, Dianne A. van Hemert &amp; Ype H. Poortinga (Eds.) ''Multilevel Analysis of Individuals and Cultures,'' pp. `99-222. New York: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leung and Bond (2008) provide a formal definition of social axioms: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Social axioms are generalized beliefs about people, social groups, social institutions, the physical environment, or the spiritual world as well as about categories of events and phenomena in the social world. These generalized beliefs are encoded in the form of an assertion about the relationship between two entities or concepts."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Social axioms act as a practical guide to human conduct in everyday life. They function in at least four ways. "They facilitate the attainment of important goals (instrumental), help people protect their self-worth (ego-defensive), serve as a manifestation of people's values (value-expressive), and help people understand the world (knowledge)."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt; Leung and Bond (2002) also argue that because people in all cultures face similar challenges in everyday life, these axioms should be universal, even if people in each culture do not believe in them with the same strength.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

==Development==

The Social Axioms Survey (SAS) was developed with the cooperation of researchers in Hong Kong and Venezuela, using materials from local residents along with sources in the psychology literature to develop and screen items for the Survey. The survey was then refined using data from Japan, the USA and Germany.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

===Generating survey items===

Three methods were used to generate a list of possible items for the Survey:&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;
*Examining the extensive literature already existing on beliefs in the English-language psychology literature
*Content analysis of popular literature in Hong Kong and Venezuela, including newspapers, textbooks, language surveys, proverbs, popular songs, etc.
*Interviews with adults in Hong Kong and Venezuela, both "on the street" and in-depth. Three sets of interview questions were used: "...(a) the beliefs and principles that guide their interactions with others, and their beliefs about everyday matters, (b) beliefs with regard to the self, other people, social relations, social groups, the environment, and the supernatural, and (c) beliefs with regard to issues on health, love, marriage, society, politics, religion, entertainment/recreation, work, family, sports and life in general".&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

===Screening the items and assembling the Survey===

Of the more than four thousand items collected, only about a third came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These items were classified, similar items were eliminated, and the remaining items were rewritten to be clear. The rewritten items were then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

The first working version contained 182 items. Scoring used a 5-point Likert-type scale, which ranged from "strongly believe" to a neutral midpoint "no opinion", to "strongly disbelieve",  A standard English version was used to generate Chinese and Spanish versions.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

===First administration===

The Survey was administered in both Venezuela and Hong Kong, using both university students (100 and 128 respectively), and citizens approached on the street (122 and 230). The adults completing the survey covered a range of ages, both genders and, in Venezuela, both urban and working participants.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

===Analyzing the results===

The data were analyzed separately for Hong Kong and Venezuela using [[cluster analysis]] as well as [[exploratory factor analysis]] and [[confirmatory factor analysis]] to see if there were patterns of relationship among the beliefs within each culture. The analysis pointed to a five factor solution – five clusters of beliefs that seem to be interrelated. The five factors overlapped substantially between the Hong Kong and Venezuelan samples, indicating that they were valid for both cultures. For a second analysis, the scores from both cultures were combined, and [[principal components analysis]] was used. Five factors were again obtained. The survey was shortened by eliminating items that had low factor loadings or were inconsistent with the meaning of their factors, resulting in a final survey of 60 questions.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

===Expanding the study===

Another study was conducted to explore the SAS in three more cultures with differing value orientations on Hofstede's cultural dimensions scale. The questionnaire was given to college students in Germany, Japan and the United States. Confirmatory factor analysis checked by [[Procrustes rotation]] was used to analyze the data, and again five factors were found, although some differences between cultures were found, especially for Spirituality (subsequently renamed Religiosity) and Fate control.&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

==Description of the factors==

*'''Social cynicism:''' "...a negative assessment of human nature, a biased view against some groups of people, a mistrust of social institutions, and a belief that people disregard ethical means in achieving their ends."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt; ''Sample items:'' "Powerful people tend to exploit others; "Kind-hearted people usually suffer losses;" "It is rare to see a happy ending in real life."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt; 
*'''Social complexity:''' "...there are multiple ways of achieving a given outcome and ...a given person's behavior is inconsistent from situation to situation."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt; ''Sample items:'' "Human behavior changes with the social context;" "One has to deal with matters according to the specific circumstances;" "To deal with things in a flexible way leads to success."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt; 
*'''Reward for application:''' "...effort, knowledge, careful planning, and the investment of these and other resources will lead to positive results."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt; ''Sample items:'' Hard-working people will achieve more in the end;" "Adversity can be overcome by effort;" "Every problem has a solution."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt; 
*'''Religiosity (originally called Spirituality):''' "...assert[s] the existence of a supernatural being and the beneficial social functions of religious institutions and practices."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt; ''Sample items:'' "There is a supreme being controlling the universe." "Belief in a religion helps one understand the meaning of life;" "Religious faith contributes to good mental health."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;
*'''Fate control:''' "...a belief that life events are determined by grand external forces, but reassuringly, there are some ways for people to influence the impact of these forces."&lt;ref name=Leung2008 /&gt; ''Sample items:'' "Fate determines one's successes and failures"; "Good luck follows if one survives a disaster"; "Most disasters can be predicted."&lt;ref name=Leung2002 /&gt;

==Multilevel analysis==

Cross-cultural studies have analyzed data at two levels. Analysis can use the scores from individuals as data for statistical analysis, as the original SAS studies did, or it can use the averages of whole countries as data points, as Hofstede's values study did. These two methods can give very different results, since the patterns of scores within a country may be different from the average of the whole country sample.&lt;ref name=Bond2004a&gt;Bond, Michael Harris; Leung, Kwok; Au, Al; Tong, Kwot-Kit; Carrasquel, Sharon Reimel de; Murakami, Fumio; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Bierbrauer, Gűnter; Singelis, Theodore M.;  Broer, Markus, et al. (2004). ''Culture-Level Dimensions of Social Axioms and Their Correlates across 41 Cultures.'' ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35(5),'' 548-570.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the factor structure of the SAS at the culture level Bond, Leung et. al. (2004) collected and analyzed SAS scores from 41 cultures. The data were analyzed at both the individual and country level. While the individual data yielded the expected five-factor structure, the country-level analysis yielded only a two-factor solution. Almost all items in one factor are contained in the original factor Social cynicism, so the factor was named Societal cynicism. The other factor contains items from the other four original factors. It was named Dynamic externality, combining both the "external" aspects of religiosity and fate control, and the "dynamic" aspects of Reward for application. Only one item from Social complexity appeared.&lt;ref name=Bond2004a /&gt;

==Development of the Social Axioms Survey II==

Eight years after their original construction of the SAS, the researchers developed a revised version (the SAS II) to improve its [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]]. The earlier reliabilities of Social complexity and Fate control were lower than they liked, and they hoped to generally improve its performance between cultures.&lt;ref name=Leung2012&gt;Leung, Kwok; Lam, Ben C. P.; Bond, Michael Harris; Conway, Lucian Gideon III; Gornick, Laura Janelle; Amponsah, Benjamin; Boehnke, Klaus; Dragolov, Georgi; et. al. (2012). ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 43(5),'' 833-857.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing the SAS II a different strategy was used. The original SAS was deductive – it examined the data and then constructed the axiom categories. The weakness of this method is that some categories may not have been adequately represented in the original group of items. Over the course of eight years, research had shown that the SAS was valid, and could be used in a theory-driven approach to build the SAS II. Another difficulty with the original SAS was that the scale was developed using many Western-influenced items. Those items might not have the same meaning in other cultures, and axioms derived from those items might not be adequately valid. Van de Vijver and Leung (1997) proposed the "culturally decentered" approach, in which items are created by researchers from many cultural groups, and the final questionnaire is analyzed so that items that are answered differently by different groups are changed or eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Vijver, F. &amp; Leung, K. (1997). ''Methods and data analysis for cross-cultural research.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; The culturally-decentered approach was used for the development of the SAS II. The SAS II yielded more reliable measures of Social complexity and Fate Control, and showed that Fate control could be sub-divided into two separate components, Fate determination and Fate alterability.&lt;ref name=Leung2012 /&gt;

==Representative research using survey==

''Level of knowledge of a culture's social axioms predicts adjustment levels of immigrants.'' Kurman and Ronen-Eilon (2004) demonstrated that an immigrant's level of knowledge of the host culture's social axioms is a better predictor of adjustment than whether the immigrant shares the host culture's values or social axioms themselves. This is in agreement with Berry's model of acculturation, which maintains that the best strategy for immigrant success is integration – learning how to operate in the host culture without assimilating one's own values and beliefs completely.&lt;ref name=Kurman2004&gt;Kurman, Jenny &amp; Ronen-Eilon, Carmel (2004). "Lack of Knowledge of a Culture's Social Axioms and Adaptation difficulties among Immigrants." ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35(2),'' 192-208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, J.W. (1990). "Psychology of acculturation." In J. Berman (Ed.). ''Nebraska symposium on Motivation 1989: Cross-cultural Perspectives,'' (pp. 201-234. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. Cited in Kurman, Jenny &amp; Ronen-Eilon, Carmel (2004). "Lack of Knowledge of a Culture's Social Axioms and Adaptation difficulties among Immigrants." ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35(2),'' 192-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Social axioms supplement the predictive power of values.'' Bond et. al. showed that using social axioms added to the power of values to predict vocational choice, style of conflict resolution and style of coping.&lt;ref name=Bond2004b&gt;Bond, Michael Harris; Leung, Kwok; Au, Al; Tong, Kwok-kit;  &amp; Chemonges-Nielson, Zoe (2004). "Combining Social Axioms with Values in Predicting Social Behaviors." ''European Journal of Personality, 18:'' 177-191.&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching abroad''' is a [[catch phrase]] used in [[first world]] countries for temporary teaching assignments outside of the teacher's home country.

==Overview of different programs==
There are many different programs that exist to help people to teach abroad. If a person knows that they want to teach abroad but they aren't sure if they're able to make the transition, they can pick a teaching program that goes from a semester to a couple years. There are also programs where one can switch positions with a teacher overseas. When picking a program make sure its a credible program. Three often-used paths for American teachers are teaching at a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school, teaching at an [[international school]], or working independently at any school accepting foreign applicants.

==U.S. Department of Defense==
Teaching at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) school is much like teaching at a school within the United States.  The schools enroll the children of military and DOD civilian employees.  There are currently 222 public schools in “13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico” (DOD).  There are 8,785 teachers working in these schools.  The DOD works to keep the school atmosphere and level of learning comparable to schools within the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodea.edu DoDEA: The Department of Defense Education Activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOD hires only teachers with bachelor's degrees (which must include some course work in education) and teaching experience.  Most placements are for one or two years; teachers are placed at the discretion of the DoD and cannot choose their location.

==International volunteer programs==
Numerous volunteer programs exist in which teachers can teach in foreign schools.  Costs to participate as a volunteer vary depending on the organization, the country and the length of the program.  International volunteer programs usually vary in length from 2 to 12 months.  Volunteers most often teach English but other subjects can also be covered, such as computer skills, AIDS/HIV awareness, science, math, etc.

Volunteer English teaching programs exist in almost all corners of the world.  Some countries with prominent English teaching programs are Chile, Spain, France and Georgia.  Many programs are sponsored by the host nation's ministry of education, such as the Chile's [[English Opens Doors Program|English Opens Doors]] and Korea's [[EPIK]] program.

==International schools==
[[International school]]s are private schools that cater mainly to children who are not nationals of the host country, including the children of the staff of international businesses, international organizations, foreign embassies, missions, or missionary programs. Teachers are often hired on contracts which typically last two years &lt;ref&gt;Savva, M. (2013). International schools as gateways to the intercultural development of North-American teachers. Journal of Research in International Education, 12(3), 214-227. &lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that teaching experiences abroad contribute positively to the intercultural development of teachers (Savva, 2013).

==TESOL Certification==
Many teaching positions overseas are for teachers of English, and can involve teaching to all ages, including both children and adults.  Programs are organized by individual schools, national governments (such as the [[JET Programme]] in Japan and [[English Opens Doors Program|English Opens Doors]] in Chile). The University of Missouri-Saint Louis, like many schools, have required their education majors to either pick TESOL or special education to major in for more specificity. This university in particular wants teachers to be more well rounded for future employers. Some programs require [[teaching credential]]s and/or [[teaching English as a foreign language|TESOL certification]].

There is some dispute about the claimed usefulness of brief courses (TEFL, TESOL, etc.) in either becoming an effective teacher or finding employment.  Such courses are sometimes advertised as being important or even required, without stating that they are no substitute for a university degree in [[teaching English as a foreign language]].

'''''The Hitchhiker''''' is a 2007 American [[thriller (genre)|thriller film]] written and directed by [[Leigh Scott]], and co-written by Jeshua De Horta.

==Plot==
While travelling through [[Utah]], Jack Carter picks up a [[hitchhiker]], but kicks him out after a few minutes due to the man hitting on him. Hours later, Jack stops in a secluded area, and begins digging a grave for the woman he had bound and gagged in the back of his pickup truck.

Four women (Melinda, Patty, Kristina, and Denise) from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] are driving through the area on their way to a nurse's conference in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Spotting Jack hitchhiking, the quartet pick him up, and soon after experience car trouble, forcing them to stop at a roadside [[motel]]. The manager tells the group that the nearest service station does not open until the morning, so they elect to stay. During the night, Jack shows interest in Melinda, and has rough sex with Kristina, who has a fiancé.

In the morning, the mechanic arrives, and is shot to death by Jack after the two travel to Jack's abandoned truck. Jack returns to the motel, where he murders the manager and takes the women captive after drugging them. Jack gives a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] speech, and implies he is doing this due to having been "betrayed" by his girlfriend or wife. While sexually assaulting Denise and Melinda, Jack is knocked out by the latter, who tries to escape with her friends. The vehicles will either not work, or are missing their keys, so the women decide to kill Jack, who awakens while being attacked, and fatally shoots Kristina. The others are recaptured, and while Jack is binding Melinda (who he has developed a fondness for, and regards as "special") a married couple arrives, looking for a room.

After giving the couple a room, Jack kills the husband when he goes to investigate noises coming from the room Melinda and the others are in. Jack places the man's wife, Susan, with the other captives, and shoots Patty in the head after Denise goes on an insult-laden rant against him. As Jack sleeps, Susan uses her cellphone to repeatedly dial 911, prompting a pair of police officers to stop by in the morning. Jack gets into a shootout with the officers, who he kills while Melinda, Denise, and Susan drive off in their patrol car. A chase ensues, during which Susan is shot in the head, and Jack is run over.

Weeks later, Denise visits Melinda, and it is revealed that Jack had survived, and is being tried in [[Wyoming]], where he murdered at least two women. That night, Jack, who had escaped from custody and hitchhiked his way to Colorado, breaks into Melinda's home, and ties her husband to a chair. Jack declares his love for Melinda, who responds by rejecting him, shooting him in the stomach, and then in the face.

==Reception==

Arrow in the Head gave ''The Hitchhiker'' a two and half out of four, describing it as "a perfectly decent little flick" and going on to say that "For a direct-to-DVD knock-off, it's always watchable and mostly engaging. You could do worse than dropping a few bucks down for this, but don't expect to be too surprised or scared by the assembly line plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/the-hitchhiker|title = ''The Hitchhiker''|last = Hughton|first = Jamey|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Hollywood said it was "not altogether bad" and that it moves well enough, "with plenty of gratuitous sex, violence, and exploitative moments" to warrant a viewing for those interested in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.beyondhollywood.com/the-hitchhiker-2007-movie-review/|title = ''The Hitchhiker'' (2007) Movie Review|last = |first = Nix|publisher = Beyond Hollywood|date = 18 March 2007|website = beyondhollywood.com|accessdate = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Vasquez Jr. of [[Film Threat]] panned the movie, writing that the movie was "definite proof that all Leigh Scott had to do to ensure he'd inflict a cruel revenge on me was to make another movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Hitchhiker|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitchhiker/|website = Rotten Tomatoes|date = 2006-09-12|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tuck Everlasting''''' is a 2002 [[romantic fantasy]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Jay Russell]] and starring [[Alexis Bledel]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Amy Irving]], [[Victor Garber]], [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]], [[Scott Bairstow]], and [[William Hurt]]. Based on [[Natalie Babbitt]]’s [[Tuck Everlasting|1975 children’s book of the same name]], it was a [[Walt Disney Pictures]] release.

== Plot ==
15-year-old Winnie (Winifred) Foster is from an upper-class family in the town of Treegap, and wants to make her own choices in life. After being told that she is going to a boarding school, she runs off into the forest where she meets Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring at the foot of a great tree. She is kidnapped by his older brother Miles and brought back to the Tucks' home where they tell her they will return her as soon as they can trust her.

She becomes enamored of their slow and simple way of life and falls in love with Jesse. She learns that the Tucks cannot age or be injured due to drinking water from a magic spring around a hundred years ago and that they kidnapped her to hide the secret. They tell her that living forever is more painful than it sounds and believe that giving away the secret of the spring will lead to everyone wanting to drink from it.

A man in a yellow suit befriends the Fosters while Winnie is gone. He spies on the Tucks and he desires the spring to sell the water. He makes a deal to save Winnie and get the forest. He goes to the Tucks and orders them to reveal where the spring is; when they deny any knowledge about the spring he threatens Winnie with a pistol. He calls their bluff by shooting Jesse and exposing his youth; but in return Jesse's mother, Mae, kills him with the rear end of a rifle. The constable arrests Mae and Angus. Mae is sentenced to be hanged for murdering the man.

After being returned home, Winnie is woken by Jesse who begs her to help him free his parents. The family fears that if Mae will be hanged the next day, she won't die and their immortality will be exposed to the public. Winnie helps Jesse and Miles to break the Tucks out of jail and say goodbye to them. Jesse, who has fallen in love with Winnie, asks her to join them, but Angus warns her that it is dangerous to go with them as they will be hunted. Jesse tells Winnie to drink from the spring so she could live forever and never age, then he will come back for her when everything is safe. He leaves promising to love her until the day he dies. After the Tucks depart, Winnie chooses not to drink the water. She would rather die after living a full life, than be immortal and stuck watching life pass her by.

85 years later, Jesse returns to Treegap, which has now become a modern city. He goes into the woods and at the base of the great tree he finds Winnie's headstone marking the site of where the spring once stood. The stone reads that Winnie became a wife and mother before passing away at 100 years of age. Jesse sits at her grave, smiling through his tears and remembering her.

The '''Voyager Golden Records''' are two [[gramophone record|phonograph records]] that were included aboard both [[Voyager program|Voyager spacecraft]] launched in 1977.&lt;ref name="TA-20170630"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lafrance |first=Adrienne |title=Solving the Mystery of Whose Laughter Is On the Golden Record |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/solving-the-mystery-of-whose-laughter-is-on-the-golden-record/532197/ |date=30 June 2017 |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=1 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] form, or for future humans, who may find them. The records are a sort of [[time capsule]].

Although neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, ''[[Voyager 1]]'' will pass within 1.6 [[light-year]]s' distance of the star [[Gliese 445]], currently in the constellation [[Camelopardalis]], in about [[Timeline of the far future#Spacecraft and space exploration|40,000 years]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html |title=Voyager – Interstellar Mission |website=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] noted that "The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring [[civilization]]s in [[interstellar space|interstellar]] space, but the launching of this [[Message in a bottle|'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean']] says something very hopeful about life on this planet." &lt;ref name="Voyager - Golden Record"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html |title=Voyager – Golden Record |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The ''[[Voyager 1]]'' probe is currently the [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|farthest human-made object]] from [[Earth]]. ''Voyager 1'' has reached interstellar space, the region between stars where the [[Interstellar medium|galactic plasma]] is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20130912.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space |date=September 12, 2013 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like their predecessors ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] [[Pioneer 10|10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'', which featured a simple [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], both ''Voyager 1'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' were launched by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] with a message aboard—a kind of [[time capsule]], intended to communicate to extraterrestrials a story of the world of [[human]]s on Earth.&lt;ref name = "Voyager - Golden Record"/&gt;

{{quote|This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. |[[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]}}

== Contents ==
{{Main|Contents of the Voyager Golden Record}}

The contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by [[Carl Sagan]] of [[Cornell University]]. The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of [[Birdsong|birds]] and [[whale sound|whales]]). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's),&lt;ref name="TA-20170630" /&gt; and printed messages from U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Kurt Waldheim]]. The record also includes the inspirational message ''[[Per aspera ad astra]]'' in [[Morse code]].

| title       = "Hello from the children of Planet Earth"
| description = A child's greeting in English recorded on the Voyager Golden Record

}}
The collection of images includes many photographs and diagrams both in black and white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the [[Solar System]] and its planets, [[DNA]], and human [[Outline of human anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Human reproduction|reproduction]]. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of [[chemical composition]]. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the [[universe]].

The musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as [[J.S. Bach]] (interpreted by [[Glenn Gould]]), [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (played by the [[Budapest String Quartet]]), and [[Igor Stravinsky| Stravinsky]]. The disc also includes music by [[Guan Pinghu]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Valya Balkanska]], and electronic composer [[Laurie Spiegel]], as well as [[Azerbaijani folk music]] by oboe player [[Kamil Jalilov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-interstellar-contract |title=The Interstellar Contract |first=Alex |last=Ross |date=February 13, 2014 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of Berry's "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" was controversial, with some claiming that rock music was "adolescent", to which Sagan replied, "There are a lot of adolescents on the planet."&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is on Voyager's Golden Record? |first=Megan |last=Gambino |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-on-voyagers-golden-record-73063839/?no-ist=&amp;page=4 |date=April 22, 2012 |work=[[The Smithsonian]] |accessdate=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of music for the record was completed by a team composed of Carl Sagan as project director, [[Linda Salzman Sagan]], [[Frank Drake]], [[Alan Lomax]], [[Ann Druyan]] as creative director, artist [[Jon Lomberg]], [[Timothy Ferris]] as producer, and [[Jimmy Iovine]] as sound engineer.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;.&lt;ref name="TimFerris"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferris|first1=Timothy|title=How the Voyager Golden Record Was Made|url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/voyager-golden-record-40th-anniversary-timothy-ferris|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Record also carries an hour-long recording of the brainwaves of [[Ann Druyan]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; During the recording of the brainwaves, Druyan thought of many topics, including Earth's history, civilizations and the problems they face, and what it was like to fall in love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-679-41160-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After NASA had received [[Pioneer plaque#Criticism|criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque]] (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included.&lt;ref&gt;Lomberg, Jon, "Pictures of Earth" in {{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=Murmurs of Earth |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-34528-396-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the record does contain "Diagram of vertebrate evolution", by [[Jon Lomberg]], with drawings of an anatomically correct naked male and naked female, showing external organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/sceneearth.html |title=Voyager Record Photograph Index |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA | accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pulsar]] map and hydrogen molecule diagram are shared in common with the [[Pioneer plaque]].

The 115 images are encoded in analogue form and composed of 512 vertical lines. The remainder of the record is audio, designed to be played at 16⅔ revolutions per minute.

[[Jimmy Iovine]], who was still early in his career as a music producer, served as sound engineer for the project.&lt;ref name="Ferris"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Ferris |first1=Timothy |title=How the Voyager Golden Record Was Made |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/voyager-golden-record-40th-anniversary-timothy-ferris |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |magazine=The New Yorker |date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that Carl Sagan suggested including the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" on the record but the record company [[EMI]], which held the copyrights, declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!The-Truly-Most-Expensive-Record-Ever-25-billion-dollars-no-Beatles-and-no-nudity/c1rr6/557a38940cf2c5991af3e149 |title=The Truly Most Expensive Record Ever: 2.5 billion dollars (no Beatles and no nudity) |date=June 12, 2015 |first=Arved |last=Deecke |publisher=Kvart &amp; Bølge |accessdate=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was refuted by [[Timothy Ferris]], who worked on the selection with Sagan; the song was never even considered for inclusion.&lt;ref name="Ferris" /&gt;

In July 2015, NASA uploaded the audio contents of the record to the audio streaming service [[SoundCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sets/golden-record-greetings-to-the |title=Greetings to the Universe |via=SoundCloud |access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/nasa/sets/golden-record-sounds-of |title=Sounds of Earth |via=SoundCloud |access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voyager Golden Record Cover Explanation.svg|thumb|Explanation of the Voyager record cover diagram, as provided by NASA]]

In the upper left-hand corner is a drawing of the [[phonograph record]] and the stylus carried with it. The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in [[Binary Arithmetic|binary arithmetic]] is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a [[Hydrogen line|fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom]]. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side of the record—about an hour (more precisely, between 53 and 54 minutes).

The information in the upper right-hand portion of the cover is designed to show how pictures are to be constructed from the recorded signals. The top drawing shows the typical signal that occurs at the start of a picture. The picture is made from this signal, which traces the picture as a series of vertical lines, similar to analog [[television]] (in which the picture is a series of horizontal lines). Picture lines 1, 2 and 3 are noted in binary numbers, and the duration of one of the "picture lines," about 8 milliseconds, is noted. The drawing immediately below shows how these lines are to be drawn vertically, with staggered "interlace" to give the correct picture rendition. Immediately below this is a drawing of an entire picture [[Raster scan|raster]], showing that there are 512 (2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) vertical lines in a complete picture. Immediately below this is a replica of the first picture on the record to permit the recipients to verify that they are decoding the signals correctly. A circle was used in this picture to ensure that the recipients use the correct ratio of horizontal to vertical height in picture reconstruction. Color images were represented by three images in sequence, one each for red, green, and blue components of the image. A color image of the spectrum of the sun was included for calibration purposes.

The drawing in the lower left-hand corner of the cover is the pulsar map previously sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11. It shows the location of the Solar System with respect to 14 [[pulsar]]s, whose precise periods are given. The drawing containing two circles in the lower right-hand corner is a drawing of the [[hydrogen atom]] in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale, both for the time given on the cover and in the decoded pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/voyager_record/index_voyager.html |title=Voyager Record |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blank records were provided by the [[Pyral]] S.A. of [[Créteil]], France. [[Sony Music|CBS Records]] contracted the JVC Cutting Center in [[Boulder, Colorado]], to cut the [[Audio mastering|lacquer masters]] which were then sent to the James G. Lee record-processing center in [[Gardena, California]], to cut and gold-plate eight Voyager records. After the records were plated they were mounted in aluminum containers and delivered to JPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voyager &amp; the Golden Record |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasa-jpl/sets/72157676187916186 |via=Flickr |publisher=NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voyager Interstellar Record Collection, 1976-1977 |url=https://pub-lib.jpl.nasa.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-533/JPL151,%20Voyager%20Interstellar%20Record%20Collection,%20%201976-1977.pdf |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record is constructed of gold-plated copper and is {{convert|12|in|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Voyager - Golden Record"/&gt; The record's cover is [[Aluminium|aluminum]] and [[electroplating|electroplated]] upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope [[uranium-238]]. Uranium-238 has a [[half-life]] of 4.468 billion years. It is possible (e.g. via [[Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry|mass-spectrometry]]) that a civilization that encounters the record will be able to use the ratio of remaining uranium to the other elements to determine the age of the record.

The records also had the inscription ''"To the makers of music – all worlds, all times"'' hand-etched on its surface. The inscription was located in the "takeout grooves", an area of the record between the label and playable surface. Since this was not in the original specifications, the record was initially rejected, to be replaced with a blank disc. Sagan later convinced the administrator to include the record as is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/opinion/05ferris.html |title=The Mix Tape of the Gods |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Timothy |last=Ferris |date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journey ==
[[File:Record is attached to Voyager 1.jpg|thumb|Golden record is attached to the spacecraft.]]
''[[Voyager 1]]'' was launched in 1977, passed the orbit of [[Pluto]] in 1990, and left the [[Solar System]] (in the sense of passing the [[Heliosphere|termination shock]]) in November 2004. It is now in the [[Kuiper belt]]. In about 40,000 years, it and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' will each come to within about 1.8 [[light-year]]s of two separate stars: ''Voyager 1'' will have approached star [[Gliese 445]], located in the constellation [[Camelopardalis]]; and ''Voyager 2'' will have approached star [[Ross 248]], located in the constellation of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]].

In March 2012, ''Voyager 1'' was over 17.9 billion km from the Sun and traveling at a speed of 3.6 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] per year (approximately {{convert|61000|km/h|abbr=on}}), while ''Voyager 2'' was over 14.7 billion km away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year (approximately {{convert|56000|km/h|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voyager – The Interstellar Mission |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html |website=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voyager 1'' has entered the [[heliosheath]], the region beyond the termination shock. The termination shock is where the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically charged gas blowing continuously outward from the Sun, is slowed by pressure from gas between the stars. At the termination shock, the solar wind slows abruptly from its average speed of {{convert|300|-|700|km/s|mph|abbr=on}} and becomes denser and hotter.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/voyager_agu.html |title=Voyager Enters Solar System's Final Frontier |date=May 24, 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the eleven instruments carried on ''Voyager 1'', five of them are still operational and continue to send back data today. It is expected that there will be insufficient energy to power any of the instruments beyond 2025.

On September 12, 2013, NASA announced that ''Voyager 1'' had left the heliosheath and entered [[Outer space|interstellar space]],&lt;ref name="Voyager 1 Interstellar Space"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20130912.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space |date=September 12, 2013 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it still remains within the Sun's gravitational sphere of influence.

== Depictions in culture ==
[[Image:Voyager Sounds of Earth record - Udvar-Hazy Center.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A copy of the record on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center in [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].]]
Several works of science fiction, such as the 1979 film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', the 1984 film ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' and the 2000 film ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' feature extraterrestrial intelligences discovering the record and turning their attention to Earth as a result. Among these is included the computer animated television show ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers|Beast Wars]]'', which features one of the records as a central plot point in a continuation of the ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers]]'' storyline. Referred to as the Golden Disk, the record is stolen by [[Megatron#Beast Era|Megatron]] and his band of Predacons. The disk is revealed to contain a hidden message left by [[Megatron#Generation 1|the original Megatron]], instructing his descendants to venture back in time to prehistoric Earth and assassinate [[Optimus Prime]], to change history and ensure a [[Decepticon]] victory against the [[Autobot]]s. 

In a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' segment ("Next Week in Review") in episode 64 of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 3)|third season]] (originally aired 1978), [[Steve Martin]]'s character, a psychic named Cocuwa, announced that extraterrestrials had responded to the record with the four words "Send more Chuck Berry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77rreview.phtml |title=Saturday Night Live Transcripts, Season 3: Episode 18, 77r: Steve Martin / The Blues Brothers, Next Week In Review |date=April 22, 1978 |series=Season 3: 1977-1978 |layurl=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77r.phtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recording is a major plot piece of "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]", a [[The X-Files (season 2)|season 2]] episode of ''[[The X-Files]]''.

On ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the Greetings from Earth on the golden record are sent to ''[[USS Voyager|Voyager]]'' by Rain Robinson in Season 3, Episode 8 "[[Future's End]]".

It was also referenced in the 2005 animation known as ''[[Fafner in the Azure]]'' as being one of the objects that the aliens discover.

In 2014, the [[podcast]] ''[[The Truth (podcast)|The Truth]]'' produced an episode titled "Voyager Found", where the ''Voyager'' crash-lands on the property of Dawn and Tad, an alien couple, who decide to play the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthpodcast.com/story/2015/10/6/voyager-found |title=Voyager Found |publisher=The Truth Podcast |accessdate=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, composer [[Dario Marianelli]] wrote a ''Voyager Concerto'' for Violin and Orchestra, which was premiered in [[Brisbane]], Australia in November that year by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra (QSO), and in Stockholm the following April (2015), by the Swedish Radio Orchestra. The QSO, with British violinist Jack Liebeck, performed the piece over several concerts at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre; each performance was preceded by a lecture by physicist professor [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], who talked at length about NASA's Voyager Mission, and introduced the concerto. The 30-minute piece, in one single movement, depicts the journey of the ''Voyager'' through the Solar System, using as references some of the music that is on board each probe, on the Golden Record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/voyager-concerto/d-marianelli-voyager-concerto|title=D. Marianelli - Voyager Concerto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An image of the Golden Record cover is printed on the physical CD of [[Mary Fahl]]'s 2014 release ''Love &amp; Gravity''.

The 2015 feature documentary ''Sam Klemke's Time Machine'', compares the Golden Record's portrait of humanity to American man Sam Klemke's ongoing self-portraiture. In 1977—the same year that NASA launched Voyager with the Golden Record—Sam started obsessively documenting his entire life on film. ''Sam Klemke's Time Machine'', directed by Matthew Bate, premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Harvey |first1=Dennis |title=Sundance Film Review: 'Sam Klemke's Time Machine' |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-sam-klemkes-time-machine-1201407675/ |date=January 23, 2015 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Moray]], an English folk singer, released the album ''Upcetera'' in September 2016. It contains the track 'Sounds of Earth' in which he interweaves the stories of the production of the Golden Record and the romance between Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. It refers to the recording of an EEG of Druyan as she thought of Sagan as the sound of someone falling in love.&lt;ref name="jimmoray.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmoray.co.uk/upcetera/2016/07/19/upcetera/ |title=Upcetera by Jim Moray |date=July 19, 2016 |publisher=jimmoray.co.uk |access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the podcast [[Science Friday]] featured an updated, [[crowd sourced]] version of the Golden Record which included, among other entries, [[I Have a Dream]], ''[[The Little Prince]]'', and the [[human genome]].&lt;ref name="Science Friday Updated Version"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.sciencefriday.com/goldenrecord/ |title=Your Record |work=Science Friday |date=October 7, 2016 | accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Grace Petrie]], an English songwriter and folk singer, released a track by the name of "The Golden Record" on her 2017 album ''Heart First Aid Kit,'' which is a love song based upon the story of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, referencing the additions made to the record intended to depict the sound of human beings in love. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gracepetrie.bandcamp.com/album/heart-first-aid-kit |title=Heart First Aid Kit, by Grace Petrie &amp; the PC Brigade |date=June 2017 |publisher=Grace Petrie |access-date=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 documentary ''The Farthest'', directed by Emer Reynolds, features those who worked on the Golden Record and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions including [[Frank Drake]], [[Timothy Ferris]], and [[Nick Sagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/2899/the-farthest-interview-with-director-emer-reynolds |title=Interview with Director Emer Reynolds |last=Epstein |first=Sonia |date=May 4, 2017 |publisher=Sloan Science &amp; Film |access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
