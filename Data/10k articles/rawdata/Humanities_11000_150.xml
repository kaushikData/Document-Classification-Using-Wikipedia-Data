By Mary Wollstonecraft. The Second Edition. London: Printed for J. Johnson, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-Yard. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from the second edition of ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'', the first to carry [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft's]] name]]

{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}
'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France''''' (1790) is a political [[pamphlet]], written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Mary Wollstonecraft – Equal Rights for Women|journal=Foundation for Economic Education|url=https://fee.org/articles/mary-wollstonecraft-equal-rights-for-women/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attacks [[aristocracy]] and advocates [[republicanism]]. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a [[Revolution Controversy|pamphlet war]] sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), a defense of [[Constitutional monarchy#Constitutional monarchy in the United Kingdom|constitutional monarchy]], aristocracy, and the [[Church of England]].

Wollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for [[Marie Antoinette]], but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical ''tableaux''.

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition, published anonymously, sold out in three weeks. However, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer. They contrasted Wollstonecraft's "passion" with Burke's "reason" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author. This remained the prevailing analysis of the ''Rights of Men'' until the 1970s, when [[feminist literary criticism|feminist scholars]] revisited Wollstonecraft's texts and endeavoured to bring greater attention to their intellectualism.

==Historical context==

===Revolution Controversy===
{{main|Revolution Controversy}}
[[File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=The focus of the chalk drawing is at the center, where one man is standing on a table. Below him, three men are grouped together, joining hands. Around them are dozes of men, with their hands upraised. People look in from the windows.|''Tennis Court Oath'' (1791) by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]

''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was written against the backdrop of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it provoked in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', which lasted from 1789 until the end of 1795, British political commentators argued over the validity of monarchy. One scholar has called this debate "perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]".&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of popular agitation in revolutionary France, demonstrated in events such as the [[Tennis Court Oath]] and the [[storming of the Bastille]] in 1789, reinvigorated the [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|British reform movement]], which had been largely moribund for a decade. Efforts to reform the British electoral system and to distribute the seats in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] more equitably were revived.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s was sparked by the publication of [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously been part of the liberal [[British Whig Party|Whig]] party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the [[American revolution]]aries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33; Kelly, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three [[shilling]]s, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years.&lt;ref name="Butler345"&gt;Butler, 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] famous response, ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published only weeks after Burke's ''Reflections''. While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as [[William Godwin]], Paine, and Wollstonecraft, argued for [[republicanism]], agrarian socialism, [[anarchy]], and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those who came to be called radicals supported similar aims: individual liberties and [[civic virtue]]. They were also united in the same broad criticisms: opposition to the bellicose "landed interest" and its role in government corruption, and opposition to a monarchy and aristocracy who they believed were unlawfully seizing the people's power.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

1792 was the "''annus mirabilis'' of eighteenth-century radicalism": its most important texts were published and the influence of radical associations, such as the [[London Corresponding Society]] (LCS) and the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] (SCI), was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 7; see also Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until these middle- and working-class groups formed an alliance with the genteel [[Friends of the People Society|Society of the Friends of the People]] that the government became concerned. After this alliance was formed, the conservative-dominated government prohibited [[seditious]] writings. Over 100 prosecutions for sedition took place in the 1790s alone, a dramatic increase from previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals: they made ever more political arrests and infiltrated radical groups; they threatened to "revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicised debating societies and to carry reformist literature"; they seized the mail of "suspected dissidents"; they supported groups that disrupted radical events; and they attacked dissidents in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals saw this period, which included the [[1794 Treason Trials]], as "the institution of a system of TERROR, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at [[George III]] and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the [[French revolutionary wars|war with France]] and lower bread prices, Parliament immediately passed the "gagging acts" (the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]] and the [[Treasonable Practices Act]], also known as the "Two Acts"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held.&lt;ref&gt;Barrell and Mee, "Introduction", xxxv; Keen, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; British radicalism was effectively muted during the later 1790s and 1800s. It was not until the next generation that any [[Reform Act 1832|real reform]] could be enacted.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, "Introductory essay", 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burke's ''Reflections''===
{{main|Reflections on the Revolution in France}}

Published partially in response to [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price|Richard Price's]] sermon celebrating the French revolution, Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and [[primogeniture]].&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt; He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'', he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.
[[File:BurkeReflections.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Page reads "Reflections on the Revolution in France, and on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in London Relative to that Event. In a Letter Intended to have been sent to a Gentleman in Paris. By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, in Pall-Mall. M.DCC.XC."|Title page from [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790)]]
Burke criticizes many British thinkers and writers who welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While the radicals likened the revolution to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 1–2; 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', he had argued that "large inexact notions convey ideas best", and to generate fear in the reader, in ''Reflections'' he constructs the set-piece of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the [[Reign of Terror]], Burke was viewed as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke also criticizes the learning associated with the French ''[[philosophes]]''; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort to improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.&lt;ref name="Butler345"/&gt;

===Composition and publication of the ''Rights of Men''===
In the advertisement printed at the beginning of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft describes how and why she wrote it:
{{quote|text=
MR. BURKE'S Reflections on the French Revolution first engaged my attention as the transient topic of the day; and reading it more for amusement than information, my indignation was roused by the sophistical arguments, that every moment crossed me, in the questionable shape of natural feelings and common sense.

Many pages of the following letter were the effusions of the moment; but, swelling imperceptibly to a considerable size, the idea was suggested of publishing a short vindication of ''the Rights of Men.''

Not having leisure or patience to follow this desultory writer through all the devious tracks in which his fancy has started fresh game, I have confined my strictures, in a great measure, to the grand principles at which he has levelled many ingenious arguments in a very specious garb.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
So the pamphlet could be published as soon as she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written.&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his ''Memoirs'', describes it as "a temporary fit of torpor and indolence".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; see also Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' was published anonymously on 29 November 1790, the first of between fifty and seventy responses to Burke by various authors.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60; Taylor, 7; Sapiro, 23; Myers, 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three weeks later, on 18 December, a second edition, with her name printed on the title page, was issued.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft took time to edit the second edition, which, according to biographer Emily Sunstein, "sharpened her personal attack on Burke" and changed much of the text from [[First-person narrative|first person]] to [[third-person narrative|third person]]; "she also added a non-partisan code criticising hypocritical liberals who talk equality but scrape before the powers that be."&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and major arguments==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|right|thumb|Near-profile, half-length portrait of a man wearing a brown suit who has reddish-brown hair and a ruddy complexion.|[[Edmund Burke]], painted by the studio of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] (1771)]]

Until the 1970s, the ''Rights of Men'' was typically considered disorganized, incoherent, illogical, and replete with ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks (such as the suggestion that Burke would have promoted the crucifixion of Christ if he were a Jew).&lt;ref name="W434"&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been touted as an example of "feminine" emotion tilting at "masculine" reason.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Myers, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1970s scholars have challenged this view, arguing that Wollstonecraft employed 18th-century modes of writing, such as the digression, to great rhetorical effect. More importantly, as scholar Mitzi Myers argues, "Wollstonecraft is virtually alone among those who answered Burke in eschewing a narrowly political approach for a wide-ranging critique of the foundation of the ''Reflections''."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft makes a primarily moral argument; her "polemic is not a confutation of Burke's political theories, but an exposure of the cruel inequities which those theories presuppose."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's style was also a deliberate choice, enabling her to respond to Burke's ''Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful'' as well as to ''Reflections''.&lt;ref name="Johnson26"&gt;Johnson, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the ''Rights of Men'' mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like ''Reflections'', the text follows the mental associations made by the author as she was writing.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 58; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, in the form of a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself.&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"&gt;Sapiro, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The ''Rights of Men'' is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 197; Myers, 121; Kelly, 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates, as one scholar writes, "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence."&lt;ref name="Sapiro197"/&gt; At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rights of Men'' does not aim to present a fully articulated alternative political theory to Burke's, but instead to demonstrate the weaknesses and contradictions in his own argument. Therefore, much of the text is focused on Burke's logical inconsistencies, such as his support of the American revolution and the [[George IV of the United Kingdom#Regency crisis of 1788|Regency Bill]] (which proposed restricting monarchical power during George III's madness in 1788), in contrast to his lack of support for the French revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; see also, Poovey 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In criticism of Burke's contradictory support of the Regency Bill along with supporting the rule of monarchy in France, she writes:
{{quote|text=
You were so eager to taste the sweets of power, that you could not wait till time had determined, whether a dreadful delirium would settle into a confirmed madness; but, prying into the secrets of Omnipotence, you thundered out that God had ''hurled him from his throne'', and that it was the most insulting mockery to recollect that he had been a king, or treat him with any particular respect on account of his former dignity…. I have, Sir, been reading, with a scrutinizing, comparative eye, several of your insensible and profane speeches during the King's illness. I disdain to take advantage of a man's weak side, or draw consequences from an unguarded transport—A lion preys not on carcasses!&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis Wollstonecraft's]
}}
Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is "to shew you [Burke] to yourself, stripped of the gorgeous drapery in which you have enwrapped your tyrannic principles."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 70; see also Myers, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 82; Todd, 218; Kelly, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==

===Attack against rank and privilege===
Wollstonecraft's attack on rank and hierarchy dominates the ''Rights of Men''. She chastises Burke for his contempt for the people, whom he dismisses as the "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 199; Jones, 49; Johnson, 28; Myers, 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous passage, Burke had written: "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Butler, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the ''Rights of Men'' into larger social and political contexts.&lt;!--this sentence seems a bit out of place here--&gt;

Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends that people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Janet Todd]] writes, "the vision of society revealed [in] ''A Vindication of the Rights of Men'' was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged."&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the "vices of the rich", such as "insincerity" and the "want of natural affections".&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95; see also Jones, 49; 51; Poovey, 65; Myers, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; She endorses a [[commercialism|commercial]] society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several years later, in ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.

While [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] clergyman [[Richard Price]], whose sermon helped spark Burke's work, is the villain of ''Reflections'', he is the hero of the ''Rights of Men''. Both Wollstonecraft and Burke associate him with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, particularly the notion that civilization could progress through rational debate, but they interpret that stance differently. Burke believed such relentless questioning would lead to anarchy, while Wollstonecraft connected Price with "reason, liberty, free discussion, mental superiority, the improving exercise of the mind, moral excellence, active benevolence, orientation toward the present and future, and the rejection of power and riches"—quintessential middle-class professional values.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 118; Kelly, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher [[John Locke|John Locke's]] definition of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance is one of the major impediments to the progress of European civilization,&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro 84; see also, Jones, 49–50; Sapiro, xx; Furniss, 60; Kelly, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal [[distribution of wealth]], she did desire one that was more equitable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicanism===
[[File:Shepherd-vernet.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Landscape painting, showing a mountain scene with an adoring couple surrounded by sheep in the foreground. The scene is dominated by a large, leafy green tree at the left and blue sky with white clouds, contrasted against the mountain at the top of the painting.|''Shepherd in the Alps'' by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]; an idyllic rural life is part of the political utopia Wollstonecraft depicts in the ''Rights of Men''.]]

The ''Rights of Men'' indicts monarchy and hereditary distinctions and promotes a [[republicanism|republican]] ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue is at the core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 43; Sapiro, xx; Johnson, 25; Kelly, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.&lt;ref name="Todd166"&gt;Todd, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft's ideas of virtue revolved around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] and [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref name="Jones446"&gt;Jones, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues.&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;Sapiro, 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] depictions of the ideal family and the republican [[Swiss canton]], she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt;  One scholar describes her plan this way: "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers would be allowed to make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society.

===Tradition versus revolution===
One of the central arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'' is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional.&lt;ref name="W434"/&gt; While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 164; Kelly, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, "why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?"&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones [[slavery]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 209; Kelly, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=
[T]he whole tenor of his plausible arguments settles slavery on an everlasting foundation. Allowing his servile reverence for antiquity, and prudent attention to self-interest, to have the force which he insists on, the slave trade ought never to be abolished; and, because our ignorant forefathers, not understanding the native dignity of man, sanctioned a traffic that outrages every suggestion of reason and religion, we are to submit to the inhuman custom, and term an atrocious insult to humanity the love of our country, and a proper submission to the laws by which our property is secured.—Security of property! Behold, in a few words, the definition of English liberty. And to this selfish principle every nobler one is sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Sensibility==
[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three-quarter length portrait of a woman wearing a large straw hat with grayish-blue ostrich feathers and a ruffly cream dress with a gold bow tied at the waist in the back. She is arranging a group of pink flowers.|[[Marie Antoinette]], painted by [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]] (1783); Wollstonecraft attacks Burke for his self-indulgent sympathy for the French queen.]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft not only endorses [[republicanism]], but also a social contract based on sympathy and fellow-feeling.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy.&lt;ref name="Jones446"/&gt; Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at [[Newington Green]] just a few years earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embracing a reasoned [[sensibility]], Wollstonecraft contrasts her theory of civil society with Burke's, which she describes as full of pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 48; Myers, 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity.&lt;ref&gt;Furniss, 62; Kelly, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his ''Reflections'' is propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Sapiro, 201–205.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the most dramatic moments of the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for [[Marie Antoinette]] and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's:&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--dashes copied exactly from original – please do not alter--&gt;
{{quote|text=
Man preys on man; and you mourn for the idle tapestry that decorated a gothic pile, and the dronish bell that summoned the fat priest to prayer. You mourn for the empty pageant of a name, when slavery flaps her wing, and the sick heart retires to die in lonely wilds, far from the abodes of men....Why is our fancy to be appalled by terrific perspectives of a hell beyond the grave?—Hell stalks abroad;—the lash resounds on the slave's naked sides; and the sick wretch, who can no longer earn the sour bread of unremitting labour, steals to a ditch to bid the world a long good night—or, neglected in some ostentatious hospital, breathes his last amidst the laugh of mercenary attendants.

Such misery demands more than tears—I pause to recollect myself; and smother the contempt I feel rising for your rhetorical flourishes and infantine sensibility.

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;---------------&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and aesthetics==
[[File:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Half-length portrait of a woman leaning on a desk with a book and an inkstand. She is wearing a blue-striped dress and a gray, curly wig crossed by a white band of cloth.|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]], painted by [[John Opie]] (c. 1791)]]

In the ''Rights of Men'', Wollstonecraft challenges Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, than his political theory. She begins by redefining the ''[[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]'' and the ''beautiful'', terms he had established in his ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121–22; Kelly, 90; 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, "for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the ''Rights of Men'':
{{quote|text=
You may have convinced [women] that littleness and weakness are the very essence of beauty; and that the Supreme Being, in giving women beauty in the most supereminent {{sic}} degree, seemed to command them, by the powerful voice of Nature, not to cultivate the moral virtues that might chance to excite respect, and interfere with the pleasing sensations they were created to inspire. Thus confining truth, fortitude, and humanity, within the rigid pale of manly morals, they might justly argue, that to be loved, woman's high end and great distinction! they should 'learn to lisp, to totter in their walk, and nick-name God's creatures.' Never, they might repeat after you, was any man, much less a woman, rendered amiable by the force of those exalted qualities, fortitude, justice, wisdom, and truth; and thus forewarned of the sacrifice they must make to those austere, unnatural virtues, they would be authorised to turn all their attention to their persons, systematically neglecting morals to secure beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft,  ''Vindications'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
As Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]] has written, "As feminist critique, these passages have never really been surpassed."&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt; Burke, Wollstonecraft maintains, describes womanly virtue as weakness, thus leaving women no substantive roles in the public sphere and relegating them to uselessness.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft applies this feminist critique to Burke's language throughout the ''Reflections''. As Johnson argues, "her pamphlet as a whole refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with the rhetoric of the rational.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also Myers, 127–28; Kelly, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 163; Taylor, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:WollstonecraftMacaulayLetter.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Handwritten letter reads "Madam Now I venture to send you [cut out] with a name utterly unknown to you in the [?], it is necessary to apologize for thus intruding on you—but instead of an apology shall I tell you the truth? You are the only female writer who I consider in opinion with respecting the [?] our sex ought to endeavour to attain the world. I respect Mrs. Macaulay Graham because she contends for [?] whilst most of her sex only seeks for flowers. I am Madam, Yours respectually, Mary Wollstonecraft Thursday Morning."|Letter sent by [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] to [[Catharine Macaulay]] along with a copy of the ''Rights of Men'']]

The ''Rights of Men'' was successful, its price contributing in no small measure: at one shilling and sixpence it was half the price of Burke's book.&lt;ref name="Todd166"/&gt; After the first edition sold out, Wollstonecraft agreed to have her name printed on the title page of the second. It was her first extensive work as "a self-supporting professional and self-proclaimed intellectual", as scholar Mary Poovey writes, and:
{{quote|text=
took the form that most people would have considered the least appropriate for a woman—the political disquisition. Requiring knowledge of government (in which women had no share), analytical ability (of which women theoretically had little), and the ambition to participate directly in contemporary events (of which women were supposed to have none), political disquisition was in every sense a masculine domain.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Commentaries from the time note this; [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]], for example, called her a "hyena in petticoats" for attacking Marie Antoinette. [[William Godwin]], her future husband, described the book as illogical and ungrammatical; in his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoirs]]'' of Wollstonecraft, he dedicated only a paragraph to a discussion of the content of the work, calling it "intemperate".&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, 73; see also Todd, 168; Sapiro, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the major periodicals of the day reviewed the ''Rights of Men''. The ''[[Analytical Review]]'' agreed with Wollstonecraft's arguments and praised her "lively and animated remarks".&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"&gt;Wardle, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Monthly Review'' was also sympathetic, but it pointed out faults in her writing. The ''Critical Review'', the "sworn foe" of the  ''Analytical Review'',&lt;ref name="Wardle1201"/&gt; however, wrote in December 1790, after discovering that the author was a woman:
{{quote|text=
It has been observed in an old play, that minds have no sex; and in truth we did not discover this Defender of the Rights of ''Man'' to be a ''Woman''. The second edition, however, which often reveals secrets, has attributed this pamphlet to Mrs. Wollstonecraft, and if she assumes the disguise of a man, she must not be surprised that she is not treated with the civility and respect that she would have received in her own person. As the article was written before we saw the second edition, we have presented an acknowledgement of this kind to the necessary alterations. It would not have been sufficient to have corrected merely verbal errors: a Lady should have been addressed with more respect. [emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Kelly, 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' followed suit, criticizing the book's logic and "its absurd presumption that men will be happier if free", as well as Wollstonecraft's own presumption in writing on topics outside of her proper domain, commenting "the ''rights of men'' asserted by a fair lady! The age of chivalry cannot be over, or the sexes have changed their ground."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 472, n.34; see also Wardle, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Rights of Men'' put Wollstonecraft on the map as a writer; from this point forward in her career, she was well known.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 113; Kelly, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft sent a copy of the book to the historian [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom she greatly admired. Macaulay wrote back that she was "still more highly pleased that this publication which I have so greatly admired from its pathos &amp; sentiment should have been written by a woman and thus to see my opinion of the powers and talents of the sex in your pen so early verified."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Todd, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Roscoe]], a Liverpool lawyer, writer, and patron of the arts, liked the book so much that he included Wollstonecraft in his satirical poem ''The Life, Death, and Wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke'':

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag. She and they are walking over dead bodies. The painting is structured like a triangle, with the woman at the apex. The dead are lying at the base of the triangle.|thumb|250px|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1833)]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
And lo! an amazon stept out,
  One WOLLSTONECRAFT her name,
Resolv'd to stop his mad career,
  Whatever chance became.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sapiro, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

While most of the early reviewers of the ''Rights of Men'', as well as most of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and juxtaposed it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, have come to the conclusion that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 25; 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. It is not until after the halfway point of ''Rights of Men'' that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career."&lt;ref name="Johnson26"/&gt;

Two years later, when Wollstonecraft published the ''Rights of Woman'', she extended many of the arguments she had begun in ''Rights of Men''. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women should be included in that group.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt;

== Biography==

'''Andrzej Witold Wajda''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈandʐɛj ˈvajda|lang}}; 6 March 1926 – 9 October 2016) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[film director|film]] and [[theatre director]]. Recipient of an [[Honorary Oscar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/movies/andrzej-wajda-towering-auteur-of-polish-cinema-dies-at-90.html|title=Andrzej Wajda, Towering Auteur of Polish Cinema, Dies at 90|date=10 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Palme d'Or]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/oct/10/acclaimed-polish-film-director-andrzej-wajda-dies-aged-90|title=Acclaimed Polish film director Andrzej Wajda dies aged 90|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=9 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Honorary [[Golden Lion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-andrzej-wajda-612057|title=Venice Film Festival to Honor Polish Auteur Andrzej Wajda|date=2013-08-22|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Golden Bear]] Awards, he was a prominent member of the "[[Polish Film School]]". He was known especially for his trilogy of war films consisting of ''[[A Generation]]'' (1954), ''[[Kanał (film)|Kanał]]'' (1956) and ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/andrzej-wajda-polish-director-dead-dies-1201883386/|title=Andrzej Wajda, Celebrated Polish Director, Dies at 90|first=Richard|last=Natale|date=9 October 2016|work=variety.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered one of the world's most renowned filmmakers&lt;ref name="Andrzej Wajda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/andrzej-wajda#second-menu-15 |title=Andrzej Wajda |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose works chronicled his native country's political and social evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/andrzej-wajda-p115731 |title=Andrzej Wajda |access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dealt with the myths of Polish [[national identity]] offering insightful analyses of the universal element of the Polish experience - the struggle to maintain dignity under the most trying circumstances.

Four of his films have been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]: ''[[The Promised Land (1975 film)|The Promised Land]]'' (1975),&lt;ref name="Oscars1976"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1976 |title=The 48th Academy Awards (1976) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=18 March 2012 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Maids of Wilko]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name="Oscars1980"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980 |title=The 52nd Academy Awards (1980) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=8 June 2013 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981) and ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LEussU2CjokC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33&amp;dq=wajda%20katyn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I3_Y2-jMrB&amp;sig=YUKEkWQvFGvE3XTEbXVsWcLgyT0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvcHzzs_PAhVD6mMKHY58DWI4FBDoAQghMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=wajda%20katyn&amp;f=false|title=Remembering Katyn|first1=Alexander|last1=Etkind|first2=Rory|last2=Finnin|first3=Uilleam|last3=Blacker|first4=Julie|last4=Fedor|first5=Simon|last5=Lewis|first6=Maria|last6=Mälksoo|first7=Matilda|last7=Mroz|date=24 April 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=10 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wajda was born in [[Suwałki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/legendary-polish-director-andrzej-wajda-dies-at-90-1201833782/|title=Andrzej Wajda Dies: Oscar &amp; Palme d’Or-Winning Director Was 90|first=Ross A.|last=Lincoln|date=10 October 2016|work=deadline.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland, the son of Aniela (née Białowąs), a school teacher, and Jakub Wajda, an army officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Andrzej-Wajda.html |title=Andrzej Wajda Biography (1926?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wajda's father was murdered by the Soviets in 1940 in what came to be known as the [[Katyn massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/katyn-andrzej-wajda-118-mins-15-1709287.html|title=Katyn, Andrzej Wajda, 118 mins, (15)|date=19 June 2009|work=independent.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he joined the Polish resistance and served in the [[Home Army]]. After the war, he studied to be a painter at [[Academy of Fine Arts, Kraków|Kraków's Academy of Fine Arts]] before entering the [[Łódź Film School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/andrzej-wajda|title=Andrzej Wajda – Twórca – Culture.pl|work=culture.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After Wajda's apprenticeship to director [[Aleksander Ford]], Wajda was given the opportunity to direct his own film. ''[[A Generation]]'' (1955) was his first major film. At the same time Wajda began his work as a director in theatre, including such as [[Michael V. Gazzo]]'s ''[[A Hatful of Rain]]'' (1959), ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1960), and ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]'' (1963) by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]]. Wajda made two more increasingly accomplished films, which developed further the anti-war theme of ''A Generation'': ''[[Kanał]]'' (1956) ([[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)#Prize winners|Special Jury Prize]] at [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1957, shared with Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'') and ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' (1958) with [[Zbigniew Cybulski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andrzej-wajda-dead-oscar-winning-936684|title=Andrzej Wajda, Oscar-Winning Polish Director, Dies at 90|work=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While capable of turning out mainstream commercial fare (often dismissed as "trivial" by critics), Wajda was more interested in works of [[allegory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222801/legendary-polish-director-andrzej-wajda-dies|title=Legendary Polish director Andrzej Wajda dies|work=buenosairesherald.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[symbol]]ism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/poland/articles/man-of-hope-andrzej-wajda-s-solidarity-trilogy/|title=Man Of Hope: Andrzej Wajda’s Solidarity Trilogy|first=Thomas|last=Storey|work=theculturetrip.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain symbols (such as setting fire to a glass of liquor, representing the flame of youthful idealism that was extinguished by the war) recur often in his films. ''[[Lotna]]'' (1959) is full of [[surrealistic]] and symbolic scenes and shots, but he managed to explore other styles, making [[French New Wave|new wave]] style ''[[Innocent Sorcerers]]'' (1960) with music by [[Krzysztof Komeda]], starring [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] (who was also a co-script writer) in the episodes. Then Wajda directed ''[[Samson (1961 Polish film)|Samson]]'' (1961), the story of Jacob, a Jewish boy, who wants to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland. In the mid-1960s Wajda made ''[[The Ashes (film)|The Ashes]]'' (1965) based on the novel by Polish writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] and directed several films abroad: ''[[Love at Twenty]]'' (1962), ''[[Siberian Lady Macbeth]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film07.html|title=Andrzej Wajda. Official Website of Polish movie director – Films – "Siberian Lady Macbeth"|first=Tomasz Wygoda – code, Katarzyna Lezenska – content, Belin Czechowicz -|last=design|work=wajda.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kinolorber.com/film/view/id/277|title=Siberian Lady Macbeth|work=kinolorber.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1962) and ''[[Gates To Paradise]]'' (1968).

In 1967, Cybulski was killed in a train accident, whereupon the director articulated his grief with ''[[Everything for Sale]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film12.html|title=Andrzej Wajda. Official Website of Polish movie director – Films – "Everything For Sale"|first=Tomasz Wygoda – code, Katarzyna Lezenska – content, Belin Czechowicz -|last=design|work=wajda.pl|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1968), considered one of his most personal films, using the technique of a film-within-a-film to tell the story of a film maker's life and work.The following year he directed an ironic satire ''[[Hunting Flies (1969 film)|Hunting Flies]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wajda.pl/en/filmy/film13.html|title=Andrzej Wajda.

==Artistic recognition==
[[File:Olbrychski wajda.jpg|thumb|right|Andrzej Wajda (center), c. 1970]]
The 1970s were the most prolific artistic period for Wajda, who made over ten films: ''[[Landscape After the Battle]]'' (1970), ''[[Pilate and Others]]'' (1971), ''[[The Wedding (1972 film)|The Wedding]]'' (1972) – the film version of the famous Polish poetic drama by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], ''[[The Promised Land (1975 film)|The Promised Land]]'' (1974), ''[[Man of Marble]]'' (1976) – the film takes place in two time periods, the first film showing the episodes of [[Stalinism]] in Poland, ''[[Smuga cienia|The Shadow Line]]'' (1976), ''[[Rough Treatment]]'' (the other title: ''[[Without Anesthesia]])'' (1978), ''[[The Orchestra Conductor]]'' (1980), starring [[John Gielgud]]; and two psychological and existential films based upon novels by [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] – ''[[The Birch Wood]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Maids of Wilko]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spartanecho.org/2016/03/06/poland-marks-90-birthday-of-leading-filmmaker-andrzej-wajd/|title=Poland marks 90 birthday of leading filmmaker Andrzej Wajd|first=Teena|last=Martin|date=6 March 2016|work=spartanecho.org|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1979). ''The Birch Wood'' was entered into the [[7th Moscow International Film Festival]] where Wajda won the Golden Prize for Direction.&lt;ref name="Moscow1971"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |title=7th Moscow International Film Festival (1971) |accessdate=22 December 2012 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403094201/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wajda continued to work in theatre, including ''[[Play Strindberg]]'', Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Possessed (play)|The Possessed]]'' and ''Nastasja Filippovna'' – Wajda's version of ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'', ''November Night'' by Wyspiański, ''[[The Immigrants]]'' by Sławomir Mrożek, ''The Danton Affair'' or ''The Dreams of Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E0DC1F38F93BA1575AC0A965948260?&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Andrzej Wajda 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Wajda during filming in 1974]]
Wajda's later commitment to Poland's burgeoning [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement was manifested in ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981), a thematic sequel to ''The Man of Marble'', with Solidarity leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] appearing as himself in the latter film. The film sequence is loosely based on the life of [[Anna Walentynowicz]], a hero of socialist labor [[Stakhanovite]] turned dissident and alludes to events from real life, such as the firing of Walentynowicz from the shipyard and the underground wedding of [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] to [[Alina Pienkowska]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Szporer, [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/solidarity-michael-m-phd-szporer-phd/1110913404 Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980]. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The director's involvement in this movement would prompt the Polish government to force Wajda's production company out of business. For the film, Wajda won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In 1983, he directed ''[[Danton (1983 film)|Danton]]'', starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] in the title role, a film set in 1794 (Year Two of the [[French Republican Calendar]]) dealing with the [[Reign of Terror|Post-Revolutionary Terror]]. Made against the backdrop of the [[martial law in Poland]], Wajda showed how easily revolution can change into terror and start to "eat its own children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szporer|first=Mieczyslaw [Michael]|title=Andrzej Wajda's Reign of Terror: Danton's Polish Ambiance|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Winter 1983–1984|volume=37:2|pages=27–34|jstor=3697387}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this film Wajda was honoured with the [[Louis Delluc Prize]] and a [[César Award for Best Director]]. In the 1980s he also made ''[[A Love in Germany]]'' (1983) featuring [[Hanna Schygulla]], ''The Chronicle of Amorous Incidents'' (1986) an adaptation of [[Tadeusz Konwicki]]'s novel and ''[[The Possessed (play)|The Possessed]]'' (1988) based on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel. In theatre he prepared an interpretation of Dostoyevsky's ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1984) and other unique spectacles such as ''Antygone'', his sequential ''[[Hamlet]]'' versions or an old Jewish play ''[[The Dybbuk]]''. In 1989, he was the President of the Jury at the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1989"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=24 February 2013 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316085017/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |archivedate=16 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after 1990==
[[File:Andrzej Wajda-Post Mortem (2007).jpg|thumb|right|During the filming of ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' in 2007]]
In 1990, Andrzej Wajda was honoured by the [[European Film Awards]] for his lifetime achievement, only the third director to be so honoured, after [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. In the early 1990s, he was elected a senator and also appointed artistic director of Warsaw's Teatr Powszechny. He continued to make films set during World War II, including ''[[Korczak (film)|Korczak]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmsbytheyear.com/index.php/2015/11/22/korczak-1990/|title=Korczak (1990)|first=Dan|last=Willard|date=23 November 2015|work=filmsbytheyear.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), a story about a Jewish-Polish doctor who takes care of orphan children, in ''The Crowned-Eagle Ring'' (1993) and ''[[Holy Week (film)|Holy Week]]'' (1995) specifically on Jewish-Polish relations. In 1994 Wajda presented his own film version of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novel [[The Idiot]] in the movie ''[[Nastasja]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com.au/search?q=miss%20nobody%20wajda&amp;oq=miss%20nobody%20wajda&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l5.2263j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=miss nobody wajda – Google Search|work=google.com.au|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring Japanese actor Tamasoburo Bando in the double role of Prince Mishkin and Nastasja. The film's cinematographer was [[Pawel Edelman]], who subsequently became one of Wajda's great collaborators. In 1996 the director went in a different direction with ''[[Miss Nobody (1996 film)|Miss Nobody]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/miss-nobody-2-1200449243/|title=Review: ‘Miss Nobody’|first=Derek|last=Elley|date=16 March 1997|work=variety.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a coming-of-age drama that explored the darker and more spiritual aspects of a relationship between three high-school girls. In 1999 Wajda released the epic film ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce-review.org/99/21/kinoeye21_kosc.html|title=Central Europe Review – Film: Wajda's Pan Tadeusz|work=ce-review.org|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the epic poem of the Polish 19th-century romantic poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

A year later, at the [[72nd Academy Awards|2000 Academy Awards]], Wajda was presented with an [[honorary Oscar]] for his contribution to world cinema;&lt;ref name="Storoznyski, Alex (March 2000)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Storozynski|first1=Alex|title=Poland's Movie Conscience: Academy Honors Andrzej Wajda for his films of freedom|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/poland-movie-conscience-academy-honors-andrzej-wajda-films-freedom-article-1.858349|accessdate=13 September 2016|work=The New York Daily News|date=March 26, 2000|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; he subsequently donated the award to [[Kraków]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]].&lt;ref name="The Vancouver Sun (April 2000)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Polish film-maker donates oscar to university|work=The Vancouver Sun|issue=Final Edition|date=April 7, 2000|location=Vancouver, B.C.|page=D9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Wajda directed  ''[[The Revenge (film)|The Revenge]]'', a film version of his 1980s comedy theatre production, with [[Roman Polanski]] in one of the main roles. In February 2006, Wajda received an honorary [[Golden Bear]] for lifetime achievement at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="berlinale2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes &amp; Honours 2006|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2006/03_preistr_ger_2006/03_Preistraeger_2006.html|website=Berlin International Film Festival|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''[[Katyń (film)|Katyń]]'' was released, a well-received film about the [[Katyn massacre]], in which Wajda's father was murdered; the director also shows the dramatic situation of those who await their relatives (mothers, wives and children). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] Oscar in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/19/katyn-andrzej-wajda-film-review|title=Katyn|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=18 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2010-08 Andrzej Wajda 4.jpg|thumb|right|Wajda pictured with his wife, [[Krystyna Zachwatowicz]], in 2010]]
Wajda followed it with ''[[Tatarak|Sweet Rush]]'' (2009) with [[Krystyna Janda]] as a main character. It is partly based upon a short [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] novel.  The film is dedicated to [[Edward Kłosiński]], Janda's husband, a cinematographer and a long-time Wajda friend and co-worker who died of cancer the same year. For this film Wajda was awarded by [[Alfred Bauer Prize]] at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. He received the Prix FIPRESCI during the 2009 European Film Awards. ''[[Walesa.

'''Australian heritage laws''' exist at the National (Commonwealth) level, and at each of [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]], [[Northern Territory]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]] State and Territory levels. Generally there are separate laws governing Aboriginal cultural heritage and historical (sometimes referred to as post-contact or non-Aboriginal) heritage. State laws also allow heritage to be protected through Local Government regulations, such as planning schemes, as well.

==Overview==
The heritage laws seek to protect, preserve, present, and transmit the Australian nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/laws/world.html | title=Australia's World Heritage Laws | publisher=Australian Government, Department of the Environment | accessdate = 10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National heritage==

The ''[[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth)|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984]]'' is legislation passed by the parliament of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] to enable the Commonwealth to intervene and, where necessary, preserve and protect areas and objects of particular significance to Australia's [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples.&lt;ref name="ATSIHPAct"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|aatsihpa1984549|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' protects places of World Heritage, National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage, The [[Commonwealth Heritage List]] includes places such as Federally owned telegraph stations, defence sites, migration centres, customs houses, lighthouses, national institutions such as Parliament and High Court buildings, memorials, islands and marine areas. The [[Australian National Heritage List]] is a heritage register, including natural, historic and indigenous places deemed to be of outstanding heritage significance to Australia.

==State heritage==
===New South Wales===
The New South Wales legislation's goal is to conserve the State's cultural heritage, and promote public awareness of places, objects, and features of significance to the State's Aboriginal peoples, through the '''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974]]''' ('''NSW''').

The Heritage Act 1977 (NSW) also provides for the conservation of environmental heritage items in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+136+1977+cd+0+N ''Heritage Act 1977'' (NSW)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland ===
The [[Queensland Heritage Register]] is  a statutory list of places in [[Queensland]] that are protected by the [[Queensland Heritage Act 1992]]. The register is maintained by the [[Queensland Heritage Council]].&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/heritage/register/|title=Queensland Heritage Register|date=|work=|publisher=Queensland Heritage Council|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Section 113 of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992, all local government authorities in Queensland must maintain a local heritage register; the [[Brisbane Heritage Register]] is an example of a local government heritage register in Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/qha1992188/s113.html|title=QUEENSLAND HERITAGE ACT 1992 - SECT 113|work=Queensland Consolidated Acts|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2003, the Queensland '''[[Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003]]''' was passed by Parliament to provide statutory protection to all Aboriginal heritage across the State, irrespective of whether the heritage was previously identified by the State's "Cultural Heritage Coordination Unit," of the Department of Natural Resources and Water.&lt;ref name="DNRW02"&gt;Department of Natural Resources and Mines (2005) "Cultural Heritage – Your Duty of Care".  Cultural Heritage Information Series. Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a separate ''Torres Strait Islander Cultural Heritage Act'' 2003 and historical places are protected under the ''Queensland Heritage Act'' 1992.

===South Australia===
The '''Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988''' aims to protect and preserve South Australia's Aboriginal heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsa.asn.au/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=147 CROW, H (2002) ''Conserving Aboriginal Heritage'' as posted on Conservation Council of South Australia's web page] Accessed 6 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; While the act maintains the Aboriginal Heritage Register for the previous legislation it also provides blanket protection for all Aboriginal heritage, whether on the register or not. It also establishes an Aboriginal Heritage Committee of indigenous people appointed by the minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/archaeology/department/publications/wallis/j06_v025_EPLJ_pt02_wiltshire_&amp;_wallis_offprints.pdf Wallis &amp; Wiltshire, 2008, A History of Aboriginal Heritage Legislation in South Australia],&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tasmania===
The '''Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995''' aims to promote the protection and conservation of places of historic cultural heritage significance in Tasmania. The Act established the Tasmanian Heritage Council and the Tasmanian Heritage Register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=ALL;doc_id=117%2B%2B1995%2BAT%40EN%2B20090507090000;histon=;prompt=;rec=;term=Historic%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Act Tasmanian Government Legislation on-line]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria ===
Victorian Aboriginal heritage protection is governed by the ''[[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]]''. Under the act all Aboriginal culturally significant aspects are protect by Victorian Law. A steering committee, The Aboriginal Heritage Council was established to allow government a consultation and steerage functionality back to the major Aboriginal Communities within Victoria, referred to as [[Registered Aboriginal Party|Registered Aboriginal Parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/indigenous | title=Aboriginal Affairs | publisher=Department of Planning and Community Development, Aboriginal Affairs Victoria | accessdate=10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/indigenous/aboriginal-cultural-heritage | title=Aboriginal Cultural Heritage | publisher=Department of Planning and Community Development, Aboriginal Affairs Victoria | accessdate=10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Heritage Act 1995''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|ha199586|Heritage Act 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides for the protection and conservation of historical places and objects of cultural heritage significance and the registration of such places and objects.  The Act establishes a Heritage Council to oversee heritage policy and implementation; and a Victorian Heritage Register, for listing and protection of places of significance to the state of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/consultations/pmch-review/submissions/heritage-council-victoria.pdf Heritage Council of Victoria’s submission on the Review of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act and Regulations, Comments made in response to the January 2009, Discussion Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212063826/http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/consultations/pmch-review/submissions/heritage-council-victoria.pdf |date=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeological heritage is also protected by the ''Heritage Act'' through blanket protection of archaeological places and objects greater than 50 years old, and through the [[Victorian Heritage Inventory]] of historical archaeological sites, as well as historic shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/92379/10-chapter8.pdf "Conservation of Australia's Historic Heritage Places"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212235127/http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/92379/10-chapter8.pdf |date=12 February 2014 }}, Inquiry report 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/55796/sub178.pdf Submission to the Productivity Commission Inquiry into the conservation of historic heritage places by the Heritage Council of Victoria, October 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213213255/http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/55796/sub178.pdf |date=13 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Legion''''' is a 1937 American [[crime]] [[drama]] film, directed by [[Archie Mayo]], with a script by Abem Finkel and [[William Wister Haines]] based on an original story by producer [[Robert Lord (screenwriter)|Robert Lord]].  The film stars [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Dick Foran]], [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]] and [[Ann Sheridan]]. It is a fictionalized treatment of the historic [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]] of the 1930s in Michigan,&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; a white [[vigilante]] group. A third of its members lived in Detroit, which had also been a center of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the 1920s. 

The plot is based on the May 1935 kidnapping and murder in [[Detroit]] of Charles A. Poole, a [[Works Progress Administration]] organizer.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; Twelve men were tried and 11 convicted of his murder; all were sentenced to life. Authorities prosecuted another 37 men for related crimes; they were also convicted and sentenced to prison, breaking up the Legion. [[Columbia Pictures]] had made ''[[Legion of Terror]]'' (1936) based on the same case.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;

''Black Legion'' was praised by critics for its dramatization of a dark social phenomenon. It was one of several films of this period relating anti-fascism to opposition to fascist and racist organizations.&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; A number of reviewers commented that Bogart's performance should lead to his becoming a major star. Warners did not give the film any special treatment, promoting it and Bogart in their standard fashion. Bogart's breakthrough would come in ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' in 1941.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The Black Legion (1937) 1.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[Erin O'Brien-Moore]], [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ann Sheridan]]]]
When passed over for promotion at work in favor of a foreign-born friend, Frank Taylor ([[Humphrey Bogart]]), a midwestern factory worker, joins the anti-immigrant Black Legion, a secret white vigilante organization&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt; portrayed as related to the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Dressed in black robes and hoods, Taylor and the Legion mount a torchlight raid and burn down the friend's chicken farm, driving him out of town, so that Taylor can gain the job he believed was his. Soon, however, Taylor's recruiting activities with the Legion get in the way of his work, and he is demoted in favor of his Irish neighbor Mike Grogan (Clifford Soubier). The Legion takes action again, attacking Grogan.

Under the continued influence of the Legion, Taylor becomes a brutal racist,&lt;ref name=tcmart&gt;Tatara, Paul. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=68894&amp;category=Articles "Black Legion" (TCM article)]&lt;/ref&gt; and alienates his wife ([[Erin O'Brien-Moore]]). He starts drinking heavily and takes up with a loose woman (Helen Flint). When his friend Ed Jackson ([[Dick Foran]]) tries to counsel him, a drunken Taylor tells about his Legion activities. Taylor reports the conversation to Cliff, a co-worker and fellow member of the Legion, who initiates a false rumor that Jackson is a woman-beater. On the pretext of punishing him for that offense, the Legion kidnaps Jackson, planning to flog him. Jackson tries to escape. As he is running away, Taylor shoots and kills him; breaking down afterward with guilt and remorse, he exclaims, "I didn't mean to shoot!"&lt;ref&gt;Allmovie [http://allmovie.com/work/black-legion-85215 "Black Legion plot synopsis"], Allmovie website&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor is arrested for the murder, and the Legion threatens his wife and son to prevent him from implicating the secret group in the crime. Taylor finally tells the truth, resulting in all the members of the Black Legion being convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=68894&amp;category=Full_Synopsis Full synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cast notes
*Before he turned to acting, Clifford Soubier was a broadcaster for [[NBC]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; ''Black Legion'' was his film debut, and he went on to appear in five others.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0815682|Clifford Soubier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Black Legion 1937.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Lobby card for ''Black Legion'']]
''Black Legion'' went into production in late August 1936.&lt;ref&gt;TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=68894 Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the details about the Legion portrayed in the film, such as the initiation oath and the confessions in the trial scenes, were based on known facts about the historic organization. Because United States [[libel|libel laws]] had recently been broadened in scope by court rulings, Warner Bros. underplayed some aspects of the group's political activities to avoid legal repercussion.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] sued Warner Bros. for [[patent]] infringement for the film's use of a patented Klan insignia: a white cross on a red background with a black square.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt; A judge threw out the case.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

Location shooting took place in private homes in the [[Hollywood]] area, the Providencia Ranch in the [[Hollywood Hills]] and the Warner Ranch in [[Calabasas]].&lt;ref&gt;IMDb [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027367/locations Filming locations]&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] had wanted [[Edward G. Robinson]] to play the lead role, but producer [[Robert Lord (screenwriter)|Robert Lord]] thought Robinson was too foreign looking, and wanted a "distinctly American looking actor to play [the] part."&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;

==Reception==
The film was generally praised, and reviewers especially noted Humphrey Bogart's performance. They suggested he was on the verge of becoming a major star.&lt;ref name=tcmart /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
[[Robert Lord (screenwriter)|Robert Lord]]'s original screenplay received an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1937, but lost to [[William Wellman]] and [[Robert Carson (writer)|Robert Carson]]'s work for ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1259857526859 1937 (10th)]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on [[AMPAS]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Board of Review]] named ''Black Legion'' as the best film of 1937, and Humprey Bogart as the best actor for his work in the film.&lt;ref name=tcmnotes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allmovie [http://allmovie.com/work/black-legion-85215/awards Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of a series of anti-fascist films in this period that addressed the dangers to society from groups that opposed immigrants (especially Catholics and Jews) and blacks, showing that fascism and racism resulted in similar "crimes against humanity."&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;Jennifer Lynde Barker, ''The Aesthetics of Antifascist Film: Radical Projection,'' New York: Routledge, 2013, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chactún''' (Maya: Red stone)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche Extensive Maya city discovered in Campeche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623022716/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche |date=June 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of an archaeological site of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Maya civilization]] in the state of [[Campeche]], [[Mexico]], in the northern part of the [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]]. The site of approximately 54 acres is located in the lowlands of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], between the regions of [[Rio Bec]] and [[Chenes]]. There are some significant differences that have yet to be explained completely, which distinguish it from some of the other nearby sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yucatan-connection.com/43-2-Chactun%2B+the+discovery+of+a+lost+Mayan+city.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
A team of Mexican and foreign experts from the Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts ([http://www.zrc-sazu.si/en ZRC SAZU]) and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), headed by archaeologist Ivan Sprajc, rediscovered the site in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.latinospost.com/articles/21973/20130621/lost-mayan-city-discovered-deep-mexican-jungle-previously-known-lumberers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; by aerial photographs&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailygrail.com/Sacred-Sites/2013/6/Ancient-Maya-City-Discovered-Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; and named it '''''Chactún''''', "Red Stone". The name was based on an inscription which translated to "K'inich B'ahlam erected the Great Red Stone in (what would have been AD 751&lt;!--not likely that the Mayans were using Gregorian calendar dates--&gt;)".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/mayan-city-chactun-discovered-mexico_n_3468502.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project was financed by the [[National Geographic Society]] and Villas and Ars Longa, two private companies, and supported by [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology and History]], Mexico. It is one of 80 sites detected by the Southeast Campeche Archaeological Reconnaissance Project, which launched in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/agencia-efe/130619/vast-mayan-city-discovered-southeast-mexico-jungle&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this discovery by archaeologists, very little was known about this part of the region. Evidence of logging suggests locals were aware of the site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.designntrend.com/articles/5101/20130620/archaeology-ancient-mayan-city-jungle-southeast-mexico.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the difficulty in accessing the area due to difficult terrain and overgrown vegetation. To reach the area, the team of archaeologists spent four weeks reopening an abandoned and heavily overgrown dirt-road. Without the discovery with aerial photography, it is likely this site would have remained hidden for much longer. The project surveyed the three urban cores of the site to create maps and three dimensional models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623022716/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche |archivedate=2013-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient use==
Chactún is believed to have been an ancient city that served as a government seat for a large area. The researchers dated the site to 600 to 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/agencia-efe/130619/vast-mayan-city-discovered-southeast-mexico-jungle&lt;/ref&gt; The site contains three complexes of monumental architecture. The West Complex is the largest one, making up about half of the total area of the site. There are many pyramids throughout the site, with the tallest one reaching a height of 23 meters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623022716/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/06/2013/extensive-maya-city-discovered-in-campeche |archivedate=2013-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two ball courts, a number of large palace-like buildings surrounding several plazas, and various residential areas. There are also many sculpted stone stelae and altars.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/21/science/la-sci-sn-maya-ruins-city-chactun-mexico-discovered-yucatan-20130621&lt;/ref&gt; While some of them are plain and others eroded, a few monuments have well preserved reliefs, including hieroglyphic inscriptions. A unique case is a standing stela with remnants of stucco glyphs attached to the stone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yucatan-connection.com/43-2-Chactun%2B+the+discovery+of+a+lost+Mayan+city.html&lt;/ref&gt; Initial estimates indicate Chactún was once home to between 30,000 and 40,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/us-mexico-maya-idUSBRE95J0ZP20130620&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that the site may have been inhabited by a different group after the collapse of the Maya. There are several monuments that were turned upside down as though the people living there did not understand their significance, but there is also evidence that the reused monuments were worshiped up to the Postclassic period, as indicated by some ceramic offerings.&lt;ref&gt;http://treasureworks.com/archaeological/987-extensive-maya-site-discovered-southeast-of-campeche&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of artifacts dating to these second inhabitants were found in the ball court areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yucatan-connection.com/43-2-Chactun%2B+the+discovery+of+a+lost+Mayan+city.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chichen Itza'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{IPAc-en|tʃ|iː|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|n|_|iː|ˈ|t|s|ɑː}} {{respell|chee|CHEN|_|eet|SAH}}, {{lang-es|Chichén Itzá}} {{IPA-es|tʃiˈtʃen iˈtsa|}}, often with the emphasis reversed in English to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|tʃ|ɛ|n|_|ˈ|iː|t|s|ə}} {{respell|CHEE|chen|_|EET|sə}}; from {{lang-yua|Chi&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;ch&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;èen Ìitsha&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} {{IPA-myn|tɕʰiʔtɕʼèːn ìːtsʰaʔ|}} (Barrera Vásquez et al., 1980.) "at the mouth of the well of the [[Itza]] people"&lt;/ref&gt; was a large [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya city|city]] built by the [[Maya people]] of the Terminal Classic period. The [[archaeological site]] is located in [[Tinúm Municipality]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán State]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Gobierno del Estado de Yucatán 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern [[Maya Lowlands]] from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] (c. AD 600–900) through the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of [[Maya architecture|architectural]] styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the [[Puuc]] and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of [[cultural diffusion]].

Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or ''[[Tollan]]s'', referred to in later [[Mesoamerica]]n literature.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.&lt;ref name="Miller99p26"&gt;Miller 1999, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's ''[[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]]'' (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Concerning the legal basis of the ownership of Chichen and other sites of patrimony, see Breglia (2006), in particular Chapter 3, "Chichen Itza, a Century of Privatization". Regarding ongoing conflicts over the ownership of Chichen Itza, see Castañeda (2005). Regarding purchase, see "Yucatán: paga gobierno 220 mdp por terrenos de Chichén Itzá," La Jornada, 30 March 2010, retrieved 30 March 2010 from [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/03/30/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a06n1cu jornada.unam.mx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estadística de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and orthography ==
[[File:Serpent head at the base of El Castillo.jpg|thumb|A feathered serpent sculpture at the base of one of the stairways of El Castillo.]]
The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from ''chi''', meaning "mouth" or "edge," and ''ch'en'' or ''ch'e'en'', meaning "well." ''Itzá'' is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula. One possible translation for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water,"&lt;ref&gt;Boot 2005, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; from ''its'', "sorcerer," and ''ha'', "water."&lt;ref&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is spelled ''Chichén Itzá'' in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable. Other references prefer the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]] orthography, ''Chichen Itza' '' (pronounced {{IPA-myn|tʃitʃʼen itsáʔ|}}). This form preserves the [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinction between ''ch' ''and ''ch,'' since the base word ''ch'e'en'' (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a [[postalveolar]] ejective [[affricate]] consonant. The word "Itza'" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a [[glottal stop]] (indicated by the apostrophe).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Evidence in the [[Chilam Balam]] books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán. While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest. This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as ''Uuc Yabnal'' ("Seven Great House"),&lt;ref&gt;Luxton 1996, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uuc Hab Nal'' ("Seven Bushy Places"),&lt;ref&gt;Koch 2006, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uucyabnal'' ("Seven Great Rulers")&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; or ''Uc Abnal'' ("Seven Lines of Abnal").&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Uuc Yabnal'' becomes ''Uc Abnal'', meaning the "Seven Abnals" or "Seven Lines of Abnal" where Abnal is a family name, according to Ralph L. Roys (Roys 1967, p.133n7).&lt;/ref&gt; This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=458}}

==Location==
{{see also|Pisté, Yucatán}}
[[File:Chichen Itza-16.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Chichen Itza]]
Chichen Itza is located in the eastern portion of [[Yucatán|Yucatán state]] in Mexico.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}} The northern Yucatán Peninsula is arid, and the rivers in the interior all run underground. There are four visible, natural sink holes, called [[cenote]]s, that could have provided plentiful water year round at Chichen, making it attractive for settlement. Of these cenotes, the "Cenote Sagrado" or [[Sacred Cenote]] (also variously known as the Sacred Well or Well of Sacrifice), is the most famous.&lt;ref name="Coggins 1992"&gt;Coggins 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under [[Kukulkan]], which has never been seen by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="ChavezRene2015"&gt;Chavez 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god [[Chaac]]. [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Maya ceramics|pottery]] and [[incense]], as well as human remains.&lt;ref name="Coggins 1992"/&gt; A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Anda Alanís 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
[[File:Chichen-Itza-1000-Warriors-Columns.jpg|thumb|300px|Columns in the Temple of a Thousand Warriors]]
Several archaeologists in the late 1980s suggested that unlike previous Maya polities of the Early Classic, Chichen Itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single [[dynastic]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Instead, the city's political organization could have been structured by a "''multepal''" system, which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of [[elite]] ruling lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, p.6. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.581.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory was popular in the 1990s, but in recent years, the research that supported the concept of the "multepal" system has been called into question, if not discredited. The current belief trend in Maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the Maya kingdoms of the Classic Period [[Petén Basin|southern lowlands in Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt 2007, pp.166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Chichen Itza was a major economic power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Plama 2004, 2005, pp.539–540.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in the water-borne circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast,&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, p.540.&lt;/ref&gt; Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] from central Mexico and [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|gold]] from southern Central America.

Between AD 900 and 1050 Chichen Itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central Yucatán. It established Isla Cerritos as a trading port.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, pp.537–541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Trono de Jaguar en El Castillo, Chichen Itza.jpg|thumb|The Jaguar Throne inside the "El Castillo" pyramid.]]
The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.&lt;ref name="CobosPalma0405p531"&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, p.531.&lt;/ref&gt; Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palma 2004, 2005, pp.531–533.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Maya script|hieroglyphic]] date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}

===Establishment===
The Late Classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the Xtoloc cenote, with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the Las Monjas and Observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=461}}

=== Ascendancy ===
Chichen Itza rose to regional prominence towards the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] period (roughly 600 AD). It was, however, towards the end of the Late Classic and into the early part of the Terminal Classic that the site became a major regional capital, centralizing and dominating political, sociocultural, economic, and ideological life in the northern Maya lowlands. The ascension of Chichen Itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern Maya lowlands.

As Chichen Itza rose to prominence, the cities of [[Yaxuna]] (to the south) and [[Coba]] (to the east) were suffering decline. These two cities had been mutual allies, with Yaxuna dependent upon Coba. At some point in the 10th century Coba lost a significant portion of its territory, isolating Yaxuna, and Chichen Itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobos Palama, 2004, 2005, p.541.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline ===
{{Maya civilization}}
According to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), [[Hunac Ceel]], ruler of [[Mayapan]], conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals thrown into the Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel leaped into the Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.

While there is some archaeological evidence that indicates Chichén Itzá was at one time looted and sacked,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1954, 1966, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by Mayapan, at least not when Chichén Itzá was an active urban center. Archaeological data now indicates that Chichen Itza declined as a regional center by 1250, before the rise of Mayapan.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For summation of this re-dating proposal, see in particular Andrews ''et al.'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018|talk=That's not what it says at all}} Ongoing research at the site of Mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum.

After Chichén Itzá elite activities ceased, the city may not have been abandoned. When the Spanish arrived, they found a thriving local population, although it is not clear from Spanish sources if these Maya were living in Chichen Itza proper, or a nearby settlement. The relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors' decision to locate a capital there.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.136, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; According to post-Conquest sources, both Spanish and Maya, the [[Cenote Sagrado]] remained a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Restall 1998, pp.81, 149; Landa 1937, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish conquest===
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán}}

In 1526 Spanish [[Conquistador]] [[Francisco de Montejo]] (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cortés expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for a charter to conquer Yucatán. His first campaign in 1527, which covered much of the Yucatán Peninsula, decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at [[Playa del Carmen|Xaman Ha']], south of what is today [[Cancún]]. Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with reinforcements and established his main base at [[Campeche]] on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his son, Francisco Montejo The Younger, in late 1532 to conquer the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north. The objective from the beginning was to go to Chichén Itzá and establish a capital.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.19–20, 64, 97, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montejo the Younger eventually arrived at Chichen Itza, which he renamed Ciudad Real. At first he encountered no resistance, and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers. The Maya became more hostile over time, and eventually they laid siege to the Spanish, cutting off their supply line to the coast, and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city. Months passed, but no reinforcements arrived. Montejo the Younger attempted an all out assault against the Maya and lost 150 of his remaining troops. He was forced to abandon Chichén Itzá in 1534 under cover of darkness. By 1535, all Spanish had been driven from the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain 1948, pp.132–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montejo eventually returned to Yucatán and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large [[Indian auxiliaries|Indio-Spanish]] army and conquered the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen 2003, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it was a working cattle ranch.&lt;ref&gt;Breglia 2006, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:Castillo Maler.jpg|thumb|300px|The Castillo Temple, photograph by [[Teobert Maler]], 1892.]]
Chichen Itza entered the popular imagination in 1843 with the book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan'' by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] (with illustrations by [[Frederick Catherwood]]). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucatán and his tour of Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, [[Désiré Charnay]] surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in ''Cités et ruines américaines'' (1863).

In 1875, [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] and his wife [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon]] visited Chichén, and excavated a statue of a figure on its back, knees drawn up, upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach. Augustus Le Plongeon called it "Chaacmol" (later renamed "[[Chac Mool]]", which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in Mesoamerica). [[Teobert Maler]] and [[Alfred Maudslay]] explored Chichén in the 1880s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs. Maudslay published the first long-form description of Chichen Itza in his book, ''Biologia Centrali-Americana''.

In 1894 the United States Consul to Yucatán, [[Edward Herbert Thompson]], purchased the [[Hacienda Chichén]], which included the ruins of Chichen Itza. For 30 years, Thompson explored the ancient city. His discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the Temple of the Initial Series and the excavation of several graves in the Osario (High Priest's Temple). Thompson is most famous for dredging the Cenote Sagrado (Sacred Cenote) from 1904 to 1910, where he recovered artifacts of gold, copper and carved jade, as well as the first-ever examples of what were believed to be pre-Columbian Maya cloth and wooden weapons. Thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum at Harvard University]].

In 1913, the Carnegie Institution accepted the proposal of archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley|Sylvanus G. Morley]] and committed to conduct long-term archaeological research at Chichen Itza.&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1913, pp.61–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican Revolution and the following government instability, as well as World War I, delayed the project by a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the Mexican government awarded the Carnegie Institution a 10-year permit (later extended another 10 years) to allow U.S. archaeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of Chichen Itza.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.195–196; Weeks and Hill 2006, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie researchers excavated and restored the Temple of Warriors and the Caracol, among other major buildings. At the same time, the Mexican government excavated and restored El Castillo and the Great Ball Court.&lt;ref&gt;Brunhouse 1971, pp.195–196; Weeks and Hill 2006, pp.577–653.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 excavation ChichenItza.JPG|thumb|300px|Excavations next to El Castillo began in 2009.]]
In 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. The government seized the Hacienda Chichén. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucatán. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book ''People of the Serpent'' published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.&lt;ref name="Usborne 2007"&gt;Usborne (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado, in 1961 and 1967. The first was sponsored by the National Geographic, and the second by private interests. Both projects were supervised by Mexico's [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH). INAH has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archaeological zone, including the Osario, Akab D'zib, and several buildings in Chichén Viejo (Old Chichen).

In 2009, to investigate construction that predated El Castillo, Yucatec archaeologists began excavations adjacent to El Castillo under the direction of Rafael (Rach) Cobos.

== Site description ==
[[File:Chichen Itza Plan EN.png|thumb|A map of central Chichen Itza.]]
Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered [[Maya architecture|architecture]] of the site core covering an area of at least {{convert|5|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.562.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}}

The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called ''[[sacbe]]ob''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;From {{lang-myn|sakb'e}}, meaning "white way/road". Plural form is ''sacbeob'' (or in modern Maya orthography, ''sakb'eob&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have identified over 80 ''sacbeob'' criss-crossing the site,{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=456}} and extending in all directions from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1981, pp.51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls. The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo, Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court; The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.

South of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.

===Architectural styles===
The Puuc-style architecture is concentrated in the Old Chichen area, and also the earlier structures in the Nunnery Group (including the Las Monjas, Annex and La Iglesia buildings); it is also represented in the Akab Dzib structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp.562–563.&lt;/ref&gt; The Puuc-style building feature the usual mosaic-decorated upper façades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the Puuc heartland in their block masonry walls, as opposed to the fine veneers of the Puuc region proper.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p563"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.563.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one structure in the Las Monjas Group features an ornate façade and masked doorway that are typical examples of Chenes-style architecture, a style centred upon a region in the north of [[Campeche]] state, lying between the Puuc and [[Río Bec]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.562. Coe 1999, pp.100, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site, with the most important being the Las Monjas group.{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}

|caption1=The serpent effect demonstrated during the night show with artificial lighting.|caption2=The serpent effect observed during the 2009 [[spring equinox]].}}
{{main article|El Castillo, Chichen Itza}}
Dominating the North Platform of Chichen Itza is the ''Temple of [[Kukulkan]]'' (a Maya [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|feathered serpent deity]] similar to the Aztec [[Quetzalcoatl]]), usually referred to as ''El Castillo'' ("the castle").{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} This [[step pyramid]] stands about {{convert|30|m|ft}} high and consists of a series of nine square terraces, each approximately {{convert|2.57|m|ft}} high, with a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} high temple upon the summit.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"&gt;García Salgado 2010, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sides of the pyramid are approximately {{convert|55.3|m|ft}} at the base and rise at an angle of 53°, although that varies slightly for each side.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; The four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of 45°.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; The ''[[Talud-tablero|talud]]'' walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between 72° and 74°.&lt;ref name="GarciaSalgado10p118"/&gt; At the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent.&lt;ref&gt;García Salgado 2010, pp.119, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones,&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2006, 2007, p.264.&lt;/ref&gt; and El Castillo is one such example.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p565"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p.565.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1930s, the Mexican government sponsored an excavation of El Castillo. After several false starts, they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid. By digging from the top, they found another temple buried below the current one.&lt;ref name="Willard 1941"&gt;Willard 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the temple chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne in the shape of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade.&lt;ref name="Willard 1941"/&gt; The Mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, and opened it to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.&lt;ref name="DiarioYucatan3Mar06"&gt;Diario de Yucatan, 3 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the [[spring equinox|Spring]] and [[Autumn equinox]]es, in the late afternoon, the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase, which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered-serpent god Kukulcan.&lt;ref&gt;García Salgado 2010, pp.121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a widespread belief that this light-and-shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes, but the idea is highly unlikely: it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed, without major changes, during several weeks around the equinoxes, making impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=XXV |issue=149 |pages=26-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Great Ball Court=====
[[File:Chichen-Itza-Ballcourt-Panorama-2010.jpg|thumb|300px|The Great Ball Court.]]
Archaeologists have identified thirteen [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] for playing the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] in Chichen Itza,&lt;ref&gt;Kurjack et al. 1991, p.150.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Great Ball Court about {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the north-west of the Castillo is by far the most impressive. It is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient Mesoamerica.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} It measures {{convert|168|by|70|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each {{Convert|95|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt; The walls of these platforms stand {{convert|8|m|ft}} high;&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt; set high up in the centre of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p42"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A popular explanation is that the objective of the game was to pass a ball through one of the rings, however in other, smaller ball courts there is no ring, only a post.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} In one panel, one of the players has been decapitated; the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes.&lt;ref name="PinaChan8093p44"&gt;Piña Chan 1980, 1993, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, we know tour guides like telling visitors it was the winners who were decapitated. If you have any primary source confirmation, please explain on the talk page before changing this.--&gt;

At one end of the Great Ball Court is the '''North Temple''', also known as the '''Temple of the Bearded Man''' (''Templo del Hombre Barbado'').{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}} This small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair.&lt;ref&gt;Cirerol Sansores 1948, pp.94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.

Built into the east wall are the ''Temples of the Jaguar''. The ''Upper Temple of the Jaguar'' overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two, large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif. Inside there is a large mural, much destroyed, which depicts a battle scene.

In the entrance to the ''Lower Temple of the Jaguar'', which opens behind the ball court, is another Jaguar throne, similar to the one in the inner temple of El Castillo, except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration. The outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas-relief carvings.

=====Additional structures=====
The ''[[Tzompantli]]'', or ''Skull Platform'' (''Plataforma de los Cráneos''), shows the clear cultural influence of the central [[Mexican Plateau]]. Unlike the ''tzompantli'' of the highlands, however, the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at [[Tenochtitlan]].{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}
{{Großes Bild|2014-01-03 Tzompantli in Chichén Itzá anagoria.jpg|1500px|Chichén Itzá; ''[[tzompantli]]'' or Skull Platform}}

The ''Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars'' (''Plataforma de Águilas y Jaguares'') is immediately to the east of the Great Ballcourt.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}} It is built in a combination Maya and Toltec styles, with a staircase ascending each of its four sides.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} The sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}

This ''Platform of Venus'' is dedicated to the planet [[Venus]].{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} In its interior archaeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone,{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}} the purpose of which is unknown. This platform is located north of El Castillo, between it and the Cenote Sagrado.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=83}}

The ''Temple of the Tables'' is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of El Castillo. Its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms, called "atlantes."

The ''Steam Bath'' is a unique building with three parts: a waiting gallery, a water bath, and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones.

''Sacbe Number One'' is a causeway that leads to the Cenote Sagrado, is the largest and most elaborate at Chichen Itza. This "white road" is {{convert|270|m|ft}} long with an average width of {{convert|9|m|ft}}. It begins at a low wall a few metres from the Platform of Venus. According to archaeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road.

=====Sacred Cenote=====
{{main article|Sacred Cenote}}
[[File:Mexico Cenotes.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sacred Cenote]].]]
The [[Yucatán Peninsula]] is a [[limestone]] plain, with no rivers or streams. The region is pockmarked with natural [[sinkhole]]s, called cenotes, which expose the [[water table]] to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Cenote Sagrado, which is {{convert|60|m|ft}} in diameter{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}} and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some {{convert|27|m|ft}} below.

The Cenote Sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who, according to ethnohistoric sources, would conduct sacrifices during times of drought.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}} Archaeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote, including material such as gold, carved jade, copal, pottery, flint, [[obsidian]], shell, wood, rubber, cloth, as well as skeletons of children and men.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=85}}&lt;ref name="Cogginsp26"&gt;Coggins 1984, pp. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Temple of the Warriors=====
[[File:Templo de los Guerreros.jpg|thumb|300px|Templo de los Guerreros (Temple of the Warriors)]]
[[File:Chichen-Itza-Chac-Mool-2010.jpg|thumb|300px|Detail of Temple of the Warriors, showing a statue of [[Chacmool]].]]
The Temple of the Warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors. This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramid's summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramid's temple) is a Chac Mool.

This temple encases or entombs a former structure called The Temple of the Chac Mool. The archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] from 1925 to 1928. A key member of this restoration was Earl H. Morris who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled ''Temple of the Warriors''.

=====Group of a Thousand Columns=====
Along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns, although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: A west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors. A north group runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief;

A northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors, contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods, as well as animals and serpents. The northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering, a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some {{convert|40|m|ft}} away to a rejollada, a former cenote.

To the south of the Group of a Thousand Columns is a group of three, smaller, interconnected buildings. The '''Temple of the Carved Columns''' is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a Chac Mool. There are also numerous columns with rich, bas-relief carvings of some 40 personages.

A section of the upper façade with a motif of x's and o's is displayed in front of the structure. The '''Temple of the Small Tables''' which is an unrestored mound. And the '''Thompson's Temple''' (referred to in some sources as '''Palace of Ahau Balam Kauil''' ), a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting Jaguars (''balam'' in Maya) as well as glyphs of the Maya god Kahuil.

=====El Mercado=====
This square structure anchors the southern end of the Temple of Warriors complex. It is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace. Today, archaeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial.

====Osario Group====
South of the North Group is a smaller platform that has many important structures, several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at Chichen Itza, Xtoloc.

[[File:HighPriestTemple.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Osario pyramid.]]
[[File:Ossuary stairs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Osario staircase.]]
'''The Osario''' itself, like El Castillo, is a step-pyramid temple dominating its platform, only on a smaller scale. Like its larger neighbor, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but unlike El Castillo, at the center is an opening into the pyramid which leads to a natural cave {{convert|12|m|ft}} below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 19th century, and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads, he named the structure '''The High Priests' Temple.''' Archaeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests.

The '''Temple of Xtoloc''' is a recently restored temple outside the Osario Platform is. It overlooks the other large cenote at Chichen Itza, named after the Maya word for iguana, "Xtoloc." The temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people, as well as representations of plants, birds and mythological scenes.

Between the Xtoloc temple and the Osario are several aligned structures: The '''Platform of Venus''' (which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to El Castillo), the '''Platform of the Tombs''', and a small, round structure that is unnamed. These three structures were constructed in a row extending from the Osario. Beyond them the Osario platform terminates in a wall, which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the Xtoloc temple.

South of the Osario, at the boundary of the platform, there are two small buildings that archaeologists believe were residences for important personages. These have been named as the '''House of the Metates''' and the '''House of the Mestizas'''.

====Casa Colorada Group====
South of the Osario Group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the Chichen Itza archaeological zone.

The '''Casa Colorada''' (Spanish for "Red House") is one of the best preserved buildings at Chichen Itza. Its Maya name is ''Chichanchob'', which according to INAH may mean "small holes". In one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of Chichen Itza and possibly of the nearby city of Ek Balam, and contain a Maya date inscribed which correlates to 869 AD, one of the oldest such dates found in all of Chichen Itza.

In 2009, INAH restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the Casa Colorada.&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Casa Colorada is in a good state of preservation, other buildings in the group, with one exception, are decrepit mounds. One building is half standing, named '''La Casa del Venado''' (House of the Deer). This building's name has been long used by the local Maya, and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn't exist anymore.&lt;ref&gt;El Chichán Chob y la Casa del Venado, Chichén Itzá, Yucatán. William J. Folan [https://mediateca.inah.gob.mx/islandora_74/islandora/object/articulo:7562]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Group====
[[File:Chichen itza la iglesia.jpg|thumb|300px|"La Iglesia" in the Las Monjas complex.]]
[[File:Chichen Itza 4.jpg|right|thumb|450px|The "El Caracol" observatory temple.]]
'''Las Monjas''' is one of the more notable structures at Chichen Itza. It is a complex of Terminal Classic buildings constructed in the Puuc architectural style. The Spanish named this complex ''Las Monjas'' ("The Nuns" or "The Nunnery") but it was actually a governmental palace. Just to the east is a small temple (known as the ''La Iglesia'', "The Church") decorated with elaborate masks.{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=84}}{{sfn|Cano|2002|p=87}}

The Las Monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the Late to Terminal Classic. These texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of [[K'ak'upakal|Kakupakal]].{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=457}}{{sfn|Osorio León|2006|p=460}}

'''[[El Caracol, Chichen Itza|El Caracol]]''' ("The Snail") is located to the north of ''Las Monjas''. It is a round building on a large square platform. It gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside. The structure, with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape (the others are rectangular, in keeping with Maya practice), is theorized to have been a proto-observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events, specifically around the path of Venus as it traverses the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997, pp.135–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Akab Dzib]]''' is located to the east of the Caracol. The name means, in Yucatec Mayan, "Dark Writing"; "dark" in the sense of "mysterious". An earlier name of the building, according to a translation of glyphs in the Casa Colorada, is ''Wa(k)wak Puh Ak Na'', "the flat house with the excessive number of chambers," and it was the home of the administrator of Chichén Itzá, kokom Yahawal Cho' K'ak'.&lt;ref&gt;Voss and Kremer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

INAH completed a restoration of the building in 2007. It is relatively short, only {{convert|6|m|ft}} high, and is {{convert|50|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|15|m|ft}} wide. The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways. The eastern façade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, and looks out over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.

The southern end of the building has one entrance. The door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway, above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs—the "mysterious" or "obscure" writing that gives the building its name today. Under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs. Inside one of the chambers, near the ceiling, is a painted hand print.

====Old Chichen====

Data from a [[National Science Foundation]]/[[CyArk]] research partnership.]]
'''Old Chichen''' (or '''Chichén Viejo''' in Spanish) is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site, where most of the Puuc-style architecture of the city is concentrated.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p562"/&gt; It includes the Initial Series Group, the Phallic Temple, the Platform of the Great Turtle, the Temple of the Owls, and the Temple of the Monkeys.

====Other structures====
Chichen Itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about {{convert|5|km2|mi2}} and several outlying subsidiary sites.

====Caves of Balankanche====
Approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} south east of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as [[Balankanche]] ({{lang-es|Gruta de Balankanche}}), '''Balamka'anche'''' in Yucatec Maya). In the caves, a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre-Columbian times.

The location of the cave has been well known in modern times. Edward Thompson and [[Alfred Tozzer]] visited it in 1905. A.S. Pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in 1932 and 1936. E. Wyllys Andrews IV also explored the cave in the 1930s. [[Edwin Shook]] and R.E. Smith explored the cave on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] in 1954, and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts. Shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period, at least from the Preclassic to the post-conquest era.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1961, pp.28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1959, José Humberto Gómez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved [[censer]]s, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==
[[File:Façade principale du palais des Nonnes.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Chichen Itza in 1859–1860 by [[Désiré Charnay]] before vegetation was removed.]]
Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico; in 2014 it was estimated to receive an average of 1.4 million visitors every year.&lt;ref name="SECTUR07"&gt;SECTUR 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Relief, lower terrace columns, Temple of the Warriors (8287896013).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Painting of a relief, lower terrace columns, Temple of the Warriors, by Octavio Medellin 1938.]]
Tourism has been a factor at Chichen Itza for more than a century. John Lloyd Stephens, who popularized the Maya Yucatán in the public's imagination with his book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan'', inspired many to make a pilgrimage to Chichén Itzá. Even before the book was published, Benjamin Norman and Baron [[Emanuel von Friedrichsthal]] traveled to Chichen after meeting Stephens, and both published the results of what they found. Friedrichsthal was the first to photograph Chichen Itza, using the recently invented [[daguerreotype]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmquist and Kailbourn 2000, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Edward Thompson in 1894 purchased the Hacienda Chichén, which included Chichen Itza, he received a constant stream of visitors. In 1910 he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property, but abandoned those plans, probably because of the Mexican Revolution.

In the early 1920s, a group of Yucatecans, led by writer/photographer Francisco Gomez Rul, began working toward expanding tourism to Yucatán. They urged Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments, including Chichen Itza. In 1923, Governor Carrillo Puerto officially opened the highway to Chichen Itza. Gomez Rul published one of the first guidebooks to Yucatán and the ruins.

Gomez Rul's son-in-law, Fernando Barbachano Peon (a grandnephew of former Yucatán Governor [[Miguel Barbachano]]), started Yucatán's first official tourism business in the early 1920s. He began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at Progreso, the port north of Mérida, and persuading them to spend a week in Yucatán, after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination. In his first year Barbachano Peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour. In the mid-1920s Barbachano Peon persuaded Edward Thompson to sell {{convert|5|acre|m2}} next to Chichen for a hotel. In 1930, the Mayaland Hotel opened, just north of the Hacienda Chichén, which had been taken over by the Carnegie Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Madeira 1931, pp. 108–109,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Barbachano Peon purchased all of the Hacienda Chichén, including Chichen Itza, from the heirs of Edward Thompson.&lt;ref name="Usborne 2007"/&gt; Around that same time the Carnegie Institution completed its work at Chichen Itza and abandoned the Hacienda Chichén, which Barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel.

In 1972, Mexico enacted the Ley Federal Sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicas, Artísticas e Históricas (Federal Law over Monuments and Archeological, Artistic and Historic Sites) that put all the nation's pre-Columbian monuments, including those at Chichen Itza, under federal ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Breglia 2006, pp.45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; There were now hundreds, if not thousands, of visitors every year to Chichen Itza, and more were expected with the development of the Cancún resort area to the east.

In the 1980s, Chichen Itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcan in which the feathered serpent god appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See Quetzil Castaneda (1996) In The Museum of Maya Culture (University of Minnesota Press) for a book length study of tourism at Chichen, including a chapter on the equinox ritual. For a 90-minute ethnographic documentary of new age spiritualism at the Equinox see Jeff Himpele and Castaneda (1997)[Incidents of Travel in Chichen Itza] (Documentary Educational Resources).&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists are also amazed by the acoustics at Chichen Itza. For instance a handclap in front of the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid is followed by an echo that resembles the chirp of a [[quetzal]] as investigated by [[Nico F. Declercq|Declercq]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, 14 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichen Itza, a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], is the second-most visited of Mexico's archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;SECTUR 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site draws many visitors from the popular tourist resort of Cancún, who make a day trip on tour buses. In 2007, Chichen Itza's El Castillo was named one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]] after a worldwide vote. Despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise, and that its methodology was criticized, the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in Mexico who project that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists expected to visit Chichen will double by 2012.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Figure is attributed to Francisco López Mena, director of the Consejo de Promoción Turística de México (CPTM – Council for the Promotion of Mexican Tourism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EFE, 29 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing publicity re-ignited debate in Mexico over the ownership of the site, which culminated on 29 March 2010 when the state of Yucatán purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner Hans Juergen Thies Barbachano.&lt;ref&gt;Boffil Gómez, 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past several years, INAH, which manages the site, has been closing monuments to public access. While visitors can walk around them, they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers. The most recent was El Castillo, which was closed after a San Diego, California, woman fell to her death in 2006.&lt;ref name="DiarioYucatan3Mar06"/&gt;

'''Chupícuaro''' is an important [[Pre-Columbian era|prehispanic]] [[Archaeological site|archeological site]] from the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|preclassical]] or [[Formative stage|formative]] period. The culture that takes its 
name from the site dates to 400 BC to 200 AD, or alternatively 500 BC   to 300 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Beatriz de la Fuente, ''L'art précolombien en Mésoamérique'' (Precolombian Art in Meso America), Hazan, 2003, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;, although some academics suggest an origin as early as 800 BC.&lt;ref name=Boletin/&gt;
     
Although often included with the cultures of the Mexican West, Chupícuaro is both close  to the [[Valley of Mexico]] and the northern edge of Meso-America. Information on the epynomous site, composed of several burial grounds, remains fragmentary, since most of it was flooded when the Presa Solis dam was built in the 1940s. A [[INAH]] excavation was able to salvage a little before that happened.&lt;ref name=Boletin /&gt; Other excavations took place beginning in 1998,&lt;ref name=Fr&gt;{{es}}{{cite web |title= México - Chupícuaro |url= http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/es/tobearchived/arqueologia/apuntes-de-arqueologia/america/mexico-chupicuaro/ |website= diplomatie.gouv.fr |publisher= Ministère des Affaires étrangères (France)|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the {{ILL|CEMCA|fr|Centre d'études mexicaines et centraméricaines}}, [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] and l'INAH,  and also contributed to knowledge of Chupicuaro culture.

On the northern border of [[Mesoamerica]], west of the [[Mexican Plateau]], just seven kilometers from [[Acámbaro]], in [[Guanajuato]] State, México, it lies in hills near the [[Lerma River]] and its tributary the Coroneo or Tiger River.&lt;ref name=Boletin&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín de Cultura Chupícuaro|url=http://www.acambaro.gob.mx/uaip/museo/cultura%20chupicuaro.pdf|publisher=Local Acámbaro Museum|location=Guanajuato|language=Spanish|trans-title=Chuícuaro Cultural Bulletin=|accessdate=26 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717170559/http://www.acambaro.gob.mx/uaip/museo/cultura%20chupicuaro.pdf|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology==
The name Chupícuaro can be translated as ''blue place''.&lt;ref name=Dic  &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Diccionario Breve de Mexicanismos |url=  http://www.academia.org.mx/diccionarios/DICAZ/diccionario.htm |publisher=   Academia Mexicana de la Lengua |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Brief Mexican slang dictionary  |year= |accessdate=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the [[Purépecha language]] word "chupicua", a name for the "Ipomoea" plant, used for  blue dye, and the term "ro", place.

== History ==
This prehispanic archaeological site is located on the banks of the Lerma River, between the present-day cities of [[Acámbaro]] and [[Tarandacuao]] in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Little is known about the history of this site. The first explorations took place in 1946 and uncovered pottery objects and tombs. The site is currently below water because of the dam, although the surrounding area is still being explored.&lt;ref name=Francia&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= Apuntes de Arqueología - México - Chupícuaro  |trans-title=Archaeology Notes - México - Chupícuaro  |publisher=  Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores francés|location=  |url= http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/es/accion-francia_217/arqueologia_400/apuntes-arqueologia_401/america_402/mexico-chupicuaro_2603/index.html |language=Spanish|accessdate=9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chichimeca]] nomadic groups ([[Guamare]]s and [[Guachichil]]) arrived from the current [[San Luis Potosí]] state.&lt;ref name=Leon  &gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title= Historia prehispánica  |url= http://www.leon-gto.com.mx/la-ciudad-leon/epoca-prehispanica/ |publisher= León-Gto  |location= |language= |trans-title=Prehispanic History  |year= |accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups settled in a large village of huts built over platforms coated with mud and stone. They grew corn, beans and squash on the banks of the Lerma River and its tributaries. Based on the existence of metals and stone [[molcajete]]s used to grind corn, they probably planted chili and tomatoes. It is also known they were hunters-fishers-gathers.&lt;ref name=Boletin  /&gt;

According to several authors, this settlement developed between 500 BCE and 300 CE. The first inhabitants of this area were hunter-gatherers who lived along the river and eventually developed agricultural knowledge.&lt;ref name=Boletin  /&gt;

In 2013 the level of the water behind the dam in Chupicuaro was lowered for a couple of days. Archeologists brought the towers from the old church to the town of [[Nuevo Chupicuaro]] in Guanajuato {{mdash}} the town founded in 1946 after the townspeople of the original town of Chupicuaro had to move out following the construction of the dam.

From type evidence, its development has been established between 500 BCE and 300 CE, although some scientists suggest an older development, as far back as 800 BCE.&lt;ref name=Boletin/&gt;

Ibarrilla, an unexcavated site in Leon, Guanajuato, is seen as part of the Chupicuaro complex. This archaeological site is potentially one of the most extensive and important of the country according to one author.{{who|date=March 2018}} There are thought to be more than a dozen pyramids built on an oval basement. Only one has been partially explored; various flint stone objects, figurines and pottery were found.

The rest of the structures remain to be explored. There are tombs, altars and other scattered remains in an estimated 500 m2 area.&lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;

== Chupícuaro culture==
This culture is important due to its influence in the area. It may have spread to what is now the southern United States, circa 500 BCE. There are theories that the first inhabitants of Guanajuato belonged to this culture.&lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;

Ceramics of this culture pre-date the classical Mesoamerican period, and include angular figurines with geometric shapes. The [[Acámbaro]] museum exhibits pieces from the [[Purépecha culture|Purépecha]], [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], and [[Otomi]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;

Apparently the Chupícuaro culture developed in a vast territory, or it was defined as Chupícuaro style or tradition (Beatriz Braniff) in, Guanajuato, [[Michoacán]], [[Guerrero]], Mexico State, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], [[Querétaro]] and [[Zacatecas]]. It is estimated that Chupícuaro facilitated the northward expansion of Mesoamerican elements (cultural roots of western Mexico and perhaps Northwest, comparable with the [[Olmec]] culture throughout Mesoamerica (Jiménez Moreno, 1959: 1043).)

Chupícuaro had an important cultural development and expansion of its style in distant areas from the diffusing center and influenced ceramic traditions, which lasted until the end of the classical period, and even into the Postclassical, as seen in Purépecha Michoacán ceramic.&lt;ref name=Boletin/&gt;

At the end of 1985, at the first prehispanic societies meeting in relation to the Chupícuaro culture, it was noted, that Chupícuaro tradition ceramics manufacturing groups, should be considered part of Mesoamerican stratified societies, with a definite political and territorial structure, rather than as isolated village societies, lacking ceremonial centers and architecture. From that first impulse, subsequent social groups presented their own cultural expressions at a regional level in the Mesoamerican context.(Crespo, ''et al.'', 1988:259).

==Regional cultures ==
The [[Acámbaro]] region had five Prehispanic cultures:
*Chupícuaro – Late Preclassical - 800 BCE to 200 CE.
*[[Los Morales]] - Late Preclassical - 400 BCE to 250 CE.
*[[Teotihuacán]] - Classical Period - 200 CE to 900 CE.
*[[Toltec]] – Early Postclassical - 900 CE to 1200 CE.
*[[Purépecha culture|Purépecha]] – Late Postclassical - 1200 CE to 1525 CE.

==Late Preclassical or Formative==
The decline of [[Olmec]] culture at the beginning of the Late Preclassical period (400 BCE - 150 CE) marked a period of cultural diversification and assimilation of Olmec elements into cultural systems that was the origin of several of the most important [[Mesoamerica]]n traditions. However, [[Cuicuilco]] in the south of the [[Valley of Mexico]], and the Chupícuaro, are the most important. The first became the largest city in Mesoamerica and the main ceremonial center of the Valley of Mexico; it maintained relations with Chupícuaro. The decline of Cuicuilco paralleled  the emergence of [[Teotihuacán]], and consumed with the eruption of the [[Xitle]] volcano circa 150 CE, which led to migration north from the Valley of Mexico. Chupícuaro culture is known for its ceramics, of which remnants have been found in a wide area located in the [[Bajío]] and the lake basin.

==Ceramic==
Chupícuaro was a major ceramic center, recognized as one of the best in Mesoamerica for the fine ceramic finishing and decoration, which were developed in multiple shapes and colors, some with geometrical drawings. The motifs were deities, maternity, breastfeeding, people and their ornaments, animals and plants.

Ceramics included multiple monochromatic forms and a variety of three-color polychrome (red, beige and black) with pyramidal geometrical drawings or zig-zags. Clay figurines used “{{ILL|pastillaje|es}}” techniques and made hollow figures. Shell, bone and stone were used.&lt;ref name=Boletin/&gt;

From a study of ceramic styles, the clothing used is inferred, they painted their faces and bodies, wore sandals, truss, necklaces, earflaps, and earrings. Women wore elaborate hairstyles.&lt;ref name=Boletin/&gt;

==Burials==
Chupícuaro inhabitants practiced a [[cult of the dead]] characterized by tombs where they placed trophy skulls, [[obsidian]] arrowheads, [[metate]]s, figurines, earflaps, shell ornaments, necklaces and beads, bone artifacts and musical instruments. These were all found during excavations around 1950.

The many burials and offerings provide knowledge of the way of life of the ancient Chupícuaro inhabitants. They were farmers who lived in huts built from perishable materials forming a good extended rural village, built low platforms with clay floors, ,sometimes grouped together, over which their houses were built. They harvested corn, beans and pumpkin.(pineapple CHAN, 1967: 263).

'''"Cohen on the Telephone"''', also known as '''"Cohen at the Telephone"''' is a comedy [[monologue]]. The monologue was released on [[cylinder recording|cylinder records]], [[78 rpm]] records, and early [[sound film]].

==History of recordings==
[[Joe Hayman]] first recorded the monologue in London in July 1913 for [[Regal Records (1914)|Regal Records]] and was issued in the U.S. by [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faujsa.fau.edu/jsa/discography.php?jsa_num=503633-A |title=FAU Judaica Sound Archives – 78-rpm List (Jewish Music) |publisher=Faujsa.fau.edu |date=1913-07-05 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayman's version of the song reached over 2 million sales in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrells|first1=Joseph|title=The Book of Golden Discs|date=1978|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins|isbn=9780214204807|page=10|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the record led to [[cover versions]] recorded by performers such as [[Monroe Silver]] in 1914, and Barney Bernard whose version was recorded in March 1916 for [[Victor Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr%201=1016&amp;query=2815&amp;num=1&amp;start=1&amp;sortBy=&amp;sortOrder=id |title=Cohen at the telephone / George Thompson.

Cohen at the telephone / Barney Bernard |publisher=Victor.library.ucsb.edu |date=1916-03-17 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Thompson whose version on [[Edison Records]] was released in 1916.

A sound-on-film recording was made in 1923 with [[Monroe Silver]] by [[Lee DeForest]] in the [[Phonofilm]] process, and with George Sidney (1876–1945) in September 1929 by [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/C/CohenOnTheTelephone1923.html SilentEra entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0490849 IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayman recorded a similar routine entitled "Cohen Buys a Wireless Set" in 1923 on Columbia Records.

==Synopsis of sketch==
The monologue is Mr. Cohen's attempt to contact his landlord using a telephone of the period.  The humor is derived from that of the Cohen's "stereo-typical" tendency to make puns, and perhaps the difficulty in being understood on the then primitive telephone with his thick [[Yiddish]] accent:

"Hello, I'm Cohen...I'M COHEN...No- I ain't Goin...I'm stopping here....Hello! This is your tenant Cohen...YOUR TENANT COHEN....No, NOT Lieutenant Cohen..."

The purpose of the call was to ask the landlord to send a repairman down to his location after a windstorm had caused property damage. In frustration, he hangs up at the end of the record and decides to arrange for the repairs himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26777">'''Community health''' is a major field of study within the medical and clinical sciences which focuses on the maintenance, protection, and improvement of the health status of population groups and communities. It is a distinct field of study that may be taught within a separate school of [[public health]] or [[environmental health]]. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] defines community health as:&lt;blockquote&gt;environmental, social, and economic resources to sustain emotional and physical well being among people in ways that advance their aspirations and satisfy their needs in their unique environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = A discussion document on the concept and principles of health promotion | journal = Health Promotion | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–76 | date = May 1986 | pmid = 10286854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Community health tends to focus on a defined geographical [[community]]. The health characteristics of a community are often examined using [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software and [[public health]] datasets. Some projects, such as [[Infoshare|InfoShare]] or GEOPROJ combine GIS with existing datasets, allowing the general public to examine the characteristics of any given community in participating countries.

Medical interventions that occur in communities can be classified as three categories: [[primary healthcare]], [[Secondary care|secondary healthcare]], and [[Tertiary care|tertiary healthcare]]. Each category focuses on a different level and approach towards the community or population group. In the [[United States]], community health is rooted within primary healthcare achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman RA, Bunnell R, Posner SF | title = What is "community health"? Examining the meaning of an evolving field in public health | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 67 Suppl 1 | pages = S58–61 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25069043 | pmc = 5771402 | doi = 10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.07.028 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.07.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary healthcare programs aim to reduce [[risk factor]]s and increase health promotion and [[Preventive healthcare|prevention]]. Secondary healthcare is related to "hospital care" where [[acute care]] is administered in a [[hospital department]] setting. Tertiary healthcare refers to highly specialized care usually involving disease or disability management.

The success of community health programmes relies upon the transfer of information from health professionals to the general public using one-to-one or one to many communication ([[mass communication]]). The latest shift is towards [[health marketing]].

== Measuring community health ==
Community health is generally measured by [[Geographic information system|geographical information systems]] and [[demographic data]]. Geographic information systems can be used to define sub-communities when neighborhood location data is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897378689|title=Community-oriented health services : practices across disciplines|others=Mpofu, Elias,|isbn=9780826198181|location=New York, NY|oclc=897378689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally community health has been measured using sampling data which was then compared to well-known data sets, like the [[National Health Interview Survey]] or [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/evaluate/evaluation|title=Chapter 36. Introduction to Evaluation {{!}} Community Tool Box|website=ctb.ku.edu|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With technological development, [[information system]]s could store more data for small scale communities, cities, and towns; as opposed to [[census]] data that only generalizes information about small populations based on the overall population. Geographical information systems (GIS) can give more precise information of community resources, even at neighborhood levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce J, Witten K, Bartie P | title = Neighbourhoods and health: a GIS approach to measuring community resource accessibility | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–95 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16614327 | pmc = 2563982 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2005.043281 | url = http://jech.bmj.com/content/60/5/389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ease of use of geographic information systems (GIS), advances in [[Multilevel model|multilevel statistics]], and [[spatial analysis]] methods makes it easier for researchers to procure and generate data related to the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thornton LE, Pearce JR, Kavanagh AM | title = Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assess the role of the built environment in influencing obesity: a glossary | journal = The International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity | volume = 8 | pages = 71 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21722367 | pmc = 3141619 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5868-8-71 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social media]] can also play a big role in health information analytics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korda H, Itani Z | title = Harnessing social media for health promotion and behavior change | journal = Health Promotion Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 21558472 | doi = 10.1177/1524839911405850 | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1524839911405850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found social media being capable of influencing people to change their unhealthy behaviors and encourage interventions capable of improving health status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Social media statistics combined with geographical information systems (GIS) may provide researchers with a more complete image of community standards for health and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefanidis|first=Anthony|last2=Crooks|first2=Andrew|last3=Radzikowski|first3=Jacek | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013-04-01|title=Harvesting ambient geospatial information from social media feeds|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-011-9438-2|journal=GeoJournal|volume=78|issue=2|pages=319–338|doi=10.1007/s10708-011-9438-2|issn=0343-2521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghosh DD, Guha R | title = What are we 'tweeting' about obesity?

== Categories of community health ==

=== Primary healthcare and primary prevention ===
Community based health promotion emphasizes [[primary prevention]] and population based perspective(traditional prevention).&lt;ref name="pmid12660197"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merzel C, D'Afflitti J | title = Reconsidering community-based health promotion: promise, performance, and potential | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–74 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12660197 | pmc = 1447790 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.93.4.557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the goal of community health to have individuals in a certain community improve their lifestyle or seek medical attention. [[Primary healthcare]] is provided by [[health professional]]s, specifically the ones a patient sees first that may refer them to secondary or tertiary care.

Primary prevention refers to the early avoidance and identification of risk factors that may lead to certain diseases and disabilities. Community focused efforts including immunizations, classroom teaching, and awareness campaigns are all good examples of how primary prevention techniques are utilized by communities to change certain health behaviors. Prevention programs, if carefully designed and drafted, can effectively prevent problems that children and adolescents face as they grow up.&lt;ref name="Nation_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nation M, Crusto C, Wandersman A, Kumpfer KL, Seybolt D, Morrissey-Kane E, Davino K | title = What works in prevention. Principles of effective prevention programs | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 58 | issue = 6–7 | pages = 449–56 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12971191 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.58.6-7.449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding also applies to all groups and classes of people. Prevention programs are one of the most effective tools health professionals can use to greatly impact individual, population, and community health.&lt;ref name="Nation_2003" /&gt;

=== Secondary healthcare and secondary prevention ===
Community health can also be improved with improvements in individuals' environments. Community health status is determined by the environmental characteristics, behavioral characteristics, [[social cohesion]] in the environment of that community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38216563|title=Primary care : balancing health needs, services, and technology|last=Barbara.|first=Starfield | name-list-format = vanc |date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195125436|edition=Rev.|location=New York|oclc=38216563}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appropriate modifications in the environment can help to prevent unhealthy behaviors and negative health outcomes.

[[Secondary prevention]] refers to improvements made in a patient's lifestyle or environment after the onset of disease or disability. This sort of prevention works to make life easier for the patient, since it's too late to prevent them from their current disease or disability. An example of secondary prevention is when those with occupational low back pain are provided with strategies to stop their health status from worsening; the prospects of secondary prevention may even hold more promise than primary prevention in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank JW, Brooker AS, DeMaio SE, Kerr MS, Maetzel A, Shannon HS, Sullivan TJ, Norman RW, Wells RP | title = Disability resulting from occupational low back pain. Part II: What do we know about secondary prevention? A review of the scientific evidence on prevention after disability begins | journal = Spine | volume = 21 | issue = 24 | pages = 2918–29 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9112717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chronic disease self management programs ====
{{Cleanup section|reason=style, flow|date=May 2018}}
[[Chronic diseases]] has been a growing phenomena within recent decades, affecting nearly 50% of adults within the US in 2012.&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm|title=Chronic Disease Overview {{!}} Publications {{!}} Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion {{!}} CDC|date=2017-10-02|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such diseases include [[asthma]], [[arthritis]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and [[hypertension]]. While they are not directly life-threatening, they place a significant burden on daily lives, affecting quality of life for the individual, their families, and the communities they live in, both socially and financially. Chronic diseases are responsible for an estimated 70% of healthcare expenditures within the US, spending nearly $650 billion per year.

With steadily growing numbers, many community healthcare providers have developed self-management programs to assist patients in properly managing their own behavior as well as making adequate decisions about their lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chodosh|first=Joshua|last2=Morton|first2=Sally C.|last3=Mojica|first3=Walter|last4=Maglione|first4=Margaret|last5=Suttorp|first5=Marika J.|last6=Hilton|first6=Lara|last7=Rhodes|first7=Shannon|last8=Shekelle|first8=Paul|date=2005-09-20|title=Meta-Analysis: Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs for Older Adults|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-6-200509200-00007|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=143|issue=6|pages=427|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-6-200509200-00007|pmid=16172441|issn=0003-4819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate from clinical patient care, these programs are facilitated to further educate patients about their health conditions as a means to adopt health-promoting behaviors into their own lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warsi|first=Asra|last2=Wang|first2=Philip S.|last3=LaValley|first3=Michael P.|last4=Avorn|first4=Jerry|last5=Solomon|first5=Daniel H.|date=2004-08-09|title=Self-management Education Programs in Chronic Disease|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archinte.164.15.1641|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=164|issue=15|pages=1641|doi=10.1001/archinte.164.15.1641|pmid=15302634|issn=0003-9926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristics of these programs include:
* grouping patients with similar chronic diseases to discuss disease-related tasks and behaviors to improve overall health
* improving patient responsibility through daily disease-monitoring
* inexpensive and widely-known

No significant differences have been reported comparing the effectiveness of both peer-led versus professional led self-management programs.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;

[[File:Distribution of the chronic-disease self-management program by ZIP Code and rurality.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Distribution_of_the_chronic-disease_self-management_program_by_ZIP_Code_and_rurality.png|thumb|The distribution of rural CDSME program participantsvaried across the US. Analysis across rurality indicated that approximately 22.1% (using county-level rurality) to24.4% (using ZCTA/ZIP Code-level rurality) of CDSME programparticipants resided in rural areas.]]There has been a lot of debate regarding the effectiveness of these programs and how well they influence patient behavior and understanding their own health conditions. Some studies argue that self-management programs are effective in improving patient quality of life and decreasing healthcare expenditures and hospital visits. A 2001 study assessed health statuses through healthcare resource utilizations and self-management outcomes after 1 and 2 years to determine the effectiveness of chronic disease self-management programs. After analyzing 800 patients diagnosed with various types of chronic conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and arthritis, the study found that after the 2 years, there was a significant improvement in health status and fewer [[emergency department]] and physician visits (also significant after 1 year). They concluded that these low-cost self-management programs allowed for less healthcare utilization as well as an improvement in overall patient health.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorig|first=Kate R.|last2=Ritter|first2=Philip|last3=Stewart|first3=Anita L.|last4=Sobel|first4=David S.|last5=Brown|first5=Byron William|last6=Bandura|first6=Albert|last7=Gonzalez|first7=Virginia M.|last8=Laurent|first8=Diana D.|last9=Holman|first9=Halsted R.|date=2001|title=Chronic Disease Self-Management Program: 2-Year Health Status and Health Care Utilization Outcomes|journal=Medical Care|volume=39|issue=11|pages=1217–1223|jstor=3767514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2003 by the National Institute for Health Research analyzed a 7-week chronic disease self-management program in its cost-effectiveness and health efficacy within a population over 18 years of age experiencing one or more chronic diseases. They observed similar patterns, such as an improvement in health status, reduced number of visits to the emergency department and to physicians, shorter hospital visits. They also noticed that after measuring unit costs for both hospital stays ($1000) and emergency department visits ($100), the study found the overall savings after the self-management program resulted in nearly $489 per person.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorig|first=K.

They concluded that self-management programs for both diabetes and hypertension produced clinically significant benefits to overall health.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;

On the other hand, there are a few studies measuring little significance of the effectiveness of chronic disease self-management programs. In the previous 2005 study in Australia, there was no clinical significance in the health benefits of osteoarthritis self-management programs and cost-effectiveness of all of these programs.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Furthermore, in a 2004 literature review analyzing the variability of chronic disease self-management education programs by disease and their overlapping similarities, researchers found "small to moderate effects for selected chronic diseases," recommending further research being conducted.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

Some programs are looking to integrate self-management programs into the traditional healthcare system, specifically primary care, as a way to incorporate behavioral improvements and decrease the increased patient visits with chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leppin|first1=Aaron|date=2018|title=Integrating community-based health promotion programs and primary care: a mixed methods analysis of feasibility|url=https://bmchealthservres-biomedcentral-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-2866-7|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=18|doi=10.1186/s12913-018-2866-7|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have argued that severe limitations hinder these programs from acting its full potential. Possible limitations of chronic disease self-management education programs include the following:&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;
* underrepresentation of minority cultures within programs
* lack of medical/health professional (particularly primary care) involvement in self-management programs
* low profile of programs within community
* lack of adequate funding from federal/state government
* low participation of patients with chronic diseases in program
*uncertainty of effectiveness/reliability of programs

=== Tertiary healthcare ===
In [[tertiary healthcare]], community health can only be affected with professional medical care involving the entire population. Patients need to be referred to specialists and undergo advanced medical treatment. In some countries, there are more sub-specialties of medical professions than there are primary care specialists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Health inequalities]] are directly related to social advantage and social resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The complexity of community health and its various problems can make it difficult for researchers to assess and identify solutions. [[Community-based participatory research]] (CBPR) is a unique alternative that combines community participation, inquiry, and action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minkler|first=Meredith|date=2005-06-01|title=Community-based research partnerships: Challenges and opportunities|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1093/jurban/jti034|journal=Journal of Urban Health|language=en|volume=82|issue=2|pages=ii3–ii12|doi=10.1093/jurban/jti034|issn=1099-3460|pmc=3456439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community-based participatory research (CBPR) helps researchers address community issues with a broader lens and also works with the people in the community to find culturally sensitive, valid, and reliable methods and approaches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other issues involve access and cost of medical care. A great majority of the world does not have adequate health insurance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968482612|title=World health statistics. 2016, Monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals.|others=World Health Organization,|isbn=9241565268|location=Geneva, Switzerland|oclc=968482612}}&lt;/ref&gt; In low-income countries, less than 40% of total health expenditures are paid for by the public/government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Community health, even [[population health]], is not encouraged as health sectors in developing countries are not able to link the national authorities with the local government and community action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) changed the way community health centers operate and the policies that were in place, greatly influencing community health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Rosenbaum, Sara|last2=Peter|first2=Shin,|last3=Emily|first3=Jones,|last4=Jennifer|first4=Tolbert,|date=2010|title=Community Health Centers: Opportunities and Challenges of Health Reform|url=https://hsrc.himmelfarb.gwu.edu/sphhs_policy_facpubs/199/|journal=Health Sciences Research Commons|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACA directly affected community health centers by increasing funding, expanding insurance coverage for Medicaid, reforming the Medicaid payment system, appropriating $1.5 billion to increase the workforce and promote training.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The impact, importance, and success of the Affordable Care Act is still being studied and will have a large impact on how ensuring health can affect community standards on health and also individual health.

'''Contemporary Sant Mat Movements''' are [[esoteric]] philosophy movements active in the United States, Europe, [[Latin America]], and especially India. These movements assert that [[Sant Mat]] shares a lineage with [[Sikhism]] and contains elements of thought found in [[Hinduism]], such as [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. They further assert that Sant Mat also contains elements found in [[Sufism]] and has inspired and influenced a number of religious groups and organizations. They refer to this spiritual path as the "Science of the Soul" or ‘[[Sant Mat]]’, meaning ‘teachings of the saints’. More recently it has been described as "The Way of Life" or "Living the Life of Soul." It incorporates a practical [[yoga]] system known as [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to incorporate a personal and private path of spiritual development in the common tradition of mystics past and present. They discuss the irrelevance of rituals, priestly class, mandatory contributions, or compulsory gatherings.

==Introduction==
The basic teaching of contemporary Sant Mat, as described by its Masters, is that everything lies inside us and that God is within. The outside world is only an image or a reflection of the inner reality.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Thakar (1989). Newspaper interview, Lagos Nigeria. Reprinted in Heart Of Compassion, Kirpal Light Satsang, 1991 {{ISBN|0-917019-11-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; So self-knowledge or knowledge of the higher self and God-knowledge (taken as a practical project rather than a theoretical inquiry) are the topics of Sant Mat.&lt;ref name="link2"&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1955). Night Is A Jungle, Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/god_man.htm Online_version].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirpal Singh]] describes [[Sant Mat]] as a synonym for ''[[Surat Shabd Yoga]]'', the [[yoga]] of the [[Sound Current]], or more simply ''Shabd yoga'', a meditation technique he asserts was taught and practiced originally in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal. (1999). ''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm Naam or Word]''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. {{ISBN|0-942735-94-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh writes that practitioners of Shabd yoga position the path as not requiring the physical torture of penance and austerities that marked many of the yogas and spiritual paths throughout the ages. Thus it is sometimes called "[[Sahaja|Sehaj]]" (easy) yoga.&lt;ref name="link5"&gt;Singh, Kirpal. Man Know Thyself. Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Online_version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely accepted translations of the Indian term "Sant Mat" are "Teachings of the Saints" and "Path of the Masters." These are both incidentally the titles of prominent works on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1976). The Way of the Saints: Sant Mat. Sant Bani ashram. {{ISBN|0-89142-026-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link4"&gt;Johnson, Julian (1985). The Path of the Masters: The Science of Surat Shabd Yoga : The Yoga of the audible Life Stream. Radha Soami Satsang Beas. {{ISBN|1-199-61327-4}} (Originally published much earlier, perhaps in the 1950s.)&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly accepted definition of the term is found in [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Man Know Thyself] by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]]:

:Man is constantly changing or introducing new names and terminologies to describe this Science. The Masters were called Sants, and the nature of knowledge Mat, thus giving us the term 'Sant-Mat', which is at present mostly used to name the Path of the Masters. Other terms, such as Shabd Yoga, Surat Shabd Yoga, Sehaj Yoga, are also used to describe the same Science. In the Sanskrit language, the word 'Sant' means Master of the highest Order, and 'Mat' is a confirmed opinion or statement made by an adept after personal experience. The foundation of this Science, therefore, is the result of a critical study, minute investigation, and the lifelong personal verification of facts based on practical experience of the Self in man. This experience of the Self is something that a competent Master is prepared to give to each individual who approaches him. Sant Mat, therefore, is the teaching, system and path of the Saints.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

However, terminology, names, and groups are not considered to be of any importance in Sant Mat:

:The Masters do not attach any importance to names, designations, or the fact that many religious sects, groups and circles, have claimed this Science as their own and named it after their leaders or founders. They look upon these groups as schools where man — the noblest being in Creation — can study with other men as children of one and the same Almighty Father.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

==Origins==
{{details|Sant Mat}}
Sant Mat (literally, "school of the [[Sant (India)|Sant]]s") was a loosely associated group of teachers that assumed prominence in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent from about the 13th century. Their teachings are distinguished theologically by inward loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an [[egalitarian]]ism opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste hierarchy and to the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;Woodhead, Linda &amp; Fletcher, Paul. ''Religion in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations'' (2001) pp.71-2. Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|0-415-21784-9}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical reach==
Contemporary Sant Mat movements exist all over the world.

[[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], the mission begun by [[Baba Jaimal Singh]] at the turn of the 19th century, has its headquarters known as "Dera Baba Jaimal Singh", near the river [[Beas River|Beas]] in [[northern India]] since 1891. His Master [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] had perhaps 500 initiates, and if one wanted to see the Master it was necessary to travel to his home in Agra. His lineage continues at Radhasoami Central Satsang, at Dayalbagh, Agra, in India. Baba Jaimal Singh had perhaps 2500 initiates and did not travel more than a few hundred miles from Beas while he was a Master. Baba Sawan Singh did not travel outside of India, but is believed to have had as many as one lac (100,000) initiates, some of whom were foreigners. [[Charan Singh (guru)]] did travel overseas and the present master [[Gurinder Singh]], travels to nearly 90 countries.  Today the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], is leading the way forward and encompassing all the teachings of the saints.&lt;ref name="link4" /&gt;

[[Sant Kirpal Singh]] visited Europe and the United States in 1955 and 1963, and Europe, America, and Latin America in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/kirpal.htm Ruhani Satsang USA website, Tour reports]&lt;/ref&gt; The various spiritual leaders who claim to lead this movement now frequently travel all over the world.

==General tenets==
The most central tenet is the need to be initiated by a living Master or [[Satguru]] ("sat" meaning true and "guru" meaning Master or Spiritual Teacher). "Competent Master" is another common formulation: the Master must be competent in the sense of having been commissioned by God, not just a person who feels like working in the role of a guru:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a sad affair that there are thousands of imitators, of false copies, but it doesn't mean that the world is devoid of truth and that a Master is not available to the people...It has always been a law that at least one complete master would be on earth to bring God's truth to the people. One such Master can benefit the entire world just as one sun can glorify and light up the entire world. [16] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Technically speaking Sant Mat practice involves listening to the [[Shabd|Inner Sound]], also known in the Holy Bible as 'The Word' or 'logos' contemplating the [[Light (theology)|Inner Light]], and (eventually) [[Astral projection|leaving the human body at will]] - a practice sometimes referred to as "dying while living". The principal intent is to awaken the Soul and unite it with God.&lt;ref&gt;"My dear souls, I should call you souls because we are from God. It is told to us" 'Your soul bears the seal of God. It belongs to God, give it unto God.' These words from the Bible and other scriptures were told by God himself when he came into the human garb. He came because Man has been misled. God is the only one who has sympathy with these suffering souls. He wants to end their suffering: 'Come back to me. Enjoy perfection, as I am perfect.'" LTLOS, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sant Mat is a practical and not a theoretical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"The present day is an age of the practical life. People do not believe unless there is something practical. So we must have all our Truth in a practical way, and it will appeal to all. This Truth will prevail. Times are changing. This is the only thing that can appeal to everybody. This is the only ground on which all of us can sit together. So I wish each one of you to be practical. Do not try to reform others. Reform your own self." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/ocean.htm The Ocean of Intoxication].&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to be different in a radical sense from other disciplines or kinds of knowledge which can be taught. It claims to be a meta-knowledge or method of going beyond knowledge and deprecates the mind and mental processes, at all times describing a dichotomy between the mind and the soul, in which the mind is only a negative copy or imitation of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Anyone whose soul is under the mind's influence and control becomes an image of the mind, for he forgets his true self. We call this ego or I-hood for one thinks 'I am everything.' Yet, one does not know that true 'I.' If one has forgotten one's true Self, then who is it that will realize the Lord?" LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/listen.htm Oh Mind, Listen For Once].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is to become still and quiet so that the soul can begin to experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Once, I remember, a very learned pundit came to our Master. I was there. He had a talk with my Master. At the end he said, "Will you kindly initiate me?" He was initiated. Then he told the Master, "Master, I will become proficient within three months. I'll do everything You say and come back." Master said, "All right, what more is wanted?" He came back after six months, and fortunately I was there because I had the privilege to be back with the Master. He said, "Master, previously l had been putting in eight hours a day in worship, and my mind never disturbed me. Now I cannot sit for a moment." You see? It is because in the outward performances, the mind gets food. You light the candle, you offer flowers, then you do this and that. The mind gets food. But in this way, the mind meets its death. He would prefer to go into the mouth of a cannon rather than enter within." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/lok/servant.htm Are You The Servant Of Your Mind?]&lt;/ref&gt; The soul has its own internal sources of knowledge, and when properly connected to its inner sources, no outer education or knowledge is required or desired.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The second essential tenet is the mystical role of the Sound Current:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Prajapatir vai idam-agree asit Tasya vak dvitiya asit Vak vai Paramam Brahma''&lt;/blockquote&gt; (from Vedas)

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning was [[Prajapati]] (the Creator),
With Him was the [[Vāk|Vak]] (the Word),
And the Vak (the Word) was verily the
Supreme [[Brahman]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents compare this with the verses of John 1 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201;&amp;version=31 John] to assert their special use of comparative religion (seeking the common thread in all religions and esoteric phenomena). ''Naam or Word'' [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm], written by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]], explores this theme. It asserts that the Sound Current is the esoteric form of God which is available to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;"When we meditate on that light of God and that music, we will find access to God himself. The music we hear in this outer world is the outer expression of that inner music. In the Jap Ji, twenty-seventh stanza, you will find Nanak marvelling at God's mansion...he says that in God's house he found all music, so many instruments, so many kinds and types of songs, and so many singers. Then Nanak further explains that all this universe, the Judge and air and fire and everything there is, is going on because of music....Everything is Music. God is also music and he controls everything with music." And You Will Fly Up To God (see [16]). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guru, who is a human being, has merged with the Sound Current in such a manner that he is a living manifestation of it (the Word made flesh).&lt;ref name="link42"&gt;Way of Life, 2002. "'Word made flesh and dwelt amongst us.' The Word God came into this world in human flesh and began to dwell with us. Why? So that the competency of the Word God, who has created everything, maintains everything, and is full God, will work in this world in the same capacity as it works in the highest heavens. " p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just the Guru can achieve this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way &lt;ref name="link42" /&gt;

===Helping factors===
Beyond the two main tenets, Contemporary Sant Mat movements emphasize an ethical lifestyle and selfless service. They assert that these are not spirituality as such, but are necessary preparation for true spirituality to commence.&lt;ref&gt;An Ethical Lifestyle, Selfless Service. Video tape recording, Edition Naam USA. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A self-introspective diary or daily diary tracking ethical lifestyle in five cardinal disciplines is sometimes recommended as a way to self-monitor one's own ethical condition. The five cardinal virtues tracked by
the diary are ''Ahimsa'' or [[Nonviolence]], Truthfulness, [[Chastity]], love for all regardless of caste, creed, wealth, or intellectual attainments (i.e., [[Humility]]), and finally the maintenance of a strict [[Vegetarian]] diet. Drugs and alcohol are also to be avoided, as is the company of worldly-minded people.&lt;ref name="link45"&gt;And You Will Fly Up To God, p. 57-75, "The Daily Diary".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selfless Service]] or Seva means devoting oneself to mental, physical, or financial service to the Guru, and the sangat (or devotees).  Mental service means keeping constant remembrance of God by means of repetition of the Mantra (known as [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]) or by other means keeping the Guru in mind. Physical service means doing some physical work, as in the situation where one helps dig a well at an ashram or gives a talk about the Master to the public. Financial service means giving money to the mission of the Master (to his organization) instead of spending it on oneself. The concept of Financial Seva is quite similar to [[tithe|tithing]] as known generally in Christianity. Also, just as a very general rule, at least 10% of one's time should be spent in meditation.&lt;ref name="link45" /&gt;

===Practices===
Contemporary Sant Mat movements assert that the "Master" or [[Guru]] is provided by God as the channel through which God manifests in the world - God is believed to be unknowable and inconceivable, so he has created Gurus as a way in which to be available. Only humans are capable of interacting with a Master, as other forms of life are asserted to be incapable of doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Teachers of contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to teach a spiritual path which is intentionally easier than others described in the ancient scriptures as it requires nothing more than sitting quietly and looking and listening within.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Specifics of this process include connecting one's soul or attention, called ''[[Surat (soul)]]'' with the inner Current of Light and Sound of God, the [[Shabd]]. Adherents believe this Sound Current cannot be heard by the uninitiated; it is made manifest at the time of initiation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} An essential component of the practice involves sitting still with eyes closed, with one's attention focused at the "third eye center", located between and behind the two eyebrows, while (mentally) repeating one or more [[mantra]]s given by the Guru to the disciple at the time of initiation. This is called [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition) and its primary function is to still the mind while remembering (or being connected to) the Guru via the mantra he provided. However listening to the Sound Current by plugging the ears with the thumbs and listening at the right side or above is equally as important. Sound is considered to be the source of the Light, and to contain everything required. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The concept of [[Satsang]] is also a common thread in contemporary Sant Mat movements' practices. Satsang means literally "gathering of Truth." These gatherings serve as the formal meeting place of the Master and his devotees when he is present in physical form, but also, more often, follow the tradition of early Christianity and take place in the homes of disciples or in any convenient location as times of remembrance of the Master and the need for meditation.&lt;ref&gt;"You may also gather together in one of your homes to listen to one of Master's tapes or read from the religious scriptures or talk about Master's mission or His teachings. That will also be a satsang." And You Will Fly Up to God, p. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Sant Mat movements, not everyone automatically qualifies for [[Initiation]]; many teachers require that prospective followers be spiritually “ready”. This was especially true in earlier times, when people made more time available. There are definite criteria for judging whether or not a person is indeed ready for initiation: they must be ready to eschew drugs and alcohol, lead a disciplined and chaste lifestyle, avoid spiritual healing and other forms of meditation, and commit to several hours of meditation per day.&lt;ref name="link2" /&gt;

==Sects==
There are many sects within contemporary Sant Mat movements, with different leaders and varying belief systems. Examples include [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], [[Radha Swami Satsang, Dinod]] and the [[Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission]].

The work of [[David C. Lane]] provides a partial catalogue of various sects related to the Radha Soami Satsang Beas and attempts to study their formation from a socio-economic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, David, [http://elearn.mtsac.edu/dlane/radhabook.html The Radhasoami tradition: A Critical History of Guru Successorship]'' (1992).  Garland Publishers, New York {{ISBN|0-8240-5247-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] has also extensively studied groups related to Radha Soami Satsang Beas.&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark.

==Other contemporary movements described as having a Sant Mat origin==
The [[Quan Yin Method]] of meditation promoted though the spiritual teachings of [[Supreme Master Ching Hai]] also has notable similarities to Sant Mat. The religious movement [[Eckankar]] is considered by some to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. Paul Twitchell, who founded Eckankar, was an initiate of Sant [[Kirpal Singh]].

The [[Divine Light Mission]], founded by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and succeeded by his sons Guru Maharaj Ji ([[Prem Rawat]]) and [[Satpal Maharaj]], was characterized as part of the Sant Mat tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland : een encyclopedisch overzicht'', published by Kampen Kok cop.

The '''''Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources''''' ("DMLBS") is a lexicon of [[Medieval Latin]] published by the [[British Academy]]. The dictionary is not founded upon any earlier dictionary, but derives from original research. After decades of preparatory work, work on the dictionary itself was begun in 1965, and it was published in fascicules between 1975 and 2013.  In 2016 the complete work was put online. A consolidated reprint in three volumes was published in 2018.

==History==

In 1913, [[R J Whitwell|Robert Whitwell]], a prolific contributor to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; petitioned the [[British Academy]] to use the imminent International Congress of Historical Studies to propose a replacement for the standard dictionary of medieval Latin, [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]]'s ''Glossarium'' (1678).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jowitt Whitwell, "Mediaeval Latin", letter to ''The Spectator'', 1 February 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitwell's idea was taken up in 1920 by the new [[Union Académique Internationale|International Union of Academies]], which decided in 1924 that member academies should produce dictionaries based on those medieval Latin texts produced in geographic areas corresponding to their respective present-day territories, whilst also furnishing the material for an international ''Novum Glossarium''.&lt;ref&gt;Union Académique Internationale [http://www.uai-iua.org/cgi?lg=en&amp;pag=1145&amp;tab=195&amp;rec=5&amp;frm=0 project page] {{Retrieved | accessdate=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the British Academy appointed two committees to direct the collection of quotations, one covering the sixth to eleventh centuries for the ''Novum Glossarium'' and the other covering [[Norman conquest of England|1066]] to 1600 for a dictionary of "late medieval British Latin".

By 1932 the Academy felt that they could usefully publish the first fruits of the project, which appeared in 1934 as the ''Medieval Latin Word-List from British and Irish Sources'', prepared by J. H. Baxter and Charles Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;James Houston Baxter and Charles Johnson, "Introduction", ''Medieval Latin Word-List from British and Irish Sources''.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Revised Word-List'' prepared by Ronald Latham appeared in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Latham, ''Revised Medieval Latin Word-List from British and Irish Sources'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print publication history==
The DMLBS was published in printed [[serial (literature)|fascicules]], from 1975 to 2013, by [[Oxford University Press]]:

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional Overlapping Competing Jurisdictions''' ('''FOCJ''', also '''Functional, Overlapping and Competing Jurisdictions''') is a moderate form of [[panarchy]] advocated by [[Swiss people|Swiss]] economists [[Bruno Frey]] and [[Reiner Eichenberger]].

Under FOCJ, government operations are divided into multiple organisations each known as a FOCUS.  FOCJ are:

* '''Functional''', as they deal with one matter only, such as education, policing, or roads.
* '''Overlapping''', since the individuals or region covered by a FOCUS providing one function might be covered by multiple FOCJ in respect of another function.
* '''Competing''', as FOCJ providing the same function compete with one another.  For some functions, each individual may choose which FOCUS will apply to them; however, if the function is territorially bound, each town votes to select its FOCUS.  For example, an FOCJ nation may have three police forces, with each town voting as to which of the three shall provide its policing.
* A '''jurisdiction''', because a FOCUS is a separate political unit, and may, for example, levy taxes upon the individuals or towns selecting it.

'''''Fear and Bullets''''' is an album created through a collaboration between [[James O'Barr]] and longtime friend [[John Bergin]] as a [[soundtrack]] to O'Barr's [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Crow]]''. It was originally released in 1994 along with a limited edition hardcover copy of the graphic novel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Trust-Obey-Fear-And-Bullets/release/361632|title=Trust Obey - Fear And Bullets|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release also coincided with the publicity received from [[The Crow (1994 film)|the film]].

In 1999, ''Fear and Bullets'' was re-released with a new cover, almost all the songs completely re-recorded or remixed, and the addition of two new tracks (but other two were removed).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Trust-Obey-Fear-And-Bullets/release/260068|title=Trust Obey - Fear And Bullets|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release included previously unreleased drawings by O'Barr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7034">'''Fusion of powers''' is a feature of some [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] forms of government, especially those following the [[Westminster system]], where the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government are intermingled. It is contrasted with the more rigorous [[separation of powers]]&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws&lt;/ref&gt; found in [[Presidential system|presidential]] and [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] forms of government where the legislative and executive powers are in origin separated by popular vote. Fusion of powers exists in many, if not a majority, of parliamentary democracies, and does so by design. However, in all modern democratic polities the [[judiciary|judicial]] branch of government is independent of the legislative and executive branches.

The system first arose as a result of political evolution in the [[United Kingdom]] over many centuries, as the powers of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] became constrained by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Needler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin C. Needler|title=The Concepts of Comparative Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fcssj8yigS4C&amp;pg=PA116|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-93653-2|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''fusion of powers'' itself is believed to have been coined by the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional]] expert [[Walter Bagehot]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090507183313/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nuls/research/wpapers/verde1.html The Harmonious Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Australia===
As Australia has a partially Westminster-derived parliamentary system, the executive branch is entirely composed of members of the legislative branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 2|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter2#ano|website=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Senator [[Eugene Forsey]] of [[Canada]] remarked that "in Canada, the [[Government of Canada|Government]] and the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] cannot be at odds for more than a few weeks at a time. If they differ on any matter of importance, then, promptly, there is either a new government or a new House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lop.parl.ca/About/Parliament/senatoreugeneforsey/book/chapter_4-e.html | title=How Canadians Govern Themselves | website=Library of Parliament, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The current [[French Fifth Republic]] provides an example of the fusion of powers from a country which does not follow the [[Westminster system]]. Rather France follows a model known alternatively as a [[semi-presidential system]] or 'mixed presidential-parliamentary' system, which exists somewhere between [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]] and [[Presidential system|presidential democracies]].

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom is generally considered the country with the strongest fusion of powers. Until 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] was a full fusion of all branches, being [[Lord Speaker|speaker in the House of Lords]], a government minister heading the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] and head of the judiciary.

===Sweden===
The parliamentary system in Sweden has since its new constitution in 1974 instituted a fusion of powers whereby the principle of "popular sovereignty" serves as the guiding light of principle of government and forms the first line of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riksdagen.se/en/Documents-and-laws/Laws/The-Constitution/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
One advantage of a fusion of powers, according to promoters, is that it is easier for the government to take action. There exists virtually no way for there to be a deadlock in the manner that can sometimes occur where the legislature and executive are separated,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.hawaii.edu/~fredr/6-lap9a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but see the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] for a counter-example (regarding the dual executive nature of some parliamentary systems).

==Disadvantages==
{{technical|section|date=April 2016}}The disadvantage with a fusion of powers, paradoxically, is the power it gives to the executive, not the legislative, arm of government. In a fusion of powers, the [[head of government]] must have the confidence of a majority in the legislature. If the majority is made up of members of one's own party, the head of government can use these supporters to control the legislature's business, thus protecting the executive from being truly accountable and at the same time passing any laws expedient for the government. A revolt by members of the government's own party (or, if the government is a [[coalition]] or [[minority government]], by supporting parties) is possible, but [[party discipline]], along with a tendency by many electorates to vote against [[political instability|unstable governments]], makes such a revolt unattractive and therefore rare.

Many states have responded to this by instituting or retaining [[multicameralism|multicameral]] legislatures, in which all houses must pass legislation in the same form. The [[responsible house]] is usually the most powerful and the only house with the actual power to terminate the government. Other houses, though, can often veto or at least delay controversial [[bill (proposed law)|bills]], perhaps until the government's performance can be [[general election|judged by the electorate]]. They also provide additional forums for inquiry into the conduct of the executive. In addition, since the government's future is not at stake in other houses, members of the governing party or coalition in these houses can be freer to oppose particular government policies they disagree with. A second approach to curbing executive power is the election of the responsible house by some form of [[proportional representation]], as in the case of [[Japan]]. This often, but not necessarily, leads to coalitions or minority governments. These governments have the support of the legislature when their survival is at stake but less absolute control over its proceedings.

A fusion of powers was specifically rejected by the framers of the [[American constitution]], for fear that it would concentrate a dangerous level of power into one body. However, other countries reject the presidential system for the same reason, arguing it concentrates too much power in the hands of one person, especially if [[impeachment]] is difficult.

'''Garry Wills''' (born May 22, 1934) is an American author, journalist, and historian, specializing in American history, politics, and religion, especially the [[history of the Catholic Church]]. He won a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1993.

Wills has written nearly forty books and, since 1973, has been a frequent reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/85 Author's page for Garry Wills] at the [[New York Review of Books]] website&lt;/ref&gt; He became a faculty member of the history department at [[Northwestern University]] in 1980, where he is currently an [[Emeritus Professor]] of History.

==Early years==
Wills was born on May 22, 1934, in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="loa"&gt;Library of America.[http://reportingcivilrights.loa.org/authors/bio.jsp?authorId=157 Biography of Garry Wills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605010422/http://reportingcivilrights.loa.org/authors/bio.jsp?authorId=157 |date=June 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jack Wills, was from a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] background, and his mother was from an [[Irish Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.nytimes.com/2002/07/14/books/chapters/0714-1st-wills.html|title=The Loyal Opposition|first=Jack|last=Miles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reared as Catholic and grew up in Michigan and Wisconsin, graduating in 1951 from [[Campion High School]], a Jesuit institution in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]]. He entered and then left the [[Society of Jesus]].

Wills earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Saint Louis University]] in 1957 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree from [[Xavier University]] in 1958, both in philosophy. [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] hired him as a drama critic for ''[[National Review]]'' magazine at the age of 23. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[classics]] from [[Yale University]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="nm4h1998"/&gt; He taught history at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1962 to 1980.

==Personal life==
Wills has been married to Natalie Cavallo since 1959; she was the flight attendant on his first flight on an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/485 According to [[William F. Buckley]], as told on the [[Charlie Rose Show]] on March 24, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606131616/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/485 |date=June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three children: John, Garry, and Lydia.&lt;ref name="nm4h1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081845,00.html | title=Garry Wills Dismantles Camelot and Finds Some Prisoners Within – Jack, Bob and Ted Kennedy | publisher = [[People magazine|People]] magazine | date=April 5, 1982 | first=Linda | last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trained [[classicist]], Wills is proficient in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]]. His home in [[Evanston, Illinois]], is "filled with books", with a converted bedroom dedicated to English literature, another containing [[Latin literature]] and books on American political thought, one hallway full of books on economics and religion, "including four shelves on [[St. Augustine]]", and another with shelves of [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;ref name="nm4h1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10052/1036942-148.stm | title=Non-fiction: "Bomb Power," by Garry Wills | publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date=February 21, 2010 | first=Bob | last=Hoover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Wills describes himself as a Roman Catholic and, with the exception of a period of doubt during his [[seminary]] years, has been a Roman Catholic all his life.&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{cite book|author=Garry Wills |title=Why I Am a Catholic |year=2003 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-618-38048-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at the Sheil Catholic Center in [[Northwestern University]]. He prays the [[rosary]] every day, and wrote a book about the [[Catholic devotion|devotion]] (''The Rosary: Prayer Comes Around'') in 2005.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web| last=Allen | first=John L, Jr. | url= http://ncronline.org/news/people/poped-out-wills-seeks-broader-horizons | title='Poped out' Wills seeks broader horizons | publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]] | date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills has also been a critic of many aspects of [[history of the Catholic Church|church history]] and [[Catholic social teaching|church teaching]] since at least the early 1960s. He has been particularly critical of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]]; the social teaching of the church regarding homosexuality, abortion, contraception, and the Eucharist; and of the church's reaction to the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sex abuse scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garry Wills |title=Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Garry |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-op-wills4nov04,0,2121538.story |title='Abortion isn't a religious issue' |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wills | first=Garry | url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/feb/15/contraception-con-men/ | title = 'Contraception's Con Men' | publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] | date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wills | first=Garry | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/aug/15/the-bishops-at-bay/ | title = The Bishops at Bay | publisher=New York Review of Books | date=August 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, in a phone conversation with William F. Buckley Jr., Wills coined the famous [[macaronic]] phrase ''[[Mater si, magistra no]]'' (literally "mother yes, teacher no").&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; The phrase, which was a response to the [[papal encyclical]] ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' and a reference to the then-current [[anti-Castro]] slogan "Cuba sí, Castro no", signifies a devotion to the faith and tradition of the church combined with a skeptical attitude towards [[ecclesiastical authority]].&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

Wills published a full-length analysis of the contemporary Catholic Church, ''Bare Ruined Choirs'', in 1972 and a full-scale criticism of the historical and contemporary church, ''Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit'', in 2000. He followed up the latter with a sequel, ''Why I Am a Catholic'' (2002), as well as with the books ''What Jesus Meant'' (2006), ''What Paul Meant'' (2006), and ''What the Gospels Meant'' (2008).

==Politics==
Wills began his career as an early protégé of William F. Buckley Jr. and was associated with [[conservatism]]. When he first became involved with ''[[National Review]]'' he did not know if he was a conservative, calling himself a [[distributism|distributionist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives|author=John B. Judis|year=1990|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-671-69593-2|page=158|quote=Wills&amp;nbsp;... did not know whether he was a conservative (he called himself a 'distributionist')}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he was self-admittedly conservative, being regarded for a time as the "token conservative" for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' and writing a book entitled ''Confessions of a Conservative''.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt;

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by his coverage of both [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]]s, Wills became increasingly liberal. His biography of president [[Richard M. Nixon]], ''Nixon Agonistes'' (1970) landed him on the [[master list of Nixon political opponents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enemieslist.info/enemy.php?ID=wills&amp;submit=Search|title=Nixon's Enemies List Search Results|website=www.enemieslist.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], but declared two years later that Obama's presidency had been a "terrible disappointment".
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kurutz |first=Steven |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/10/20/garry-wills-on-bill-buckley-obamas-failures-and-the-tea-party-circus/ |title='Garry Wills on Obama 'Disappointment' and the Tea Party 'Zoo' |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Wills wrote an article about the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. It was originally entitled "Why We Have No Right to Bear Arms", but that was not Wills's conclusion. He neither wrote the title nor approved it prior to the article's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1995/nov/16/to-keep-and-bear-arms-an-exchange/ |title='To Keep and Bear Arms: An Exchange' |publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] | quote= 'I had no knowledge of the misleading cover title "Why We Have No Right to Bear Arms" before I read with dismay the printed issue. Of course the Amendment states a right that "we" do possess – but we possess it, as the Amendment itself says, in a "well-regulated militia." |date=November 16, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Wills argued that the Second Amendment refers to the [[right to keep and bear arms]] in a military context only, rather than justifying private ownership and use of guns. Furthermore, he said the military context did not entail the right of individuals to overthrow the government of the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Standard Model finds, squirrelled away in the Second Amendment, not only a private right to own guns for any purpose but a public right to oppose with arms the government of the United States. It grounds this claim in the right of insurrection, which clearly does exist whenever tyranny exists. Yet the right to ''overthrow'' the government is not given by government. It arises when government no longer has any authority. One cannot say one rebels by right of that nonexistent authority. Modern militias say the government itself instructs them to overthrow government – and wacky scholars endorse this view. They think the Constitution is so deranged a document that it brands as the greatest crime a war upon itself (in Article III: 'Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them...') and then instructs its citizens to take this up (in the Second Amendment). According to this doctrine, a well-regulated group is meant to overthrow its own regulator, and a soldier swearing to obey orders is disqualified from true militia virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Public appraisal==
''[[The New York Times]]'' literary critic [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] said in 1970 that Wills "reads like a combination of [[H. L. Mencken]], [[John Locke]] and [[Albert Camus]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Leonard| first=John| authorlink=John Leonard (critic) | title=Books of the Times: Mr. Nixon as the Last Liberal| work= Review of ''Nixon Agonistes'' | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/01/reviews/wills-nixon.html | publisher=The New York Times| date= October 15, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic journalist [[John L. Allen Jr.]] considers Wills to be "perhaps the most distinguished Catholic intellectual in America over the last 50 years" ({{as of|2008|lc=y}}).&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; [[Martin Gardner]] in "The Strange Case of Garry Wills" states there is a "mystery and strangeness that hovers like a gray fog over everything Wills has written about his faith".&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gardner |first=Martin |title=Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries? |publisher=W.W. Norton |year =2003 |isbn =0-393-05742-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Geodesy}}
[[File:Long geodesic on an oblate ellipsoid.svg|thumb|200px|A geodesic on an oblate ellipsoid]]
The study of '''geodesics on an ellipsoid''' arose in connection with [[geodesy]]
specifically with the solution of [[triangulation network]]s.  The
[[figure of the Earth]] is well approximated by an
''[[oblate ellipsoid]]'', a slightly flattened sphere.  A ''[[geodesic]]''
is the shortest path between two points on a curved surface, i.e., the analogue
of a [[straight line]] on a plane surface.  The solution of a triangulation
network on an ellipsoid is therefore a set of exercises in spheroidal
trigonometry {{harv|Euler|1755}}.

If the Earth is treated as a [[sphere]], the geodesics are
[[great circles]] (all of which are closed) and the problems reduce to
ones in [[spherical trigonometry]].  However, {{harvtxt|Newton|1687}}
showed that the effect of the rotation of the Earth results in its
resembling a slightly oblate ellipsoid and, in this case, the
[[equator]] and the [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] are the only simple
closed geodesics.  Furthermore, the shortest path between two points on
the equator does not necessarily run along the equator.  Finally, if the
ellipsoid is further perturbed to become a [[triaxial ellipsoid]] (with
three distinct semi-axes), only three geodesics are closed.

== Geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution ==
There are several ways of defining geodesics
{{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952|pp=220–221}}.  A simple definition
is as the shortest path between two points on a surface.  However, it is
frequently more useful to define them as paths with zero
[[geodesic curvature]]—i.e., the analogue of [[straight lines]] on a
curved surface.  This definition encompasses geodesics traveling so far
across the ellipsoid's surface (somewhat more than half the
circumference) that other distinct routes require less distance.
Locally, these geodesics are still identical to the shortest distance
between two points.

By the end of the 18th century, an ellipsoid of revolution (the term
[[spheroid]] is also used) was a well-accepted approximation to the
[[figure of the Earth]].  The adjustment of [[triangulation network]]s
entailed reducing all the measurements to a [[reference ellipsoid]] and
solving the resulting two-dimensional problem as an exercise in
spheroidal trigonometry {{harv|Bomford|1952|loc=Chap. 3}}
{{harv|Leick et al.|2015|loc=§4.5}}.

[[File:Geodesic problem on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|right|
Fig. 1.
A geodesic ''AB'' on an ellipsoid of revolution.  ''N'' is the north
pole and ''EFH'' lie on the equator.]]
It is possible to reduce the various geodesic problems into one of two
types.  Consider two points: {{math|''A''}} at latitude
{{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and longitude {{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and
{{math|''B''}} at latitude {{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and longitude
{{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (see Fig.  1).  The connecting geodesic
(from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}}) is {{math|''AB''}}, of length
{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which has [[azimuth]]s {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the two endpoints.{{refn|
Here {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the ''forward'' azimuth at {{math|''B''}}.
Some authors calculate the ''back'' azimuth instead; this is given by
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;plusmn; &amp;pi;}}.}}  The two geodesic problems usually
considered are:
# the ''direct geodesic problem'' or ''first geodesic problem'', given {{math|''A''}}, {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, determine {{math|''B''}} and {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}};
# the ''inverse geodesic problem'' or ''second geodesic problem'', given {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, determine {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, these problems involve solving the triangle
{{math|''NAB''}} given one angle, {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} for the direct
problem and {{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} for the
inverse problem, and its two adjacent sides.
For a sphere the solutions to these problems are simple exercises in
[[spherical trigonometry]], whose solution is given by
[[Solution of triangles#Two sides and the included angle given|formulas
for solving a spherical triangle]].
(See the article on [[great-circle navigation]].)

For an ellipsoid of revolution, the characteristic constant defining the
geodesic was found by {{harvtxt|Clairaut|1735}}.  A
systematic solution for the paths of geodesics was given by
{{harvtxt|Legendre|1806}} and
{{harvtxt|Oriani|1806}} (and subsequent papers in
[[#{{harvid|Oriani|1808|}}|1808]] and
[[#{{harvid|Oriani|1810|}}|1810]]).
The full solution for the direct problem (complete with computational
tables and a worked out example) is given by {{harvtxt|Bessel|1825}}.

During the 18th century geodesics were typically referred to as "shortest
lines".
The term "geodesic line" was coined by {{harvtxt|Laplace|1799b}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nous désignerons cette ligne sous le nom de ''ligne géodésique'' [We
will call this line the ''geodesic line''].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This terminology was introduced into English either as "geodesic line"
or as "geodetic line", for example {{harv|Hutton|1811}},
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A line traced in the manner we have now been describing, or deduced from
trigonometrical measures, by the means we have indicated, is called
a ''geodetic'' or ''geodesic line:'' it has the property of being
the shortest which can be drawn between its two extremities on the
surface of the Earth; and it is therefore the proper itinerary
measure of the distance between those two points.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In its adoption by other fields "geodesic line", frequently shortened
to "geodesic", was preferred.

This section treats the problem on an ellipsoid of revolution (both
oblate and prolate).  The problem on a triaxial ellipsoid is covered in
the next section.

}}

Here the equations for a geodesic are developed; the
derivation closely follows that of {{harvtxt|Bessel|1825}}.
{{harvtxt|Jordan|Eggert|1941}},
{{harvtxt|Bagratuni|1962|loc=§15}},
{{harvtxt|Gan'shin|1967|loc=Chap. 5}},
{{harvtxt|Krakiwsky|Thomson|1974|loc=§4}},
{{harvtxt|Rapp|1993|loc=§1.2}},
{{harvtxt|Jekeli|2012}}, and
{{harvtxt|Borre|Strang|2012}} also provide derivations of these
equations.

Consider an ellipsoid of revolution with equatorial radius
{{math|''a''}} and polar semi-axis {{math|''b''}}.  Define the
flattening {{math|''f'' {{=}} (''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'')/''a''}}, the eccentricity
{{math|''e'' {{=}} {{radical|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}/''a'' {{=}} {{radical|''f''(2 &amp;minus; ''f'')}}}}, and the second
eccentricity {{math|''e''&amp;prime; {{=}} {{radical|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}/''b'' {{=}} ''e''/(1 &amp;minus; ''f'')}}.  (In most
applications in geodesy, the ellipsoid is taken to be oblate,
{{math|''a'' &amp;gt; ''b''}}; however, the theory
applies without change to prolate ellipsoids, {{math|''a'' &amp;lt; ''b''}}, in
which case {{math|''f''}}, {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''e''&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} are
negative.)

Let an elementary segment of a path on the ellipsoid have length
{{math|''ds''}}.  From Figs. 2 and 3, we
see that if its azimuth is {{math|&amp;alpha;}}, then {{math|''ds''}}
is related to {{math|''d''&amp;phi;}} and {{math|''d''&amp;lambda;}} by
:(1)&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad
\cos\alpha\,ds = \rho\,d\varphi = - dR/\sin\varphi, \quad
\sin\alpha\,ds = R\,d\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;rho;}} is the
[[Earth radius#Meridional|meridional radius of curvature]],
{{math|''R'' {{=}} &amp;nu; cos&amp;phi;}} is the radius of the circle of latitude
{{math|&amp;phi;}}, and {{math|&amp;nu;}} is the
[[Earth radius#Prime vertical|normal radius of curvature]].
The elementary segment is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \rho^2\,d\varphi^2 + R^2\,d\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}ds &amp;= \sqrt{\rho^2\varphi'^2 + R^2}\,d\lambda \\
&amp;\equiv L(\varphi,\varphi')\,d\lambda,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;phi;&amp;prime; {{=}} ''d''&amp;phi;/''d''&amp;lambda;}} and the
[[Lagrangian_mechanics#Euler–Lagrange equations and Hamilton's principle|
Lagrangian function {{math|''L''}}]] depends on
{{math|&amp;phi;}} through {{math|&amp;rho;(&amp;phi;)}} and
{{math|''R''(&amp;phi;)}}.  The length of an arbitrary path between
{{math|(&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{math|(&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is
given by
:&lt;math&gt; s_{12} =
\int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} L(\varphi, \varphi')\,d\lambda,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;phi;}} is a function of {{math|&amp;lambda;}} satisfying
{{math|&amp;phi;(&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and
{{math|&amp;phi;(&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The shortest path or geodesic
entails finding that function {{math|&amp;phi;(&amp;lambda;)}} which minimizes
{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This is an exercise in the
[[calculus of variations]] and the minimizing condition is given by the
[[Beltrami identity]],
:&lt;math&gt;L - \varphi' \frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi'} = \text{const.}
&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting for {{math|''L''}} and using Eqs. (1) gives
:&lt;math&gt;R\sin\alpha = \text{const.}&lt;/math&gt;
{{harvtxt|Clairaut|1735}} found this [[Clairaut's relation|relation]],
using a geometrical construction; a similar derivation is presented by
{{harvtxt|Lyusternik|1964|loc=§10}}.{{refn|
{{harvtxt|Laplace|1799a}} showed that a particle constrained to move on
a surface but otherwise subject to no forces moves along a geodesic for
that surface.  Thus, Clairaut's relation is just a consequence of
[[conservation of angular momentum]] for a particle on a surface of
revolution.}}  Differentiating this
relation gives
:&lt;math&gt;d\alpha=\sin\varphi\,d\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;
This, together with Eqs. (1), leads to a system of
[[ordinary differential equations]] for a geodesic
:&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad\displaystyle
\frac{d\varphi}{ds} = \frac{\cos\alpha}{\rho};\quad
\frac{d\lambda}{ds} = \frac{\sin\alpha}{\nu\cos\varphi};\quad
\frac{d\alpha}{ds} = \frac{\tan\varphi\sin\alpha}{\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;
We can express {{math|''R''}} in terms of the
[[Latitude#Reduced (or parametric) latitude|parametric latitude]],
{{math|&amp;beta;}},
using
:&lt;math&gt;R = a\cos\beta,&lt;/math&gt;
and Clairaut's
relation then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha_1\cos\beta_1 = \sin\alpha_2\cos\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Spherical trigonometry#Sine rules|sine rule]] of spherical
trigonometry relating two sides of the triangle {{math|''NAB''}} (see
Fig. 4), {{math|''NA'' {{=}} {{frac|1|2}}&amp;pi; &amp;minus; &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and

corresponding quantities for the ellipsoid shown in parentheses.
Quantities without subscripts refer to the arbitrary point
{{math|''P''}}; {{math|''E''}}, the point at which the geodesic crosses
the equator in the northward direction, is used as the origin for
{{math|&amp;sigma;}}, {{math|''s''}} and {{math|&amp;omega;}}.

[[File:Differential element of a geodesic on a sphere.svg|thumb|
Fig. 6.
Differential element of a geodesic on a sphere.]]
If the side {{math|''EP''}} is extended by
moving {{math|''P''}} infinitesimally (see Fig. 6), we
obtain
:(2)&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad
\cos\alpha\,d\sigma = d\beta, \quad
\sin\alpha\,d\sigma = \cos\beta\,d\omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2) gives differential
equations for {{math|''s''}} and {{math|&amp;lambda;}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac1a\frac{ds}{d\sigma}
= \frac{d\lambda}{d\omega}
= \frac{\sin\beta}{\sin\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between {{math|&amp;beta;}} and {{math|&amp;phi;}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\tan\beta = \sqrt{1-e^2} \tan\varphi = (1-f) \tan\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\beta}{\sin\varphi} = \sqrt{1-e^2\cos^2\beta},&lt;/math&gt;
so that the differential equations for the geodesic become
:&lt;math&gt;\frac1a\frac{ds}{d\sigma} = \frac{d\lambda}{d\omega}
= \sqrt{1-e^2\cos^2\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

The last step is to use {{math|&amp;sigma;}} as the independent
parameter in both of
these differential equations and thereby to express {{math|''s''}} and
{{math|&amp;lambda;}} as integrals.  Applying the sine rule to the vertices
{{math|''E''}} and {{math|''G''}} in the spherical triangle
{{math|''EGP''}} in Fig. 5 gives
:&lt;math&gt;\sin\beta = \sin\beta(\sigma;\alpha_0) =
\cos\alpha_0 \sin\sigma,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the azimuth at {{math|''E''}}.
Substituting this into the equation for {{math|''ds''/''d''&amp;sigma;}} and
integrating the result gives
:(3)&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad
\frac sb = \int_0^\sigma \sqrt{1 + k^2 \sin^2\sigma'}\,d\sigma',
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;k = e'\cos\alpha_0,&lt;/math&gt;
and the limits on the integral are chosen so that
{{math|''s''(&amp;sigma; {{=}} 0) {{=}} 0}}.  {{harvtxt|Legendre|1811|p=180}} pointed out
that the equation for {{math|''s''}} is the same as the equation for the
[[Meridian arc#Meridian distance on the ellipsoid|arc on an ellipse]]
with semi-axes {{math|''b''{{radical|1 + ''e''&amp;prime;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} and
{{math|''b''}}.  In order to express the equation for
{{math|&amp;lambda;}} in terms of {{math|&amp;sigma;}}, we write
:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = \frac{\sin\alpha_0}{\cos^2\beta}\,d\sigma,&lt;/math&gt;
which follows from Eq. (2) and Clairaut's relation.
This yields
:(4)&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad
\lambda - \lambda_0 = \omega - f\sin\alpha_0
\int_0^\sigma\frac
{2-f}{1 + (1-f)\sqrt{1 + k^2\sin^2\sigma'}}
\,d\sigma',
&lt;/math&gt;
and the limits on the integrals are chosen
so that {{math|&amp;lambda; {{=}} &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at the equator crossing,
{{math|&amp;sigma; {{=}} 0}}.

This completes the solution of the path of a geodesic using the
auxiliary sphere.  By this device a great circle can be mapped exactly
to a geodesic on an ellipsoid of revolution.

There are also several ways of approximating geodesics on a terrestrial
ellipsoid (with small flattening) {{harv|Rapp|1991|loc=§6}}; some of
these are described in the article on [[geographical distance]].
However, these are typically comparable in complexity to the method for
the exact solution {{harv|Jekeli|2012|loc=§2.1.4}}.

=== Behavior of geodesics ===
[[File:Closed geodesics on an ellipsoid of revolution.svg|thumb|
Fig. 7.  Meridians and the equator are the only closed
geodesics.  (For the very flattened ellipsoids, there are other closed
geodesics; see Figs. 11 and 12).]]

|header=Geodesic on an oblate ellipsoid ({{math|''f'' {{=}} {{frac|50}}}}) with {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|45|u=deg}}}}.

[[File:Long geodesic on a prolate ellipsoid.svg|thumb|

Geodesic on a prolate ellipsoid ({{math|''f'' {{=}} &amp;minus;{{frac|50}}}}) with
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|45|u=deg}}}}.  Compare with
Fig. 8.]]
Fig. 7 shows the simple closed geodesics which consist of the
meridians (green) and the equator (red).  (Here the qualification
"simple" means that the geodesic closes on itself without an intervening
self-intersection.)  This follows from the equations for the geodesics
given in the previous section.

All other geodesics are typified by Figs. 8 and 9
which show a geodesic starting on the equator with
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 45&amp;deg;}}.  The geodesic oscillates about the equator.
The equatorial crossings are called ''nodes'' and the
points of maximum or minimum latitude are called ''vertices''; the
vertex latitudes are given by
{{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;plusmn;({{frac|1|2}}&amp;pi; &amp;minus; {{!}}&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}})}}.
The geodesic completes one full oscillation in
latitude before the longitude has increased by {{val|360|u=deg}}.
Thus, on each successive northward crossing of the equator (see
Fig. 8), {{math|&amp;lambda;}} falls short of a full circuit of
the equator by approximately {{math|2&amp;pi; ''f'' sin&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (for a
prolate ellipsoid, this quantity is negative and {{math|&amp;lambda;}}
completes more that a full circuit; see Fig. 10).  For nearly all
values of {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the geodesic will fill that portion of
the ellipsoid between the two vertex latitudes (see
Fig. 9).

If the ellipsoid is sufficiently oblate, i.e.,
{{math|''b''/''a'' &amp;lt; {{frac|1|2}}}}, another class of simple closed geodesics is
possible {{harv|Klingenberg|1982|loc=§3.5.19}}.  Two such geodesics
are illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12.  Here
{{math|''b''/''a'' {{=}} {{frac|2|7}}}} and the equatorial azimuth,
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for the green (resp. blue) geodesic is chosen to
be {{val|53.175|u=deg}} (resp. {{val|75.192|u=deg}}), so that the
geodesic completes 2 (resp. 3) complete oscillations about the equator
on one circuit of the ellipsoid.

{{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|-30|u=deg}}}};
geodesic circles are shown in green and the cut locus in red.]]
Fig.
13 shows geodesics (in blue) emanating
{{math|''A''}} with {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} a multiple of
{{val|15|u=deg}} up to the point at which they cease to be shortest
paths.  (The flattening has been increased to
{{frac|10}} in order to accentuate the ellipsoidal effects.)
Also shown (in green) are curves of constant {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}},
which are the geodesic circles centered {{math|''A''}}.
{{harvtxt|Gauss|1828}} showed that, on any surface, geodesics and
geodesic circle intersect at right angles.  The red line is the
[[cut locus]], the locus of points which have multiple (two in this
case) shortest geodesics from {{math|''A''}}.  On a sphere, the cut
locus is a point.  On an oblate ellipsoid (shown here), it is a segment
of the circle of latitude centered on the point [[antipodes|antipodal]]
to {{math|''A''}}, {{math|&amp;phi; {{=}} &amp;minus;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The longitudinal
extent of cut locus is approximately
{{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; [&amp;pi; &amp;minus; ''f'' &amp;pi; cos&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;pi; + ''f'' &amp;pi; cos&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.  If
{{math|''A''}} lies on the equator, {{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, this relation
is exact and as a consequence the equator is only a shortest geodesic if
{{math|{{!}}&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} &amp;le; (1 &amp;minus; ''f'')&amp;pi;}}.  For a prolate
ellipsoid, the cut locus is a segment of the anti-meridian centered on
the point antipodal to {{math|''A''}}, {{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;pi;}},
and this means that
meridional geodesics stop being shortest paths before the antipodal
point is reached.

=== Solution of the direct and inverse problems ===
Solving the geodesic problems entails mapping the geodesic onto the
auxiliary sphere and solving the corresponding problem in
[[great-circle navigation]].
When solving the
"elementary" spherical triangle for {{math|''NEP''}} in Fig.
5,
[[Spherical trigonometry#Napier's rules for quadrantal triangles|
Napier's rules for quadrantal triangles]] can be employed,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin\alpha_0 &amp;= \sin\alpha \cos\beta = \tan\omega \cot\sigma, \\
\cos\sigma &amp;= \cos\beta \cos\omega  = \tan\alpha_0 \cot\alpha, \\
\cos\alpha &amp;= \cos\omega \cos\alpha_0 = \cot\sigma \tan\beta, \\
\sin\beta &amp;= \cos\alpha_0 \sin\sigma = \cot\alpha \tan\omega, \\
\sin\omega &amp;= \sin\sigma \sin\alpha = \tan\beta \tan\alpha_0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The mapping of the geodesic involves evaluating the
integrals for the distance, {{math|''s''}}, and the longitude,
{{math|&amp;lambda;}}, Eqs. (3) and (4) and these depend on
the parameter {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Handling the direct problem is straightforward, because
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be determined directly from the given
quantities {{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In the case of the inverse problem, {{math|&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given;
this cannot be easily related to the equivalent spherical angle
{{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} because {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is unknown.
Thus, the solution of the problem requires that {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be
found iteratively.

In geodetic applications, where {{math|''f''}} is small, the integrals
are typically evaluated as a series {{harv|Legendre|1806}}
{{harv|Oriani|1806}} {{harv|Bessel|1825}} {{harv|Helmert|1880}}
{{harv|Rainsford|1955}} {{harv|Rapp|1993}}.  For arbitrary
{{math|''f''}}, the integrals (3) and (4) can be found by
numerical quadrature or by expressing them in terms of
[[elliptic integrals]] {{harv|Legendre|1806}} {{harv|Cayley|1870}}.

{{harvtxt|Vincenty|1975}} provides solutions for the direct and inverse
problems; these are based on a series expansion carried out to third
order in the flattening and provide an accuracy of about
{{val|0.1|u=mm}} for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid; however the inverse method
fails to converge for nearly antipodal points.  {{harvtxt|Karney|2013}}
continues the expansions to sixth order which suffices to provide full
[[double precision]] accuracy for
{{math|{{!}}''f''{{!}} &amp;le; {{frac|1|50}}}} and improves the solution of
the inverse problem so that it converges in all cases.
{{harvtxt|Karney|2013|loc=addendum}} extends the method to use elliptic
integrals which can be applied to ellipsoids with arbitrary flattening.

=== Differential properties of geodesics ===
Various problems involving geodesics require knowing their behavior
when they are perturbed.  This is useful in trigonometric adjustments
{{harv|Ehlert|1993}},
determining the physical properties of signals which follow geodesics,
etc.  Consider a reference geodesic, parameterized by {{math|''s''}},
and a second geodesic a small
distance {{math|''t''(''s'')}} away from it.  {{harvtxt|Gauss|1828}} showed that
{{math|''t''(''s'')}} obeys the
[[Differential geometry of surfaces#Gauss–Jacobi equation|
Gauss-Jacobi equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}.}\qquad
\displaystyle\frac{d^2t(s)}{ds^2} = K(s) t(s), &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Definition of reduced length and geodesic scale.svg|thumb|
Fig. 14.
Definition of reduced length and geodesic scale.]]
where {{math|''K''(''s'')}} is the [[Gaussian curvature]] at {{math|''s''}}.
As a second order, linear, homogeneous differential equation,
its solution may be expressed as the sum of two independent solutions
:&lt;math&gt; t(s_2) = C m(s_1,s_2) + D M(s_1,s_2) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m(s_1, s_1) &amp;= 0, \quad
\left.\frac{dm(s_1,s_2)}{ds_2}\right|_{s_2 = s_1} = 1, \\
M(s_1, s_1) &amp;= 1, \quad
\left.\frac{dM(s_1,s_2)}{ds_2}\right|_{s_2 = s_1} = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The quantity {{math|''m''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the so-called
''reduced length'', and {{math|''M''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the
''geodesic scale''.{{refn|
{{harvtxt|Bagratuni|1962|loc=§17}} uses the term "coefficient of
convergence of ordinates" for the geodesic scale.}}
Their basic definitions are illustrated in
Fig. 14.

The
[[Ellipsoid of revolution#Curvature|Gaussian curvature for an ellipsoid of revolution]]
is
:&lt;math&gt;
K = \frac1{\rho\nu} = \frac{(1-e^2\sin^2\varphi)^2}{b^2}
  = \frac{b^2}{a^4(1-e^2\cos^2\beta)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
{{harvtxt|Helmert|1880|loc=Eq. (6.5.1.)}} solved the Gauss-Jacobi
equation for this case enabling {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} and
{{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be expressed as integrals.

As we see from Fig. 14 (top sub-figure), the separation of two
geodesics starting at the same point with azimuths differing by
{{math|''d''&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  On a closed
surface such as an ellipsoid, {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} oscillates
about zero.  The point at
which {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} becomes zero is the point
[[conjugate point|conjugate]] to the starting point.  In order
for a geodesic between {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, of length
{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to be a shortest path it must satisfy the
Jacobi condition {{harv|Jacobi|1837}} {{harv|Jacobi|1866|loc=§6}}
{{harv|Forsyth|1927|loc=§§26–27}}
{{harv|Bliss|1916}}, that there is
no point conjugate to {{math|''A''}} between {{math|''A''}} and
{{math|''B''}}.  If this condition is not satisfied, then there is a
''nearby'' path (not necessarily a geodesic) which is shorter.  Thus,
the Jacobi condition is a local property of the geodesic and is only a
necessary condition for the geodesic being a global shortest path.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for a geodesic being the shortest
path are:
* for an oblate ellipsoid, {{math|{{!}}&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} &amp;le; &amp;pi;}};
* for a prolate ellipsoid, {{math|{{!}}&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} &amp;le; &amp;pi;}}, if {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0}}; if {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, the supplemental condition {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 0}} is required if {{math|{{!}}&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}} {{=}} &amp;pi;}}.

=== Envelope of geodesics ===

|header=Geodesics from a single point ({{math|''f'' {{=}} {{frac|10}}}}, {{math|&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|-30|u=deg}}}})
}}

The geodesics from a particular point {{math|''A''}} if continued
past the cut locus form an envelope illustrated in Fig. 15.
Here the geodesics for which {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a multiple of
{{val|3|u=deg}} are shown in light blue.  (The geodesics are only
shown for their first passage close to the antipodal point, not for
subsequent ones.)  Some geodesic circles are shown in green; these form
cusps on the envelope.  The cut locus is shown in red.  The envelope is
the locus of points which are conjugate to {{math|''A''}}; points on the
envelope may be computed by finding the point at which
{{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} on a geodesic.
{{harvtxt|Jacobi|1891}} calls this star-like figure
produced by the envelope an [[astroid]].

Outside the astroid two geodesics intersect at each point; thus there
are two geodesics (with a length approximately half the
circumference of the ellipsoid) between {{math|''A''}} and these points.
This corresponds to the situation on the sphere where there are "short"
and "long" routes on a great circle between two points.  Inside the
astroid four geodesics intersect at each point.  Four such geodesics are
shown in Fig. 16 where the geodesics are numbered in order of
increasing length.  (This figure uses the same position for
{{math|''A''}} as Fig. 13 and is drawn in the same projection.)
The two shorter geodesics are ''stable'', i.e., {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0}},
so that there is no nearby path connecting the two points which is
shorter; the other two are unstable.  Only the shortest line (the first
one) has {{math|&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; &amp;pi;}}.  All the geodesics are tangent
to the envelope which is shown in green in the figure.

The astroid is the (exterior) [[evolute]] of the geodesic circles
centered at {{math|''A''}}.  Likewise, the geodesic circles are
[[involute]]s of the astroid.

=== Area of a geodesic polygon ===
A ''geodesic polygon'' is a polygon whose sides are geodesics.  The area of
such a polygon may be found by first computing the area between a
geodesic segment and the equator, i.e., the area of the quadrilateral
{{math|''AFHB''}} in Fig. 1 {{harv|Danielsen|1989}}.  Once this
area is known, the area of a polygon may be computed by summing the
contributions from all the edges of the polygon.

Here an expression for the area {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''AFHB''}}
is developed following {{harvtxt|Sjöberg|2006}}.  The area of any closed
region of the ellipsoid is
:&lt;math&gt; T = \int dT = \int \frac1K \cos\varphi\,d\varphi\,d\lambda,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''dT''}} is an element of surface area and {{math|''K''}}
is the [[Gaussian curvature]].  Now the
[[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] applied to a geodesic polygon states
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = \int K \,dT = \int \cos\varphi\,d\varphi\,d\lambda,
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma = 2\pi - \sum_j \theta_j
&lt;/math&gt;
is the geodesic excess and {{math|&amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the exterior angle at
vertex {{math|''j''}}.  Multiplying the equation for {{math|&amp;Gamma;}}
by {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the
[[Earth radius#Authalic radius|authalic radius]], and subtracting this
from the equation for {{math|''T''}} gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T &amp;=
R_2^2 \,\Gamma + \int \biggl(\frac1K - R_2^2\biggr)\cos\varphi\,d\varphi\,d\lambda \\
&amp;=R_2^2 \,\Gamma + \int \biggl(
\frac{b^2}{(1 - e^2\sin^2\varphi)^2} - R_2^2
\biggr)\cos\varphi\,d\varphi\,d\lambda,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Spheroid#Curvature|value of {{math|''K''}} for an ellipsoid]]
has been substituted.
Applying this formula to the quadrilateral {{math|''AFHB''}}, noting
that {{math|&amp;Gamma; {{=}} &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and performing
the integral over {{math|&amp;phi;}} gives
:&lt;math&gt;
S_{12}=R_2^2 (\alpha_2-\alpha_1)
+ b^2 \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} \biggl(
\frac1{2(1 - e^2\sin^2\varphi)}+
\frac{\tanh^{-1}(e \sin\varphi)}{2e \sin\varphi}
- \frac{R_2^2}{b^2}\biggr)\sin\varphi
\,d\lambda,
&lt;/math&gt;
where the integral is over the geodesic line (so that {{math|&amp;phi;}}
is implicitly a function of {{math|&amp;lambda;}}).
The integral can be expressed as a series valid for small {{math|''f''}}
{{harv|Danielsen|1989}} {{harv|Karney|2013|loc=§6 and addendum}}.

The area of a geodesic polygon is given by summing {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}
over its edges.  This result holds provided that the polygon does not
include a pole; if it does {{math|2&amp;pi; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be added to the
sum.   If the edges are specified by their vertices, then a
[[Spherical excess|convenient expression]]
for te geodesic excess {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is
:&lt;math&gt;
\tan\frac{E_{12}}2 =
\frac{\sin\tfrac12 (\beta_2 + \beta_1)}
{\cos\tfrac12 (\beta_2 - \beta_1)} \tan\frac{\omega_{12}}2.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid ==
Solving the geodesic problem for an ellipsoid of revolution is, from the
mathematical point of view, relatively simple: because of symmetry,
geodesics have a constant of the motion, given by Clairaut's relation
allowing the problem to be reduced to
[[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]].  By the early 19th century
(with the work of Legendre, [[Barnaba Oriani|Oriani]], Bessel, et al.),
there was a complete understanding of the properties of geodesics on an
ellipsoid of revolution.

On the other hand, geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid (with three unequal
axes) have no obvious constant of the motion and thus represented a
challenging "unsolved" problem in the first half of the 19th
century.  In a remarkable paper, {{harvtxt|Jacobi|1839}} discovered a
constant of the motion allowing this problem to be reduced to quadrature
also {{harv|Klingenberg|1982|loc=§3.5}}.{{refn|

=== The triaxial coordinate system ===
Consider the ellipsoid defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
  h = \frac{X^2}{a^2} + \frac{Y^2}{b^2} + \frac{Z^2}{c^2} = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|(''X'',''Y'',''Z'')}} are Cartesian coordinates centered on the
ellipsoid and, without loss of generality,
{{math|''a'' &amp;ge; ''b'' &amp;ge; ''c'' &amp;gt; 0}}.{{refn|1=
This notation for the semi-axes is incompatible with that used in the
previous section on ellipsoids of revolution in which {{math|''a''}} and
{{math|''b''}} stood for the equatorial radius and polar semi-axis.
Thus the corresponding inequalities are {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''a'' &amp;ge; ''b'' &amp;gt; 0}} for
an oblate ellipsoid and {{math|''b'' &amp;ge; ''a'' {{=}} ''a'' &amp;gt; 0}} for a prolate
ellipsoid.}}
{{harvtxt|Jacobi|1866|loc=§§26–27}}
employed the ''ellipsoidal'' latitude and longitude
{{math|(&amp;beta;, &amp;omega;)}} defined by
[[File:Triaxial ellipsoid coordinate system.svg|thumb|
Fig. 17.
[[Ellipsoidal coordinates]].]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  X &amp;= a \cos\omega
      \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2\sin^2\beta - c^2\cos^2\beta}}
           {\sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}, \\
  Y &amp;= b \cos\beta \sin\omega, \\
  Z &amp;= c \sin\beta
      \frac{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2\omega + b^2\cos^2\omega - c^2}}
           {\sqrt{a^2 - c^2}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In the limit {{math|''b'' &amp;rarr; ''a''}}, {{math|&amp;beta;}}
becomes the parametric latitude for an oblate ellipsoid, so the use of
the symbol {{math|&amp;beta;}} is consistent with the previous sections.
However, {{math|&amp;omega;}} is ''different'' from the spherical
longitude defined above.{{refn|
The limit {{math|''b'' &amp;rarr; ''c''}} gives a prolate ellipsoid with
{{math|&amp;omega;}} playing the role of the parametric latitude.}}

Grid lines of constant {{math|&amp;beta;}} (in blue) and
{{math|&amp;omega;}} (in green) are given in Fig. 17.  These
constitute an [[orthogonal]] coordinate system: the
grid lines intersect at right angles.  The principal sections of the
ellipsoid, defined by {{math|''X'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''Z'' {{=}} 0}} are shown in
red.  The third principal section, {{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}}, is covered by the
lines {{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;plusmn;90&amp;deg;}} and {{math|&amp;omega; {{=}} 0&amp;deg;}} or
{{math|&amp;plusmn;180&amp;deg;}}.  These lines meet at four
[[umbilical point]]s (two of which are visible in this figure) where the
[[principal curvature|principal radii of curvature]] are equal.  Here
and in the other figures in this section the parameters of the ellipsoid
are {{math|''a'':''b'':''c'' {{=}} 1.01:1:0.8}}, and it is viewed in an orthographic
projection from a point above {{math|&amp;phi; {{=}} 40&amp;deg;}},
{{math|&amp;lambda; {{=}} 30&amp;deg;}}.

The grid lines of the ellipsoidal coordinates may be interpreted in three
different ways:
# They are "lines of curvature" on the ellipsoid: they are parallel to the directions of principal curvature {{harv|Monge|1796}}.
# They are also intersections of the ellipsoid with [[confocal ellipsoidal coordinates|confocal systems of hyperboloids of one and two sheets]] {{harv|Dupin|1813|loc = [https://books.google.com/books?id=j40AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA297 Part 5]}}.
# Finally they are geodesic ellipses and hyperbolas defined using two adjacent umbilical points {{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952|p=188}}.  For example, the lines of constant {{math|&amp;beta;}} in Fig. 17 can be generated with the familiar [[Gardener's ellipse|string construction for ellipses]] with the ends of the string pinned to the two umbilical points.

=== Jacobi's solution ===
Jacobi showed that the geodesic equations, expressed in ellipsoidal
coordinates, are separable.  Here is how he recounted his discovery to
his friend and neighbor Bessel {{harv|Jacobi|1839|loc=Letter to Bessel}},
&lt;blockquote&gt; The day before yesterday, I reduced to quadrature the problem of geodesic lines on an ''ellipsoid with three unequal axes''.  They are the simplest formulas in the world, [[Abelian integral]]s, which become the well known elliptic integrals if 2 axes are set equal.&lt;br&gt;
[[Königsberg]], 28th Dec. '38.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The solution given by Jacobi {{harv|Jacobi|1839}}
{{harv|Jacobi|1866|loc=§28}} is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\delta &amp;= \int \frac
{\sqrt{b^2\sin^2\beta + c^2\cos^2\beta}\,d\beta}
{\sqrt{a^2 - b^2\sin^2\beta - c^2\cos^2\beta}
 \sqrt{(b^2-c^2)\cos^2\beta - \gamma}} \\[6pt]
&amp;\quad -
\int \frac
{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2\omega + b^2\cos^2\omega}\,d\omega}
{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2\omega + b^2\cos^2\omega - c^2}
 \sqrt{(a^2-b^2)\sin^2\omega + \gamma}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
As Jacobi notes &amp;quot;a function of the angle {{math|&amp;beta;}} equals
a function of the angle {{math|&amp;omega;}}.  These two functions are
just Abelian integrals&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;  Two constants {{math|&amp;delta;}} and
{{math|&amp;gamma;}} appear in the solution.  Typically
{{math|&amp;delta;}} is zero if the lower limits of the integrals are
taken to be the starting point of the geodesic and the direction of the
geodesics is determined by {{math|&amp;gamma;}}.  However, for geodesics
that start at an umbilical points, we have {{math|&amp;gamma; {{=}} 0}} and
{{math|&amp;delta;}} determines the direction at the umbilical point.
The constant {{math|&amp;gamma;}} may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma = (b^2-c^2)\cos^2\beta\sin^2\alpha-(a^2-b^2)\sin^2\omega\cos^2\alpha,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;alpha;}} is the angle the geodesic makes with lines of
constant {{math|&amp;omega;}}. In the limit {{math|''b'' &amp;rarr; ''a''}},
this reduces to {{math|sin&amp;alpha; cos&amp;beta; {{=}} const.}}, the
familiar Clairaut relation.  A derivation of Jacobi's result is
given by {{harvtxt|Darboux|1894|loc=§§583–584}}; he
gives the solution found by {{harvtxt|Liouville|1846}} for general quadratic
surfaces.

=== Survey of triaxial geodesics ===

}}
On a triaxial ellipsoid, there are only three simple closed geodesics, the
three principal sections of the ellipsoid given by {{math|''X'' {{=}} 0}},
{{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}}, and {{math|''Z'' {{=}} 0}}.{{refn|
If {{math|''c''/''a'' &amp;lt; {{frac|1|2}}}}, there are other simple closed geodesics
similar to those shown in Figs. 11 and 12
{{harv|Klingenberg|1982|loc=§3.5.19}}.}}
To survey the other geodesics, it is convenient to consider geodesics
that intersect the middle principal section, {{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}}, at right
angles.  Such geodesics are shown in Figs. 18–22,
which use the same ellipsoid parameters and the same viewing direction
as Fig. 17.  In addition, the three principal ellipses are shown
in red in each of these figures.

If the starting point is {{math|&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; (&amp;minus;90&amp;deg;, 90&amp;deg;)}},
{{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, and {{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 90&amp;deg;}}, then
{{math|&amp;gamma; &amp;gt; 0}} and the
geodesic encircles the ellipsoid in a "circumpolar" sense.  The geodesic
oscillates north and south of the equator; on each oscillation it
completes slightly less than a full circuit around the ellipsoid
resulting, in the typical case, in the geodesic filling the area bounded
by the two latitude lines {{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;plusmn;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Two examples
are given in Figs. 18 and 19.  Figure 18 shows
practically the same behavior as for an oblate ellipsoid of revolution
(because {{math|''a'' &amp;asymp; ''b''}}); compare to Fig. 9.
However, if the starting point is at a higher latitude (Fig. 18)
the distortions resulting from {{math|''a'' &amp;ne; ''b''}} are evident.  All
tangents to a circumpolar geodesic touch the confocal single-sheeted
hyperboloid which intersects the ellipsoid at {{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
{{harv|Chasles|1846}}
{{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952|pp=223–224}}.

}}
If the starting point is {{math|&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 90&amp;deg;}},
{{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; (0&amp;deg;, 180&amp;deg;)}}, and
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 180&amp;deg;}}, then
{{math|&amp;gamma; &amp;lt; 0}} and the geodesic encircles the ellipsoid
in a "transpolar" sense.  The geodesic oscillates east and west of the
ellipse {{math|''X'' {{=}} 0}}; on each oscillation it completes slightly more
than a full circuit around the ellipsoid.  In the typical case, this results
in the geodesic filling the area bounded by the two longitude lines
{{math|&amp;omega; {{=}} &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&amp;omega; {{=}} 180&amp;deg; &amp;minus; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
If {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}, all meridians are geodesics; the effect of
{{math|''a'' &amp;ne; ''b''}} causes such geodesics to oscillate east and west.
Two examples are given in Figs. 20 and 21.  The constriction
of the geodesic near the pole disappears in the limit
{{math|''b'' &amp;rarr; ''c''}}; in this case, the ellipsoid becomes a
prolate ellipsoid and Fig. 20 would resemble Fig. 10
(rotated on its side).  All tangents to a transpolar geodesic touch the
confocal double-sheeted hyperboloid which intersects the ellipsoid at
{{math|&amp;omega; {{=}} &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

{{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|0|u=deg}}}},
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|135|u=deg}}}}.]]
If the starting point is {{math|&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 90&amp;deg;}},
{{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0&amp;deg;}} (an umbilical point), and
{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 135&amp;deg;}} (the geodesic leaves the ellipse
{{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}} at right angles), then
{{math|&amp;gamma; {{=}} 0}} and the geodesic repeatedly
intersects the opposite umbilical point and returns to its starting
point.  However, on each circuit the angle at which it intersects
{{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}} becomes closer to {{val|0|u=deg}} or
{{val|180|u=deg}} so that asymptotically the geodesic lies on the
ellipse {{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}} {{harv|Hart|1849}} {{harv|Arnold|1989|p=265}},
as shown in Fig. 22.  A single geodesic does not
fill an area on the ellipsoid.  All tangents to umbilical geodesics
touch the confocal hyperbola that intersects the ellipsoid at the
umbilic points.

Umbilical geodesic enjoy several interesting properties.
* Through any point on the ellipsoid, there are two umbilical geodesics.
* The geodesic distance between opposite umbilical points is the same regardless of the initial direction of the geodesic.
* Whereas the closed geodesics on the ellipses {{math|''X'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''Z'' {{=}} 0}} are stable (an geodesic initially close to and nearly parallel to the ellipse remains close to the ellipse), the closed geodesic on the ellipse {{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}}, which goes through all 4 umbilical points, is ''exponentially unstable''.  If it is perturbed, it will swing out of the plane {{math|''Y'' {{=}} 0}} and flip around before returning to close to the plane.  (This behavior may repeat depending on the nature of the initial perturbation.)

If the starting point {{math|''A''}} of a geodesic is not an umbilical
point, its envelope is an astroid with two cusps lying on
{{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;minus;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the other two on
{{math|&amp;omega; {{=}} &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;pi;}}.  The cut locus
for {{math|''A''}} is the portion
of the line {{math|&amp;beta; {{=}} &amp;minus;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} between the cusps.

== Applications ==
The direct and inverse geodesic problems no longer play the central role
in geodesy that they once did.  Instead of solving
[[adjustment of observations|adjustment]] of [[geodetic networks]] as a
two-dimensional problem in spheroidal trigonometry, these problems are
now solved by three-dimensional methods {{harv|Vincenty|Bowring|1978}}.
Nevertheless, terrestrial geodesics still play an important role in
several areas:
* for measuring distances and areas in [[geographic information systems]];
* the definition of [[maritime boundaries]] {{harv|UNCLOS|2006}};
* in the rules of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for area navigation {{harv|RNAV|2007}};
* the method of measuring distances in the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] Sporting Code {{harv|FAI|2018}}.

By the [[principle of least action]], many problems in physics can be
formulated as a variational problem similar to that for geodesics.  Indeed,
the geodesic problem is equivalent to the motion of a particle
constrained to move on the surface, but otherwise subject to no forces
{{harv|Laplace|1799a}} {{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952|p=222}}.
For this reason,
geodesics on simple surfaces such as ellipsoids of revolution or
triaxial ellipsoids are frequently used as "test cases" for exploring new
methods.  Examples include:
* the development of elliptic integrals {{harv|Legendre|1811}} and [[elliptic functions]] {{harv|Weierstrass|1861}};
* the development of differential geometry {{harv|Gauss|1828}} {{harv|Christoffel|1869}};
* methods for solving systems of differential equations by a change of independent variables {{harv|Jacobi|1839}};
* the study of [[caustic (optics)|caustics]] {{harv|Jacobi|1891}};
* investigations into the number and stability of periodic orbits {{harv|Poincaré|1905}};
* in the limit {{math|''c'' &amp;rarr; 0}}, geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid reduce to a case of [[dynamical billiards]];
* extensions to an arbitrary number of dimensions {{harv|Knörrer|1980}};
* geodesic flow on a surface {{harv|Berger|2010|loc=Chap. 12}}.

'''Giving Tuesday''', often stylized as &lt;nowiki&gt;#GivingTuesday&lt;/nowiki&gt; for purposes of [[hashtag activism]], refers to the [[Tuesday]] after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]] in the United States. It is a movement {{clarify|date=November 2018}} to create an international day of charitable giving at the beginning of the [[Christmas and holiday season]]. Giving Tuesday was started in 2012 by the [[92nd Street Y]] and the [[United Nations Foundation]] as a response to commercialization and consumerism in the post-Thanksgiving season ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Cyber Monday]]). If Thanksgiving is on November 22, 23, 24, or 25, it will fall in November but if it is on November 26, 27, or 28, it will fall in December. The date range is November 27 to December 3, and is always five days after the holiday.&lt;ref name=mashable-announcement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/10/23/giving-tuesday-skype-cisco/|title = 6 Inspiring Organizations Joining in &lt;nowiki&gt;#GivingTuesday&lt;/nowiki&gt;|last = Fox|first = Zoe|date = October 23, 2012|accessdate = February 15, 2014|publisher = [[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=community-about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.givingtuesday.org/Page/About |title=: About |publisher=Giving Tuesday |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225113736/http://community.givingtuesday.org/Page/About |archivedate=February 25, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Templeton Foundation]] released a study based on a survey of Americans that showed that whereas 93% of respondents were familiar with [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], only 18% were familiar with Giving Tuesday, showing that the day still had a long way to go in terms of achieving name recognition.&lt;ref name=templeton-chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url = https://philanthropy.com/article/Study-Few-Consumers-Familiar/234323|title = Study: Few Consumers Familiar With Giving Tuesday|last = Stiffman|first = Eden|date = November 23, 2015|accessdate = November 28, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/18-percent-of-americans-familiar-with-giving-tuesday-survey-finds|title = 18 Percent of Americans Familiar With 'Giving Tuesday', Survey Finds|publisher = ''Philanthropy News Digest''|date = November 26, 2015|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, organizers were optimistic about continued growth in money moved, volunteering, and name recognition for the day, and payment processors and retailers offered donation matching and incentive schemes to encourage people to donate on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/giving-tuesday-after-the-turkey-and-before-the-mall-time-to-give/|title = In case you haven't heard, charity has a day too|last = Gibson|first = Kate|date = November 26, 2015|accessdate = November 28, 2015|publisher = ''[[CBS News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/11/28/annual-giving-tuesday-strives-to-keep-growing.html|publisher = ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]''|title = Annual Giving Tuesday strives to keep growing |last = Price|first = Rita|date = November 28, 2015|accessdate = November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Blackbaud supplied data to show real-time statistics on an online dashboard to highlight the impact of #GivingTuesday.&lt;ref name="Post and Courier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prang|first1=Allison|title=Charleston tech firm Blackbaud helps out with #GivingTuesday|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20151130/PC05/151139934/1010/charleston-tech-firm-blackbaud-helps-out-with-givingtuesday|website=Post and Courier|publisher=Post and Courier|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facebook]]'s principal founder and CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and his wife Priscilla Chan published an open letter to their newborn daughter, announcing their intention to donate 99%+ of Zuckerberg's wealth from his Facebook shares through the newly formed [[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative]].

Matching was limited to $1,000 per fundraiser and $50,000 per nonprofit.&lt;ref name=techcrunch-fb-2017&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/the-gates-foundation-is-matching-2m-in-donations-on-facebook-for-givingtuesday/|title = Facebook and The Gates Foundation are matching $2M in donations for #GivingTuesday|last = Tepper|first = Jake|date = November 28, 2017|accessdate = December 1, 2017|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/facebook-gates-to-match-up-to-2-million-for-givingtuesday|title = Facebook, Gates to Match Up to $2 Million for #GivingTuesday|date = October 27, 2017|accessdate = December 1, 2017|publisher = Philanthropy News Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; $45 million was raised by nonprofits through Facebook fundraisers on Giving Tuesday, well above the $2 million matching limit.&lt;ref name=qz-fb-2017&gt;{{cite web|url = https://qz.com/1141658/facebook-is-dropping-its-fundraising-fees-for-non-profits-but-not-for-personal-causes/|title = Facebook is dropping its fundraising fees for nonprofits, but not for personal causes|last = Kozlowska|first = Hanna|publisher = Quartz|date = November 29, 2017|accessdate = December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wxyz-fb-2017&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wxyz.com/lifestyle/people-donated-45m-to-nonprofits-via-facebook-on-giving-tuesday|title = People donated $45M to nonprofits via Facebook on Giving Tuesday|publisher = WXYZ Detroit via Scripps National Desk|date = November 29, 2017|accessdate = December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Giving Tuesday 2018, Facebook and PayPal announced donation matching for up to $7 million in donations to United States nonprofits starting 8:00 EST on Giving Tuesday, on a first-come-first-serve basis, up to $20,000 per donor and $250,000 per nonprofit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/help/332488213787105|title = What is Facebook doing for #GivingTuesday 2018?|accessdate = December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.paypal.com/stories/us/paypal-facebook-partner-to-match-donations-on-giving-tuesday|title = PayPal &amp; Facebook Partner to Match Donations on Giving Tuesday|date = November 14, 2018|accessdate = December 2, 2018|publisher = PayPal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match limit was hit by 9:05 EST (about one hour after the beginning of matching).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/facebook-and-paypal-matches-quickly-hit-limit/|title = Facebook and PayPal Matches Quickly Hit Limit|last = Hrywna|first = Mark|date = November 27, 2018|accessdate = December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of $125 million was raised via Facebook on Giving Tuesday, the highest for a single day on the platform.&lt;ref name=npt-2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=fast-company-2018/&gt;

Total donations on Giving Tuesday were estimated to be nearly $400 million in the United States alone, according to tentative estimates.&lt;ref name=variety-2018/&gt;

==Reception==

Reception of Giving Tuesday has generally been positive, with a large number of organizations, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Skype]], [[Cisco]], [[UNICEF]], the [[Case Foundation]], [http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8858189/k.4773/Giving_Tuesday_at_Save_the_Children.htm Save the Children], and others joining in as partners.&lt;ref name=partners&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingtuesday.org/category/newsfeed/meet-our-partners/|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;#GivingTuesday&lt;/nowiki&gt;: Partners|date = February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving Tuesday has been praised as an antithesis of consumer culture and as a way for people to give back.&lt;ref name="deseretnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name=charitynavigator&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1651#.UwAkC4XJ1Xo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029144154/http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1651#.UwAkC4XJ1Xo|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 29, 2013|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;#GivingTuesday&lt;/nowiki&gt;: A Day of Giving Back|date = October 24, 2013|accessdate = February 15, 2014|publisher = [[Charity Navigator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Giving-Tuesday-Shows-Robust/143375/|title = Giving Tuesday Shows Robust Results|last = Flandez|first = Raymund|last2 =  Frostenson|first2 = Sarah|publisher = ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''|date = December 4, 2013|accessdate = February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Ogden, managing director of the [[Financial Access Initiative]] at [[New York University]] and board member at [[effective altruism]] organization [[GiveWell]], wrote articles for the [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]] skeptical of Giving Tuesday, one in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_curmudgeons_guide_to_giving_tuesday|title = The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Giving Tuesday: The effort to make giving public and start a "giving season" won’t materially affect giving in any positive way.|date = November 26, 2012|accessdate = February 15, 2014|last = Ogden|first = Timothy|publisher = [[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/what_exactly_is_giving_tuesdays_theory_of_change|title = What, Exactly, Is Giving Tuesday’s Theory of Change?

''[[Inside Philanthropy]]'' attributed Giving Tuesday's growing success and global reach to the role that technology companies and founders played in promoting the event, including the $5 million matching grant to [[GiveDirectly]] announced by [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]]'s foundation [[Good Ventures]] and the $75,000 in matching funds announced by former [[AOL]] CEO [[Steve Case]] for donations made to charities supported [http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8858189/k.4773/Giving_Tuesday_at_Save_the_Children.htm by] his organization.&lt;ref name=inside-philanthropy-tech&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/12/4/how-tech-philanthropy-propelled-giving-tuesday.html|title = How Tech Philanthropy Propelled Giving Tuesday|last = Gentilucci|first = Michael|date = December 4, 2013|accessdate = December 1, 2015|publisher = ''[[Inside Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2015 article in ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]'' discussed Giving Tuesday in the context of giving days in general. Giving Tuesday was described as a federated, multi-platform campaign, that involved many different nonprofits and many donation processing platforms, all focusing on a single day so that they could coordinate efforts to raise awareness and publicity. It was contrasted with the [[Give to the Max Day]] in [[Minnesota]], that involved many nonprofit participants but used a single donation processor every year to allow for better tracking of the money moved.&lt;ref name=npq-giving-days&gt;{{cite web|url = https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/20/giving-days-structures-model-crowdfunding-givingtuesday/|title = The Giving Days Model: Collaboration, Federation, or Unification?|last= Boland|first = Steve|date = January 20, 2015|accessdate = December 1, 2015|publisher = ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gore Effect''' or '''Al Gore Effect''' refers to a perceived connection between occurrences of unseasonably cold weather and some events associated with [[global warming]] activism, particularly those attended by former [[Vice President of the United States]] and [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name="Lovely_2008-11-25_Politico" /&gt; 

== Usage ==
Citing the [[crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] ''[[Urban Dictionary]]'', Peter Scowan of the ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'' reported the term as "the phenomenon that leads to unseasonably cold temperatures, driving rain, hail, or snow whenever Al Gore visits an area to discuss global warming".&lt;ref name="Scowen_2007-02-17_GlobeMail" /&gt; Erika Lovely of [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] described it as occurring when "a global warming-related event, or appearance by...Al Gore, is marked by exceedingly cold weather or unseasonably winter weather".&lt;ref name="Lovely_2008-11-25_Politico" /&gt; The phenomenon was reportedly first observed in January 2004 when a speech by Gore to a global warming rally held in New York City met extremely cold winter weather;&lt;ref name="Warren_2008-11-02_OttawaCitizen" /&gt; according to [[Andrew Bolt]] after another Gore speech took place on a strikingly cold day in Boston in the same year.&lt;ref name="Bolt_2008-11-26_HeraldSun" /&gt; "[[Climate skeptic]]s" use the term "half-seriously" in relation to the weather conditions at global warming venues.&lt;ref name="Lovely_2008-11-25_Politico" /&gt; German authors Daniel Rettig and Jochen Mai described the effect in 2012 in a popular science book about psychological mechanisms and memes, but referred to it as [[selective perception]].&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Ich denke, also spinn ich: Warum wir uns oft anders verhalten, als wir wollen, Daniel Rettig, Jochen Mai, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 2012, Chapter Gore effect, p. 47 ff [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ppNC-iAs2UC&amp;pg&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage Online], reception of the book see [http://www.alltagsforschung.de/uber-mich/ich-denke-also-spinn-ich/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] meteorologist [[Rob Marciano]] describes use of the effect as a mere [[in-joke]] among weather forecasters: "in the weather community, we kind of joke about it. It's just a bad timing. Every time there's some big weather climate conference, there seems to be a cold outbreak. ... But, globally, we are still warming."&lt;ref name="2010-01-05_CNN" /&gt;

Curtis Brainard of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' has called coverage of the Gore Effect "asinine", noting the distinction between short-term weather and long-term climate,&lt;ref name="Brainard" /&gt; while [[Steve Benen]] of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' called focus on the claim "insulting".&lt;ref name="Benen_2008-11-25_WahingtonMonthly" /&gt; Michael Daly criticized "delight in noting coincidences between events relating to [Gore's] favorite subject and severe winter weather."&lt;ref name="nydaily"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Gore Effect brings snow to New York City |first=Michael |last=Daly |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/12/20/2009-12-20_if_gore_traveled_the_world_everything_would_be_cool.html |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalist A. Siegel has called the jokes a "shallow observation" from "those who don't get that weather isn't climate".&lt;ref name="Siegel_2009-03-02_HuffingtonPost" /&gt; Phenomena attributed to the Gore Effect are "chalked up as coincidence", according to Joe Joyce, a weather forecaster and environmental reporter.&lt;ref name="Joyce_2009-03-04_weathernewengland" /&gt; [[Media Matters for America]] quoted [[Patrick J. Michaels]], a skeptical climatologist and commentator with the [[libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] in Washington with the observation that "the predictable distortion of extreme weather goes in both directions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714173956/http://fairvaluesforamerica.com/research/200912180013 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url=http://fairvaluesforamerica.com/research/200912180013 |title=Right-wing media seize on snow at Copenhagen conference to deem climate change a 'fraud' |date=December 18, 2009 |publisher=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalee Kreider, a spokesperson for Gore, told Erika Lovely: "As amusing as this little study sounds, we don’t think it should distract us from the reality."&lt;ref name="Lovely_2008-11-25_Politico" /&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Harry Potter'' in translation}}
[[File:RIAN archive 168852 The seventh book about Harry Potter goes on sale.jpg|thumb|The Russian translation of ''The Deathly Hallows'' goes on sale in [[Moscow]], 2007]]

The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of fantasy novels by [[J. K. Rowling]] is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most translated series of all time]], with the first book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', having been translated into over 74 languages. This includes languages diverse as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as well as the dead languages [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. This makes it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of [[Heliodorus of Emesa]] in the 3rd century AD. Additionally, regional adaptations of the books have been made to accommodate regional dialects such as the [[American English]] edition or the [[Valencian]] adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

For reasons of secrecy, translations were only allowed to begin after each book had been published in English, creating a lag of several months for readers of other languages. Impatient fans in many places simply bought the book in English instead. In France in 2003 the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', became the first book in English to top the French best-seller list. Another response to this, and unavailability in certain languages, has been fans creating their own translations unofficially.

Interesting issues arising in the translation of ''Harry Potter'' include cultural references, riddles, anticipating future plot points, and Rowling's creative names for characters and other elements in the magical world which often involve wordplay and descriptive phonology.

== Translation process ==
For an authorised translation, the publisher must first negotiate and sign a contract with the author's agents, The Blair Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/links_cl.cfm |title=J. K. Rowling Official Site |publisher=Jkrowling.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208173515/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/links_cl.cfm |archive-date=8 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of authorised publishers can be read on J. K. Rowling’s website. The publishers select translators locally.

Translators were not granted access to the books before their official release date in English; hence, translation could start only after the English editions had been published, creating a lag of several months before the translations were made available. This necessary delay has boosted the sales of English language editions of the books to impatient fans, in countries where English is not the first language. Such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English edition became the first English-language book ever to top the bookseller list in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3036000/3036350.stm|publisher=BBC|title=OOTP is best seller in France – in English!|date=1 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, impatient Potter fans organised "Operation Feather", deluging the publisher Salani with feathers (reminiscent of Hogwarts' messenger owls) to demand expedited publication for the Italian translation of the seventh and final book in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article2645098.ece |title=Who won the race to translate 'Harry Potter'? review &amp;#124; Children's Books – Times Online |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd. |date= 2007-10-12|accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Adam |last2=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also caused unauthorised translations and fake versions of the books to appear in many countries.

The high profile and demand for a high-quality local translation means that a great deal of care is often taken in the task. In some countries, such as Italy, the first book was revised by the publishers and issued in an updated edition in response to readers who complained about the quality of the first translation. In countries such as China and Portugal, the translation is conducted by a group of translators working together to save time. Some of the translators hired to work on the books were quite well known before their work on Harry Potter, such as [[Viktor Golyshev]], who oversaw the [[Russian language|Russian]] translation of the series' fifth book. Golyshev was previously best known for having translated [[William Faulkner]] and [[George Orwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translating Harry — Part I: The Language of Magic|author=Steven Goldstein|url=http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|work=GlobalByDesign|year=2004|accessdate=2007-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306025320/http://www.globalbydesign.com/resources/articles/translating_harry_potter_part1.html|archivedate=6 March 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to snub the Harry Potter books in interviews and refer to them as inferior literature. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translation of books two to five was undertaken by [[Sevin Okyay]], a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not lost in translation: Harry Potter in Turkish|author=Emrah Güler|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171135/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of official translations ==
Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into. As best as can be determined (as of 2018), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 75&lt;ref name="potterglot_list"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.potterglot.net/the-list/|title=The List|publisher=PotterGlot|date=|accessdate=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; other languages, the most recent being Hawaiian, in August 2018, preceded by Scots,{{#tag:ref|This should not be confused with the long-ago planned [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] translation, initially scheduled for release in December 2006 but which was delayed indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpana.com/news.17417.html |title=News: Potter translated to Scots Gaelic |publisher=Hpana.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=3&amp;id=1804362006 |title=Gaelic Harry Potter wait |publisher=Scotsman.com News |date=2006-12-05 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |location=Edinburgh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217110602/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=3 |archivedate=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}&lt;ref name="2017-06-28_Scots_Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jkrowling.com/harry-potter-translated-scots/|title=Harry Potter to be Translated into Scots|publisher=J.K.

Rowling|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017-06-28_Scots_Announcement" /&gt; sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (their count would now likely be 82 with the subsequent 2018 release&lt;ref name="2018-08-23_Hawaiian_PS" /&gt; of Hawaiian, the 2017 release&lt;ref name="2017-11-23_Amazon_Scots" /&gt; of Scots and a new Mongolian translation);&lt;ref name="2017-11-25_HPPS_MON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsudar.mn/books/view/140/|title=Харри Поттер ба Философийн Чулуу - Монсудар|publisher=Монсудар|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it has been argued that number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English.&lt;ref name="potterglot_bloomsbury"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.potterglot.net/bloomsbury-provides-a-number/|title=Bloomsbury Provides a Number!|publisher=PotterGlot|date=2017-01-19|accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language.&lt;ref name="potterglot_list" /&gt; Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Mongolian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (6 languages).&lt;ref name="potterglot_list" /&gt; English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be. Thus: 82 &amp;minus; 1 English &amp;minus; 6 double-translations = 75.&lt;ref name="potterglot_list" /&gt; It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books have been translated into these 75 languages.

The 82 total does not include other linguistically interesting language editions: there have been many regional adaptations of the books to accommodate regional dialects, for example the [[American English]] edition or the [[Valencian]] adaptation of Catalan. There have been transliterations of translations into different scripts ([[English Braille]], [[Serbian Cyrillic]]), there have been major revisions of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] translations and there have been any number of unauthorized translations.&lt;ref name="potterglot_list" /&gt;

The government of [[Kazakhstan]] has ordered a [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] translation of the Harry Potter novels to be made&lt;ref name="KazakhTranslation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/4342/|title=Kazakhstan to translate Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter books into Kazakh language|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=19 February 2012|work=Tengri News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have also ordered a Tajik, Uzbek and Kyrgyz translation.{{Citation needed|reason=no easily identifiable source for this information|date=June 2016}} Thus far translations into these languages have not appeared.

Some translations, such as those to the [[Language death|dead]] Latin and [[Ancient Greek]] languages, were done as academic exercises, to stimulate interest in the languages and to provide students of those languages with modern reading texts. The Ancient Greek version, according to the translator, is the longest text written in Ancient Greek since the novels of [[Heliodorus of Emesa]] in the 3rd century AD, and took about a year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playalicious.com/reference/news/greek_harry.html |title=Harry Potter? It's All Greek to Me |last=Castle |first=Tim |date=2 December 2004|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=28 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119214752/http://playalicious.com/reference/news/greek_harry.html |archivedate= 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in some countries, such as Spain and India, the book has been translated into several local languages (see section on publishers); sometimes the book has been translated into two dialects of the same language in two countries (for example, separate Portuguese versions for Brazil and for Portugal).

== List of translations by language ==
The original [[British English]] versions of the book were published in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. There is no complete official list of authorised translations currently available. Editions exist in the following languages (including the original):

&lt;!--Since the context of this list is written language, not spoken language, using the "macrolanguage" "Chinese" is probably most relevant since the writing system(s) are applicable to multiple spoken languages. Although there is a difference in the writing system of these two translations, the motivation for having multiple translations is probably primarily political not linguistic. For instance, either could have been adapted for the other region without a new translation; in the case of trad-&gt;simplified, almost entirely algorithmically. Therefore, for the purposes of this list, this should be considered two translations into the same language that also happen to use different writing systems. They are separated into two table rows for the sake of legibility since the titles are completely different (in contrast to other dual-translations where there are only slight differences in titles).--&gt;

== Unauthorised translations ==
The impatience of the international Harry Potter fan community for translations of the books has led to the proliferation of unauthorised or [[Copyright infringement|pirate]] translations that are often hastily translated and posted on the internet chapter-by-chapter, or printed by small presses and sold illegally. The work may be done by multiple translators to speed the process. Such translations are often poorly written and filled with errors. Cases have occurred in many areas of the world, but China is one of the most common areas of the world for unauthorised translations and pirated editions to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |title=Online translations of "Harry Potter" draw fire |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504041532/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-08/09/content_6500798.htm |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}also see [[Chinese literature]], bookmarket&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable case involved a French 16-year-old who published serialised translations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' online. He was arrested and his site was later shut down; however, the wife of the official translator noted that these works do not necessarily hurt the official translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/08/france.harrypotter |title=Harry Potter and the boy wizard translator &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=guardian.co.uk, Wednesday 8 August 2007 17.51 BST |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London | date=2007-08-09 | first=Kim | last=Willsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example occurred in Venezuela in 2003, when an illegal translation of the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', appeared soon after the release of the English version and five months before the scheduled release of the Spanish translation. The pirate translation was apparently so bad that the translator added messages, including "Here comes something that I'm unable to translate, sorry," and "I'm sorry, I didn't understand what that meant" in some sections. Two people were arrested in connection with the pirated version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | title = Potter Pirate Sorry for Mistakes | publisher = BBC News | date = 3 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3079032.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another case involved the internet [[fan translation]] community, ''Harry auf Deutsch'', formed to translate the Harry Potter books into German more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harry-auf-deutsch.de/ |title=Harry auf Deutsch :: Projekt-Übersicht der Harry Potter Übersetzung(en) |publisher=Harry-auf-deutsch.de |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German publisher of the Harry Potter books, [[Carlsen Verlag]], filed a [[cease and desist]] against the fan translators; they complied, taking down the translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/906048.stm |title=BBC News &amp;#124; SCI/TECH &amp;#124; Harry Potter and the German pirates |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-12-12 | date=2000-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, when there were no authorised translations into the local language, translations not sanctioned by J. K. Rowling were prepared and published. Such was the case, for example, in [[Sri Lanka]], where the books have been unofficially translated into '''[[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]''' and possibly into '''[[Tamil language|Tamil]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter to fly into Sri Lanka under tight security|author=Dilshani Samaraweera|work=Lanka Business Online|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/fullstory.php?newsID=1862492683&amp;no_view=1&amp;SEARCH_TERM=11|year=2005|accessdate=2007-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620024315/http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/fullstory.php?newsID=1862492683&amp;no_view=1&amp;SEARCH_TERM=11|archivedate=20 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been more recent translations into both Sinhala and Tamil published by Sarasavi Bookshop and Manjul Press respectively that are authorised by J. K. Rowling.&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

In [[Iran]], several unauthorised translations of the Harry Potter books exist side by side. According to one source, there may be as many as 16 Persian translations in existence concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/08/may/1220.html |title=Iranian translators should observe guild's rights: Vida Eslamieh |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is not a member of the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], so publishers are not prosecuted for publishing foreign books without respecting copyright or paying royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran's Potter fans join frenzy over wizard's fate|author=AFP|work=Middle East Times|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20070721-091316-1672r|year=2007|accessdate=2007-07-21}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team consisting of seven [[Esperantist]] volunteers completed the translation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' into [[Esperanto]] (under the title ''Hari Poter kaj la ŝtono de la saĝuloj'') in 2004. Rowling's representatives did not respond to offers from [[Esperanto-USA]] to make the translation available for publication. An on-line petition aimed at raising interest in the Esperanto translation has obtained support from approximately 800 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hp-esperanto.com/?lang=en Help us make an Esperanto Harry Potter!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010051152/http://www.hp-esperanto.com/?lang=en |date=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents representing J. K. Rowling have stated in the past that they cannot and do not intend to prevent individuals from translating Rowling's books for their own personal enjoyment, as long as the results are not made available to the general public.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2003-07-14_nytimes_h_potter.pdf |title=Harry Potter and the Internet Pirates |author=Amy Harmon |date=14 July 2003 |work=NYTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=19 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220094209/http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2003-07-14_nytimes_h_potter.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fake translations ==
{{See also|Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series#International publications}}
Whereas "pirate translations" are unauthorised translations of true Harry Potter books, "fake translations" have also appeared, which are published [[pastiche]]s or [[fan fiction|fanfics]] that a foreign publisher has tried to pass off as the translation of the real book by Rowling. There have been several such books, the most famous of which is probably ''Harry Potter and Bao Zoulong'' which was written and published in China in 2002, before the release of the fifth book in Rowling's series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''.

Other fake Harry Potter books written in Chinese include ''[http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/miscellaneous/ciwawa.html Harry Potter and the Porcelain Doll]'' (哈利・波特与瓷娃娃 or Hālì Bōtè yǔ Cíwáwa), ''Harry Potter and the Golden Turtle'', and ''Harry Potter and the Crystal Vase''.&lt;ref&gt;Leifer, Andrew.

== Regional adaptations ==
It is a common practice within the publishing industry to make minor changes in the text of books written in one region for publication in other regions. For example, there are a number of differences in American and UK English spelling conventions; generally publishers change the spellings to conform to the expectations of their target market. Adaptation may also extend to vocabulary or grammatical choices that might impair legibility or impart some cognitive dissonance. Readers usually wouldn't be aware of the adaptations, but the choice to change the title of the American edition of the first Harry Potter book from ''Harry Potter and the '''Philosopher's''' Stone'' to ''Harry Potter and the '''Sorcerer's''' Stone'' highlighted the practice and drew considerable attention.

The book's title was changed due to the American publisher's concern that children would be confused by a reference to philosophy. Other translations have also changed the first book's title, for instance, the French translation which changed ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' to ''Harry Potter at the School of Wizards'' for the same reason as the American translation, citing that the reference to the Philosopher's Stone legend was "too obscure for a book aimed at the youth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2006/v/n3/013553ar.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other translations also have regional adaptations that have largely gone without much notice. The Spanish translation has been adapted to three regions: Europe, Latin America and [[Southern Cone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.potterglot.net/harry-potter-and-the-spanish-tykes/|title=Harry Potter and the Spanish Tykes|accessdate=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others translations have adaptations that were published seemingly to enhance the identity of minority communities of speakers: [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (an adaptation of [[Serbian language|Serbian]]) and [[Valencian]] (an adaptation of [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). It is worth noting that some translations were completed when adaptations possibly would have been sufficient; for example, any of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] or [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] translations could have been adapted for each region; however, the complexities political and linguistic identity in the region probably precluded that choice.

The [[American English]] adaptations have by far received the most attention. A comprehensive list of differences between the American and British editions of the books is collected at [[the Harry Potter Lexicon]] web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward Olson |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/cs/differences-cs.html |title=HPL: Differences: CS |publisher=Hp-lexicon.org |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect [[American and British English differences|the different dialects]] and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar [[Glossary of British terms not widely used in the United States|Briticism]]s. Although it is common to adapt ''any'' text from British to American editions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html |title=FAST-US-1 Intro to American English Reference File |publisher=Uta.fi |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041313/http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/US1/REF/potter.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;, in the case of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleick | first = Peter H. | title = Harry Potter, Minus a Certain Flavour | publisher = New York Times | date = 10 July 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/specials/rowling-gleick.html | accessdate = 2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the [[Philosopher's Stone]] is a legendary alchemical substance.

In an [[Associated Press]] interview, Rowling described how the alterations to the American editions came about:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rowling pretended to bang her head against the sofa in mock frustration. "SO much has been made of that," she groans, noting that it was only done where words had been used that really meant something very different to Americans. Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea. "He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater,' which is just as British?" That was fine with Rowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Woods | first = Audrey
 | title = Success Stuns Harry Potter Author | agency = Associated Press | date = 6 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Publisher Arthur Levine of [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] explained the changes in an interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't trying to, quote, "Americanize" them... What I was trying to do is translate, which I think is different. I wanted to make sure that an American kid reading the book would have the same literary experience that a British kid would have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Radosh | first = Daniel | title = Why American kids don't consider Harry Potter an insufferable prig | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 20 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same article, however, points out that some British dialect was retained in the books, and in some cases certain phrases were replaced with more stereotypical British phrases, such as "spanking good" for "cracking."

Regional adaptations have sometimes—incorrectly—been referred to as "translations" (as in the quote above); however, the changes in the text of an adaptation do not nearly encompass the scope of a translation. A native speaker generally would not be able to tell the difference between two adaptations without careful reading. A translation requires a translator who will be credited for the work—notably, an adaptation will by performed by an editor probably with the assistance of software and the original translator will remain credited as such.

== Issues in translation ==
The Harry Potter series presents many challenges to translators, such as rhymes, acronyms, dialects, culture, riddles, jokes, invented words, and plot points that revolve around spellings or initials. These have been dealt with by various translators with different degrees of modification to the meaning of the original text.

=== Translation strategies ===
The books carried a number of words that are considered ''loaded names'' by linguists and translators, meaning that they carry a [[semantic]] load, and that their [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (structure) and [[phonology]] (sound) need to be adapted when translating them to a foreign language, for example the house names (Ravenclaw = [[raven]] + [[claw]]), or Voldemort's name ("flight of death" or "theft of death" in French).&lt;ref name="lincoln"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[New Voices in Translation Studies]] | title = Translation of Names in Children’s Fantasy Literature: Bringing the Young Reader into Play | author = Lincoln Fernandes | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090419092822/http://www.iatis.org/newvoices/issues/2006/fernandes-paper-2006.pdf | archivedate = 19 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }} (page 6 on pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; These words were translated in different countries using several translation strategies, such as ''copying'' the names with no attempt to transmit the original English meaning, ''[[transliteration|transliterating]]'' even if the name lost its original meaning, ''replacing'' the name with another given name from the target language, or ''translating'' the name using native words that conveyed the same meaning.&lt;ref name="lincoln" /&gt;&lt;ref name="russian"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Meta Translators' Journal]] | title = From Harry to Garri: Strategies for the Transfer of Culture and Ideology in Russian Translations of Two English Fantasy Stories | author = Judith Inggs | volume = 48 | issue = 1–2 Traduction pour les enfants / Translation for children | date = May 2003 | pages = 285–297 | url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2003/v48/n1-2/006975ar.html | doi=10.7202/006975ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Russian first book the transliterating strategy was used for some names because the "th" sound does not exist in Russian, so "Slytherin" was transliterated as "Slizerin". The translator of the second book chose the translating strategy instead, and she renamed the houses, "Hufflepuff" becoming "Puffendui" and "Ravenclaw" becoming "Kogtevran" (from the Russian word for claw, "kogot'").

=== Culture and language ===
Many of the nuances of British culture and language will be unfamiliar to international readers. Such things require careful and creative translating. Nonstandard English present in the book also had to be given careful consideration. The character [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s [[West Country dialect]], for example, needed to be rendered in other languages to reflect the fact that he speaks with an accent and uses particular types of slang.&lt;ref name="swedishbookreview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedishbookreview.com/old/2002s-gedin.html |title=Translation – Swedish Book Review 2002 Supplement |publisher=Swedishbookreview.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113193027/http://www.swedishbookreview.com/old/2002s-gedin.html |archivedate = 13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Japanese translation, he speaks in the [[Tōhoku dialect]], which to a Japanese reader conveys a similar provincial feel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/rc20030730a2.html 'Potter' makes Tohokuites proud], Masayuki Aihara, Japan Times, 30 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The same was done in Ukrainian translation where Hagrid speaks [[Ukrainian dialects|Western Ukrainian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unian.ua/society/269770-viktor-morozov-zavdyaki-ukrajinskomu-garri-potteru-u-ditey-vidbuvayutsya-mentalni-zmini.html Віктор Морозов: Завдяки українському Гаррі Поттеру у дітей відбуваються ментальні зміни]&lt;/ref&gt; For the Hebrew translation, some of the Christian references were changed, because Israelis have less familiarity with cultural Christianity than readers elsewhere: a scene in which Sirius Black sings a parody of "[[God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen]]" replaced the song with a parody of "[[Hanukkah music#Mi Y'malel|Mi Y'malel]]," a Chanukah song.&lt;ref name="CJN" /&gt; In the French translation, explanations of certain features of British schools unfamiliar to French students were inserted in the dialogues (e.g., "Prefect" and "Head Boy"), but they were not distinguished from explanations in the original text of differences between ordinary British schools and wizarding schools. This could mislead readers into thinking that these features of the house and boarding systems didn't exist in real-world British schools.&lt;ref name="feral"&gt;{{citation |title= The Translator's "Magic" Wand: Harry Potter's Journey from English into French |author= Anne-Lise Feral |work= Translators' Journal |volume= 51 |issue= 3 |year= 2006 |pages= 459–481 |url= http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2006/v51/n3/013553ar.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rhymes, anagrams, and acronyms ===
The series involves many songs, poems, and rhymes, some of which proved difficult to translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Close |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview17 |title=Daniel Hahn: Translating involves art as well as craft |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London | date=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One rhyme, a riddle told by a [[sphinx]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', posed a particular problem.{{#tag:ref|{{cite web |url=http://www.iti.org.uk/pdfs/newPDF/HarryPotter.pdf |title=The Sphinx's Song in 13 Languages |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210034224/http://www.iti.org.uk/pdfs/newPDF/HarryPotter.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-10}}|group="note"}} The riddle involves taking words from a poem and using them to form a longer word, "spider," in answer to the riddle. In the Taiwanese translation, the English words are simply put in parentheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Pringle |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Hpotter/unicode/sphinxriddle.html |title=The Sphinx's Riddle in the CJV translations of Harry Potter (Book 4) |publisher=Cjvlang.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other translations, the riddle is changed to provide different words that can be put together to make up the translated version of "spider".

Some acronyms also proved difficult; the abbreviations "O.W.L.s" (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) and "N.E.W.T.s" (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) needed to be translated to reflect the fact that their abbreviations spelled out the names of animals associated with the wizarding world, which did not always work in other languages. "N.E.W.T.s" was translated into Swedish as "F.U.T.T." (Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls-Test, Terribly Exhausting Wizard's Test). "Futt" means "measly" in Swedish.&lt;ref name="swedishbookreview1" /&gt;

Another issue was the translation of "The Mirror of Erised", since "''Erised''" is created by reading English "desire" backwards. In German the word desire is spelled "Begehren", so the mirror was called "Der Spiegel ''Nerhegeb''". The Finnish translation also follows this formula of reversing a word; the mirror is called "Iseeviot-peili" "iseeviot" being "toiveesi" ("your wish") written backwards. In Polish the mirror is called "Zwierciadło Ain Eingarp" ("zwierciadło" = "mirror"; "pragnienia" = "desire" (in [[genitive case]])). In Indonesian, The Mirror of Erised is called "Cermin Tarsah" (cermin" = "mirror"; "hasrat" = "desire"). In Spanish it is called "El Espejo de Oesed" ("Espejo" = "Mirror"; "Deseo" = "desire"). In the early Italian editions and in the movie, the mirror is called "Specchio delle Brame" ("Mirror of Desires"; Italian name for the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] from ''[[Snow White]]''), later, it was renamed "Specchio delle Emarb" ("Emarb" is "Brame" read backwards), a name based on the English one.

Areas in which anagrams are present do not make the transition easily into other languages. The name "Tom Marvolo Riddle", first mentioned in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', is rearranged to spell "I am Lord Voldemort". This has required translators to alter Riddle's name to make the anagram work. Sometimes translators manage to alter only one part of the name. For example, Tom Riddle's middle name of Marvolo was changed to ''Marvolodemus'' in the Serbian second edition; the first edition had lacked the anagram and the original name ''Tom Marvolo Riddle'' had simply been copied. In the Bulgarian translation his middle name becomes "Mersvoluko" so the whole name forms an anagram for "And here I am, Lord Voldemort" (instead of "I am Lord Voldemort" as in the original English). Analogous alterations of the middle name ''Marvolo'' have been made in several other languages; for example; it became ''Servolo'' in Brazilian Portuguese, ''Vandrolo'' in Hebrew, ''Marvoldo'' in Turkish, ''Vorlost'' in German, ''Narvolo'' in Russian, ''Sorvolo'' in Spanish, ''Rojvol'' in Czech, ''Marvoloso'' in Slovak, and ''Orvoloson'' in Italian. (Note: the original Italian version kept the English name, having Riddle translate the anagram in his speech that immediately follows. The change to ''Orvoloson'' was made in later editions.) In the Latin version his name is ''Tom Musvox Ruddle'', which is an anagram of "Sum Dux Voldemort", or "I am the leader Voldemort".

In other languages, translators replaced the entire name to preserve the anagram. In French, Riddle's full name becomes ''Tom Elvis Jedusor'' (i.e. phonetically "game of fate" for the French "Jeu du sort", wordplay with a phonetically identical "Jet du sort", which means "Casting spell") which forms an anagram for "Je suis Voldemort" ("I am Voldemort"). In Norwegian, his name is ''Tom Dredolo Venster'', an anagram of "Voldemort den store", which means "Voldemort the Great". In Greek, his name is "Anton Marvolo Hurt" (Άντον Μαρβόλο Χέρτ), anagram of "Άρχον Βόλντεμορτ" which means "Lord Voldemort". In Icelandic, his name is ''Trevor Delgome'', which becomes "(Ég)Eg er Voldemort" ("I am Voldemort"), but his middle name is not used for the anagram and stays as Marvolo. In Finnish his name is "Tom Lomen Valedro"; the corresponding anagram is "Ma(ä) olen Voldemort", "I am Voldemort". In Dutch, his name is "Marten Asmodom Vilijn", an anagram of "Mijn naam is Voldemort", or "My name is Voldemort", "Vilijn" being a pseudohomophone of ''vilein'', "evil". In Swedish, his name is "Tom Gus Mervolo Dolder", an anagram of "Ego sum Lord Voldemort", where "ego sum" is Latin, not Swedish, for "I am".

In Slovenian, both names are completely changed. Tom Marvolo Riddle is ''Mark Neelstin'' and Lord Voldemort is translated as ''Lord Mrlakenstein''. When the name Mark Neelstin is rearranged in the scene, it spells Mrlakenstein. Because the books in Slovenia were released with a three-year delay, the translation of Voldemort is consistent throughout the series. The film series corresponds with the book translation.
The Danish translation uses abbreviation and suffix to make the name work. The translation is ''Romeo G. Detlev Jr'' an anagram of "Jeg er Voldemort" ("I am Voldemort").

In Hungarian, Voldemort's name becomes "Tom Rowle Denem", which is an anagram of "Nevem Voldemort" ("My name is Voldemort"), with the "w" in the name becoming two "v"s. This caused a name collision with the character ''Thorfinn Rowle'', who first appears in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', but who is not related to Voldemort. Because of this collision, in the Hungarian translation his family name was altered to Rovel. The Arabic version avoids the issue entirely by having Riddle directly write out, "I am Lord Voldemort" (أنا لورد فولدمورت). These changes to the name created problems in later books however; in the English edition, a line of dialogue mentions that Tom Riddle shares his [[given name]] with the bartender of the [[The Leaky Cauldron (pub)|Leaky Cauldron]], and this becomes a plot point. However, this is not the case in all translations.

=== Invented words, proper nouns, and names ===
Rowling invented a great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and historical references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, ''priori incantatem'' (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would be familiar to many English-speaking readers as the words ''prior'' (previous) and ''incantation'' (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the [[Manjul Publishing House Pvt. Ltd.|Hindi version]], the [[Sanskrit]], typical in [[mantra]]s, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to [[transliteration]].

Names that involve wordplay, such as ''[[Knockturn Alley]]'' and ''[[Pensieve]]'' are also difficult to translate. The former, an unsavoury area in London's magical market, is semi-[[homophone|homophonous]] with "nocturnally," suggesting darkness and evil. The latter is a magical bowl into which memories and thoughts can be placed and examined, and is a [[portmanteau]] of two words: ''pensive'', meaning "musingly or dreamily thoughtful," and ''sieve'', a type of bowl with perforations through which fine particles of a substance (such as flour) may be passed to separate them from coarser ones. Translators must creatively render such names. If the words are simply transliterated, the shades of meaning are lost; but, when new word-games are invented, they can end up sounding quite different from the original, and often reflect the translator's personal interpretation and preferences. For instance, the Turkish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Düşünseli'', which is a portmanteau of the words ''Düşünmek'' (to think, to imagine) and ''sel'' (a flood of water). The German version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Denkarium'', from ''denken'', meaning ''to think'', and the suffix ''-arium''. The Swedish version of ''Pensieve'' is ''Minnessåll'' which means ''memory's sieve''. The Norwegian translation of Pensieve is ''tanketank'' which translates to ''Thought-tank''. The Hebrew version achieves a similar effect to the English in its translation of Pensieve; ''Pensieve'' is הגיגית (''Hagigit''), which is a combination of the word הגיג (''hagig'') meaning ''thought'', and the word גיגית (''gigit'') meaning ''tub''. In the Czech translation, ''Pensieve'' is "''Myslánka''" (from "''myslet''" – think) and ''Knockturn Alley'' is ''Obrtlá ulice'', a rather complex neologism with many meanings and associations, but based on the word "obrtlík" (swivel) and the phrase "otočit se na obrtlíku" (run away suddenly). The "Nocturnal" wordplay is not used in the Czech translation. The Vietnamese version of "Pensieve" is "Tưởng Ký", which is a combination word of "tư tưởng" ("thought" or "mind") and "ký" (literally means something to keep thoughts, like a diary.)

Often, names in Harry Potter have historical or linguistic significance in English, which may create problems if the translator does not recognise or misjudges it. Rowling commented on this phenomenon in ''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', in which she complained that the Italian translation of [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s last name was "Silente"; rather than recognizing that "Dumbledore" was an old [[Devon]] word for "bumblebee," the translator took the word "dumb" and translated it as "silent".&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', Lindsey Fraser, Arthur E. Levine Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Czech translator used the Old Czech word for bumblebee – ''Brumbál'' (in modern Czech ''čmelák'').

=== Plot points ===
In some cases, English-speaking fans have sought clues to the story's mysteries by examining the way certain parts of the books have been translated in foreign editions. A case in point is the identity of a character mentioned by initials only in the book ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. The English initials R.A.B. could have belonged to several minor characters from the books, but variations on the initials in other languages gave evidence to the true identity of the mystery character: in the Dutch edition of the book R.A.B. was translated into R.A.Z., 'zwart' being Dutch for 'black'; in the Norwegian edition, R.A.B. translates to 'R.A.S.', ''svart'' being Norwegian for 'black'; and in the Finnish edition the initials were R.A.M., 'musta' being Finnish for 'black'. Fans took this to mean that the character was [[Regulus Black]], the brother of [[Sirius Black]]; when ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' was published, this was revealed to be the case.

Similarly, the title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' did not make it obvious whether the word "Order" referred to a group of people or to a directive. The information that it was a group of people was then determined by viewing the title in other languages. The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted "Order" as a directive and translated it as "Harry Potter và Mệnh lệnh Phượng hoàng"; when it became clear that "Order" referred to a group of people, the title was changed to "Harry Potter và Hội Phượng hoàng".

Rowling released an alternative title for ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' for use by translators finding difficulty translating its meaning. The alternative title (in English) is ''Harry Potter and the Relics of Death''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugglenet.com/2007/05/swedish-deathly-hallows-translation-may-give-clues/ Swedish Deathly Hallows translation may give clues], Mugglenet, 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the title has been translated as ''Harry Potter e i doni della morte'' replacing "hallows" with "presents" because the word "relic" is often used in reference to the remains or personal effects of a saint. This variation was proposed and then approved by J.K. Rowling. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.badtaste.it/2007/10/01/la-salani-chiede-aiuto-harry-potter-7/333/|title=La Salani chiede aiuto per Harry Potter 7 - BadTaste.it|date=2007-10-01|work=BadTaste.it|access-date=2018-03-08|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character gender ===
A few characters in the series are identified with a title and last name, or with a gender-neutral name. In some languages—for example, those where adjectives are gendered—it was necessary for the translator to guess the character's gender. The Hebrew translation initially made Blaise Zabini a girl, though the character was revealed to be a boy in later books.&lt;ref name="CJN"&gt;[http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2007/10/18/features/arts/aarts1019.txt When Harry’ met Hebrew], Cleveland Jewish News, Sarah Bronson, 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid this problem, Isabel Nunes, the Portuguese translator, asked Rowling about the gender of some of the characters—Zabini, Professor Sinistra, and "R.A.B."—while working on her translations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/story.200610081.html Rumor: Full name of R.A.B. revealed], David Haber, 8 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artemision jockey detail of horse head.jpg|right|thumb|Alternate view]]

The '''Jockey of Artemision''' is a large [[Hellenistic]] [[bronze statue]] of a young boy riding a horse, dated to around 150–140 BC.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Archaeological Museum'', Athens, date the statue to 140 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rare surviving original bronze statue from [[Ancient Greece]] and a rare example in Greek sculpture of a racehorse. Most ancient bronzes were melted down for their raw materials some time after creation, but this one was saved from destruction when it was lost in a shipwreck in antiquity, before being discovered in the twentieth century. It may have been dedicated to the gods by a wealthy person to honour victories in horse races, probably in the single-horse race (Greek: κέλης).&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; The artist is unknown.

==Discovery and display==
The statue was found in a shipwreck off [[Cape Artemision]], in north Euboea, which was discovered in 1926.{{citation required|date=May 2013}} Also found in the wreck were parts of the [[Artemision Bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;"Archaelogical Work In Near East" in [[The Times]], 5 April 1929, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The first parts of the equestrian statue were recovered in 1928, with more pieces found in 1936 and/or 1937.&lt;ref name=BM&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-02-18.html Seán Hemingway, The Horse and Jockey from Artemision: A Bronze Equestrian Monument of the Hellenistic Period.] Review by Janet Burnett Grossman in [[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]], 2005.02.18. Retrieved 29 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GyddJw8P Archived here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nat/&gt; The statue was reassembled, after restoration of the horse's tail and body, and it went on display at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] in 1972.

==Origins==
The original artist and the circumstances under which the work was created are unknown, however, Seán Hemingway has suggested that it may have been plundered from [[Corinth]] in 146 BC by the Roman general [[Mummius]] in the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Achaean War]] and given to [[Attalus II Philadelphus|Attalus]] but lost while in transit to [[Pergamon]].&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

==Design and construction==
The [[equestrian statue]] is approximately life-size, with a length of {{convert|2.9|m|ft}} and {{convert|2.1|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=Nat&gt;[http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/sculpture/hellenistic/hellenistic13-en.html X 15177.] [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], Athens, 2012. Retrieved 29 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GydyMF1n Archived here].&lt;/ref&gt; It was cast in pieces using an indirect [[lost wax]] process and then assembled with [[flow welding]].&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; Some parts are missing, such as the rider's whip and reins, and the horse's bridle. The horse and its rider are rendered realistically, as if captured as the horse springs away in mid-gallop, with its rear feet on the ground and its front legs raised.  The bronze of the rear legs is thicker, indicating that they were the statue's primary means of support.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; The image of the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] is engraved on the horse's right thigh, holding a wreath in raised hands; a brand for racehorses in Ancient Greece.  The horse dwarfs its jockey, a boy only {{convert|84|cm|ft}} tall and perhaps 10 years old, possibly from Africa based on his physiognomy and original black patinated surface colouring. His hairstyle, however, is Greek, suggesting a mixed heritage.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt; He rides [[bareback]] without a saddle.  He wears sandals and a short [[chiton (costume)|chiton]], and looks back over his left shoulder.

The '''Leader of the Opposition''' is a title traditionally held by the leader of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|largest party not in government]] in a [[Westminster System]] of parliamentary government.

He is best remembered for establishing the medical residency programme, taking medical students to the bedside, writing major textbooks&lt;ref name = "Big Four"&gt;[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/history/history5.html Johns Hopkins Medicine: The Four Founding Professors]. Hopkinsmedicine.org. Retrieved on 18 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and whilst in England as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, founding the history of medicine section at the RSM in 1912. [[Raymond Crawfurd]] described him as a “magnet” in attracting members. Undeterred by opposing Sir Richard Douglas Powell who felt the Society had too many sections already, Osler meticulously planned the establishment of the History section, individually writing to more than 160 potential members. He considered the section one of his better achievements in his later years and his wish was for it to be a common meeting place for “scholars, students and all those who feel that the study of the history of medicine has a value in education”.&lt;ref name=":Hunting"/&gt;||

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">{{For|ancient Greek historians|Logographer (history)}}

The title of '''logographer''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|λογογράφος}}, ''logographos'', a compound of {{lang|grc|λόγος}}, ''logos'', 'word', and {{lang|grc|γράφω}}, ''grapho'', 'write') was applied to professional authors of [[court system|judicial]] discourse in [[Ancient Greece]]. The modern term [[speechwriter]] is roughly equivalent.

In the [[Athens]] of [[Ancient Greece|antiquity]], the law required a litigant to make his case in front of the court with two successive speeches. [[Lawyer]]s were unknown, and the law permitted only one friend or relative to aid each party. If a litigant did not feel confident to make his own speech, he would seek the service of a logographer (also called a {{lang|grc|λογοποιός}}, ''logopoios'', from {{lang|grc|ποιέω}}, ''poieo'', 'to make'), to whom he would describe his case. The logographer would then write a speech which the litigant would learn by heart and recite in front of the court. [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]] (480 BC&amp;ndash;410 BC) was among the first to practice this profession; the orator [[Demosthenes]] (384–322) was also a logographer. Practice in defending the targets of politicized prosecutions built the foundations of a later career in politics for many logographers.

==Role of the logographer==
Logographers played a pivotal role in the larger interactions of the Athenian court system. Athenian courts differ from modern examples of legal systems in several significant ways. In Classical Athens, no class of legal experts existed. The absence of [[prosecutor|prosecution]] and defense [[Lawyer|attorneys]] meant cases were decided mainly upon the basis of the speeches given by [[plaintiff]] and [[defendant]]. Litigants were expected to deliver their own speeches in court, but often relied on professional speech writers to craft their words.  To support the arguments made in these speeches, the parties involved in litigation often produced several [[witness]]es. In Classical Athens, the [[social status]], [[wealth]], and esteem of a witness determined the strength and potential impact of his (typically a male's) testimony and not necessarily the accuracy of his account. Unlike in modern legal systems, these "character witnesses" wielded considerable influence over [[jury|juries]]. The Athenian court system was characterized by a lack of state intervention. Pursuing litigation, collecting evidence, and prosecuting were all functions of the legal process left to the responsibility of the litigant. The juries which decided the outcome of these cases were large assemblies of Athenian citizens, not state-appointed judges.

[[File:Manga Example.png|thumb|right|A page from the ''[[Marmalade Boy]]'' manga, volume 1 (Japanese version)]]
{{Anime and manga}}

Japanese [[manga]] has developed its own visual language or [[iconography]] for expressing emotion and other internal character states. This drawing style has also migrated into [[anime]], as many manga stories are adapted into television shows and films. While this article addresses styles from both types of output, the emphasis here is on the manga origins for these styles.

The popular and recognizable style of manga is very distinctive. Emphasis is often placed on line over form, and the storytelling and panel placement differ from those in American comics. Impressionistic backgrounds are very common, as are sequences in which the panel shows details of the setting rather than the characters. Panels and pages are typically read from right to left, consistent with traditional [[Japanese language#Writing system|Japanese writing]].

Because manga is a diverse art form, however, not all manga artists adhere to the conventions most popularized in the West through series such as ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', and ''[[Ranma ½]]''.

==Panel characteristics==

There are several expressive techniques typical (and some of them unique) to the manga art form:

*'''[[Screentone]]:''' Transparent adhesive sheets manufactured with a distinctive pattern (typically, some form of dots or hatching, but also including a variety of flashy effects like stars or explosions, or commonplace scenes such as cityscapes, schoolyards, and natural landscapes), these are cut out and overlapped on the panel to introduce shading and detail that would be time-consuming or unfeasible to draw by hand. Increasingly, physical tone sheets are being replaced by computer-generated equivalents.
*'''Expressive dialogue bubbles:''' The borders of the [[Speech balloon|speech/thought bubbles]] change in pattern/style to reflect the tone and mood of the dialogue. For example, an explosion-shaped bubble for an angry exclamation. Also, manga does not usually follow the normal Western comic conventions for speech (solid arc extending from the character's head) and thought bubble (several small circles used in place of the arc). The latter bubble style is often used for whispered dialogue in manga, which can confuse Western readers.
*'''[[Speed line]]s:''' Often in action sequences, the background will possess an overlay of neatly ruled lines to portray direction of movements. Speed lines can also be applied to characters as a way to emphasise the motion of their bodies (limbs in particular). This style, especially background blurs, extends into most action based anime as well.
*'''Mini flashbacks:''' Many artists employ copies of segments from earlier chapters (sometimes only a single panel) and edit them into the story panels to act as a flashback (also applying an overlay of darker tone to differentiate it from current events). This can be considered a convenient method to evoke prior event(s) along with visual imagery. In situations where a character's life events flash across his/her mind, a splash page may be used with the entire background consisting of segments from earlier chapters.
*'''Abstract background effects:''' These involve elaborate hatching patterns in the background and serve to indicate or strengthen the mood of the plot. It can also illustrate a character's state of mind.

==Facial features==
While the art can be incredibly realistic or cartoonish, characters often have large eyes (female characters usually have larger eyes than male characters), small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces.  Psychological and social research on [[Neoteny|facial attractiveness]] has pointed out that the presence of childlike facial features increases [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_II/Psychologie/Psy_II/beautycheck/english/kindchenschema/kindchenschema.htm|title=Babyfaceness|date=2002-07-15|publisher=www.beautycheck.de and Universität Regensburg|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manga artists often play on this to increase the appeal of protagonists. Large eyes have become a permanent fixture in manga and anime since the 1960s when [[Osamu Tezuka]] was inspired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons from the [[United States]] and started drawing them in this way.

Furthermore, inside the big eyes, the transparent feeling of pupils and the glares, or [[Purkinje images|small reflections]] in the corners of the eyes are often exaggerated, regardless of surrounding lighting, although they are only present in living characters: the eyes of characters who have died are the colour of the iris, but darker. Sometimes this death effect is also used to indicate characters who are emotionless due to trauma or loss of conscious control because of [[spirit possession|possession]] ([[ghost]], [[demon]], [[zombie]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], etc.). In characters with hair partially covering the face, the eyes that would otherwise be covered are often outlined to make them visible, even when the hair is particularly dense and dark.

Certain visual symbols have been developed over the years to become common methods of denoting emotions, physical conditions and mood:

===Eyes===
Eye shape and size can be exaggerated or changed altogether.  Love-hearts and doe-eyes indicate an [[infatuation]], while stars indicate that the character is star-struck.  Spirals indicate confusion or dizziness, while [[flame]]s or wide empty semicircles indicate that the character is angry or vengeful.  When dead, unconscious or stunned, "X"s are sometimes used as an indication of the state. Eyes may be replaced with two "&lt;"s facing in opposite directions to represent a variety of emotions, such as nervousness or excitement.  Eyes without pupils and with reflective glints indicate a state of [[delirium]].

Enlargement of the eyes, where they become huge and perfectly round with tiny pupils and no iris and going beyond the reach of the face (often shown with the mouth becoming like a stretched semicircle, the point of which extends past the chin) symbolises extreme excitement.  Similarly, turning eyes into two thick half-circles, conveys a cute, delighted look (see [[#Character design|Character design]] section below).

The character's eye shapes and sizes are sometimes symbolically used to represent the character. For instance, bigger eyes will usually symbolize beauty, innocence, or purity, while smaller, more narrow eyes typically represent coldness and/or evil. Completely blackened eyes ([[shadow]]ed) indicates a vengeful personality or underlying deep [[anger]]. It could also indicate that someone's being a wise-guy type, particularly when accompanied by grinning. A character's eyes are shadowed regardless of the lighting in the room when they become angry, upset, something is wrong with them, or they are emotionally hurt. Bubbles forming in the corner of a child's or female character's eyes often indicate that the character is about to cry.

===Mouth===

Mouths are often depicted as small, usually rendered with one line on the face.  A fang peeking from the corner of the mouth indicates mischief or feistiness (unless, of course, the character has fangs normally).  A cat mouth (like a number "3" rotated 90° clockwise) replacing the character's normal mouth, and usually accompanied by larger eyes may also represent mischief or feistiness (a notable exception being [[Konata Izumi]] from ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', whose usual mouth shape is this).

===Nose===

Again, noses are often depicted as small, with only a brief L-shaped mark to locate them.  With female characters, the nose can sometimes be removed completely when the character is facing forward.  In profile, female noses are often button shaped, consisting little more than a small triangle.  A nosebleed indicates sexual excitation following exposure to stimulating imagery or situation. It is based on a Japanese [[old wives' tale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html|title=Tanioka Yasuji|last=Van Huffel|first=Peter|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A balloon dangling from one nostril (a "snot bubble") indicates sleep.

===Head and face===

[[File:Anirage-alternate.svg|right|thumb|Cruciform popping veins above eye on the left and large sweat drop above eye on the right]]
Sweat drops are a common visual convention. Characters are drawn with one or more prominent beads of sweat on their brow or forehead (or floating above the hair on characters whose back is turned). This represents a broad spectrum of emotions, including embarrassment, exasperation, confusion, and shock, not all of which are necessarily considered to be sweat-inducing under normal conditions.  Actual physical perspiration in manga is signified by even distribution of sweat drops over the body, occasionally on top of clothing or hair.

Throbbing "cross popping"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins |title=Cross-Popping Veins |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; veins, usually depicted as a cruciform or [[triskelion]] in the upper head region, indicate [[anger]] or [[irritation]].  These shapes can sometimes be exaggerated, and placed on top of hair when the character is facing away from the viewer. Further throbs indicate additional anger. However, some manga such as ''[[Doraemon]]'' use smoke puffs to represent anger, and does not have the vein insignia.

A red cheek or hatchings on the cheek represent [[blushing]], usually used when embarrassed by romantic feelings, while oval "blush dots" on the cheeks represent rosy cheeks. This can sometimes be confused with a scribble on the cheek, indicating injury. Sometimes when the character is expressing strong emotions, such as sadness, a long blush through the nose would appear.

Facial shape changes depending on the character's mood, and can look from round apple-shaped to a more subtle carrot shape.

Parallel vertical lines with dark shading over the head or under the eye may represent mortification, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or horror. If the lines are wavy, they may represent [[disgust]].  A far cuter way to represent frustration/mortification is (mainly for female/young female characters) that they tend to puff out their cheeks while their line is delivered in a gruff voice, an elongated "3" showing puffed lips, to emphasize that puffed look.

Hair colors of anime characters are not just selected randomly. In some cases they express significant elements of that person's character (based on color symbolism in Japan).

* '''[[Black]]''': Power, [[evil]], [[emptiness]], [[sadness]], mystery, [[sophistication]], completeness, [[death]]
* '''[[White]]''': Purity, simplicity, [[peace]], [[humility]], [[cold]], [[heaven]] (can also mean [[death]])
* '''[[Blue]]''': [[Peace]], calm, stability, [[dependability]], [[male]], [[cold]], [[loyalty]]. With dependability, dark blue means more responsible than light blue.
* '''[[Purple]]''': Royalty, [[wisdom]], [[spirituality]]
* '''[[Red]]''': [[passion (emotion)|Passion]], [[joy]], [[aggression]], [[energy]], [[love]] (basically strong emotions)
* '''[[Pink]]''': [[Femininity]], purity, [[child|childlike]], [[love]], [[kindness]]
* '''[[orange (colour)|Orange]]''': [[Energy]], balance, [[enthusiasm]], [[heat|warmth]], seeking attention
* '''[[blond|Blond(e)]]''': [[Wealth]], heaven, childlike, [[courage]]
* '''[[Green]]''': [[luck|Fortune]] (good and bad), [[envy]], harmony, life, vigor, [[tranquility]]
* '''[[silver (colour)|Silver]]/[[grey|Gray]]''': Reliability, [[intelligence]], [[adult|maturity]], [[sadness]], [[boredom]]
* '''[[Brown]]''': [[Comfort]], simplicity, [[endurance]]

==Character design==

To better elicit a more emotional response with the audience for a certain character, a manga artist or animator will sometimes use certain traits in the character's design. The most common features include youthfulness as a physical trait (younger age or pigtails) or as an emotional trait such as a naive or innocent outlook, a childlike personality, or some obvious sympathetic weakness the character works hard to correct (extreme clumsiness or a life-threatening disease) but never really succeeds to get rid of.

Other artistic conventions used in mainstream manga include:

*A round swelling, sometimes drawn to the size of baseballs, is a visual exaggeration of swelling from injury.
*A white cross-shaped bandage symbol denotes pain. (In older manga, eyes pop out to symbolize pain, as shown in ''[[Dragon Ball]]''.)
*Thick black lines around the character may indicate trembling due to anger, shock or astonishment.&lt;ref name="SB200510"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norimi|first=Morisaki|title=How To Draw Manga: Lesson Three|journal=Shojo Beat|date=October 2005|volume=1|issue=4|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually accompanied by a rigid pose or [[super deformed]] styling.
*Sparks literally fly between the eyes of two characters when they are fighting, or simply glaring at each other (in this case, their eyes may also be connected by a lightning streak).
*A character suddenly falling onto the floor, usually with one or more extremities twisted above himself or herself, is a typically humorous reaction to something unexpected happening.
*All facial features shrinking, the nose disappearing, the character sometimes lifting off the floor and the limbs being multiplied as if moving very fast symbolizes panic; if the same but with larger facial features it symbolizes comic rage or shock. Some may come with a yellow spark like symbol near their head.
*Exaggerated facial features signify anger. Examples such as star-like eyes with dark shading surrounding them while the face is framed by a red and black background imply comedic and/or understated rage. Others may include white circular eyes with slanted eyebrows and a square jaw with sharp teeth or even burning eyes with gritted teeth.
*Tear drops everywhere or forming a twin fountain indicate either intense joy or sadness.
*An [[ellipsis]] appearing over a character's head indicates a silence, implying that something is going unsaid.
*A drooping head may indicate sorrow or depression.&lt;ref name=SB200510 /&gt; Some may come with lines drawn of the hunched character or over their eyes. Variations with wavy lines and white circular eyes can imply embarrassment.
*More often than not, character colorisations tend to represent the character in some way. A more subdued character will be coloured with lighter tones, while a flamboyant character will be done in bright tones. Similarly, villains are often coloured in darker tones, while colder characters will be given neutral tones (black, white, grey, etc.).
*Characters push their index fingers together when admitting a secret or telling the truth to another.
*An odd white shape (more often than not, something close to a mushroom) that appears during an exhale represents a sigh of awkward relief or depression.
*A wavy ghost coming out of the mouth is often a comical representation of depression, mortification, or a comedic and figurative death. This is a reference to the [[hitodama]], as is the above example.
*Cherry blossoms indicate a sweet or beautiful moment. This is a reference to [[Mono no aware]].
*A flower blossom falling off its stem may indicate death or, more commonly, loss of [[virginity]].
*Unbound hair may represent freedom, while hair that is tied back may represent some form of either literal, figurative or emotional enslavement of some kind.
*Sleeping people may be indicated by having a bubble coming out of the nose, said bubble inflating and deflating as they snore. This is usually done when the character sleeps at an inappropriate moment (e.g. during class, at work, outside, in public, in an unusual pose or location, etc.).
*Sometimes, when a character screams or is surprised, they will do [[The Scream]] pose.
*Twitching eyebrows or eyelids may indicate anger or shock that the character is holding back.
*[[Negative (photography)|Negative imagery]] or rapidly dilating eyes often indicates either severe shock or a severe psychological effect.
*The image of something cracking or shattering often signifies either death or a serious event.
*Dark shading over the eyes or the eyes' omission while showing the face often suggest a silent or sullen disposition.
*Twinkling or star-like eyes with a smile often signify excitement while heart-shaped eyes imply immediate attraction to someone or something.
* A serious bloody nose (often mimicking a waterfall) often indicates a romantic or infatuated reaction from male characters.
* A character with white eyes, a stern look, and a dark atmosphere around them can imply barely concealed rage at someone or something. 
*Suddenly changing the character's eyes into [[Heart (symbol)|Valentine heart]]s can also indicate that they are madly in love with another character.
*Smoke or steam coming out of the character's nose indicates that the character is aroused.
*When one character sharply criticized or brings up a topic that is quite sensitive to another character, the impact of their words are sometimes symbolically shown by having their word bubble form an arrow that metaphorically pierces the other person they are talking to.

'''Marine art''' or '''maritime art''' is any form of [[figurative art]] (that is, painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture) that portrays or draws its main [[Sea in culture|inspiration from the sea]].  Maritime painting is a genre that depicts ships and the sea—a genre particularly strong from the 17th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary American Marine Art'' by American Society of Marine Artists, Richard V. West, American Society of Marine Artists, Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens, Charles and Emma Frye Art Museum, Published by University of Washington Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-295-97656-X}}, 9780295976563 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIAJAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=marine+art] (accessed Jan. 15, 2009 on Google Book Search)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the term often covers art showing shipping on rivers and estuaries, beach scenes and all art showing boats, without any rigid distinction - for practical reasons subjects that can be drawn or painted from dry land in fact feature strongly in the [[genre]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;"Grove": Cordingley, D., ''Marine art'' in [[Grove Art Online]]. Accessed April 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking "maritime art" should always include some element of human seafaring, whereas "marine art" would also include pure seascapes with no human element, though this distinction may not be observed in practice.

Ships and boats have been included in art from almost the earliest times, but marine art only began to become a distinct genre, with specialized artists, towards the end of the [[Middle Ages]], mostly in the form of the "ship portrait" a type of work that is still popular and concentrates on depicting a single vessel.  As [[landscape art]] emerged during the Renaissance, what might be called the marine landscape became a more important element in works, but pure seascapes were rare until later.  Marine painting was a major genre within [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], reflecting the importance of overseas trade and naval power to the [[Dutch Republic]], and saw the first career marine artists, who painted little else.  In this, as in much else, specialist and traditional marine painting has largely continued Dutch conventions to the present day.  With [[Romantic art]], the sea and the coast was reclaimed from the specialists by many landscape painters, and works including no vessels became common for the first time.

==Earliest times to 1400==
[[File:8-pointed star on the boat in Qobustan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The [[reed boat]] petroglyph at [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape|Gobustan]].]]

Vessels on the water have featured in art from the earliest times.  The earliest known works are [[petroglyph]]s from 12,000 BCE showing [[reed boat]]s in the [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape|Gobustan Petroglyph Reserve]] in modern [[Azerbaijan]], which was then on the edge of the much larger [[Caspian Sea]].  Rock carvings and carved objects depicting ships have been found on several islands of the Aegean (Andros, Naxos, Syros, Astypalaia, Santorini) as well as mainland Greece (Avlis), dating from 4,000 BCE onwards.

Both men and gods are shown on river "barges" in [[Ancient Egyptian art]]; these boats were made of [[papyrus]] reed for most uses, but the vessels used by the [[pharaoh]]s were of costly imported [[Cedar wood|cedar]] wood, like the 43.6&amp;nbsp;m (143&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 5.9&amp;nbsp;m (19.5&amp;nbsp;ft) wide [[Khufu ship]] of c. 2,500.  [[Nilotic landscape]]s in [[fresco]] in Egyptian tombs often show scenes of hunting birds from boats in the [[Nile delta]], and [[grave goods]] include detailed models of boats and their crews for use in the [[afterlife]].  The central cult image in [[Egyptian temple]]s was usually a small figure of the god, carried in a barge or "barque".

Ships sometimes appear in [[Ancient Greek vase painting]], especially when relevant in a narrative context, and also on coins and other contexts, though with little attempt at a seascape setting.  As in Egyptian painting, the surface of the water may be indicated by a series of parallel wavy lines.  [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman painting]], presumably drawing on Greek traditions, very often shows landscape views from the land across a lake or bay with distant land on the horizon, as in the famous "Ulysses" paintings in the [[Vatican Museums]].  The water is usually calm, and objects that are submerged, or partly so, may be shown through the water.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The large [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]] (1st century BCE) is a version of such compositions, with a view intended to show all the course of the river.

From [[Late Antiquity]] to the end of the [[Middle Ages]] marine subjects were shown when required for narrative purposes, but did not form a genre in the West, or in Asian [[ink painting]] traditions, where a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of scholar landscapes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Marine highlights in [[Medieval art]] include the 11th century [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing the [[Norman Invasion of England]].  From the 12th century onwards, seals of ports often featured a "ship portrait".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship functioned as an image of the church, as in [[Giotto]]'s lost ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' above the entrance to [[Old St Peter's]] in Rome, but such representations are of relatively little interest from the purely marine point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accademia - Arrivo a Colonia Cat.579 - Vittore Carpaccio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vittore Carpaccio]], ''Arrival of the Pilgrims in Cologne'', 1490.]]

A distinct tradition begins to re-emerge in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], with two lost miniatures in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], probably by [[Jan van Eyck]] in about 1420, showing a huge leap in the depiction of the sea and its weather.  Of the seashore scene called ''The Prayer on the Shore'' (or ''Duke William of Bavaria at the Seashore'',  the ''Sovereign's prayer'' etc.) [[Kenneth Clark]] says: "The figures in the foreground are in the chivalric style of the de Limbourgs; but the sea shore beyond them is completely outside the fifteenth-century range of responsiveness, and we see nothing like it again until [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]'s beach-scenes of the mid-17th century."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a true seascape, the  ''Voyage of St Julian &amp; St Martha'',&lt;ref&gt;Kren, 84, note 1.  Châtelet, 34–35 and 194–196 – both are illustrated there.&lt;/ref&gt; but both pages were destroyed in a fire in 1904, and only survive in black and white photographs.  For the rest of the 15th century [[illuminated manuscript]] painting was the main medium of marine painting, and in France and Burgundy in particular many artists became skilled in increasingly realistic depictions of both seas and ships, used in illustrations of wars, romances and court life, as well as religious scenes.  Scenes of small pleasure boats on rivers sometimes feature in the calendar miniatures from [[books of hours]] by artists such as [[Simon Bening]].

During the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] the [[nef (metalwork)|nef]], a large piece of [[goldsmith]]'s work in the shape of a ship, used for holding cutlery, salt or spices, became popular among the grand.  Initially just consisting of the "[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]", from the 15th century the most elaborate had masts, sails and even crew.  As the exotic [[nautilus shell]] began to reach Europe, many used these for their hull, like the [[Burghley Nef]] of about 1528.  Lower down the social scale, interest in shipping was reflected in many early [[old master print|prints]] of ships.  The earliest are by [[Master W with the Key]], who produced several [[engraving]]s of ships; for some time such "ship portraits" were confined to prints and drawings, and typically showed the ship with no crew, even if under sail.  They also usually anticipated the low horizon that painting would not achieve until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The first print of a naval battle is an enormous (548 x 800&amp;nbsp;mm) [[woodcut]] of the [[Battle of Zonchio]] in 1499 between the [[Venice|Venetians]] and the Turks.  The only surviving impression is coloured with [[stencil]]s; most were probably pasted onto walls.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, 104-105,[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/t/the_battle_of_zonchio_navarin.aspx British Museum highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018221608/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/t/the_battle_of_zonchio_navarin.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest comparable painting to survive comes from several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;The Greenwich Portuguese carracks - see next section.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time artists were often involved in the expansion of Western [[cartography]], and more aware than might always seem evident of the scientific and nautical advances of the age. According to Margarita Russell, one of [[Erhard Reuwich]]'s [[woodcut]]s from the first printed travel book (1486) shows him trying to demonstrate his understanding of the curvature of the earth with a ship half-seen on the horizon.  The many coastal views in the book's woodcuts are important in the development of such representations.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 24-32&lt;/ref&gt;  Birds-eye plans of cities, often coastal, which we would today usually consider as cartography, were often done by artists, and considered as much as works of art as maps by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Russell; this is the main theme of here chapter 2, especially pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Renaissance art]] showed maritime scenes when required, but apart from the [[Venice|Venetian]] artist [[Vittore Carpaccio]] there were few artists in this or the next century who often returned to such scenes, or did so with special sensitivity.  Carpaccio's scenes show Venetian canals or docksides; there are several arrivals and departures in his ''[[Legend of Saint Ursula]]''.  In the German-speaking lands, [[Konrad Witz]]'s ''Miraculous Draught of Fishes'' (1444) is both the first [[landscape painting]] to show a recognisable rural location, and an atmospheric view across [[Lake Geneva]].

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 031.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Peter Brueghel]], ''Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples, (The Harbour of Naples)'', c. 1558]]
The Netherlandish tradition of the "[[world landscape]]", a panoramic view from a very high viewpoint, pioneered by [[Joachim Patinir]] in the 1520s, once again begins to include a wide expanse of water in a rather similar way to the classical paintings, which these artists cannot have been aware of.  These paintings were essentially landscapes in the guise of [[history painting]]s, with small figures usually representing a religious subject.  A strong marine element was therefore present as landscape painting began to emerge as a distinct genre.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] greatly restricted the uses of religious art, accelerating to the development of other secular types of art in Protestant countries, including landscape art and secular forms of [[history painting]], which could both form part of marine art.  
[[File:Bruegel, Pieter de Oude - De val van icarus - hi res.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], now seen as a good early copy of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s original]]

An important work by a Flemish "follower of Patenir" is the ''Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast'' of about 1540 (787 x 1447&amp;nbsp;mm), in the [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]], London, "which has justly been labelled the earliest known pure marine painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 40-41, and Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  This probably represents the meeting of two small fleets involved in escorting a Portuguese princess going to be married; a type of ceremonial maritime subject which remained very common in court art until the late 17th century, although more often set at the point of embarkation or arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0705 National Maritime Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617185001/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0705 |date=2010-06-17 }}; see also Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the painting in the [[Royal Collection]] showing [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] embarking for the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], which is typical in clearly showing the ships side-on, with no attempt to adjust for the high view point.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Embarkation-Dover.jpg|Commons image]], Russell, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  A superb coloured drawing by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] of a ship crowded with drunken [[lansquenet]]s was perhaps done in preparation for a mural in London.  This adopts the low viewpoint typical of the ship portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staedelmuseum.de/sm/index.php?StoryID=337&amp;ObjectID=332 Stadel, Frankfurt], Holbein drawing, see also Russell, 53, and illus. p.54&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] is famous for his development of [[genre painting]] scenes of [[peasant]] life, but also painted a number of marine subjects, including [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]] (c. 1568); the original is now recognised as lost, and the painting in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]] is now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original.  He also painted a large ''[[:Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 031.jpg|Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples]]'', of 1560, [[Galleria Doria-Pamphilj]], [[Rome]], and a small but dramatic late shipwreck scene.  A larger storm scene in [[Vienna]], once regarded as his, is now attributed to [[Joos de Momper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 038b.jpg|Commons images]]; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Such subjects were taken up by his successors, including his sons. 
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 038b.jpg|thumb|left|''Storm'' c. 1568, now attributed to [[Joos de Momper]].]]

The highly picturesque and historically useful [[Anthony Roll]] was a luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] inventory of the ships of the [[Royal Navy]] prepared for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in the 1540s.  However it is neither very visually accurate nor artistically accomplished, having perhaps been illustrated by the official concerned.&lt;ref&gt;The conventional view, although Russell seems unpersuaded of this, see p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  As in France, 16th-century English paintings of elaborate royal embarkations and similar occasions are formulaic, if often impressive.  Most used Netherlandish artists, as did representations in prints of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.  [[The Virgin of the Navigators]] is a Spanish work of the 1530s with a  group of ships at anchor, presumably in the [[New World]], protected by the Virgin.

[[Mannerism]] in both Italy and [[Northern Mannerism|the North]] began to paint fantastic tempests with gigantic waves and lightning-filled skies, which had not been attempted before but were to return into fashion at intervals over the following centuries.  As naval warfare became more prominent from the late 16th century, there was an increased demand for works depicting it, which were to remain a staple of maritime painting until the 20th century, pulling the genre in the direction of history painting, with an emphasis on the correct and detailed depiction of the vessels, just as other trends pulled in the direction of increasingly illusionist and subtle effects in the treatment of the sea and weather, paralleling those of landscape painting.  Many artists could paint both sorts of subject, but others specialized in one or the other.  However at this date seascapes showing a large portion of sea and with no vessels at all were very rare.

==Maritime painting of the Dutch Golden Age==
[[File:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]], 1617, ''Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602'']]
{{main article|Dutch Golden Age painting}}

The [[Dutch Republic]] relied on fishing and trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. By 1650 95% of ships passing from the [[North Sea]] into the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] were Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the "calms", or more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated.  It is therefore no surprise that the genre of maritime painting was enormously popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213, the start of his chapter 9, which is devoted to Marine painting&lt;/ref&gt;  As with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting to a low viewpoint was a crucial step, made by the first great Dutch marine specialist [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;

More often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists probably often had precise models of ships available to help them achieve accurate depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 57-61&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], and [[Hendrick Dubbels]].&lt;ref&gt;Described in Slive, 216-220&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[Salomon van Ruysdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the "tonal phase".]]

The prolific workshop of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] was the leader of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, but incorporating the advances of the tonal works of earlier decades where the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. The Younger van de Velde was very strongly influenced by Simon de Vlieger, whose pupil he was. The Elder van de Velde had first visited England in the 1660s, but both father and son left Holland permanently for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 220-224&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reinier Nooms]], who had been a sailor and signed his works ''Zeeman'' ("seaman"), specialized in highly accurate battle scenes and ship portraits, with some interest also in effects of light and weather, and it was his style that was to be followed by many later specialized artists.  [[Abraham Storck]] and [[Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten]] were other battle specialists.  Nooms also painted several scenes of dockyard maintenance and repair operations, which are unusual and of historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of marine painting continued in the Flemish part of the Netherlands, but was much less prominent, and took longer to shake off the Mannerist style of shipwrecks amid fantastic waves. Most paintings were small ''zeekens'', whereas the Dutch painted both large and small works.  The leading artist was [[Bonaventura Peeters]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Schepen aan lager wal - Ships running aground - The 'Ridderschap' and 'Hollandia' in trouble in the Street of Gibraltar 1-3 March 1694 (Ludolf Backhuysen, 1708).jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], Dutch warships in trouble off [[Gibraltar]], a real incident of 1690]]

The Dutch style was exported to other nations by various artists who emigrated, as well as mere emulation by foreign artists.  The most important emigrants were the leading Amsterdam marine artists, the father and son Willem van de Velde.  Having spent decades chronicling Dutch naval victories over the English, after the collapse of the art market in the disastrous [[rampjaar]] of 1672, they accepted an invitation from the English court to move to London, and spent the rest of their lives painting the wars from the other side.  Artists loosely said to have "followed" their style include [[Isaac Sailmaker]], although he was a much earlier Dutch emigrant who had preceded their arrival in England by at least 20 years, and whose style is very different from theirs; as well as [[Peter Monamy]], whose style derives from numerous marine painters besides the van de Veldes, such as Nooms, Peeters and Bakhuizen; and several others, such as Thomas Baston and the Vale brothers, who painted in the native English tradition.

Increasingly, marine art was already mostly left to specialists, with rare exceptions like [[Rembrandt]]'s powerful ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' of 1633, his only true seascape.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 214&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Van Dyck]] made some fine drawings of the English coast from boats off [[Rye]], apparently when waiting for his ship to the continent, but never produced any paintings.  Some of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens's]] paintings involve the sea and ships, but are so extravagant and stylised that they can hardly be called marine art.  However [[Claude Lorrain]] developed an influential type of harbour scene, usually with a view out to a sea with a rising or setting sun, and extravagant classical buildings rising on both sides of the channel.  This elaborated on a tradition of Italianate harbour scenes by Northern artists (Italian ones took little interest in such scenes) that goes back at least as far as [[Paul Bril]] and was especially popular in Flanders, with [[Bonaventura Peeters]] and [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], an emigrant from [[Rotterdam]], as the leading exponents there, and [[Jan Baptist Weenix]] in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 178 and 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hodges, Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Hodges]], ''The [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]] and [[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]] in [[Matavai Bay]]'' ([[Tahiti]]), 1776.]]
The century supplied an abundance of military actions to depict, and before the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759]] the English and French had roughly equal numbers of victories to celebrate.  There were a considerable number of very accomplished specialist artists in several countries, who continued to develop the Dutch style of the previous century, sometimes in a rather formulaic manner, with carefully accurate depictions of ships.  This was insisted on for the many paintings commissioned by captains, ship-owners and others with nautical knowledge, and many of the artists had nautical experience themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Slive, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Nicholas Pocock]] had risen to be master of a merchantman, learning to draw while at sea, and as official marine painter to the king was present at a major sea battle, the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794, on board the frigate [[HMS Pegasus (1779)|HMS ''Pegasus'']].  [[Thomas Buttersworth]] had served as a seaman in several actions up to 1800.  The Frenchman [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]], mainly active as a painter in the following century, was an experienced sailor, and the accuracy of his paintings of [[whaling]] is praised by the narrator in [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', who knew them only from prints.&lt;ref&gt;"But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale... " and "Who Garneray the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvelously tutored by some experienced whaleman.'' (CHAPTER 56: Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes), [[Moby Dick]].&lt;/ref&gt;  At the bottom end of the market, ports in many European countries by now had "pierhead artists" at the docks, who would paint cheap ship portraits that were typically fairly accurate as to the features and rigging of the ship, which was demanded by sailor customers, but very formulaic in general artistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Osborne , Anthony Langdon.  "Marine painting", in ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online.

The Venetian artists [[Canaletto]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] painted [[vedute]] in which the canals, [[gondola]]s and other small craft, and lagoon of Venice are most often prominent features; many of Guardi's later works barely show land at all, and Canaletto's works from his period in England also mostly feature a river and boats. Both produced a large quantity of work, not all of the same quality, but their best paintings handle water  and light superbly, though in very different moods, as Canaletto's world is always bright and sunny, where Guardi's is often overcast, if not misty and gloomy.
[[File:Vernet, Claude Joseph - The Shipwreck - 1772.jpg|thumb|''The Shipwreck'', 1772, by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]]]

Naval cadets were now encouraged to learn drawing, as new coastal charts made at sea were expected to be accompanied by "coastal profiles", or sketches of the land behind, and artists were appointed to teach the subject at naval schools, including [[John Thomas Serres]], who published ''Liber Nauticus, and Instructor in the Art of Marine Drawings'' in 1805/06.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 134-135&lt;/ref&gt;  Professional artists were now often sent on voyages of exploration, like [[William Hodges]] (1744–1797) on [[James Cook]]'s second voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and exotic coastal scenes were popular as both paintings and prints.

Prints had become as significant as a source of income as the original painting for some artists, for example the much-engraved French painter [[Claude Joseph Vernet]] (1714–1789), who both revived something of the spirit of the Mannerist tempest, and looked forward to [[Romanticism]], in his large and extremely dramatic scenes of storms and shipwrecks.  He was also commissioned by the French government to produce a series of views of French harbours,&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; with the strange result that many of his works showing merchant shipping are very violent, and most showing naval vessels very tranquil.  He also developed a type of large Claudeian harbour-scene, at sunset and with a generalized Mediterranean setting, which were imitated by many artists.  Another early Romantic French, or at least Alsatian-Swiss,  artist was [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]] (1740–1812), who spent most of his career in England, where he was commissioned by the government to produce a number of works depicting naval victories.  [[Watson and the Shark]] is a famous marine history subject of 1778 by [[John Singleton Copley]].

==Romantic Age to present==
[[File:Slave-ship.jpg|thumb|300px| [[J. M. W. Turner]], ''[[The Slave Ship]]'', 1840]]
The Romantic period saw marine painting rejoin the mainstream of art, although many specialized painters continued to develop the "ship portrait" genre.  [[Antoine Roux]] and sons dominated maritime art in [[Marseille, France|Marseille]] throughout the 1800s with detailed portraits of ships and maritime life. 
Arguably the greatest icon of Romanticism in art is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1819), and for [[J.M.W. Turner]] painting the sea was a lifelong obsession.  The ''Medusa'' is a radical type of history painting, while Turner's works, even when given history subjects, are essentially approached as landscapes.  His public commission [[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]] (1824) was criticised for inaccuracy, and his most personal late works make no attempt at accurate detail, often having lengthy titles to explain what might otherwise seem an unreadable mass of "soapsuds and whitewash", as [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]] described Turner's ''[[Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth|Snow Storm - Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth making Signals in Shallow Water, and going by the Lead.  The Author was in this Storm on the Night the Ariel left Harwich]]'' of 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 177-178; [[:File:William Turner - Snowstorm.JPG|Snowstorm]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new force in painting, the [[art of Denmark]], featured coastal scenes very strongly, with an emphasis on tranquil waters and still, golden light. These influenced the German [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who added an element of Romantic mysticism, as in ''[[The Stages of Life]]'' (1835); his ''[[The Sea of Ice]]'' is less typical, showing a polar shipwreck.  [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] continued the old themes of battles, shipwrecks and storms with a full-blooded Russian Romanticism, as in [[The Ninth Wave]] (1850).
River, harbour and coastal scenes, typically with only small boats, were popular with [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and the [[Barbizon school]], especially [[Charles-François Daubigny]]; many of the most famous works of the most important Russian landscapist, [[Isaac Levitan]], featured tranquil lakes and also the huge rivers of Russia, which he and many artists treated as a source of national pride.  [[Gustave Courbet]] painted a number of scenes of beaches with cliffs and views looking out to sea of waves breaking on a beach, usually with no human figures or craft. During the 1860s [[Édouard Manet]] painted a number of paintings depicting important and newsworthy events including his 1864 'marine' painting of the ''Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama,'' memorializing a sea battle that took place in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/101707.html Philadelphia Museum of Art] Retrieved April 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Ivan Aivazovsky]], ''[[The Ninth Wave]]'', 1850]]

The ship portrait genre was taken to America by a number of emigrants, most English like [[James E. Buttersworth]] (1817–1894) and [[Robert Salmon]].  The [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminist]] [[Fitz Henry Lane]] (1804–1865) was the earliest of a number of artists who developed American styles based in landscape art; he painted small boats at rest in tranquil small bays. [[Martin Johnson Heade]] was a member of the [[Hudson River School]], and painted tranquil scenes, but also threatening storms of alarming blackness.  [[Winslow Homer]] increasingly specialized in marine scenes with small boats towards the end of the century, often showing boats in heavy swells on the open sea, as in his ''[[The Gulf Stream (painting)|The Gulf Stream]]''.[[Thomas Eakins]] often painted river scenes, including ''[[Max Schmitt in a Single Scull]]'' (1871).&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

[[File:HMS Pomone (retouched).jpg|thumb|260px|right|HMS ''Pomone'', a colour lithograph by [[Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton|T. G. Dutton]], after a painting by G.F. St.John]][[Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton]] (1820-1891) has the reputation of being one of the finest lithographers of 19th Century nautical scenes and ship portraits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blueworldwebmuseum.org/showall.php?id=64 T.G.Dutton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, as the coast became increasingly regarded as a place of pleasure rather than work, beach scenes and coastal landscapes without any shipping became prominent for the first time, often including cliffs and rock formations, which had earlier been mostly found in scenes of shipwreck.  Many later beach scenes became increasingly crowded, as holidaymakers took over the beaches of Europe.  [[Eugène Boudin]]'s scenes of the beaches of north France strike a familiar note to the modern viewer, despite the heavy clothing worn by the ladies sitting on chairs in the sand.  The [[Impressionist]]s painted many scenes of beaches, cliffs and rivers, especially [[Claude Monet]], who often returned to Courbet's themes, as in ''[[Stormy Sea in Étretat]]''.  It was his ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' (1872), a view over the waters of the harbour at [[Le Havre]], that had given the movement its name.  River scenes were very common among the Impressionists, especially by Monet and [[Alfred Sisley]].&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;
[[File:Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Painting of [[dazzle camouflage|Dazzle-ships]] in Drydock at [[Liverpool]]'', by [[Edward Wadsworth]], 1919]]
The Spanish painter [[Joaquín Sorolla]] painted many beach scenes, typically concentrating on a few figures seen close up, in contrast to the smaller figures of most beach paintings.  American artists who painted beaches and shores, typically less populated, include [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who mainly painted rivers and the canals of [[Venice]]. Towards the end of the 19th century the [[United States|American]] painter [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] created moody and darkly visionary early modernist seascapes. The [[Fauvism|Fauve]] and [[Pointillism|Pointilliste]] groups included fairly tranquil waters in large numbers of their work, as did [[Edvard Munch]] in his early paintings.  In England the [[Newlyn School]] and the naive fisherman-artist [[Alfred Wallis]] are worth noting.

The rather traditional British marine artist Sir [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] was during [[World War I]] the inventor of [[dazzle camouflage]], by which ships were boldly painted in patterns, achieving results not dissimilar to [[Vorticism]], inspiring the naval ditty: "Captain Schmidt at the periscope / You need not fall or faint / For it’s not the vision of drug or dope / But only the dazzle paint".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/507 Article (see end) by] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206224810/http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/507 |date=2010-12-06 }} [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the American navy adopted the idea in 1918, [[Frederick Judd Waugh]] was put in charge of design.

Specialized marine painters concentrating on ship portraits continue to the present day, with artists such as [[Montague Dawson]] (1895–1973), whose works were very popular in reproduction; like many, he found works showing traditional sailing ships more in demand than those of modern vessels. Even in 1838 Turner's ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up]]'', still probably his most famous work, displayed nostalgia for the age of sail.  Marine subjects still  attract many mainstream artists,  and more popular forms of marine art remain enormously popular, as shown by the parodic series of paintings by [[Vitaly Komar]] and [[Alexander Melamid]] called ''America's Most Wanted Painting'', with variants for several countries, almost all featuring a lakeside view.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, 21, and [http://awp.diaart.org/km/painting.html Most Wanted and Least Wanted Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of [[Chinese ink and brush painting]]s, and many featured lakes and, less often, coastal views. However the water was often left as white space, with the emphasis firmly on the land elements in the scene.  The more realist court school of Chinese painting often included careful depictions of the shipping on China's great rivers in the large horizontal scrolls showing panoramas of city scenes with the Emperors progressing across the Empire, or festivals like the one shown above.

The turning-away from long-distance maritime activity of both the Chinese and Japanese governments at the time of the Western Renaissance no doubt helped to inhibit the development of marine themes in the art of these countries, but the more popular Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] coloured [[woodblock print]]s very often featured coastal and river scenes with shipping, including ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' (1832) by [[Hokusai]], the most famous of all ukiyo-e images.

'''Nashan''' (modern day '''Al-Sawda'''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven C. Caton|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BfDXAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Nashan+yemen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MXAlb0EfNb&amp;sig=Ia62D67pdGL-cjUnT4b9aCUYrk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGi5vlpO_XAhXJRhQKHf4tC4UQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nashan%20yemen&amp;f=false|title=Yemen|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2013|page=43|isbn=9781598849288}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ar|خربة السوداء}}) is the name of an ancient [[South Arabia]]n city in the northern [[al-Jawf]] region of present day [[Yemen]], in the territory of the ancient [[Minaeans|Kingdom of Ma'in]].

==History==
Nashan, located near "Al-Khārid river" along with the neighboring [[Kaminahu]], [[Haram (Yemen)|Ḥaram]] and [[Nashaq]] in the region of [[al-Jawf]], was a separate city state. Around 715 BC, it was initially annexed by Yitha'amar Watar I of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. Subsequently, [[Karib'il Watar]] (around 685 BC) launched a campaign to capture Nashan and Nashaq which lasted for three years. Eventually, he managed to subdue both cities, and to dedicate his triumph to his god [[Almaqah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magee|first1=Peter|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xmRzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=1139991639&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuw87gr-_XAhVDPxQKHVMwC4cQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=watar&amp;f=false|title=The Archaeology of Prehistoric Arabia: Adaptation and Social Formation from the Neolithic to the Iron Age |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |page=243|isbn=1139991639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 25 BC, Nashan was mentioned as "''Annestum''"{{refn|group="note"|Mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his book ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. p. 151.}} during [[Aelius Gallus]]'s expedition to [[Arabia Felix]] under orders of [[Augustus]] against Saba'. However, the expedition ended in critical failure and the Romans accused a [[Nabataean]] guide called "Syllaeus" of misleading them. This expedition was mentioned by [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] geographer [[Strabo]] in which he named [[Ilasaros]] as the ruler of [[Hadhramaut]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gertoux|first1=Gerard|title=Kings David and Solomon: Chronological, Historical and Archaeological Evidence |publisher=lulu.com |date=2015|url=|isbn=132969810X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

Paku-Paku Pacman the Muncher}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a form of [[origami]] used in children's games. Parts of the fortune teller are labelled with colors or numbers that serve as options for a player to choose from, and on the inside are eight flaps, each concealing a message. The person operating the fortune teller manipulates the device based on the choices made by the player, and finally one of the hidden messages is revealed. These messages may purport to answer questions (hence the name) or they may be activities that the player must perform.

The same shape may also be used as [[Pincers (tool)|pincers]] or as a [[salt cellar]].

==Construction==
A paper fortune teller may be constructed by the steps shown in the illustration below:&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="temkut"&gt;{{citation|title=Origami Toys|first1=Florence|last1=Temko|first2=Dave|last2=Kutchukian|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8048-3478-0|pages=22–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_kRTVfrhnUC&amp;pg=PA22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The corners of a sheet of paper are folded up to meet the opposite sides and (if the paper is not already square) the top is cut off, making a square sheet with diagonal creases.
# The four corners of the square are folded into the center, forming a shape known in origami terminology as a [[Yoshizawa–Randlett system#Origami_bases|blintz base]] or cushion fold.&lt;ref name="temkut"/&gt; The resulting smaller square is turned over, and the four corners are folded in a second time.
# All four corners are folded up so that the points meet in the middle, and the player works their fingers into the pockets of paper in each of the four corners.
[[File:Fortuneteller mgx.svg|360px|center]]

==Telling fortunes==
To use the fortune teller, the player telling the fortunes holds the four corners of the paper with index fingers and thumbs on both hands, keeping two pairs of corners together and the other two pairs separated so that only half of the internal sides of the corners are visible.

Manipulations are done by various similar methods, for example: The player asks a question of the person holding the fortune teller; this question will be answered by the device. The holder then asks for a number or color. Once the number or color is chosen, the holder uses their fingers to switch between the two groups of colors and numbers inside the fortune teller. The holder switches these positions a number of times: which may be determined by the number of letters in the color selected, the number originally chosen, or the sum of both. Once the holder has finished switching the positions of the fortune teller, the player chooses one of the flaps revealed. These flaps often have colors or numbers on them. The holder then lifts the flap and reveals the fortune underneath. Steps may be repeated to suit the users.&lt;ref name="Maguire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="temkut"/&gt;

==Other uses==
As well as being used to tell fortunes, these shapes may be used as a pincer to play-act catching insects such as [[lice]], hence the "[[cooties|cootie]] catcher" name.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kenneway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide|first1=Claudia|last1=Mitchell|first2=Jacqueline|last2=Reid-Walsh|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7|pages=245–246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[salt cellar]]" name refers to a different use for the same shape, in which it stands on a table with the four points downwards; the four open pockets may be used to hold small pieces of food.&lt;ref name="kenneway"&gt;{{citation|title=Complete origami|first=Eric|last=Kenneway|publisher=Macmillan|year=1987|isbn=978-0-312-00898-7|pages=153–154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLp8DwZY8gwC&amp;pg=PA153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, over 10,000 copies of this shape were used to create an installation resembling lava pouring from a building window, for the Lluèrnia festival in [[Olot]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/11/origami-lava-catalonia/|title=Origami Lava Pours from the Window of an Abandoned Building in Catalonia for LLUÈRNIA|first=Christopher|last=Jobson|date=November 12, 2018|work=[[Colossal (blog)|Colossal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This shape was introduced to the English-speaking world under the name ''salt cellar'' in the 1928 origami book ''Fun with Paper Folding'' by Murray and Rigney (Fleming H. Revell company, 1928, p.10). The use of paper fortune tellers in England has been recorded since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Iona and Peter Opie]]|year=1959|title=The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=341–342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdWwHbOf4oAC&amp;pg=PA341}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the phrase "cootie catcher" has been used with other meanings in the U.S. for much longer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Alabama's own in France|first=William Henry|last=Amerine|publisher=Eaton &amp; Gettinger|year=1919|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXhHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA284}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of paper cootie catchers in the U.S. dates back at least to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Honestly, Katie John!|first=Mary|last=Calhoun|publisher=Scholastic Book Services|year=1963|isbn=978-0-590-08544-1|pages=89, 91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hawthorne|first=Ruth|title=The Folklore Repertory of a Third-Grade Class|journal=Pennsylvania Folklife|volume=17|issue=1|date=Autumn 1967|pages=18–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Trojan War}}

'''''Philoctetes''''' ({{lang-grc|Φιλοκτήτης}}, ''Philoktētēs''; English pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ə|k|ˈ|t|iː|t|iː|z}}, [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the third [[syllable]], ''-tet-''&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Wells]], ''Longman pronunciation dictionary'', 3rd edition (2008), entry ''Philoctetes''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a play by [[Sophocles]] ([[Aeschylus]] and [[Euripides]] also each wrote a ''Philoctetes'' but theirs have not survived). The play was written during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It is one of the seven extant tragedies by Sophocles. It was first performed at the [[City Dionysia]] in 409 BC, where it won first prize. The story takes place during the [[Trojan War]] (after the majority of the events of the ''[[Iliad]]'', but before the [[Trojan Horse]]).  It describes the attempt by [[Neoptolemus]] and [[Odysseus]] to bring the disabled [[Philoctetes]], the master archer, back to Troy from the island of Lemnos.

==Background==
When [[Heracles]] was near his death, he wished to be burned on a funeral pyre while still alive. In the ''Philoctetes'', Sophocles references the myth in which no one but Philoctetes would light Heracles' funeral pyre, and in return for this favor Heracles gave Philoctetes his bow (seen in later texts, such as Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''). Philoctetes left with the Greeks to participate in the [[Trojan War]], but was bitten on the foot by a snake while walking on Chryse, a sacred ground. The bite caused him constant agony, and emitted a horrible smell. For this reason he was left by Odysseus and the Atreidai (sons of [[Atreus]]) on the desert island [[Lemnos]].

Ten years pass, and the Greeks capture the Trojan seer [[Helenus]], son of [[Priam]]. He foretells that they will need the master archer Philoctetes and the bow of Heracles to win the war. Odysseus sails back to Lemnos with Neoptolemus (son of [[Achilles]]) to get Philoctetes. The task is not easy, as Philoctetes bitterly hates Odysseus and the Greeks for leaving him there.

==Synopsis==

Sophocles' '''''Philoctetes''''' begins with their arrival on the island.  Odysseus explains to Neoptolemus that he must perform a shameful action in order to garner future glory - to take Philoctetes by tricking him with a false story while Odysseus hides.  Neoptolemus is portrayed as an honorable boy, and so it takes some persuading to get him to play this part.  To gain Philoctetes' trust, Neoptolemus tricks Philoctetes into thinking he hates Odysseus as well.  Neoptolemus does this by telling Philoctetes that Odysseus has his father's (Achilles) armor.  He tells Philoctetes that this armor was his right by birth, and Odysseus would not give it up to him.  After gaining Philoctetes' trust and offering him a ride home, Neoptolemus is allowed to look at the bow of Heracles.

Neoptolemus holds the bow while Philoctetes is going into an unbearable fit of pain in his foot.   Feeling ashamed, Neoptolemus debates giving it back to him.  Odysseus appears, and a series of arguments ensue.  Eventually Neoptolemus' conscience gains the upper hand, and he returns the bow.    After many threats made on both sides, Odysseus flees.  Neoptolemus then tries to talk Philoctetes into coming to Troy by his own free will, but Philoctetes does not agree. In the end, Neoptolemus consents to take Philoctetes back to Greece, even though that will expose him to the anger of the army.  This appears to be the conclusion of the play—however, as they are leaving, Heracles (now a deity) appears above them and tells Philoctetes that if he goes to Troy, he will be cured and the Greeks will win. Philoctetes willingly obeys him.&lt;ref&gt;Summary description of the play; [http://classics.uc.edu/~johnson/tragedy/summaries/philoctetes.html classics.uc.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905144723/http://classics.uc.edu/~johnson/tragedy/summaries/philoctetes.html |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ends here.  When Philoctetes later fights in Troy, his foot is healed, and he wins glory,  killing many Trojans (including [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]).

== Themes and ideas==
The concept of having a moral high ground is a key aspect in this play. The play makes the spectator question what morality means to each man. Furthermore, the play makes one question the struggle between what is right for the individual versus what is right for the group. It is possible that this struggle is irreconcilable. More specifically, one can see this struggle by looking at what has happened to Philoctetes versus what the Greeks need.

Another theme is that of trauma. Philoctetes suffers wounds that do not heal. Furthermore, Philoctetes' suffering is now what defines him, yet Neoptolemus pretends not to know Philoctetes at first. In other words, Philoctetes' suffering should at least make him known, however it is as if his story is dead.&lt;ref&gt;Lines 255-263, Sophocles. "Philoctetes." Electra and Other Plays. Transl. E.F. Watling. Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1953. 162-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary adaptations==

{{Main|Theatre of War Project}}

The story of Philoctetes, dealing with the wounded man and the interwoven relationships with others, has been frequently noted. In 2005 Bryan Doerries, writer and director, began a series of readings of the play in the [[New York City]] area. Noting the reactions of the audience to the reading, especially related to the reactions of audience members to the interaction of the suffering soldier and the conflicted caregiver.The project revolves around presenting such readings, especially to audiences of medical professionals and students.

A number of readings were followed by a panel discussion about doctor-patient relationships, involving presenters in psychiatry, physicians, and military medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bryan |last=Doerries |title=About the Philoctetes Project, The Key Reporter (Phi Beta Kappa) |date=Spring 2008 |url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentIDID=2674 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129202142/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives |archivedate=2006-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept has also been extended to training of medical students, such as a presentation also in 2007 to the first year medical class at [[Weill Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abigail |last=Zuger |title=The Difficult Patient, a Problem as Old as History (or Older'', The Key Reporter (Phi Beta Kappa) |date=Spring 2008 |url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentIDID=2674/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129202142/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives |archivedate=2006-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, at a conference dedicated to finding new ways to help [[US Marines]] recover from post-traumatic stress and other disorders after serving in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], four New York actors presented a dramatic reading from ''Philoctetes'' and [[Ajax (Sophocles)|''Ajax'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-combat15-2008aug15,0,6770815.story latimes.com] Story by Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartoons''' is one of the fourteen [[Pulitzer Prize]]s that is annually awarded for Journalism. It has been awarded since 1922 for a distinguished [[editorial cartoon]] or portfolio of cartoons published during the year, characterized by originality, editorial effectiveness, quality of drawing, and pictorial effect. 

Since 1980, finalists (usually two) have been announced in addition to the winner.&lt;ref name="prize" /&gt;

In politics, a '''rosette''' is a coloured fabric decoration worn by political candidates to identify them in many countries. The rosette, worn on the chest or suit jacket, will show the [[Political colour|colours]] of the [[political party]] that the candidate represents.&lt;ref name="Zetter2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lionel Zetter|title=The Political Campaigning Handbook: Real life lessons from the front line|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptfoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Harriman House|isbn=978-1-905641-34-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British politics==
In British politics, rosettes (or sometimes [[Boutonnière|flowers]] and [[Necktie|ties]]) of a political party are often worn by candidates. As of 2016, the normal colours used are red for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] (referenced in the party's [[The Red Flag|official song]]), blue for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]], orange-yellow for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat party]], Green for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green party]] and heather for the [[UK Independence Party]]. Of the nationalist parties, the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] use yellow and [[Plaid Cymru]] gold and green.

As of 2015, the only people allowed to wear a rosette at a [[polling station]] are candidates and their [[election agent]]s.&lt;ref name="What CAN'T you do in a polling station?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Castella|first1=Tom|last2=Heyden|first2=Tom|title=Election 2015: What CAN'T you do in a polling station?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32451429|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "An X in a [coloured] rosette would/wouldn't get elected here" or variants of this phrase is often used to indicate a very safe seat, where X is a deeply undesirable candidate for the likely winning party or a saintly potential candidate for a losing party.&lt;ref name="GoodwinMilazzo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew Goodwin|author2=Caitlin Milazzo|title=Ukip: Inside the Campaign to Redraw the Map of British Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVAUCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-873611-0|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blythe2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Blythe|title=X Marks the Box|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaLuGrjHgg0C&amp;pg=PT91|date=2 April 2009|publisher=Icon Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84831-180-0|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s and 90s, first [[Neil Kinnock]] and then the [[New Labour]] movement under [[Tony Blair|Blair]] encouraged the use of red roses as a symbol of the Labour party, and the party used the rose as a logo.&lt;ref name="History of the Labour Party - Part 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Labour Party - Part 3|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/pages/history-of-the-labour-party-3|website=Labour Party|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K., despite its relatively long-lasting set of major parties, colours worn by parties have not always been constant.&lt;ref name="Why is the Conservative Party blue?"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why is the Conservative Party blue?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4923050.stm|website=BBC Magazine|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, non-standard colours were worn up to around the 1970s as a local tradition. This may have been for a variety of reasons, such as association of colours with leading families of the area and then the political parties they supported.&lt;ref name="The seats where Tories weren’t blue and Labour wasn’t red"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Jon|title=The seats where Tories weren’t blue and Labour wasn’t red|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32510493|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major political parties have now standardised on the colours used nationally, a trend accelerated by the arrival of colour television.

'''Shâd'havâr''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: شادهوار) or '''Âras''' (آرس), is a legendary creature from medieval Muslim [[bestiaries]] resembling a [[unicorn]]. [[Zakariya al-Qazwini|Al-Qazwini]] said that it lives in the country of ''[[Rūm]]'' ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]) and that it has one horn with 42 hollow branches which, when the wind passes through them, produces a pleasant sound that makes the animals sit around and listen. Horns of those creatures, sometimes gifted to kings, can be played on like flutes. When played on one side, they produce a cheerful sound, and when the other, the music is so sad it makes people cry.

The scholar [[Al-Damiri]] stated a larger number of branches to 72 and al-Mustawfi made shadhavar a ferocious carnivore. The change can be explained as a result of merging its description with another creature from Qazwini, the ''Sirânis'' (سيرانس), a predator that plays music to lure its victims. G. Jacob pointed out similarities between the ''Sirânis'' and the [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] from [[Greek mythology]].

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. Régis; with a preface by [[Benjamin Ball (physician)|M. Benjamin Ball]]; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B. Weiner [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft638nb3db&amp;chunk.id=d0e13621&amp;toc.id=d0e13621&amp;brand=ucpress Nine: Mind and Body in the Clinic] in Rousseau, G. S., editor [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft638nb3db/ ''The Languages of Psyche: Mind and Body in Enlightenment Thought''].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs5PRR9-8BcC Madness and Civilization], 1964/2001, p. 209. Also known (unabridged) as [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5Pyfip2P1gC History of Madness] 1961/2006, p. 372. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013).

Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents.DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, A. S. (2003).

[[Attachment in adults|Attachment relationships in adults]] can also involve feelings of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Content/Consumer_Updates/Adult_Attachment_Relationships.aspx AAMFT Consumer Update]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a [[rat race|socioeconomic race]], or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokach|first=Ami|title=Loneliness then and now: Reflections on social and emotional alienation in everyday life|journal=Current Psychology|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.1007/s12144-004-1006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview", ''Military History'', Weider History Group, Inc. Leesburg, VA, November 2012. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that "even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mokenhaupt, Brian, [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26372/esq0307essay/ "I Miss Iraq. I Miss My Gun. I Miss My War,"] ''Esquire,'' June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, Psychologist, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnam War was a long, contentious conflict (1955–75) which in the mid to late 1960s started to lose political and domestic support, most notably in academia and film that often portrayed soldiers of this conflict as ignoble adding to their social alienation. That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that as the perception of community alienation increases, an individual's sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation to socially engage.&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief'', October 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation.

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">'''The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas''' (SSILA) is an international organization  founded in 1981 devoted to the study of the [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages of North, Central, and South America]].

SSILA has an annual winter meeting held in association with the [[Linguistic Society of America]]'s annual conference.  Summer meetings are held in alternate years at venues near the LSA's Summer Institute.  Presentations at SSILA meetings may be made in English, Spanish, or Portuguese.

Each year, SSILA accepts nominations for three awards, which are presented at the annual meeting.  The [[Mary R. Haas]] Book Award is presented for an outstanding unpublished manuscript that makes a significant substantive contribution to our knowledge of native American languages.  The [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] Prize is presented in recognition of a scholar's outstanding community language work and commitment to the documentation, maintenance, promotion, and revitalization of indigenous languages in the Americas.

The third prize was established to honor SSILA's founder, [[Victor Golla]], who served as Secretary – Treasurer through 2007.  The Golla Prize is awarded to scholars who show a significant history of both linguistic scholarship and service to the scholarly community.

SSILA issues two online publications: the quarterly ''SSILA Newsletter'' and the occasional ''SSILA Bulletin''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11571">The '''state of defence''' (in German: '''Verteidigungsfall''' or '''V-Fall''') is the constitutional [[state of emergency]] in Germany if the country is "under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a Article 115a GG]&lt;/ref&gt; Established by a [[German Emergency Acts|constitutional amendment]] in 1968 during the [[Cold War]], this state of emergency gives the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 115a to 115l] (title Xa) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. As of December 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.

==Declaration==
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a 115a] of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if "the federal territory [of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".

The normal procedure is that, upon request of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]], the [[Bundestag]] determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an "attack by armed force", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the [[quorum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/btgo_1980/__45.html section 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the German Bundestag] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;). It also has to be approved by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.

If the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' decides on their behalf.

If Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, "the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)

==Consequences==
===Commander-in-chief===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115b 115b] [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]], the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] becomes [[Commander-in-chief#Germany|Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. (Normally, the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] holds that post.)

===Extension of federal legislative powers===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115c 115c] GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:

*The federal government may pass laws with respect to any matter even if it would normally be under exclusive legislative power of the [[Länder]].
*Temporary provisions concerning the compensation for [[expropriations]] may differ from [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14 those] laid down in the constitution.
*A law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge (instead of "no later than the day following his arrest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P104 article 104 GG]&lt;/ref&gt;) However, that applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit.
*Laws concerning financial matters may differ from the requirements laid down in the titles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G9 VIII], ''(The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration)'' [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G10 VIIIa] ''(Joint Tasks)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G12 X] ''(Finance)'' of the constitution.

==Legislative procedure==
The normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:
*According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115d 115d] GG, bills are discussed "without delay" and adopted by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, in a single joint session.

===Joint Committee===
The ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the [[Bundestag]] and members of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag "in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally "not bound by instructions". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/plenum/gemeinsamer_ausschuss/mitglieder.html current members of the Joint Committee] (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a [[quorum]]. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/__1.html section 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):
*It may not amend, abrogate or suspend the constitution, in whole or in part.
*It may not enact laws pursuant to Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P23 23] ''(European Union - Protection of basic rights - Principle of subsidiarity)'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P24 24] ''(Transfer of sovereign powers - System of collective security)'', or [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P29 29] ''(New delimitation of the federal territory)'' of the constitution.
*A [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the Joint Committee requires a two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority of the votes needed for a vote of no confidence by the Bundestag).
*Laws enacted by the Joint Committee may be repealed at any time by the Bundestag, with the consent of the Bundesrat.

The Joint Committee is based on Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0249 53a] ''(Composition - Rules of procedure)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0694 115e] ''(Joint Committee)'' of the constitution, as well as on own [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/BJNR111020969.html rules of procedure].

===Use of Federal Border Guard===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.

When the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a [[paramilitary]] police force responsible only for the protection of [[West Germany]]'s external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the [[rail transport in Germany|railway network]], [[airport security]] and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 Xa] has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term ''Federal Border Guard'' is still used in the constitution.

===Extended powers of instruction===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)

===Extended electoral terms===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115h 115h] GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:
*The electoral term of the [[Bundestag]] or a [[Landtag#Modern legislatures|state parliament]] ends six months after the end of the State of Defence.
*The term of office of the [[President of Germany|President]] ends nine months after the end of the State of Defence.

===Conscription===
In 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wehrpflg/__2.html section 2 of the Conscription Act] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115l 115l] GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag "if the conditions for determining it no longer exist", such as after a [[peace treaty]] is signed.

{{short description|Medieval triptych painting by Hieronymus Bosch}}
{{italic title}}
[[File:El jardín de las Delicias, de El Bosco.jpg|thumb|550px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'', oil on oak panels, {{convert|220|x|389|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]

'''''The Garden of Earthly Delights''''' is the modern title{{efn|At the time, paintings often had no fixed titles. It is listed in [[Philip IV of Spain]]'s inventory as ''La Pintura del [[Arbutus unedo|Madroño]]''.}} given to a [[triptych]] [[oil painting]] on [[oak|oak panel]] painted by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Hieronymus Bosch]], between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between 40 and 60&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch's exact date of birth is unknown but is estimated to be 1450. Gibson, 15&amp;ndash;16&lt;/ref&gt; It has been housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid since 1939.

As so little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent have ranged from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. [[Peter S. Beagle]] describes it as an "erotic derangement that turns us all into [[voyeur]]s, a place filled with the intoxicating air of perfect liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosch painted three large triptychs (the others are ''[[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|The Last Judgment]]'' of c. 1482 and ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]'' of c. 1516) that can be read from left to right and in which each panel was essential to the meaning of the whole. Each of these three works presents distinct yet linked themes addressing history and faith. Triptychs from this period were generally intended to be read sequentially, the left and right panels often portraying [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] and the [[Last Judgment]] respectively, while the main subject was contained in the center piece.&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 85&amp;ndash;86&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether ''The Garden'' was intended as an [[altarpiece]], but the general view is that the extreme subject matter of the inner center and right panels make it unlikely that it was intended to function in a church or monastery, but was instead commissioned by a [[Laity|lay]] [[Patronage|patron]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Exterior===
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|left|The exterior panels show the world during creation, probably on the Third Day, after the addition of plant life but before the appearance of animals and humans.&lt;ref name="von33"&gt;von Baldass, 33&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When the triptych's wings are closed, the design of the outer panels becomes visible. Rendered in a green–gray [[grisaille]],&lt;ref name="Snyder102"&gt;Snyder 1977, 102&lt;/ref&gt; these panels lack colour, probably because most Netherlandish triptychs were thus painted, but possibly indicating that the painting reflects a time before the creation of the sun and moon, which were formed, according to Christian theology, to "give light to the earth".&lt;ref name="Belting21"/&gt; The typical grisaille blandness of Netherlandish [[altarpiece]]s served to highlight the splendid colour inside.&lt;ref&gt;Veen &amp; Ridderbos, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer panels are generally thought to depict the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] of the world,&lt;ref&gt;The drenched state of the Earth has led some to interpret the panels as depicting [[Deluge (mythology)|The Flood]]. In Mann, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; showing greenery beginning to clothe the still-pristine Earth.&lt;ref name="Belting22"&gt;Belting, 22&lt;/ref&gt; God, wearing a crown similar to a [[papal tiara]] (a common convention in Netherlandish painting),&lt;ref name="Belting21"/&gt; is visible as a tiny figure at the upper left. Bosch shows [[Conceptions of God|God]] as [[God the Father|the father]] sitting with a [[Bible]] on his lap, creating the Earth in a passive manner by divine [[Let there be light|fiat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 88&lt;/ref&gt; Above him is inscribed a quote from [[Psalm 33]] reading "Ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mandāvit, et creāta sunt"&amp;mdash;''For he spake and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast''.&lt;ref name="MLN"&gt;Dempsey, Charles. "Sicut in utrem aquas maris: Jerome Bosch's Prolegomenon to the Garden of Earthly Delights". ''MLN''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 119:1, January 2004. S247&amp;ndash;S270. Retrieved November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth is encapsulated in a transparent sphere recalling the traditional depiction of the created world as a crystal sphere held by God or Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Cinotti, 100&lt;/ref&gt; It hangs suspended in the cosmos, which is shown as an impermeable darkness, whose only other inhabitant is God himself.&lt;ref name="Belting21"&gt;Belting, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the presence of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents the events of the biblical Third Day.&lt;ref name="von33" /&gt; Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations.&lt;ref name="von33" /&gt; Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with [[lust]]ful humanity.

Scholars have proposed that Bosch used the outer panels to establish a Biblical setting for the inner elements of the work,&lt;ref name="Snyder102" /&gt; and the exterior image is generally interpreted as set in an earlier time than those in the interior. As with Bosch's ''[[The Haywain Triptych|Haywain]]'' triptych, the inner centerpiece is flanked by heavenly and hellish imagery. The scenes depicted in the triptych are thought to follow a chronological order: flowing from left-to-right they represent Eden, the garden of earthly delights, and Hell.&lt;ref name="Calas"&gt;Calas, Elena. "D for Deus and Diabolus. The Iconography of Hieronymus Bosch". ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Volume 27, No. 4, Summer, 1969. 445–454&lt;/ref&gt; God appears as the creator of humanity in the left hand wing, while the consequences of humanity's failure to follow his will are shown in the right.[[File:Bosch, Hieronymus - The Garden of Earthly Delights, center panel - Detail women with peacock.jpg|400px|thumb||Naked figures seek pleasure in various ways. Center panel, women with peacock (detail)]]However, in contrast to Bosch's two other complete triptychs, ''[[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|The Last Judgment]]'' (around 1482) and ''The Haywain'' (after 1510), God is absent from the central panel. Instead, this panel shows humanity acting with apparent [[free will]] as naked men and women engage in various pleasure-seeking activities. According to some interpretations, the right hand panel is believed to show God's penalties in a hellscape.&lt;ref&gt;Glum, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[Charles de Tolnay]] believed that, through the seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon the newly created earth. This view is reinforced by the rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth.&lt;ref name="Calas" /&gt; According to Hans Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before [[Fall of Man|the Fall]], there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.&lt;ref name="b57"&gt;Belting, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Left panel====
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) - WGA2519.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail from the left hand panel, showing the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|pre-incarnate]] [[Christ]] blessing [[Eve]] before she is presented to [[Adam]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The left panel (sometimes known as the ''Joining of Adam and Eve'')&lt;ref name="dixon"&gt;Dixon, Laurinda S. "Bosch's Garden of Delights: Remnants of a 'Fossil' Science". ''Art Bulletin'', LXIII, 1981. 96–113&lt;/ref&gt; depicts a scene from the paradise of the [[Garden of Eden]] commonly interpreted as the moment when God presents Eve to Adam. The painting shows Adam waking from a deep sleep to find God holding Eve by her wrist and giving the sign of his blessing to their union. God is younger-looking than on the outer panels, blue-eyed and with golden curls. His youthful appearance may be a device by the artist to illustrate the concept of [[Jesus|Christ]] as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of the [[Logos|Word of God]].&lt;ref name="Gibson92"&gt;Gibson, 92&lt;/ref&gt; God's right hand is raised in blessing, while he holds Eve's wrist with his left. According to the work's most controversial interpreter, the 20th-century [[folkloristics|folklorist]] and [[art historian]] [[Wilhelm Fraenger]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As though enjoying the pulsation of the living blood and as though too he were setting a seal on the eternal and immutable communion between this human blood and his own. This physical contact between the Creator and Eve is repeated even more noticeably in the way Adam's toes touch the Lord's foot. Here is the stressing of a rapport: Adam seems indeed to be stretching to his full length in order to make contact with the Creator. And the billowing out of the cloak around the Creator's heart, from where the garment falls in marked folds and contours to Adam's feet, also seems to indicate that here a current of divine power flows down, so that this group of three actually forms a closed circuit, a complex of magical energy ...&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eve avoids Adam's gaze, although, according to art historian Walter S. Gibson, she is shown "seductively presenting her body to Adam".&lt;ref name = "Gibson25"/&gt; Adam's expression is one of amazement, and Fraenger has identified three elements to his seeming astonishment. Firstly, there is surprise at the presence of the God. Secondly, he is reacting to an awareness that Eve is of the same nature as himself, and has been created from his own body. Finally, from the intensity of Adam's gaze, it can be concluded that he is experiencing sexual arousal and the primal urge to reproduce for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 021.jpg|thumb|right|Birds swarming through cavities of a hut-shaped form in the left background of the left panel]]
The surrounding landscape is populated by hut-shaped forms, some of which are made from stone, while others are at least partially organic. Behind Eve rabbits, symbolising [[fecundity]], play in the grass, and a [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]] opposite is thought to represent [[Immortality|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Gibson25"&gt;Gibson, 25&lt;/ref&gt; The background reveals several animals that would have been exotic to contemporaneous Europeans, including a giraffe, an elephant, and a lion that has killed and is about to devour his prey. In the foreground, from a large hole in the ground, emerge birds and winged animals, some of which are realistic, some fantastic. Behind a fish, a person clothed in a short-sleeved hooded jacket and with a duck's beak holds an open book as if reading. To the left of the area a cat holds a small lizard-like creature in its jaws. Belting observes that, despite the fact that the creatures in the foreground are fantastical imaginings, many of the animals in the mid and background are drawn from contemporary travel literature, and here Bosch is appealing to "the knowledge of a humanistic and aristocratic readership".&lt;ref name="B26"&gt;Belting, 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erhard Reuwich]]'s pictures for Bernhard von Breydenbach's 1486 ''Pilgrimages to the Holy Land'' were long thought to be the source for both the elephant and the giraffe, though more recent research indicates the mid-15th-century humanist scholar [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriac of Ancona]]'s travelogues served as Bosch's exposure to these exotic animals.&lt;ref name="B26" /&gt;

According to art historian Virginia Tuttle, the scene is "highly unconventional [and] cannot be identified as any of the events from the [[Book of Genesis]] traditionally depicted in Western art".&lt;ref name="Lilith"&gt;Tuttle, Virginia. "Lilith in Bosch's 'Garden of Earthly Delights'". ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Volume 15, No. 2, 1985. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the images contradict the innocence expected in the Garden of Eden. Tuttle and other critics have interpreted the [[gaze]] of Adam upon his wife as lustful, and indicative of the Christian belief that humanity was doomed from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Lilith" /&gt; Gibson believes that Adam's facial expression betrays not just surprise but also expectation. According to a belief common in the Middle Ages, before the Fall Adam and Eve would have copulated without lust, solely to reproduce. Many believed that the first sin committed after Eve tasted the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil|forbidden fruit]] was carnal lust.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 92&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt; On a tree to the right a [[Serpent (Bible)|snake]] curls around a tree trunk, while to its right a mouse creeps; according to Fraenger, both animals are universal [[Phallus|phallic symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Center panel====
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 028.jpg|thumb|left|The central water-bound globe in the middle panel's upper background is a hybrid of stone and organic matter. It is adorned by nude figures cavorting both with each other and with various creatures, some of whom are realistic, others are fantastic or hybrid.]]

The skyline of the center panel (220 × 195&amp;nbsp;cm, 87 × 77&amp;nbsp;in) matches exactly with that of the left wing, while the positioning of its central pool and the lake behind it echoes the lake in the earlier scene. The center image depicts the expansive "garden" landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between the two scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Linfert, 106–108&lt;/ref&gt; The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;Mann, Richard G. "Melanie Klier's: Hieronymus Bosch: Garden of Earthly Delights". ''Utopian Studies'', 16.1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, but neither is it based in the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref name="Belting47"&gt;Belting, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Fantastic creatures mingle with the real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving "overtly and without shame",&lt;ref name="Gibson80"&gt;Gibson, 80&lt;/ref&gt; while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit "a certain adolescent sexual curiosity".&lt;ref name="dixon" /&gt;

Many of the numerous human figures revel in an innocent, self-absorbed joy as they engage in a wide range of activities; some appear to enjoy [[Sensory system|sensory]] pleasures, others play unselfconsciously in the water, and yet others cavort in meadows with a variety of animals, seemingly at one with nature. In the middle of the background, a large blue globe resembling a fruit pod rises in the middle of a lake. Visible through its circular window is a man holding his right hand close to his partner's genitals, and the bare buttocks of yet another figure hover in the vicinity. According to Fraenger, the [[Erotic art|eroticism]] of the center frame could be considered either as an allegory of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] transition or a playground of corruption.&lt;ref name="Fr10"&gt;Fraenger, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 037.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A group of nude females from the center panel. The head of one female is adorned with two cherries&amp;mdash;a symbol of pride. To her right, a male drinks lustfully from an organic vessel. Behind the group, a male carries a couple encased in a [[mussel]] shell.&lt;ref name="gibson85"&gt;Gibson, 85&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On the right-hand side of the foreground stand a group of three fair and one black-skinned figures. The fair-skinned figures, two males and one female, are covered from head to foot in light-brown body hair. Scholars generally agree that these [[Hirsutism|hirsute]] figures represent wild or primeval humanity but disagree on the symbolism of their inclusion. Art historian Patrik Reuterswärd, for example, posits that they may be seen as "the [[noble savage]]" who represents "an imagined alternative to our civilized life", imbuing the panel with "a more clear-cut primitivistic note".&lt;ref&gt;Reuterswärd, Patrik. "A New Clue to Bosch's Garden of Delights". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 64, No. 4, December 1982. 636–638: 637&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Peter Glum, in contrast, sees the figures as intrinsically connected with whoredom and lust.&lt;ref&gt;Glum 2007, 253–256&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cave to their lower right, a male figure points towards a reclining female who is also covered in hair. The pointing man is the only clothed figure in the panel, and as Fraenger observes, "he is clothed with emphatic austerity right up to his throat".&lt;ref name="F139"&gt;Fraenger, 139&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is one of the few human figures with dark hair. According to Fraenger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way this man's dark hair grows, with the sharp dip in the middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the masculine M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression—already suggested by the eyes—of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.&lt;ref name="F139" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 038.jpg|thumb|left|260px|A group of figures pluck fruit from a tree. A man carries a large strawberry, while an owl is in the foreground.]]
The pointing man has variously been described as either the patron of the work (Fraenger in 1947), as an advocate of Adam denouncing Eve (Dirk Bax in 1956), as Saint [[John the Baptist]] in his camel's skin (Isabel Mateo Goméz in 1963),&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;Reuterswärd, 636&lt;/ref&gt; or as a self-portrait.&lt;ref name="b57"/&gt; The woman below him lies within a semicylindrical transparent shield, while her mouth is sealed, devices implying that she bears a secret. To their left, a man crowned by leaves lies on top of what appears to be an actual but gigantic [[strawberry]], and is joined by a male and female who contemplate another equally huge strawberry.&lt;ref name="Reuter"/&gt;

There is no perspectival order in the foreground; instead it comprises a series of small motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an [[amniotic fluid]] bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in a transparent cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 48–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The pools in the fore and background contain bathers of both sexes. In the central circular pool, the sexes are mostly segregated, with several females adorned by peacocks and fruit.&lt;ref name ="gibson85" /&gt; Four women carry cherry-like fruits on their heads, perhaps a symbol of pride at the time, as has been deduced from the contemporaneous saying: "Don't eat cherries with great lords—they'll throw the pits in your face."&lt;ref name="glunm51"&gt;Glum, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The women are surrounded by a parade of naked men riding horses, donkeys, [[unicorn]]s, camels and other exotic or fantastic creatures.&lt;ref name="Belting47"/&gt; Several men show [[acrobatics]] while riding, apparently acts designed to gain the females' attention, which highlights the attraction felt between the two sexes as groups.&lt;ref name ="gibson85"/&gt; The two outer springs also contain both men and women cavorting with abandon. Around them, birds infest the water while winged fish crawl on land. Humans inhabit giant [[Seashell|shells]]. All are surrounded by oversized fruit pods and eggshells, and both humans and animals feast on strawberries and cherries.

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) - WGA2516.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Detail showing nudes within a transparent sphere, which is the fruit of a plant]]

The impression of a life lived without consequence, or what art historian Hans Belting describes as "unspoilt and pre-moral existence", is underscored by the absence of children and old people.&lt;ref name="Belting54"&gt;Belting, 54&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second and third chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Adam and Eve's children were born after they were expelled from Eden. This has led some commentators, in particular Belting, to theorise that the panel represents the world if the two had not been driven out "among the thorns and thistles of the world". In Fraenger's view, the scene illustrates "a [[utopia]], a garden of divine delight before the Fall, or—since Bosch could not deny the existence of the dogma of [[original sin]]—a millennial condition that would arise if, after expiation of Original Sin, humanity were permitted to return to Paradise and to a state of tranquil harmony embracing all Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In the high distance of the background, above the hybrid stone formations, four groups of people and creatures are seen in flight. On the immediate left a human male rides on a [[chthonic]] solar eagle-lion. The human carries a triple-branched [[tree of life]] on which perches a bird; according to Fraenger "a symbolic bird of death". Fraenger believes the man is intended to represent a genius, "he is the symbol of the extinction of the duality of the sexes, which are resolved in the ether into their original state of unity".&lt;ref name="F135"&gt;Fraenger, 135&lt;/ref&gt; To their right a knight with a dolphin tail sails on a winged fish. The knight's tail curls back to touch the back of his head, which references the common symbol of eternity: the [[ouroboros|snake biting its own tail]]. On the immediate right of the panel, a winged youth soars upwards carrying a fish in his hands and a falcon on his back.&lt;ref name="F135"/&gt; According to Belting, in these passages Bosch's "imagination triumphs&amp;nbsp;... the ambivalence of [his] visual syntax exceeds even the enigma of content, opening up that new dimension of freedom by which painting becomes art."&lt;ref name="b57" /&gt; Fraenger titled his chapter on the high background "The Ascent to Heaven", and wrote that the airborne figures were likely intended as a link between "what is above" and "what is below", just as the left and right hand panels represent "what was" and "what will be".&lt;ref name="F136"&gt;Fraenger, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right panel====
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Triptych of Garden of Earthly Delights (detail) - WGA2526.jpg|thumb|right|380px|A scene from the hellscape panel showing the long beams of light emitted from the burning city in the panel's background&lt;ref name="Gibson92"/&gt;]]

The right panel (220 × 97.5&amp;nbsp;cm, 87 × 38.4&amp;nbsp;in) illustrates [[Hell]], the setting of a number of Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to [[evil]] and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling quality&amp;mdash;rendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterways&amp;mdash;and presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution.&lt;ref name="Belting38"&gt;Belting, 38&lt;/ref&gt; In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, [[The infernal names|infernal]] taverns, and [[demon]]s in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground.&lt;ref name="Belting35"&gt;Belting, 35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nudity|nakedness]] of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands, ashamed by their nakedness.

Large explosions in the background throw light through the city gates and spill into the water in the midground; according to writer Walter S. Gibson, "their fiery reflection turning the water below into blood".&lt;ref name="Gibson92"/&gt; The light illuminates a road filled with fleeing figures, while hordes of tormentors prepare to burn a neighbouring village.&lt;ref name="Belting44"&gt;Belting, 44&lt;/ref&gt; A short distance away, a rabbit carries an impaled and bleeding corpse, while a group of victims above are thrown into a burning lantern.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The foreground is populated by a variety of distressed or tortured figures. Some are shown vomiting or excreting, others are crucified by harp and lute, in an [[allegory]] of music, thus sharpening the contrast between pleasure and torture. A choir sings from a score inscribed on a pair of buttocks,&lt;ref name="Belting38" /&gt; part of a group that has been described as the "Musicians' Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bosch Jardin des delices detail.jpg|left|thumb|The "Tree-Man" of the right panel, and a pair of human ears brandishing a blade. A cavity in the torso is populated by three naked persons at a table, seated on an animal, and a fully clothed woman pouring drink from a barrel.]]

The focal point of the scene is the "Tree-Man", whose cavernous torso is supported by what could be contorted arms or rotting tree trunks. His head supports a disk populated by demons and victims parading around a huge set of bagpipes&amp;mdash;often used as a dual sexual symbol&lt;ref name="Belting38" /&gt;&amp;mdash;reminiscent of human [[scrotum]] and [[penis]]. The tree-man's torso is formed from a broken eggshell, and the supporting trunk has thorn-like branches which pierce the fragile body. A grey figure in a hood bearing an arrow jammed between his buttocks climbs a ladder into the tree-man's central cavity, where nude men sit in a tavern-like setting. The tree-man gazes outwards beyond the viewer, his conspiratorial expression a mix of wistfulness and resignation.&lt;ref name="Gibson98"&gt;Gibson, 97&amp;ndash;98&lt;/ref&gt; Belting wondered if the tree-man's face is a self-portrait, citing the figure's "expression of irony and the slightly sideways gaze [which would] then constitute the signature of an artist who claimed a bizarre pictorial world for his own personal imagination".&lt;ref name="Belting38" /&gt;

Many elements in the panel incorporate earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, Bosch is innovative in that he describes hell not as a fantastical space, but as a realistic world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.

[[File:Bosch the Prince of Hell with a cauldron on his head.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Gibson compares this "Prince of Hell" to a figure in the 12th-century Irish religious text ''[[Visio Tnugdali|Vision of Tundale]]'', who feeds on the souls of corrupt and lecherous clergy.&lt;ref name="Gibson98"/&gt;]]

Animals are shown punishing humans, subjecting them to nightmarish torments that may symbolise the [[seven deadly sins]], matching the torment to the sin. Sitting on an object that may be a toilet or a throne, the panel's centerpiece is a gigantic bird-headed monster feasting on human corpses, which he excretes through a cavity below him,&lt;ref name="Belting35"/&gt; into the transparent chamber pot on which he sits.&lt;ref name="Gibson98" /&gt; The monster is sometimes referred to as the "Prince of Hell", a name derived from the [[cauldron]] he wears on his head, perhaps representing a debased crown.&lt;ref name="Belting35"/&gt; To his feet a female has her face reflected on the buttocks of a demon. Further to the left, next to a hare-headed demon, a group of naked persons around a toppled gambling table are being massacred with swords and knives. Other brutal violence is shown by a knight torn down and eaten up by a pack of wolves to the right of the tree-man.

During the [[Middle Ages]], [[History of human sexuality|sexuality]] and lust were seen, by some, as evidence of humanity's [[Fall of Man|fall from grace]]. In the eyes of some viewers, this sin is depicted in the left-hand panel through Adam's, allegedly lustful, gaze towards Eve, and it has been proposed that the center panel was created as a warning to the viewer to avoid a life of sinful pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the penalty for such sins is shown in the right panel of the triptych. In the lower right-hand corner, a man is approached by a pig wearing the veil of a nun. The pig is shown trying to seduce the man to sign legal documents. Lust is further said to be symbolised by the gigantic musical instruments and by the choral singers in the left foreground of the panel. Musical instruments often carried erotic connotations in works of art of the period, and lust was referred to in moralising sources as the "music of the flesh". There has also been the view that Bosch's use of music here might be a rebuke against traveling minstrels, often thought of as purveyors of bawdy song and verse.&lt;ref name="Bosing60"&gt;Bosing, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and provenance==
[[File:Henry III of Nassau-Breda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bernard van Orley]], ''[[Henry III of Nassau-Breda]]'', (1483–1538), who may have been the patron of Bosch's triptych. Henry III was well known as an avid collector of art.&lt;ref name="Bosing60"/&gt;]]
The dating of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' is uncertain. [[Ludwig von Baldass]] (1917) considered the painting to be an early work by Bosch.&lt;ref&gt;Baldass, Ludwig von, "Die Chronologie der Gemälde des Hieronymus Bosch", in: ''Jahrbuch der königlichen Preuszischen Kunstsammlungen'', XXXVIII (1917), pp. 177&amp;ndash;195&lt;/ref&gt; However, since De Tolnay (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Tolnay, Charles de ''Hieronymus Bosch''. Basel, 1937&lt;/ref&gt; consensus among 20th-century art historians placed the work in 1503–1504 or even later. Both early and late datings were based on the "archaic" treatment of space.&lt;ref name="cinotti99"/&gt; [[Dendrochronology]] dates the oak of the panels between the years 1460 and 1466, providing an earliest date (''[[terminus post quem]]'') for the work.&lt;ref name="Glum073"&gt;Glum 2007, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Wood used for panel paintings during this period customarily underwent a lengthy period of storage for [[Wood drying|seasoning]] purposes, so the age of the oak might be expected to predate the actual date of the painting by several years. Internal evidence, specifically the depiction of a [[pineapple]] (a "[[New World]]" fruit), suggests that the painting itself postdates [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' voyages]] to the [[Americas]], between 1492 and 1504.&lt;ref name="Glum073"/&gt; The dendrochronological research brought Vermet&lt;ref&gt;Vermet, Bernard M..

[[File:Engelbrecht-II-Nassau.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Engelbert II of Nassau|Engelbrecht II of Nassau]]'' (1451–1504) in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]]]

''The Garden'' was first documented in 1517, one year after the artist's death, when Antonio de Beatis, a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] from [[Molfetta]], Italy, described the work as part of the decoration in the town palace of the [[Count]]s of the [[House of Nassau]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Steppe1962"&gt;This fact was only discovered by J. K. Steppe in 1962 (Jaarboek van de Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wegenschaften 24 [1962], 166-67), 20&amp;nbsp;years after Fraenger speculated the triptych was commissioned by the grand master of a heretical sect, but five years before Gombrich claimed to have discovered the Nassau provenance. In Belting, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The palace was a high-profile location, a house often visited by heads of state and leading court figures. The prominence of the painting has led some to conclude that the work was commissioned, and not "solely&amp;nbsp;... a flight of the imagination".&lt;ref name="Belting71"&gt;Belting, 71&lt;/ref&gt; A description of the triptych in 1605 called it the "strawberry painting", because the fruit of the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''madroño'' in Spanish) features prominently in the center panel. Early Spanish writers referred to the work as ''La Lujuria'' ("Lust").&lt;ref name="cinotti99"/&gt;

The aristocracy of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], influenced by the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] movement, were the most likely collectors of Bosch's paintings, but there are few records of the location of his works in the years immediately following his death.&lt;ref&gt;Moxey, 107–108. Works commissioned and owned by churches or royalty are more likely to have surviving documentation&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that the patron of the work was [[Engelbert II of Nassau|Engelbrecht II of Nassau]], who died in 1504, or his successor [[Henry III of Nassau-Breda]], the [[Stadtholder|governor]] of several of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] provinces in the [[Low Countries]]. De Beatis wrote in his travel journal that "there are some panels on which bizarre things have been painted. They represent seas, skies, woods, meadows, and many other things, such as people crawling out of a shell, others that bring forth birds, men and women, white and blacks doing all sorts of different activities and poses."&lt;ref name="Silver"&gt;Silver, Larry.

Retrieved April 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Because the triptych was publicly displayed in the palace of the House of Nassau, it was visible to many, and Bosch's reputation and fame quickly spread across Europe. The work's popularity can be measured by the numerous surviving copies&amp;mdash;in oil, engraving and tapestry&amp;mdash;commissioned by wealthy patrons, as well as by the number of forgeries in circulation after his death.&lt;ref name="bruegel"&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about/press/2003/bosch_bruegel.htm Bosch and Bruegel: Inventions, Enigmas and Variations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609185547/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about/press/2003/bosch_bruegel.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}". The National Gallery, London. Press release archive, November 2003. Retrieved May 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of the central panel only and do not deviate from the original. These copies were usually painted on a much smaller scale, and they vary considerably in quality. Many were created a generation after Bosch, and some took the form of wall [[tapestry|tapestries]].&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 79–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The De Beatis description, only rediscovered by Steppe in the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Steppe1962"/&gt; cast new light on the commissioning of a work that was previously thought&amp;mdash;since it has no central religious image&amp;mdash;to be an atypical [[altarpiece]]. Many Netherlandish [[diptych]]s intended for private use are known, and even a few triptychs, but the Bosch panels are unusually large compared with these and contain no [[Patronage|donor]] portraits. Possibly they were commissioned to celebrate a wedding, as large Italian paintings for private houses frequently were.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 77–80&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''The Garden''{{'}}s bold depictions do not rule out a church commission, such was the contemporaneous fervor to warn against immorality.&lt;ref name="cinotti99"&gt;Cinotti, 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1566, the triptych served as the model for a [[tapestry]] that hangs at [[El Escorial]] monastery near Madrid.&lt;ref name="Snyder96"&gt;Snyder 1977, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Henry III, the painting passed into the hands of his nephew [[William the Silent]], the founder of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] and leader of the [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spain. In 1568, however, the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] confiscated the picture and brought it to Spain, where it became the property of one Don Fernando, the Duke's illegitimate son and heir and the Spanish commander in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Belting, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbroeck, Paul. "High stakes in Brussels, 1567. ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' as the crux of the conflict between William the Silent and the Duke of Alva", in Koldeweij, et al. 2001b, 87–90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] acquired the painting at auction in 1591; two years later he presented it to El Escorial. A contemporaneous description of the transfer records the gift on 8 July 1593&lt;ref name="cinotti99"/&gt; of a "painting in oils, with two wings depicting the variety of the world, illustrated with grotesqueries by Hieronymus Bosch, known as 'Del Madroño'".&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 26&lt;/ref&gt; After an unbroken 342 years at El Escorial, the work moved to the [[Museo del Prado]] in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Prado, 36&lt;/ref&gt; along with other works by Bosch. The triptych is not particularly well-preserved; the paint of the middle panel especially has flaked off around joints in the wood.&lt;ref name="cinotti99"/&gt;&lt;!--restoration--&gt;

Little is known for certain of the life of [[List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch|Hieronymus Bosch]] or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the [[iconography]] of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 1&lt;/ref&gt; Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish artist]].&lt;ref name="Snyder 2004, 395–396."&gt;Snyder 2004, 395–396&lt;/ref&gt; His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous [[Esotericism|esoteric knowledge]] since lost to history.

His age in this representation (believed to be around 60&amp;nbsp;years) has been used to estimate his date of birth, although its attribution remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 16&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although Bosch's career flourished during the [[Renaissance painting|High Renaissance]], he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held [[moral authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 14&lt;/ref&gt; He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.&lt;ref name="Snyder 2004, 395–396."/&gt;
[[José de Sigüenza]] is credited with the first extensive critique of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'', in his 1605 ''History of the Order of St. Jerome''.&lt;ref name="Gomez22"&gt;Gómez, 22&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels "are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind".&lt;ref name="Gomez22"/&gt; The art historian [[Carl Justi]] observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by "the news of recently discovered [[Atlantis]] and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise".&lt;ref&gt;Fraenger, 57&lt;/ref&gt; The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the [[New World]] sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Although the triptych contains many unearthly and fantastic creatures, Bosch still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience. Bosch reproduces a scene from [[Martin Schongauer]]'s engraving ''Flight into Egypt''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Conquest in Africa and the East provided both wonder and terror to European intellectuals, as it led to the conclusion that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. ''The Garden'' references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriac of Ancona]], a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.&lt;ref name="Koldeweij"&gt;Vandenbroeck, Paul. "The Spanish ''inventarios reales'' and Hieronymus Bosch", in Koldeweij et al., 49–63:59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyriacus vs Bosch giraffe.jpg|left|thumb|The [[giraffe]] on the right side of the left panel may be drawn from copies of those in [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriac of Ancona]]'s ''Egyptian Voyage'' (left), which was published {{circa|1440}}.&lt;ref name="B26" /&gt;]]

The charting and conquest of this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional [[Utopia]]n representation, as exemplified by the writings of [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535).&lt;ref name="B98-99"&gt;Belting, 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albrecht Dürer]] was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited [['s-Hertogenbosch]] during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeffrey Chipps. "Netherlandish Artists and Art in Renaissance Nuremberg". ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Volume 20, Number 2/3, 1990–1991. 153–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] wrote in 1953 that, "In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of "decoding Jerome Bosch", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Moxey, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosch was christened Jeroen van Aken but took surname Bosch from the town he lived in for most of his life. Hieronymus is the Latin form of Jerome. In Rooth, 12. {{ISBN|951-41-0673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist [[Desiderius Erasmus]] has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries&amp;nbsp;... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the Son? Could God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?"&lt;ref&gt;Glum, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 030.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from the center panel showing two cherry-adorned dancing figures who carry a surface on which an owl is perched. In the front right corner a bird standing on a reclining human's foot is about to eat from a cherry offered to it.]]Because only bare details are known of Bosch's life, interpretation of his work can be an extremely difficult area for academics as it is largely reliant on conjecture. Individual motifs and elements of symbolism may be explained, but so far relating these to each other and to his work as a whole has remained elusive.&lt;ref name="dixon" /&gt; The enigmatic scenes depicted on the panels of the inner triptych of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' have been studied by many scholars, who have often arrived at contradictory interpretations.&lt;ref name="Silver" /&gt; Analyses based on symbolic systems ranging from the [[alchemy|alchemical]], [[astrology|astrological]], and [[heresy|heretical]] to the [[folklore|folkloric]] and [[unconscious mind|subconscious]] have all attempted to explain the complex objects and ideas presented in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. "Bosch's 'Garden of Earthly Delights': A Progress Report". ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Volume 32, 1969: 162&amp;ndash;170&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, Bosch's paintings were generally thought to incorporate attitudes of [[Medieval literature|Medieval didactic literature]] and sermons. Charles De Tolnay wrote that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The oldest writers, [[Dominicus Lampsonius]] and [[Karel van Mander]], attached themselves to his most evident side, to the subject; their conception of Bosch, inventor of fantastic pieces of devilry and of infernal scenes, which prevails today (1937) in the public at large, and prevailed with historians until the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Grange Books, 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Generally, his work is described as a warning against lust, and the central panel as a representation of the transience of worldly pleasure. In 1960, the art historian Ludwig von Baldass wrote that Bosch shows "how sin came into the world through the Creation of Eve, how fleshly lusts spread over the entire earth, promoting all the [[Seven deadly sins|Deadly Sins]], and how this necessarily leads straight to Hell".&lt;ref&gt;von Baldass, 84&lt;/ref&gt; De Tolnay wrote that the center panel represents "the nightmare of humanity", where "the artist's purpose above all is to show the evil consequences of sensual pleasure and to stress its ephemeral character".&lt;ref&gt;Glum, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of this view hold that the painting is a sequential narrative, depicting mankind's initial state of innocence in Eden, followed by the subsequent corruption of that innocence, and finally its punishment in Hell. At various times in its history, the triptych has been known as ''La Lujuria'', ''The Sins of the World'' and ''The Wages of Sin''.&lt;ref name="Fr10"/&gt;

Proponents of this idea point out that moralists during Bosch's era believed that it was woman's&amp;mdash;ultimately Eve's&amp;mdash;temptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of [[femininity]] was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]] shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the ''Pool of Youth'' similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.&lt;ref name ="gibson85" /&gt;

This line of reasoning is consistent with interpretations of Bosch's other major moralising works which hold up the folly of man; the ''[[Death and the Miser]]'' and the Haywain. Although each of these works is rendered in a manner, according to the art historian Walter Bosing, that it is difficult to believe "Bosch intended to condemn what he painted with such visually enchanting forms and colors." Bosing concluded however that a medieval mindset was naturally suspicious of material beauty, in any form, and that the sumptuousness of Bosch's description may have been intended to convey a false paradise, teeming with transient beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Bosing, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Wilhelm Fränger argued that the triptych's center panel portrays a joyous world when mankind will experience a rebirth of the innocence enjoyed by Adam and Eve before their [[Fall of Man|fall]].&lt;ref name="Snyder100"&gt;Snyder 1977, 100&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Millennium of Hieronymus Bosch'', Fränger wrote that Bosch was a member of the heretical sect known as the [[Adamites]]&amp;mdash;who were also known as the ''Homines intelligentia'' and [[Brethren of the Free Spirit|Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit]]. This radical group, active in the area of the [[Rhine]] and the Netherlands, strove for a form of spirituality immune from sin even in the flesh and imbued the concept of lust with a paradisical innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Grange books, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Fränger believed ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' was commissioned by the order's Grand Master. Later critics have agreed that, because of their obscure complexity, Bosch's "altarpieces" may well have been commissioned for non-devotional purposes. The ''Homines intelligentia'' cult sought to regain the innocent sexuality enjoyed by Adam and Eve before the Fall. Fränger writes that the figures in Bosch's work "are peacefully frolicking about the tranquil garden in vegetative innocence, at one with animals and plants and the sexuality that inspires them seems to be pure joy, pure bliss."&lt;ref&gt;Bosing, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Fränger argued against the notion that the hellscape shows the retribution handed down for sins committed in the center panel. Fränger saw the figures in the garden as peaceful, naive, and innocent in expressing their sexuality, and at one with nature. In contrast, those being punished in Hell comprise "musicians, gamblers, desecrators of judgment and punishment".&lt;ref name="Fr10"/&gt;

Examining the symbolism in Bosch's art&amp;mdash;"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"&amp;mdash;Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'', ''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)|Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'', and ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''. Fränger distinguished these pieces from the artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult.&lt;ref&gt;Grange Books, 32&lt;/ref&gt; While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and what can only be conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-[[Medieval painting|Medieval painter]].&lt;ref&gt;Grange Books, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Fränger's thesis stimulated others to examine ''The Garden'' more closely. Writer Carl Linfert also senses the joyfulness of the people in the center panel, but rejects Fränger's assertion that the painting is a "doctrinaire" work espousing the "guiltless sexuality" of the Adamite sect.&lt;ref name="linfert112"&gt;Linfert, 112&lt;/ref&gt; While the figures engage in amorous acts without any suggestion of the forbidden, Linfert points to the elements in the center panel suggesting death and temporality: some figures turn away from the activity, seeming to lose hope in deriving pleasure from the passionate frolicking of their cohorts. Writing in 1969, E. H Gombrich drew on a close reading of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospel According to Saint Matthew]] to suggest that the central panel is, according to Linfert, "the state of mankind on the eve of [[Deluge (mythology)|the Flood]], when men still pursued pleasure with no thought of the morrow, their only sin the unawareness of sin."&lt;ref name="linfert112"/&gt;

Because Bosch was such a unique and visionary artist, his influence has not spread as widely as that of other major painters of his era. However, there have been instances of later artists incorporating elements of ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' into their own work. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] (c. 1525–1569) in particular directly acknowledged Bosch as an important influence and inspiration,&lt;ref&gt;Burness, Donald B. "Pieter Bruegel: Painter for Poets". ''Art Journal'', Volume 32, No. 2, Winter, 1972–1973. 157–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Jonathan. "[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1123930,00.html The end of innocents]". ''The Guardian'', January 17, 2004. Retrieved May 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated many elements of the inner right panel into several of his most popular works. Bruegel's ''[[Dull Gret|Mad Meg]]'' depicts a peasant woman leading an army of women to pillage Hell, while his ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' (c. 1562) echoes the monstrous Hellscape of ''The Garden'', and utilizes, according to the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]], the same "unbridled imagination and the fascinating colours".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://museum.antwerpen.be/mayervandenbergh/collectie_2_eng.html Mad Meg by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 1561–62]". Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. Retrieved May 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Italian court painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] ({{circa|1527–1593}}) did not create Hellscapes, he painted a body of strange and "fantastic" vegetable portraits&amp;mdash;generally heads of people composed of plants, roots, webs and various other organic matter. These strange portraits rely on and echo a motif that was in part inspired by Bosch's willingness to break from strict and faithful representations of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/arts/design/10arci.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Arcimboldo's Feast for the Eyes]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 10, 2007. Retrieved May 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo - Winter, 1573.jpg|220px|thumb|left|[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], ''Winter'', 1573. The concept of the "Tree-man", the hybrid organism, as well the engorged fruit, all bear hallmarks of Bosch's ''Garden''.]]

[[David Teniers the Younger]] ({{circa|1610–1690}}) was a Flemish painter who quoted both Bosch and Bruegel throughout his career in such works as his versions of the ''Temptation of St Anthony'', the ''Rich Man in Hell'' and his version of ''Mad Meg''.

During the early 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early [[Surrealism|surrealists]]' fascination with [[Dream art|dreamscapes]], the autonomy of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with [[Joan Miró]]&lt;ref name="Miro"&gt;Moray, Gerta. "Miró, Bosch and Fantasy Painting". ''The Burlington Magazine'', Volume 113, No. 820, July 1971. 387–391&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Salvador Dalí]]&lt;ref name="Fanés"&gt;Fanés, Fèlix. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bDpziok_K7gC&amp;pg=RA1-PA121 Salvador Dalí: The Construction of the Image, 1925&amp;ndash;1930]''. Yale University Press, March, 2007. 121. {{ISBN|0-300-09179-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' in the [[Museo del Prado]], and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' contains several parallels to Bosch's ''Garden'': similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work.&lt;ref name="Miro" /&gt; Dalí's 1929 ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' is similar to an image on the right side of the left panel of Bosch's ''Garden'', composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.&lt;ref&gt;Félix Fanès: ''Salvador Dalí. The Construction of the Image 1925–1930''. Yale University Press 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-300-09179-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[André Breton]] wrote his first [[Surrealist Manifesto]] in 1924, his historical precedents as inclusions named only [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paolo Uccello|Uccello]]. However, the Surrealist movement soon rediscovered Bosch and Breughel, who quickly became popular among the Surrealist painters. [[René Magritte]] and [[Max Ernst]]&lt;ref&gt;Moray, Gerta. "Miró, Bosch and Fantasy Painting". ''The Burlington Magazine'', Volume 113, No. 820, July 1971. ''Max Ernst's favourite painters and poets of the past'', p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; both were inspired by Bosch's ''The Garden of Earthly Delights''.

'''''The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov''''' (in some British editions, '''''The Collected Stories''''') is a posthumous collection of every known short story that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] ever wrote, with the exception of "[[The Enchanter]]". The thirteen stories not previously published in English are translated by the author's son, [[Dmitri Nabokov]]. The collection was first published in America by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1995.

The collection includes 65 stories (including one that was long considered lost, but discovered shortly before the latest edition of the volume).

{{Campaignbox Civil Wars of the Early Caliphates}}
The '''Third [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]''' ({{lang-ar|الفتنة الثاﻟﺜـة}}; ''al-Fitna al-thālitha''), was a series of civil wars and uprisings against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] beginning with the overthrow of Caliph [[al-Walid II]] in 744 and ending with the victory of [[Marwan II]] over the various rebels and rivals for the caliphate in 747. However, Umayyad authority under Marwan II was never fully restored, and the civil war flowed into the [[Abbasid Revolution]] (746–750) which culminated in the overthrow of the Umayyads and the establishment of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 749/50. Thus a clear chronological delimitation of this conflict is not possible.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=90}}

== Usurpation of Yazid III ==
[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Old map of western Eurasia and northern Africa showing the expansion of the Caliphate from Arabia to cover most of the Middle East, with the Byzantine Empire outlined in green|The expansion of the Muslim Caliphate until 750, from [[William R.

The civil war began with the overthrow of [[al-Walid II]] (743–744), the son of [[Yazid II]] (r. 720–724). Al-Walid had been designated by his father as the successor of the latter's brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 724–743), and although his accession had initially been well received due to Hisham's unpopularity and his decision to increase army pay, the mood quickly changed. Al-Walid is reported to have been more interested in earthly pleasures than in religion, a reputation that may be confirmed by the decoration of the so-called "desert palaces" (including [[Qasr Amra|Qusayr Amra]] and [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]]) that have been attributed to him.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=90–91}} His accession was resented by some members of the Umayyad family itself, and this hostility deepened when al-Walid designated his two underage sons as his heirs and flogged and imprisoned his cousin, [[Sulayman ibn Hisham]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=91–92}} Further opposition arose through his persecution of the [[Al-Qadariyya|Qadariyya]] sect,{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=92}} and through his implication in the ever-present [[Qays and Yaman tribes|rivalry]] between the northern ([[Qays]]i and [[Mudar]]i) and southern ([[Kalb]]i and [[Yemen]]i) Arab tribes. Like his father, al-Walid was seen as pro-Qays, especially following his appointment of [[Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi]] as governor of [[Iraq]], and the torture and death of Yusuf's Yemeni predecessor, [[Khalid al-Qasri]]. It must be noted though that adherence was not clear cut, and men from both sides of the divide joined the other.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=93}}

In April 744, [[Yazid III]], a son of [[al-Walid I]] (r. 705–715), entered Damascus. His supporters, bolstered by many Kalbis from the surrounding region, seized the town and proclaimed him caliph. Al-Walid II, who was at one of his desert palaces, fled to al-Bakhra near [[Palmyra]]. He mustered a small force of local Kalbis and Qaysis from [[Hims]], but when Yazid III's far larger army under [[Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Hajjaj ibn Abd al-Malik]] arrived, most of his adherents fled. Al-Walid II was killed, and his severed head sent to Damascus.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=93–94}} A pro-Qaysi uprising in Hims followed, under the Sufyanid [[Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani]], but its march on Damascus was decisively defeated by the released Sulayman ibn Hisham. Abu Muhammad was thrown into prison in Damascus along with al-Walid II's sons.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=94}}

During his brief reign, Yazid showed himself an exemplary ruler, modelling himself on the pious [[Umar II]] (r. 717–720). He was favourably disposed to the Qadariyya, and consciously tried to disassociate himself from the frequent criticism of autocratic rule levelled at his Umayyad predecessors. Thus he promised to refrain from abuses of his power—mostly concerning widespread resentment at heavy taxation, the enrichment of the Umayyads and their adherents, the preference given to Syria over other parts of the Caliphate, and the long absence of soldiers on distant campaigns—and insisted that not only was he chosen by the community in an assembly (''shura''), rather than appointed, but that the community had the right to depose him if he failed in his duties or if they found someone more fit to lead them.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=94–95}} At the same time, his reign saw the renewed ascendancy of the Yemenis, with Yusuf ibn Umar dismissed and imprisoned after trying, without success, to raise the Qaysis of Iraq into revolt. Yusuf's successor in Iraq and the East was the Kalbi [[Mansur ibn Jumhur]], but he was soon replaced by the son of Umar II, [[Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]. During his brief tenure, Mansur tried to dismiss the governor of [[Khurasan]], [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]], but the latter managed to maintain his post.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=96}} Yazid died in September 744 after a reign of barely six months. Apparently due to the advice of the Qadariyya, he had appointed his brother, [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid|Ibrahim]], as his successor, but he did not enjoy much support and was immediately faced with the revolt of [[Marwan II]] (r. 744–750), the grandson of [[Marwan I]] (r. 684–685) and governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=96}}

== Rise of Marwan II ==
Marwan, who had for several years supervised the campaigns against the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Khazars]] on the Caliphate's northwestern frontiers, had reportedly considered claiming the caliphate already at the death of al-Walid II, but a Kalbi rebellion in his rear had forced him to turn back. Yazid III appointed him to Upper Mesopotamia, and Marwan installed himself in the Qays-dominated city of [[Harran]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=96–97}}

===Syria===
Following Yazid's death, Marwan marched into Syria, at first claiming that he came as the champion of al-Walid II's imprisoned sons. The local Qaysis of the northern districts of [[Qinnasrin]] and Hims flocking to his banner, until at some point on the road leading from [[Baalbek]] to Damascus, Marwan was confronted by Sulayman ibn Hisham. Likewise an experienced commander, Sulayman was at the head of his Dhakwaniyya private army and the Kalbis of southern Syria, but Marwan emerged victorious, with Sulayman fleeing to Damascus.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=97}} Marwan obliged the captives from Sulayman's army to pledge allegiance to al-Walid II's sons, whereupon they were killed by [[Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri]] on Sulayman's orders, along with Yusuf al-Thaqafi. Sulayman and his adherents, including the caliph-designate Ibrahim, then fled to Palmyra.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=97}}

[[File:Dirham of Marwan II ibn Muhammad, AH 127-132.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Silver ''[[dirham]]'' of Marwan II]]
Marwan was thus able to enter Damascus peacefully in December 744, and was declared caliph. Marwan avoided reprisals and followed a conciliatory policy, allowing the Syrian districts (''[[jund|ajnad]]'') to choose their own governors. After a short while, Sulayman ibn Hisham and Ibrahim likewise gave up their resistance and came to Damascus to submit.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=97–98}} Marwan's hold on power seemed secure, but he then chose to move his capital from Damascus to the military centre of Harran. As [[Gerald Hawting]] writes, "[f]or the first time a caliph seemed to have abandoned Syria altogether", and this act only served to fuel mistrust and resentment by the defeated Kalbis against Marwan.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=98}} As a result, in summer 745 the Kalbis of [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]] rose in revolt under the local governor, [[Thabit ibn Nu'aym]]. The revolt soon spread across Syria, event to ostensibly loyal Qaysi areas like Hims. Marwan was thus obliged to return to Syria and reduce the uprising city by city. After forcing Hims to surrender, Marwan relieved Damascus from its siege by Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri, who was killed. He then rescued [[Tiberias]], which was being besieged by Thabit ibn Nu'aym, and proceeded to defeat, capture and execute both Thabit and his sons. Following Marwan's attack on the Kalbi stronghold of Palmyra, the Kalbi leader Abrash al-Kalbi also made terms.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=97, 98–99}}

With Syria apparently back in his grip, Marwan ordered the members of the Umayyad dynasty to gather around him and named his two sons as his heirs. Marwan then focused his attention on Iraq, where an army under [[Yazid ibn Hubayra]] was already trying to gain control of the province for him. Marwan assembled a new army to send to Ibn Hubayra's aid, but at Rusafa it mutinied, and accepted Sulayman ibn Hisham as its leader. The rebel army took Qinnasrin, and once again many Syrians dissatisfied with Marwan joined them, but Marwan brought the bulk of his forces from Iraq and defeated the rebels near Qinnasrin. Sulayman ibn Hisham was able to escape again to Palmyra, and thence fled to [[Kufa]], but most of his surviving troops withdrew to Hims under the command of his brother Sa'id, where they were soon besieged by Marwan's forces. The siege lasted through the winter of 745–746, but in the end Hims surrendered.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=99}} Enraged at the repeated Syrian revolts despite his earlier leniency, Marwan now, in the summer of 746, moved to prevent any further resistance by tearing down the walls of most important Syrian towns, including Damascus and possibly even [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=99}}

===Egypt and Iraq===
Opposition to Marwan and his Qaysis was also evident in [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]], where the governor [[Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami]], a member of the traditionally dominant local Arab settler community, tried to use the turmoil of the civil war to restore its pre-eminence in Egyptian affairs: the Syrians were forcibly expelled from the capital [[Fustat]], and Hafs set about recruiting a force of 30,000 men, named ''Hafsiya'' after him, from among the native non-Arab converts ("''maqamisa''" and "''[[mawali]]''"). Marwan sent Hasan ibn Atahiya to replace him and ordered the ''Hafsiya'' disbanded, but the latter refused to accept the order to disband and mutinied, besieging the new governor in his residence until he and his ''[[sahib al-shurta]]'' both were forced to leave Egypt. Hafs, though unwilling, was restored by the mutinous troops as governor. In the next year, 745, Marwan dispatched a new governor, [[Hawthara ibn Suhayl al-Bahili]], at the head of a large Syrian army. Despite his supporters' eagerness to resist, Hafs proved willing to surrender his position. Hawthara took Fustat without opposition, but immediately launched a purge, to which Hafs and several ''Hafsiya'' leaders fell victim.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|pp=74–76}}

[[File:Dirham of Abd Allah ibn Mu'awiya.jpg|thumb|250px|Silver ''dirham'' of [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya]], minted in [[Jayy]] ca. 746/7]]
In the meantime, in Iraq, Marwan's rebellion coincided with an [[Alid]] uprising in [[Kufa]], headed by [[Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya]], in October 744. The uprising was soon suppressed by Yazid III's governor, Abdallah ibn Umar, and his Syrian troops, but Ibn Mu'awiya had managed to escape to [[Jibal]]. There volunteers opposed to the Umayyad regime continued to flock to his banner, and he managed to extend his control over large parts of [[Persia]], including most of Jibal, [[Ahwaz]], [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]]. He established his residence first at [[Isfahan]] and then at [[Istakhr]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=99}}{{sfn|Zetterstéen|1987|pp=26–27}} Marwan II appointed a supporter of his own, the Qaysi [[Nadr ibn Sa'id al-Harashi]], as governor of Iraq, but Abdallah ibn Umar retained the loyalty of the Kalbi majority of the Syrian troops, and for several months the two rival governors and their troops confronted and skirmished at each other around [[al-Hira]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=99–100}} This conflict was abruptly ended with the [[Kharijite]] revolt which had begun among the [[Banu Rabi'ah]] tribes in Upper Mesopotamia. Although "northerners", the Rabi'a, and especially the [[Banu Shayban]], were enemies of the Mudar and Qays and opposed Marwan II's takeover.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=100}}

The revolt was initially led by Sa'id ibn Bahdal, but he died soon of the plague, and was succeeded by [[al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani]]. In early 745 they invaded Iraq and defeated both rival Umayyad governors, who had joined forces, in April/May 745. Nadr fled back to Syria to join Marwan, but Ibn Umar and his followers withdrew to [[Wasit]]. In August 745 however Ibn Umar and his supporters surrendered and even embraced Kharijism and Dahhak—who was not even of the [[Quraysh]] tribe of [[Muhammad]]—as their caliph. Ibn Umar was appointed as Dahhak's governor for Wasit, eastern Iraq, and western Persia, while Dahhak governed western Iraq from Kufa.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=100}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1965|p=90}} Taking advantage of the Syrian revolt against Marwan, Dahhak returned to Upper Mesopotamia—probably in spring 746—and while Marwan was occupied by the siege of Hims, he seized [[Mosul]]. More men flocked to his banner, whether out of opposition to Marwan, like Sulayman ibn Hisham and the remnant of his Dhakwaniyya, or because he offered high wages to his followers, and his army is said to have reached 120,000 men. Marwan sent his son Abdallah to oppose Dahhak, but the Kharijite leader managed to blockade him in [[Nisibis]]. Once Hims had fallen, however, Marwan himself campaigned against Dahhak, and in a battle at al-Ghazz in Kafartuta in August/September 746, Dahhak was killed and the Kharijites had to abandon Upper Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=100}}{{sfn|Veccia Vaglieri|1965|p=90}} The Kharijites now selected Abu Dulaf as their leader, and on the advice of Sulayman ibn Hisham they withdrew to the eastern bank of the [[Tigris]]. As Marwan was able to call upon more and more troops to face the Kharijites, however, they were forced to abandon even this position and withdraw further east. Marwan then sent Yazid ibn Hubayra to establish control over Iraq, which he accomplished this by the summer of 747: after defeating the Kharijite governor of Kufa and taking the city, Ibn Hyubayra marched on Wasit, where he took Abdallah ibn Umar prisoner.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=100–101}}

Marwan's capture of Iraq left Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya as the only major leader opposing the Umayyad caliph, and his domain in western Persia became a refuge for the defeated Kharijites of Iraq, and every other opponent of Marwan, including members of the Umayyad family—notably Sulayman ibn Hisham—and even a few [[Abbasids]]. Nevertheless, in a short time Ibn Mu'awiya's forces suffered a decisive defeat by one of Ibn Hubayra's generals. Ibn Mu'awiya fled to Khurasan, where the leader of the [[Abbasid Revolution]], [[Abu Muslim]], had him executed, while Sulayman ibn Hisham and Mansur ibn Jumhur fled to India, where they remained until they died.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=101}}

==Khurasan and the Abbasid Revolution==
Khurasan, the northeasternmost province of the Caliphate, had not escaped the turmoils of the civil war. Yazid III's accession posed a threat to the longtime governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, as the numerous Yemenis in Khurasan sought to replace him with their champion, [[Juday al-Kirmani]]. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the [[Azd]] tribe, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders, but his efforts only led to a general uprising by these tribes under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the [[Muhallabids (clan)|Muhallabids]], an Azdi family that had been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=134}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=76, 107}}{{sfn|Sharon|1990|pp=43–44}} Nasr imprisoned al-Kirmani in the provincial capital, [[Merv]], but he managed to escape in summer 744. Despite Nasr's eventual re-confirmation as governor by Yazid, the rebellion spread among the Arabs of Khurasan, so that Nasr was forced to turn to the exiled rebel [[al-Harith ibn Surayj]]. Al-Kirmani had played a major role in the latter's defeat years ago, and Ibn Surayj's northern Arab ([[Banu Tamim|Tamimi]]) origin made him a natural enemy of the Yemenis. Ibn Surayj however had other designs; gathering a following of many of the Tamimis and the disaffected Arabs of the province, he launched an attack on Merv in March 746. After it failed, he made common cause with al-Kirmani.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=134–136}}{{sfn|Sharon|1990|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=107–108}}

With Marwan II still trying to consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, and western Persia controlled by the Kharijites under Ibn Mu'awiya, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement. The allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv towards the end of the year, and he retreated to the Qaysi stronghold of [[Nishapur]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=108}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=136–137}}{{sfn|Sharon|1990|pp=45–46}} Within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the latter's death. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in Merv, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto ambivalent towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis of Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Merv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimiyya uprising under Abu Muslim. Negotiations commenced, but were almost broken off when a member of Nasr's entourage, an embittered son of Ibn Surayj, attacked and killed al-Kirmani. The two sides were able to tentatively settle their differences, and Nasr re-occupied his seat in Merv.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=108}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=137}}{{sfn|Sharon|1990|pp=46–47}}

[[File:Balami - Tarikhnama - Abu'l-'Abbas al-Saffah is proclaimed the first 'Abbasid Caliph (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Proclamation of [[Abu'l-Abbas al-Saffah]] as the first Abbasid Caliph, from [[Balami]]'s ''Tarikhnama'']]
The exact origins and nature of the Hashimiyya movement are debated among scholars, but by the 740s this movement, which supported the overthrow of the Umayyads and their replacement by a "chosen one from the family of Muhammad", had spread widely among the Arabs of Khurasan. In 746 or 747, Abu Muslim was sent to Khurasan by the Abbasid [[imam]], [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Ali|Ibrahim]], to assume the leadership of the sect there, possibly in order to bring it more under Abbasid control. In a short time Abu Muslim established his control of the Khurasani Hashimiyya, and in summer 747, at the Yemeni village of Sikadanj, the black banners were unfurled, the [[salat|prayer read]] in the name of the Abbasid imam, and the Abbasid Revolution begun.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=109–115}} Abu Muslim soon took advantage of the barely mended Mudari–Yemeni hostility, by persuading al-Kirmani's son and successor Ali that Nasr had been involved in his father's murder. As a result, both Ali al-Kirmani and Nasr separately appealed for aid against each other to Abu Muslim, who now held the balance of power. The latter eventually chose to support the Yemenis, and on 14 February 748, Abu Muslim's army occupied Merv.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=108–109, 115}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=159–160}} Nasr ibn Sayyar once again fled to Nishapur, while Abu Muslim sent the Hashimiyya forces under [[Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i]] to pursue him. Nasr was forced to abandon Nishapur too after his son Tamim was defeated at [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], and retreat to the region of [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]], on the western borderlands of Khurasan. At this point, the long-awaited reinforcements from the Caliph arrived, but their general and Nasr failed to coordinate their movements, and Qahtaba was able to defeat the caliphal army at [[Gurgan]] in August 748 and capture [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=116}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=160–161}} Following the capture of Nishapur, Abu Muslim consolidated his position in Khurasan by murdering Ali ibn Juday al-Kirmani and his brother Uthman.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=116}}

Qahtaba's son [[al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba]] led the siege of [[Nihawand]], where the remnants of the caliphal armies and Nasr ibn Sayyar's followers made their last stand. In March 749, Qahtaba defeated another, bigger, caliphal army near [[Isfahan]]. Bereft of hope of further aid, Nihawand surrendered two or three months later, opening the way to Iraq.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=116}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=161}} Qahtaba led his troops towards Kufa, but on the way they were confronted by Marwan II's governor Yazid ibn Hubayra. After a surprise night attack in which Qahtaba was killed on 27 August 749, Ibn Hubayra was forced to withdraw to Wasit, and al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba led his army into Kufa on 2 September.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=161}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=116–117}} As imam Ibrahim had been imprisoned and executed by Marwan II, he was succeeded by his brother, [[Abu'l-Abbas]], whom the army leaders proclaimed as caliph on 28 November.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=117}} In January 750, at the [[Battle of the Greater Zab]], the Abbasid army decisively defeated the Umayyad army led by Marwan II in person. Pursued by the Abbasids, Marwan was forced to flee to Syria and then Egypt, where he was finally captured and executed in August 750, putting an end to the Umayyad Caliphate.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|pp=117–118}}

'''Ufuk Esin''' (11 October 1933 – 19 January 2008) was a Turkish archaeologist known for pioneering [[archaeological science]] in Turkey and for her excavations at [[Aşıklı Höyük]]. She was a professor at [[Istanbul University]] from 1966 until her retirement in 2000 and was instrumental in founding the [[Turkish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trowelblazers.com/ufuk-esin-a-serious-scientist/|title=Ufuk Esin: A Serious Scientist|last=Hassett|first=Brenna|date=|website=TrowelBlazers|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Esin was born in [[İzmir]] on 11 October 1933, but spent most of her life in Istanbul. She attended the Boğaziçi Lisesinde and [[St. George's Austrian High School]]. She enrolled at [[Istanbul University]] in 1952, initially taking the examinations to study literature, but was inspired to transfer to the newly-founded Department of Prehistory after hearing lectures by [[Kurt Bittel]]. One of only two students to enrol that year, she became the university's first graduate in prehistory in 1956. She then joined the department as Bittel's assistant whilst beginning her doctoral studies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Özbaşaran|first=Mihriban|date=2014-12-24|title=Ufuk Esin|url=http://www.aktuelarkeoloji.com.tr/ufuk-esin|magazine=Aktuel Arkeoloji|issue=43|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittel sent Esin to the [[University of Stuttgart]] to study [[archaeometallurgy]] with [[S. Junghans]]. There she developed an expertise in the [[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of ancient metals, as well as a general passion for [[archaeological science]] that would continue throughout her career. She went on to complete a thesis on prehistoric [[copper]] and bronze mining in Anatolia and was awarded a doctorate in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was appointed an [[associate professor]] ({{Lang-tr|doçent}}) at Istanbul in 1966, and later rose to become a [[Full Professor|full professor]] (1976); head of the department of prehistory (1984–2000); and head of the department of archaeology and art history (1998–2000).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/2486|title=Ufuk Esin|last=|first=|date=|website=Biyografya|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ukrainian''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Ukrainian.ogg|j|uː|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|n|i|ə|n}} ({{lang|uk|українська мова}} {{transl|uk|''ukrajinśka mova''}}) is an [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]]. It is the [[official language|official state language]] of [[Ukraine]] and first of two principal languages of [[Ukrainians]]; it is one of the three official languages in the unrecognized state of [[Transnistria]], the other two being [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Written Ukrainian uses a variant of the [[Cyrillic script]] (see [[Ukrainian alphabet]]).

Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to the [[Old East Slavic]] of the early medieval state of [[Kievan Rus']]. After the fall of the Kievan Rus' as well as the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]], the language developed into a form called the [[Ruthenian language]]. The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. From 1804 until the [[Russian Revolution]], the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the [[Russian Empire]], of which the [[Dnieper Ukraine|biggest part of Ukraine]] (Central, Eastern and Southern) was a part at the time.&lt;ref name="schools"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCZi--UtYdEC&amp;pg=PA216 Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (p. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; It has always maintained a sufficient base in [[Western Ukraine]], where the language was never banned,&lt;ref name="WUkraineL"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AP2Hh3LVGaUC&amp;pg=PA309 Purism and Language: A Study in Modem Ukrainian and Belorussian Nationalism] by [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]], [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|087750-175-0}} (page 309)&lt;/ref&gt; in its folklore songs, [[kobzar|itinerant musicians]], and prominent authors.&lt;ref name="WUkraineL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UkrGrammar30"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gncrr5KrFvIC&amp;pg=PA76 Contested Tongues: Language Politics and Cultural Correction in Ukraine] by [[Laada Bilaniuk]], [[Cornell Univ.

The standard Ukrainian language is regulated by the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] (''NANU''), particularly by its [[Institute for the Ukrainian Language]], Ukrainian language-information fund, and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies. The Ukrainian language retains a degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with Belarusian and Russian.&lt;ref name="classification145"&gt;

==Linguistic development of the Ukrainian language==

===Theories concerning the development of the Ukrainian language===

The first theory of the origin of Ukrainian language was suggested in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in the middle of the 18th century by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. This theory posits the existence of a common language spoken by all [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic people]] in the time of the Rus'. According to Lomonosov, the differences that subsequently developed between [[Great Russian language|Great Russian]] and Ukrainian (which he referred to as [[Little Russia]]n) could be explained by the influence of the Polish and Slovak languages on Ukrainian and the influence of [[Uralic languages]] on Russian from the 13th to the 17th centuries.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another point of view developed during the 19th and 20th centuries by [[linguists]] of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Like Lomonosov, they assumed the existence of a common language spoken by East Slavs in the past. But unlike Lomonosov's hypothesis, this theory does not view "[[Polonization]]" or any other external influence as the main driving force that led to the formation of three different languages (Russian, Ukrainian and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]) from the common [[Old East Slavic language]]. This general point of view is the most accepted amongst academics worldwide,&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukrainian-language|title=Ukrainian language|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly outside Ukraine. The supporters of this theory disagree, however, about the time when the different languages were formed.

Soviet scholars set the divergence between Ukrainian and Russian only at later time periods (14th through 16th centuries). According to this view, Old East Slavic diverged into Belarusian and Ukrainian to the west (collectively, the Ruthenian language of the 15th to 18th centuries), and [[Old Russian]] to the north-east, after the political boundaries of the [[Kievan Rus']] were redrawn in the 14th century. During the time of the incorporation of Ruthenia (Ukraine and Belarus) into the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Ukrainian and Belarusian diverged into identifiably separate languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Some scholars{{who|date=September 2011}} see a divergence between the language of [[Galicia-Volhynia]] and the language of [[Novgorod]]-[[Suzdal]] by the 12th century, assuming that before the 12th century, the two languages were practically indistinguishable. This point of view is, however, at variance with some historical data. In fact, several East Slavic tribes, such as [[Polans (eastern)|Polans]], [[Drevlyans]], [[Severians]], [[Dulebes]] (that later likely became [[Volhynians]] and [[Buzhans]]), [[White Croats]], [[Tiverians]] and [[Ulichs]] lived on the territory of today's Ukraine long before the 12th century. Notably, some Ukrainian features{{Which|date=September 2016}} were recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic as far back as the language can be documented.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litopys.org.ua/shevelov/shev.htm|title=Юрій Шевельов. Історична фонологія української мови|publisher=Litopys.org.ua|date=1979|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers, while admitting the differences between the dialects spoken by East Slavic tribes in the 10th and 11th centuries, still consider them as "regional manifestations of a common language" (see, for instance, the article by [[Vasyl Nimchuk]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nimchuk, Vasyl'. Періодизація як напрямок дослідження генези та історії української мови. Мовознавство. 1997.- Ч.6.-С.3–14; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Ahatanhel Krymsky]] and [[Alexei Shakhmatov]] assumed the existence of the common spoken language of Eastern Slavs only in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/pivtorak/pivt.htm |title=Григорій Півторак. Походження українців, росіян, білорусів та їхніх мов |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their point of view, the diversification of the Old East Slavic language took place in the 8th or early 9th century.

Ukrainian linguist [[Stepan Smal-Stotsky]] went even further, denying the existence of a common Old East Slavic language at any time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/istkult/ikult01.htm |title=Мова (В.В.Німчук). 1. Історія української культури |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar points of view were shared by [[Yevhen Tymchenko]], [[Vsevolod Hantsov]], [[Olena Kurylo]], [[Ivan Ohienko]] and others. According to this theory, the dialects of East Slavic tribes evolved gradually from the common Proto-Slavic language without any intermediate stages during the 6th through 9th centuries. The Ukrainian language was formed by convergence of tribal dialects, mostly due to an intensive migration of the population within the territory of today's Ukraine in later historical periods. This point of view was also supported by [[George Shevelov]]'s phonological studies.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

===Origins and developments during medieval times===
As the result of close Slavic contacts with the remnants of the [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] population north of the [[Black Sea]], lasting into the early Middle Ages, the appearance of voiced fricative γ(h) in modern Ukrainian and some southern Russian dialects is explained, that initially emerged in [[Scythian language|Scythian]] and the related eastern Iranian dialects from earlier common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*g'' and ''*gʰ''.&lt;ref&gt;Абаев В. И. О происхождении фонемы ''g (h)'' в славянском языке // Проблемы индоевропейского языкознания. М., 1964. С. 115—121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Майоров А.В.

During the 13th century, when German settlers were invited to Ukraine by the princes of Galicia-Vollhynia, German words began to appear in the language spoken in Ukraine. Their influence would continue under [[Poland]] not only through German colonists but also through the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-speaking]] Jews. Often such words involve trade or handicrafts. Examples of words of German or Yiddish origin spoken in Ukraine include ''dakh'' (roof), ''rura'' (pipe), ''rynok'' (market), ''kushnir'' (furrier), and ''majster'' (master or craftsman).&lt;ref name = "Concise Middle"&gt;History of the Ukrainian Language. R. Smal-Stocky. In ''Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia.''(1963). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 490–500&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments under Poland and Lithuania===
In the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus' (including Moscow) came under [[Tatar yoke]] until their unification under the Tsardom of [[Muscovy]], whereas the south-western areas (including [[Kiev]]) were incorporated into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. For the following four centuries, the language of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/zyzlex/zyz.htm |title=Лаврентій Зизаній. "Лексис". Синоніма славеноросская |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, a peculiar official language was formed: a mixture of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and [[Polish language|Polish]], with the influence of the last of these three gradually increasing. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.&lt;ref name=KostOstr&gt;{{ru icon}} [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''Russian History in Biographies of its main figures'', Chapter ''[http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom22.htm Knyaz Kostantin Konstantinovich Ostrozhsky]'' ([[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish rule and education]] also involved significant exposure to the [[Latin]] language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include ''zavzhdy'' (always; taken from old Polish word ''zawżdy'') and ''obitsiaty'' (to promise; taken from Polish ''obiecać'') and from Latin (via Polish) ''raptom'' (suddenly) and ''meta'' (aim or goal).&lt;ref name="Concise Middle" /&gt;

Significant contact with [[Tatars]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] resulted in many [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language.  Examples include ''torba'' (bag) and ''tyutyun'' (tobacco).&lt;ref name="Concise Middle" /&gt;

Due to heavy borrowings from Polish, German, Czech and Latin, early modern vernacular Ukrainian (''prosta mova'', "[[simple speech]]") had more lexical similarity with [[West Slavic languages]] than with Russian or Church Slavonic.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Hrytsak.

''Emerging meso-areas in the former socialist countries: histories revived or improvised?''. Slavic Research Center, [[Hokkaido University]]. 2005. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-17th century, the linguistic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages was so acute that there was a need for translators during negotiations for the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], between [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], head of the [[Zaporozhian Host]], and the Russian state.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Chirovsky.

===Rus' and Galicia-Volhynia===
During the [[Khazar]] period, the territory of Ukraine, settled at that time by Iranian (post-[[Scythian]]), Turkic (post-Hunnic, proto-Bulgarian), and Uralic (proto-Hungarian) tribes, was progressively Slavicized by several waves of migration from the Slavic north. Finally, the [[Varangian]] ruler of [[Novgorod]], called [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], seized Kiev (Kyiv) and established the political entity of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]. Some theorists see an early Ukrainian stage in language development here; others term this era Old East Slavic or [[Old Ruthenian|Old Ruthenian/Rus'ian]]. Russian theorists tend to amalgamate Rus' to the modern nation of Russia, and call this linguistic era [[Old Russian language|Old Russian]]. Some hold that linguistic unity over Rus' was not present, but tribal diversity in language was.

The era of Rus' is the subject of some linguistic controversy, as the language of much of the literature was purely or heavily [[Old Slavonic language|Old Slavonic]]. At the same time, most legal documents throughout Rus' were written in a purely [[Old East Slavic]] language (supposed to be based on the Kiev dialect of that epoch). Scholarly controversies over earlier development aside, literary records from Rus' testify to substantial divergence between Russian and Ruthenian/Rusyn forms of the Ukrainian language as early as the era of Rus'. One vehicle of this divergence (or widening divergence) was the large scale appropriation of the Old Slavonic language in the northern reaches of Rus' and of the Polish language at the territory of modern Ukraine. As evidenced by the contemporary chronicles, the ruling princes of Galich (modern [[Halych]]) and Kiev called themselves "People of Rus'" (with the exact Cyrillic spelling of the adjective from ''of Rus''' varying among sources), which contrasts sharply with the lack of ethnic self-appellation for the area until the mid-19th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Under Lithuania/Poland, Muscovy/Russia and Austro-Hungary===

After the fall of [[Galicia–Volhynia]], Ukrainians mainly fell under the rule of Lithuania and then [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom|Poland]]. Local autonomy of both rule and language was a marked feature of Lithuanian rule. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Old Slavic became the language of the chancellery and gradually evolved into the Ruthenian language. Polish rule, which came later, was accompanied by a more assimilationist policy. By the 1569 [[Union of Lublin]] that formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to Polish administration, resulting in cultural [[Polonization]] and visible attempts to [[colonization|colonize]] Ukraine by the Polish nobility. Many Ukrainian nobles learned the Polish language and adopted Catholicism during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |title=The Polonization of the Ukrainian Nobility |publisher=Mywebpages.comcast.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602145938/http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mdemkowicz1/dobra/poloniz.html |archivedate=2002-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower classes were less affected because literacy was common only in the upper class and clergy. The latter were also under significant Polish pressure after the [[Union of Brest|Union with the Catholic Church]]. Most of the educational system was gradually Polonized. In Ruthenia, the language of administrative documents gradually shifted towards Polish.

The [[Polish language]] has had heavy influences on Ukrainian (particularly in [[Western Ukraine]]). The southwestern Ukrainian dialects are [[Dialect continuum|transitional]] to Polish.&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;Geoffrey Hull, Halyna Koscharsky. "[http://miskinhill.com.au/journals/asees/20:1-2/lexical-divide-ukrainian.pdf  Contours and Consequences of the Lexical Divide in Ukrainian]". ''Australian Slavonic and East European Studies''. Vol. 20, no. 1-2. 2006.  pp. 140–147.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ukrainian language developed further, some borrowings from [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] occurred. Ukrainian culture and language flourished in the sixteenth and first half of the 17th century, when Ukraine was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among many schools established in that time, the Kiev-Mogila Collegium (the predecessor of modern [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]), founded by the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Peter Mogila]] (''Petro Mohyla''), was the most important. At that time languages were associated more with religions: Catholics spoke [[Polish language|Polish]], and members of the Orthodox church spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].

After the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], Ukrainian high culture went into a long period of steady decline. In the aftermath, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] and closed down later in the 19th century. Most of the remaining Ukrainian schools also switched to Polish or Russian in the territories controlled by these respective countries, which was followed by a new wave of [[Polonization]] and [[Russification]] of the native nobility. Gradually the official language of Ukrainian provinces under Poland was changed to Polish, while the upper classes in the Russian part of Ukraine used Russian.

During the 19th century, a revival of Ukrainian self-identification manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire [[Dnieper Ukraine]] and Austrian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] in Kiev applied an old word for the Cossack motherland, ''Ukrajina'', as a self-appellation for the nation of Ukrainians, and ''Ukrajins'ka mova'' for the language. Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian was not merely a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.

However, in the Russian Empire expressions of Ukrainian culture and especially language were repeatedly persecuted for fear that a self-aware Ukrainian nation would threaten the unity of the empire. In 1804 Ukrainian as a subject and language of instruction was banned from schools.&lt;ref name=schools/&gt; In 1811 by the Order of the Russian government, the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] was closed. The Academy had been open since 1632 and was the first university in Eastern Europe. In 1847 the [[Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius]] was terminated. The same year [[Taras Shevchenko]] was arrested, exiled for ten years, and banned for political reasons from writing and painting. In 1862 [[Pavlo Chubynsky]] was exiled for seven years to [[Arkhangelsk]]. The Ukrainian magazine ''[[Osnova]]'' was discontinued. In 1863, the tsarist interior minister [[Pyotr Valuyev]] proclaimed in [[Valuyevsky Ukaz|his decree]] that "there never has been, is not, and never can be a separate Little Russian language".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:ru:Валуевский циркуляр|Валуевский циркуляр]], full text of the Valuyev circular on [[Wikisource]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A following ban on Ukrainian books led to [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s secret [[Ems Ukaz]], which prohibited publication and importation of most Ukrainian-language books, public performances and lectures, and even banned the printing of Ukrainian texts accompanying musical scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/ohukr/ohu14.htm |title=XII.

For much of the 19th century the Austrian authorities demonstrated some preference for Polish culture, but the Ukrainians were relatively free to partake in their own cultural pursuits in [[Halychyna]] and [[Bukovyna]], where Ukrainian was widely used in education and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/subtelny/istukr/17.htm#6 Вiртуальна Русь: Бібліотека&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression by Russia retarded the literary development of the Ukrainian language in Dnipro Ukraine, but there was a constant exchange with Halychyna, and many works were published under Austria and smuggled to the east.

By the time of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Austro-Hungary#Dissolution of the Empire|collapse of Austro-Hungary]] in 1918, the former 'Ruthenians' or 'Little Russians' were ready to openly develop a body of national literature, institute a Ukrainian-language educational system, and form an independent state named Ukraine (the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], shortly joined by the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]). During this brief independent statehood the stature and use of Ukrainian greatly improved.&lt;ref name=UkrGrammar30/&gt;

====Speakers in the Russian Empire====
[[File:Ukrainian in Russian Empire 1897.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Ukrainian speakers in the Russian Empire (1897)]]
In the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897 the following picture emerged, with Ukrainian being the second most spoken language of the Russian Empire. According to the Imperial census's terminology, the Russian language (''Русскій'') was subdivided into Ukrainian (Малорусскій, '[[Little Russian]]'), what we know as Russian today (Великорусскій, '[[Great Russian]]'), and Belarusian (Бѣлорусскій, 'White Russian').

The following table shows the distribution of settlement by native language (''"по родному языку"'') in 1897 in [[Russian Empire]] governorates (''[[guberniya]]s'') that had more than 100,000 Ukrainian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php |title=Демоскоп Weekly – Приложение.

Although in the rural regions of the Ukraine provinces, 80% of the inhabitants said that Ukrainian was their native language in the Census of 1897 (for which the results are given above), in the urban regions only 32.5% of the population claimed Ukrainian as their native language. For example, in [[Odessa]] (then part of the Russian Empire), at the time the largest city in the territory of current Ukraine, only 5.6% of the population said Ukrainian was their native language.&lt;ref name=George&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2oqThmrFCfwC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Nikolayev+Ukrainian+language&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Soviet Nationality Policy, Urban Growth, and Identity Change in the Ukrainian SSR 1923–1934] by George O. Liber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-521-41391-6}} (page 12/13)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1920s the urban population in Ukraine grew faster than the number of Ukrainian speakers. This implies that there was a (relative) decline in the use of Ukrainian language. For example, in [[Kiev]], the number of people stating that Ukrainian was their native language declined from 30.3% in 1874 to 16.6% in 1917.&lt;ref name=George/&gt;

===Soviet era===
[[File:Soviet UA class union.gif|upright=1.15|thumb|The Ukrainian text in this Soviet poster reads: "The Social base of the [[USSR]] is an unbreakable union of the workers, peasants and [[intelligentsia]]".]]

During the seven-decade-long [[Soviet era]], the Ukrainian language held the formal position of the principal local language in the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Ukraine], [[Life (magazine)|Life]], 26 October 1946&lt;/ref&gt; However, practice was often a different story:&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Ukrainian always had to compete with Russian, and the attitudes of the Soviet leadership towards Ukrainian varied from encouragement and tolerance to discouragement.

Officially, there was no [[state language]] in the Soviet Union until the very end when it was proclaimed in 1990 that Russian language was the all-Union state language and that the constituent [[Soviet republics|republics]] had rights to declare additional state languages within their jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |title=Law on Languages of Nations of USSR |publisher=Legal-ussr.narod.ru |date=1990-04-24 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508201331/http://legal-ussr.narod.ru/data01/tex10935.htm |archivedate=2016-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still it was implicitly understood in the hopes of minority nations that Ukrainian would be used in the Ukrainian SSR, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] would be used in the [[Uzbek SSR]], and so on. However, Russian was used in all parts of the Soviet Union and a special term, "a language of inter-ethnic communication", was coined to denote its status.

Soviet language policy in Ukraine may be divided into the following policy periods:

* [[Ukrainianization]] and tolerance (1921–1932)
* Persecution and Russification (1933–1957)
* [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] thaw (1958–1962)
* The [[Shelest]] period: limited progress (1963–1972)
* The [[Shcherbytsky]] period: gradual suppression (1973–1989)
* [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[perestroika]] (1990–1991)

====Ukrainianization and tolerance====
Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the Russian Empire was broken up. In different parts of the former empire, several nations, including Ukrainians, developed a renewed sense of [[national identity]]. In the chaotic post-revolutionary years the Ukrainian language gained some usage in government affairs. Initially, this trend continued under the [[Bolshevik]] government of the Soviet Union, which in a political struggle to retain its grip over the territory had to encourage the national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about many political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire, where it could always find allies.

[[File:Ukposter.jpg|left|thumb|The 1921 Soviet recruitment poster. It uses traditional Ukrainian imagery with Ukrainian-language text: "Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defense of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured."]]

The widening use of Ukrainian further developed in the first years of Bolshevik rule into a policy called [[korenizatsiya]]. The government pursued a policy of [[Ukrainianization]] by lifting a ban on the Ukrainian language. That led to the introduction of an impressive education program which allowed Ukrainian-taught classes and raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone population. This policy was led by Education Commissar [[Mykola Skrypnyk]] and was directed to approximate the language to [[Russian language|Russian]]. Newly generated academic efforts from the period of independence were co-opted by the Bolshevik government. The party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking but were encouraged to learn the Ukrainian language. Simultaneously, the newly literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianized&amp;nbsp;– in both population and in education.

The policy even reached those regions of southern [[Russian SFSR]] where the ethnic Ukrainian population was significant, particularly the areas by the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] and especially [[Kuban]] in the [[North Caucasus]]. Ukrainian language teachers, just graduated from expanded institutions of higher education in Soviet Ukraine, were dispatched to these regions to staff newly opened Ukrainian schools or to teach Ukrainian as a second language in Russian schools. A string of local Ukrainian-language publications were started and departments of Ukrainian studies were opened in colleges. Overall, these policies were implemented in thirty-five [[raions]] (administrative districts) in southern [[Russian SFSR|Russia]].

====Persecution and russification====
[[File:UkrSchool.jpeg|right|thumb|Anti-russification protest. The banner reads ''"Ukrainian School for Ukrainian kids!"''.]]

Soviet policy towards the Ukrainian language changed abruptly in late 1932 and early 1933, with the termination of the policy of Ukrainianization.  In December 1932, the regional party cells received a telegram signed by [[V. Molotov]] and Stalin with an order to immediately reverse the Ukrainianization policies. The telegram condemned Ukrainianization as ill-considered and harmful and demanded to "immediately halt Ukrainianization in [[raion]]s (districts), switch all Ukrainianized newspapers, books and publications into Russian and prepare by autumn of 1933 for the switching of schools and instruction into Russian".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The following years were characterized by massive repression and discrimination for the Ukrainophones. Western and most contemporary Ukrainian historians emphasize that the cultural repression was applied earlier and more fiercely in Ukraine than in other parts of the Soviet Union, and were therefore anti-Ukrainian; others assert that Stalin's goal was the generic crushing of any dissent, rather than targeting the Ukrainians in particular.

Stalinist policies shifted to define Russian as the language of (inter-ethnic) communication. Although Ukrainian continued to be used (in print, education, radio and later television programs), it lost its primary place in advanced learning and republic-wide media. Ukrainian was demoted to a language of secondary importance, often associated with the rise in Ukrainian self-awareness and nationalism and often branded "politically incorrect". The new Soviet Constitution adopted in 1936, however, stipulated that teaching in schools should be conducted in native languages.

Major repression started in 1929–30, when a large group of Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]] was arrested and most were executed. In Ukrainian history, this group is often referred to as "[[Executed Renaissance]]" (Ukrainian: розстріляне відродження). "Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]" was declared  to be the primary problem in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ukrainian Nationalism in the Post-Stalin Era: Myth, Symbols and Ideology in Soviet Nationalities Policy |last=Farmer |first=K.C. |authorlink= |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |location= |isbn= |pages=241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terror peaked in 1933, four to five years before the Soviet-wide "[[Great Purge]]", which, for Ukraine, was a second blow. The vast majority of leading scholars and cultural leaders of Ukraine were liquidated, as were the "Ukrainianized" and "Ukrainianizing" portions of the Communist party. Soviet Ukraine's autonomy was completely destroyed by the late 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In its place, the glorification of Russia as the first nation to throw off the capitalist yoke had begun, accompanied by the migration of Russian workers into parts of Ukraine which were undergoing [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|industrialization]] and mandatory instruction of classic Russian language and literature. Ideologists warned of over-glorifying Ukraine's [[Cossack]] past, and supported the closing of Ukrainian cultural institutions and literary publications. The systematic assault upon Ukrainian identity in culture and education, combined with effects of an artificial famine (''[[Holodomor]]'') upon the peasantry—the backbone of the nation—dealt Ukrainian language and identity a crippling blow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

This sequence of policy change was repeated in [[Western Ukraine]] when it was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine. In 1939, and again in the late 1940s, a policy of Ukrainianization was implemented. By the early 1950s, Ukrainian was persecuted and a campaign of Russification began.

====Khrushchev thaw====
[[File:Rouble-1961-Paper-1-Reverse.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|While Russian was a de facto official language of the Soviet Union in all but formal name, all national languages were proclaimed equal. The name and denomination of [[Soviet ruble|Soviet banknotes]] were listed in the languages of all fifteen [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. On this 1961 one-ruble note, the Ukrainian for "one ruble", один карбованець (''odyn karbovanets`''), directly follows the Russian один рубль (''odin rubl`'').]]

After the death of Stalin (1953), a general policy of relaxing the language policies of the past was implemented (1958 to 1963). The [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era which followed saw a policy of relatively lenient concessions to development of the languages at the local and republic level, though its results in Ukraine did not go nearly as far as those of the Soviet policy of Ukrainianization in the 1920s. Journals and encyclopedic publications advanced in the Ukrainian language during the Khrushchev era, as well as [[transfer of Crimea]] under Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction.

Yet, the 1958 school reform that allowed parents to choose the language of primary instruction for their children, unpopular among the circles of the national intelligentsia in parts of the USSR, meant that non-Russian languages would slowly give way to Russian in light of the pressures of survival and advancement. The gains of the past, already largely reversed by the Stalin era, were offset by the liberal attitude towards the requirement to study the local languages (the requirement to study Russian remained). Parents were usually free to choose the language of study of their children (except in few areas where attending the Ukrainian school might have required a long daily commute) and they often chose Russian, which reinforced the resulting Russification. In this sense, some analysts argue that it was not the "oppression" or "persecution", but rather the ''lack of [[linguistic protectionism|protection]]'' against the expansion of Russian language that contributed to the relative decline of Ukrainian in the 1970s and 1980s. According to this view, it was inevitable that successful careers required a good command of Russian, while knowledge of Ukrainian was not vital, so it was common for Ukrainian parents to send their children to Russian-language schools, even though Ukrainian-language schools were usually available. While in the Russian-language schools within the republic, Ukrainian was supposed to be learned as a second language at comparable level, the instruction of other subjects was in Russian and, as a result, students had a greater command of Russian than Ukrainian on graduation. Additionally, in some areas of the republic, the attitude towards teaching and learning of Ukrainian in schools was relaxed and it was, sometimes, considered a subject of secondary importance and even a waiver from studying it was sometimes given under various, ever expanding, circumstances.

The complete suppression of all expressions of separatism or [[Ukrainian nationalism]] also contributed to lessening interest in Ukrainian. Some people who persistently used Ukrainian on a daily basis were often perceived as though they were expressing sympathy towards, or even being members of, the political opposition. This, combined with advantages given by Russian fluency and usage, made Russian the primary language of choice for many Ukrainians, while Ukrainian was more of a [[hobby]]. In any event, the mild liberalization in Ukraine and elsewhere was stifled by new suppression of freedoms at the end of the Khrushchev era (1963) when a policy of gradually creeping suppression of Ukrainian was re-instituted.

The next part of the Soviet Ukrainian language policy divides into two eras: first, the Shelest period (early 1960s to early 1970s), which was relatively liberal towards the development of the Ukrainian language. The second era, the policy of Shcherbytsky (early 1970s to early 1990s), was one of gradual suppression of the Ukrainian language.

====Shelest period====
The Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, [[Petro Shelest]], pursued a policy of defending Ukraine's interests within the Soviet Union. He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education. He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism.

====Shcherbytsky period====
The new party boss from 1972 to 1989, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels. His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985.

====Gorbachev and perebudova====
The management of dissent by the local [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communist Party]] was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, at the start of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] reforms [[Perestroika|perebudova]] and [[Glasnost|hlasnist’]] (Ukrainian for ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost''), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself.

Although Ukrainian still remained the native language for the majority in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified. In [[Donetsk]] there were no Ukrainian language schools and in [[Kiev]] only a quarter of children went to Ukrainian language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCZi--UtYdEC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22Little+Russia%22+insulting&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=4HrFTZCuJ4qBOsfUvaII&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=1804&amp;f=false Eternal Russia:Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (page 218)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian language was the dominant vehicle, not just of government function, but of the media, commerce, and modernity itself. This was substantially less the case for western Ukraine, which escaped the [[Holodomor|artificial famine]], [[Great Purge]], and most of [[Stalinism]]. And this region became the center of a hearty, if only partial, renaissance of the Ukrainian language during independence.

===Independence in the modern era===
[[File:Map12 b.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Fluency in Ukrainian (purple column) and Russian (blue column) in 1989 and 2001]]
[[File:Inf board metro.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Modern signs in the [[Kiev Metro]] are in Ukrainian. The evolution in their language followed the changes in the language policies in post-war Ukraine. Originally, all signs and voice announcements in the metro were in Ukrainian, but their language was changed to Russian in the early 1980s, at the height of Shcherbytsky's gradual Russification. In the [[perestroika]] liberalization of the late 1980s, the signs were changed to bilingual. This was accompanied by bilingual voice announcements in the trains. In the early 1990s, both signs and voice announcements were changed again from bilingual to Ukrainian-only during the [[De-Russification|de-russification]] campaign that followed Ukraine's independence. Since 2012 the signs have been in both Ukrainian and English.]]
Since 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so. The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. In some cases the abrupt changing of the language of instruction in institutions of secondary and higher education led to the charges of [[Ukrainianization]], raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population. This transition, however, lacked most of the controversies that arose during the de-[[russification]] of the other former [[Soviet Republics]].

With time, most residents, including ethnic Russians, people of mixed origin, and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, started to self-identify as Ukrainian nationals, even those who remained [[Russophone]]. The Russian language, however, still dominates the print media in most of Ukraine and private radio and TV broadcasting in the eastern, southern, and, to a lesser degree, central regions. The state-controlled broadcast media have become exclusively Ukrainian. There are few obstacles to the usage of Russian in commerce and it is still occasionally used in government affairs.

Late 20th century [[Russia]]n politicians like [[Alexander Lebed]] and [[Mikhail Yur'ev]] still claimed that Ukrainian is a [[Russian language#Dialects|Russian dialect]].&lt;ref name=YavlinskyUkr&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1w-3TCvbkioC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Ukrainian+Russian+dialect&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=yOHfS-z5Ms-A-gaChd2aBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20Russian%20dialect&amp;f=false Contemporary Ukraine: Dynamics of Post-Soviet Transformation] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[M.E. Sharpe]], 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0224-4}} (page 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]], 67.5% of the country population named Ukrainian as their native language (a 2.8% increase from 1989), while 29.6% named Russian (a 3.2% decrease). It should be noted, though, that for many Ukrainians (of various ethnic descent), the term ''[[native language]]'' may not necessarily associate with the language they use more frequently. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Ukrainians consider the Ukrainian language ''native'', including those who often speak Russian. According to the official 2001 census data&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010031943/http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/|date=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 75% of Kiev's population responded "Ukrainian" to the ''native language'' (''ridna mova'') census question, and roughly 25% responded "Russian". On the other hand, when the question "What language do you use in everyday life?" was asked in the sociological survey, the Kievans' answers were distributed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to Ukraine (See above) | url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72 | accessdate=November 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "mostly Russian": 52%, "both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure": 32%, "mostly Ukrainian": 14%, "exclusively Ukrainian": 4.3%.

Ethnic minorities, such as Romanians, Tatars and Jews usually use Russian as their lingua franca. But there are tendencies within these minority groups to use Ukrainian. The Jewish writer [[Olexander Beyderman]] from the mainly Russian-speaking city of Odessa is now writing most of his dramas in Ukrainian. The emotional relationship regarding Ukrainian is changing in southern and eastern areas.

Opposition to expansion of Ukrainian-language teaching is a matter of contention in eastern regions closer to Russia&amp;nbsp;– in May 2008, the [[Donetsk]] city council prohibited the creation of any new Ukrainian schools in the city in which 80% of them are [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908120650/http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/25050 Ukraine council adopts Russian language], ''[[RussiaToday]]'', May 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and the Ukrainian literary language==
{{further|Ukrainian literature}}


The literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into three stages: old Ukrainian (12th to 14th centuries), middle Ukrainian (14th to 18th centuries), and modern Ukrainian (end of the 18th century to the present). Much literature was written in the periods of the old and middle Ukrainian language, including legal acts, polemical articles, science treatises and fiction of all sorts.

Influential literary figures in the development of modern Ukrainian literature include the philosopher [[Hryhorii Skovoroda]], [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], [[Mykola Kostomarov]], [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Franko]], and [[Lesia Ukrainka]]. The earliest literary work in the [[modern Ukrainian language]] was recorded in 1798 when [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], a playwright from [[Poltava]] in southeastern Ukraine, published his [[epic poem]], ''Eneyida'', a [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] in Ukrainian, based on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. His book was published in vernacular Ukrainian in a satirical way to avoid being censored, and is the earliest known Ukrainian published book to survive through Imperial and, later, Soviet policies on the Ukrainian language.

Kotlyarevsky's work and that of another early writer using the Ukrainian vernacular language, Petro Artemovsky, used the southeastern dialect spoken in the Poltava, Kharkiv and southern Kieven regions of the Russian Empire. This dialect would serve as the basis of the Ukrainian literary language when it was developed by [[Taras Shevchenko]] and [[Panteleimon Kulish]] in the mid 19th century. In order to raise its status from that of a dialect to that of a language, various elements from folklore and traditional styles were added to it.&lt;ref name = "Shevelov"&gt;George Shevelov. (1981). Evolution of the Ukrainian Literary Language. From ''Rethinking Ukrainian History.'' (Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky, John-Paul Himka, editors). Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, pp. 221–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian literary language developed further when the Russian state banned the use of the Ukrainian language, prompting many of its writers to move to the western Ukrainian region of Galicia which was under more liberal Austrian rule; after the 1860s the majority of Ukrainian literary works were published in Austrian Galicia.  During this period Galician influences were adopted in the Ukrainian literary language, particularly with respect to vocabulary involving law, government, technology, science, and administration.&lt;ref name = "Shevelov"/&gt;

==Current usage==
[[File:Ivan Franko Museum in Krivorivnia.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian language traffic sign for the Ivan Franko Museum in Kryvorivnia.]]
The use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic [[Ukrainians]] worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine (77.8% of the total population), the Ukrainian language is prevalent only in western and central Ukraine. In Kiev, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking. The shift is believed to be caused, largely, by an influx of the rural population and migrants from the western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kievans' turning to use the language they speak at home more widely in everyday matters. Public signs and announcements in Kiev are in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language of the urban population. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 87.8% people living in Ukraine communicate in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name="d-m.com.ua"&gt;[http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm D-M.com.ua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302201528/http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the Ukrainian language in Ukraine can be expected to increase, as the rural population migrates into the cities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, the rural Ukrainophones continue to prefer Russian. Interest in Ukrainian literature is growing rapidly, compensating for the periods when its development was hindered by either policies of direct suppression or lack of state support.

===Popular culture===
{{Main|Ukrainian music|Ukrainian cinema}}

====Music====
Ukrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular [[Ukrainian rock]] bands, such as [[Okean Elzy]], [[Vopli Vidopliassova]], [[BoomBox (Ukrainian band)|BoomBox]], and others perform regularly in tours across [[Europe]], [[Israel]], [[North America]] and especially [[Russia]]. In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places in the charts, such as [[Enej]] from [[Poland]]. Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are [[The Ukrainians]] from the United Kingdom, [[Klooch]] from [[Canada]], [[Ukrainian Village Band]] from the United States, and the [[Kuban Cossack Choir]] from the [[Kuban]] region in [[Russia]].

===Ukrainian diaspora===
Ukrainian is also spoken by a large [[émigré]] population, particularly in Canada (see '''[[Canadian Ukrainian]]'''), United States, and several countries of South America like [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Paraguay]]. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which used to be part of [[Austro-Hungary]] before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many [[loanwords]] from the local language.

Most of the countries where it is spoken are [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR]], where many Ukrainians have migrated. Canada and the United States are also home to a large Ukrainian population.

===Grammar===
{{Further|Ukrainian grammar}}

Ukrainian is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[nominative-accusative language|nominative-accusative]], [[verb framing|satellite framed]] language. It exhibits [[T-V distinction]], and is [[null-subject language|null-subject]]. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/refdb/record/Stechishin-1958 |title=Stechishin-1958 |publisher=Wals.info |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[word order|word orders]] are usual due to the free word order created by Ukrainian's [[inflection|inflectional]] system.

Nouns [[declension|decline]] for 7 [[grammatical cases|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], [[vocative]]; 3 [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], [[plural]]. [[adjective|Adjectives]] [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]].

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 2 [[grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]], [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]], 3 [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, third; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], and [[plural]]. Ukrainian verbs come in [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspect pairs]]: [[perfective aspect|perfective]], and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Pairs are usually formed by a [[prepositional]] prefix and occasionally a [[apophony|root change]]. The [[past tense]] agrees with its [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical gender|gender]], having developed from the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] [[participle]].

The Old East Slavic and Russian ''o'' in syllables ending in a consonant, often corresponds to a Ukrainian ''i'', as in ''pod'' &amp;gt; ''pid'' (під, 'under'). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the ''o'' can re-appear as it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as ''rik'' (рік, 'year') ([[nominative case|nom]]): ''rotsi'' ([[locative case|loc]]) (році). Similarly, some words can have ''і'' in some declensions when most of the declension have ''o'', for example ''слово'' (nominative singular), ''слова'' (nominative plural) but ''слiв'' (genitive plural).

Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian ''na pervom etaže'' 'on the first floor' is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is ''na peršomu poversi'' (на першому поверсі). ''-omu'' is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in ''-im'' are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The ''kh'' of Ukrainian ''poverkh'' (поверх) has mutated into ''s'' under the influence of the soft vowel ''i'' (''k'' is similarly mutable into ''c'' in final positions).

===Phonology===
{{Further|Ukrainian phonology}}

[[File:Emma Andijewska, Vidsvity hrozy.ogg|thumb|The poem "Gleams of Thunderstorm" by Emma Andijewska being read in Ukrainian]]

The Ukrainian language has six vowels, {{IPA|/i, u, ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, a/}}.

A number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) and [[geminate consonant|long]], for example, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/lː/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/nː/}}.

The letter {{angle bracket|г}} represents [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, often transliterated as Latin ''h''. It is the [[Voiced consonant|voiced]] equivalent of English {{IPA|/h/}}. Russian speakers from Ukraine often use the soft Ukrainian {{IPA|/ɦ/}} in place of Russian {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which comes from northern dialects of Old East Slavic. The Ukrainian alphabet has the additional letter {{angle bracket|[[ґ]]}} for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which appears in a few native words such as ґринджоли  ''gryndžoly'' 'sleigh' and ґудзик ''gudzyk'' 'button'. However, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} appears almost exclusively in [[loan words]], and is usually simply written {{angle bracket|г}}. For example, loanwords from English on public signs usually use {{angle bracket|г}} for both English ''g'' and ''h''.

Another phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic {{angle bracket|[[в]]}} ''v/w''. While in standard Russian it represents {{IPA|/v/}}, in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes {{IPA|/w/}} (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within a word or at a word boundary, it denotes the allophone {{IPA|[u̯]}}, and like the off-glide in the English words "flow" and "cow", it forms a [[diphthong]] with the preceding vowel). Native Russian speakers will pronounce the Ukrainian {{angle bracket|в}} as {{IPA|[v]}}, which is one way to tell the two groups apart. As with {{angle bracket|г}} above, Ukrainians use {{angle bracket|в}} to render both English ''v'' and ''w''; Russians occasionally use {{angle bracket|у}} for ''w'' instead.

Unlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have [[final devoicing]].

===Alphabet===
{{Main|Ukrainian alphabet}}
{{Ukrainian alphabet}}

Ukrainian is written in a version of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], consisting of 33 letters, representing 38 [[phoneme]]s; an apostrophe is also used.  Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied.

The modern Ukrainian alphabet is the result of a number of proposed alphabetic reforms from the 19th and early 20th centuries, in Ukraine under the Russian Empire, in Austrian Galicia, and later in Soviet Ukraine. A unified Ukrainian alphabet (the ''[[Skrypnykivka]]'', after [[Mykola Skrypnyk]]) was officially established at a 1927 international Orthographic Conference in [[Kharkiv]], during the period of [[Ukrainization]] in Soviet Ukraine.  But the policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the Soviet Ukrainian orthography diverged from that used by the [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]].  The Ukrainian letter [[Ge with upturn|ge]] ''ґ'' was banned in the Soviet Union from 1933 until the period of [[Glasnost]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi 1996, pp 567, 570–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter щ represents two consonants {{IPA|[ʃt͡ʃ]}}. The combination of {{IPA|[j]}} with some of the vowels is also represented by a single letter ({{IPA|[ja]}} = я, {{IPA|[je]}} = є, {{IPA|[ji]}} or {{IPA|[jı̽]}} = ї, {{IPA|[ju]}} = ю), while {{IPA|[jɔ]}} = йо and the rare regional {{IPA|[jɨ]}} = йи are written using two letters. These [[iotated]] vowel letters and a special [[soft sign]] change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An [[apostrophe]] is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the [[yer]] in the Russian alphabet.

A consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long.

The phonemes {{IPA|[d͡z]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} do not have dedicated letters in the alphabet and are rendered with the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] дз and дж, respectively. {{IPA|[d͡z]}} is equivalent to English ''ds'' in ''pods'', {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} is equivalent to ''j'' in ''jump''.

''The Dictionary of Ukrainian Language'' in 11 volumes contains 135,000 entries.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Lexical card catalog of the Ukrainian Institute of Language Studies has 6 million cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nas.gov.ua/institutes/ium/lb/Documents/LB-10.pdf|title=Лексикографічний Бюлетень|format=PDF|year=2004|accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same Institute is going to publish the new ''Dictionary of Ukrainian Language'' in 13 volumes.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As mentioned at the top of the article, Ukrainian is most closely related lexically to Belarusian, and is also closer to Polish than to Russian (for example, можливість, ''mozhlyvist{{'}}'', "possibility", and Polish ''możliwość'', but Russian возможность, ''vozmozhnost{{'}}'').

==Classification and relationship to other languages==
Ukrainian has varying degrees of [[mutual intelligibility]] with other Slavic languages and is considered to be most closely related to [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Sussex, Paul V. Cubberley. (2006). ''The Slavic languages .'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the question of whether Ukrainian, [[Belorusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages are dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed, with the debate affected by linguistic and political factors.&lt;ref name="classification145"/&gt; The political situation ([[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] being mainly part of the [[Russian Empire]] at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of [[Kievan Rus']], which occupied large parts of these three nations, led to the creation of the common classification known later as the [[East Slavic languages]]. The underlying theory of the grouping is their descent from a common ancestor. In modern times, Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Comrie and Greville G. Corbett, ed.  1993.  ''The Slavonic Languages'' (Routledge).&lt;br&gt;Ethnologue, 16th edition.&lt;br&gt;Bernard Comrie.  1992.  "Slavic Languages," ''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'' (Oxford).  Vol. 3, pp. 452–456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby. 1999/2000. ''The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities'' (The Linguasphere Observatory), Volume Two, pg. 442: "53-AAA-e, Russkiy+Ukrainska"&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 17th and 18th centuries (the time of national and language revival of Ukraine) the [[Ukrainians]] were predominantly peasants and [[petit bourgeois|petits bourgeois]]; as a result, the Ukrainian language was mostly vernacular and few earlier literary works from the period can be found. In the cities, Ukrainian coexisted with [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] — a literary language of [[religion]] that evolved from the [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] — and later [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]], both languages which were more often used in formal writing and communication during that time.

===Differences between Ukrainian and other Slavic languages===
The Ukrainian language has the following similarities and differences with other Slavic languages:

*Like all Slavic languages with the exception of [[Russian language|Russian]], Belarusian, Slovak and Slovene, the Ukrainian language has preserved the Common Slavic [[vocative case]]. When addressing one's sister (''sestra'') she is referred to as ''sestro.'' In the Russian language the vocative case has been almost entirely replaced by the nominative (except for a handful of vestigial forms, e.g. ''Bozhe'' "God!" and ''Gospodi'' "Lord!").&lt;ref name="comparison"&gt;J. B. Rudnyckyj. (1963) . The Position of the Ukrainian Language among the Slavic languages. In ''Ukraine: A concise Encyclopedia''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 445–448.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all Slavic languages other than Russian, Slovak and Slovene, has retained the Common [[Slavic second palatalization]] of the velars *k, *g and *x in front of the secondary vowel *ě of the dative and locative ending in the female [[declension]], resulting in the final sequences -cě, -zě, and -sě. For example, ''ruka'' (hand) becomes ''ruci'' in Ukrainian. In Russian, the dative and locative of ''ruka'' is ''ruke.''
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Serbian, Croatian and Slovene, has developed the ending -''mo'' for first-person plurals in verbs (''khodymo'' for "we walk").&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt; In all cases, it resulted from lengthening of the Common Slavic -''mŭ''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}{{dubious|date=April 2014}}
*The Ukrainian language, along with Russian and Belarusian, has changed the Common Slavic word-initial ''ye''- into ''o'', such as in the words ''ozero'' (lake) and ''odyn'' (one).&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Czech, Slovak, Upper Sorbian, Belarusian and southern Russian dialects, has changed the Common Slavic "g" into an "h" sound (for example, ''noha'' – leg).&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with some northern Russian and Croatian dialects, has transformed the Common Slavic ''yě'' into ''i'' (for example, ''lis'' – forest).&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovene and Serbian, has simplified the Common Slavic ''tl'' and ''dl'' into ''l'' (for example, ''mela'' – she swept").&lt;ref name="comparison"/&gt;
*The Ukrainian language, in common with all modern Slavic languages other than Bulgarian and Macedonian, does not use [[Article (linguistics)|articles]].
*Other Slavic o in closed syllables, that is, ending in a consonant, in many cases corresponds to a Ukrainian i, as in pod &gt; pid (під, 'under'). This also includes place names such as Lviv (Львів in Ukrainian) - Lwów in Polish and Львов (Lvov) in Russian.

Unlike all other Slavic languages, Ukrainian has a [[synthetic future]] (also termed [[inflectional future]]) tense which developed through the erosion and cliticization of the verb 'to have' (or possibly 'to take'): ''pysa-ty-mu'' (infinitive-future-1st sg.) ''I will write''.&lt;ref name="Languages of Europe"&gt;Bernd Kortmann, Johan van der Auwera (2011). The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide, Volume 2. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Although the inflectional future (based on the verb 'to have') is characteristic of [[Romance languages]], Ukrainian linguist A. Danylenko argues that Ukrainian differs from Romance in the choice of auxiliary, which should be interpreted as 'to take' and not 'to have.' He states that Late Common Slavic (LCS) had three verbs with the same root *em- : 
* a determined imperfective LCS *jęti : *jĭmǫ 'to take' (later superseded by numerous prefixed perfectives) 
* an indetermined imperfective LCS *jĭmati : jemljǫ 'to take' (which would not take any prefixes)
* an imperfective LCS *jĭměti : *jĭmamĭ 'to hold, own, have' 
The three verbs became conflated in East Slavic due to morphological overlap, in particular of iměti ‘to have’ and jati ‘to take’ as exemplified in the Middle Ukrainian homonymic imut’ from both iměti (&amp;lt; *jĭměti) and jati (&amp;lt; *jęti). Analogous grammaticalization of the type take (‘to take,’ ‘to seize’) &gt; future is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].&lt;ref name="Danylenko"&gt;Andrii Danylenko. Is There Any Inflectional Future in East Slavic? A Case of Ukrainian against Romance Reopened. Journal of the Slavic Research Center at Hokkaido University, 2007. PP. 147 - 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4744">'''Ursula Schaefer Lamb''' (born, Essen  Germany 15  January 1914, died, Tucson AZ 8 August 1996) was a distinguished Latin American historian, who published works on the age of exploration and  the history of science.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Torodash, “Ursula Lamb (1914-1996)”. [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 77, No. 2 (May 1997), pp. 281-282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Deeds and Donna J. Guy, “Ursula Lamb (1914-1996)”. [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 77, No. 4 (Nov. 1997), pp. 677-679)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/90/1/16_1_m.html {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150405025057/http://wc.arizona.edu/papers/90/1/16_1_m.html |date=2015-04-05 }} accessed 5 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a pioneering woman academic in Latin American history, whose interdisciplinary works on history of science and globalization antedate the boom in such studies.

==Life and academic career==
Lamb was born just before the outbreak of World War I in Germany and came of age in the interwar years.  She attended the [[University of Berlin]] (1933–35), during Hitler's early years in power, studying history of art.&lt;ref&gt;Deeds and Guy, “Ursula Lamb”, p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; While a student there she aided Jewish families to escape from Nazi Germany.  She was openly anti-Nazi, and was arrested protesting a Nazi official’s speech. In 1935 she was able to come to the U.S., with aid from Quakers, as an exchange student at [[Smith College]]. Lamb entered the graduate program at [[University of California, Berkeley]], studying with [[Herbert E. Bolton]]. She earned her M.A. in 1939 and her Ph.D. in 1949.
Due to prejudices against women in the era, Lamb was “prevented from pursuing her first choices in an academic career.” But her difficulties in the U.S. were compounded by her being designated an “enemy alien." Despite her 1939 marriage to a U.S. citizen, distinguished physicist [[Willis Lamb]], who later won a Nobel prize, she could not live within 50 miles of the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Deeds and Guy, “Ursula Lamb”, pp. 677-78.&lt;/ref&gt; She completed her dissertation on [[Nicolás de Ovando]] in 1949.

She taught at [[Barnard College]] (1943–51), [[Brasenose College]], [[Oxford University]] (1959–60),  [[Yale University]] (1961-1974), and then [[University of Arizona]] (1974–84), where she retired in 1984. It was not until she was at University of Arizona did she hold a tenured professorial position.&lt;ref&gt;Deeds and Guy, “Ursula Lamb”, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, she was recognized by the [[Conference on Latin American History]] Distinguished Service Award, its highest honor.  She was the first woman to receive it.  [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]] took the unusual action of publishing two obituaries of her in the year following her death, with the editor noting that the journal “is pleased to offer its readers another look into the life of a pioneer among women in the field of Latin American history.”&lt;ref&gt;Editor’s note, HAHR, vol. 77, No. 4 (Nov. 1997), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt;
She died of cancer in 1996, survived by her husband of 57 years, whom she married in 1939. An obituary notes that she did not consider herself a feminist, but “she recognized the need for female scholars to be treated as equals.” In her personal life she made a commitment “as a supportive wife to nurture another’s genius.” &lt;ref&gt;Deeds and Guy, “Ursula Lamb” p. 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Archives and Records Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/native-americans/pictures/select-list-140.html "Pictures of Indians in the United States."] ''The National Archives''. (retrieved 4 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Winter counts''' ([[Lakota language|Lakota]]: ''waníyetu wówapi'' or ''waníyetu iyáwapi'') are pictorial calendars or histories in which tribal records and events were recorded by Native Americans in North America.  The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], [[Mandan]], [[Kiowa]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and other [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]] used winter counts extensively.  There are approximately one hundred winter counts in existence, but many of these are duplicates.

==Description==
Most winter counts have a single pictograph symbolizing each year, based on the most memorable event of that year. For Lakota people, years ran from first snow fall to first snowfall.&lt;ref name="eih"&gt;Hansen, 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; Kiowa winter counts usually feature two marks per year – one for winter and one marking the summer Sun Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Thorton, 300&lt;/ref&gt; The glyphs representing significant events would be used as a reference that could be consulted regarding the order of the years.  More extensive oral histories were passed down using the winter counts as guide posts.

Traditionally each band would choose a single keeper of the winter count. Until the 20th century, these keepers were always men. They would consult with tribal elders to reach a consensus for choosing a name for the year. The keeper chose his successor in recording the count, who was often a family member.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt;

Until the late 19th century, winter counts were recorded on buffalo hides. When buffalo became scarce, keepers resorted to using muslin, linen, or paper.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt; The annual pictographs began on either the left or right side of the drawing surface and could be run in lines, spirals, or serpentine patterns.

== Corroborating dates ==
[[Garrick Mallery]], a Smithsonian scholar, recognized that one of those events, "The Year the Stars Fell," correlated with the [[Leonids|Leonid]] meteor storm of November 1833. He used  that event to correlate the Lakota winter counts with western calendars and analyze the history of the people.&lt;ref name="eih"/&gt;
