[[File:Chicken Slaughter at the market.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken slaughter at the market in [[Indonesia]]]]
'''Animal slaughter''' is the killing of  [[animal]]s, usually referring to killing [[Domestication|domestic]] [[livestock]].  In general, the animals would be killed for [[food]]; however, they might also be slaughtered for other reasons such as being diseased and unsuitable for consumption. The slaughter involves some initial cutting, opening the major [[body cavity|body cavities]] to remove the [[gastrointestinal tract|entrails]] and [[offal]] but usually leaving the [[wikt:carcass#Noun|carcass]] in one piece. Such '''dressing''' can be done by [[hunting|hunters]] in the field (field dressing of [[game (hunting)|game]]) or in a [[slaughterhouse]]. Later, the carcass is usually [[butcher]]ed into smaller cuts.

The animals most commonly slaughtered for food are [[cattle]] and [[water buffalo]] for [[beef]] and [[veal]], [[sheep]] for [[lamb and mutton]], [[goat]]s for [[goat meat]] ,  [[pig]]s for [[pork]], [[deer]] for [[venison]], [[horse]]s for [[horse meat]], [[poultry]] (mainly [[chickens]], [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] and [[ducks]]), [[entomophagy|insects]] (a commercial species is the [[house cricket]]), and increasingly, [[fish]] in the [[aquaculture]] industry ([[fish farming]]).

== Modern history ==
[[File:Rembrandt, bue squartato, 1655, 01.JPG|thumb|thumb|right|"[[Slaughtered Ox]]" by [[Rembrandt]], 1655]]
[[File:Richardson's abattoir.jpg|thumb|right|Blueprint for a [[slaughterhouse]] designed by [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], published 1908.]]
The use of a sharpened blade for the slaughtering of livestock has been practiced throughout history. Prior to the development of electric stunning equipment, some species were killed by simply striking them with a blunt instrument, sometimes followed by exsanguination with a knife.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal eventually led to the adoption of specific stunning and slaughter methods in many countries. One of the first campaigners on the matter was the eminent physician, [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], who spent many years of his later working life developing more humane methods of slaughter as a result of attempting to discover and adapt substances capable of producing general or local [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] to relieve pain in people. As early as 1853, he designed a chamber that could kill animals by gassing them.  He also founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter and experimented with the use of electric current at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Richardson, Benjamin Ward|first=D'Arcy|last= Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1911, the [[Council of Justice to Animals]] (later the Humane Slaughter Association, or HSA) was established in England to improve the slaughter of livestock.&lt;ref name=HSANewsletterMarch2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Slaughter Association Newsletter March 2011|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/annual-reports-and-newsletters/News%202011.pdf|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, the HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of humane stunning by many local authorities.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the HSA|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/about/history-of-the-hsa|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSA went on to play a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. This made the mechanical stunning of cows and [[electrical stunning]] of pigs compulsory, with the exception of [[Shechita|Jewish]] and [[Dhabihah|Muslim meat]].&lt;ref name=History /&gt;&lt;ref name=LeeseShechita&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leese|first1=Arnold|title=The Legalised Cruelty Of Shechita: The Jewish Method Of Cattle-Slaughter|url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/HTML-docs/cattle-slaughter.htm|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern methods, such as the [[captive bolt pistol]] and electric tongs were required, and the act's wording specifically outlawed the poleaxe. The period was marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long-lasting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Methods ==
Many countries have adopted the principle of a two-stage process for the non-ritual slaughter of animals. This is to ensure a rapid death with minimal suffering. The first stage of the process, usually called [[stunning]], renders the animal unconscious, and thus not susceptible to pain, but not necessarily dead. In the second stage, the animal is killed, usually by slitting its throat and allowing the blood to drain. Countries differ in the methods which have been legalised for different species or different ages, some regulations being governmental, others being religious.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Stunning ===
[[File:Stunning with captive bolt gun.jpeg|thumb|upright|300px|Stunning a cow with a captive bolt pistol]]
Various methods are used to render an animal unconscious during animal slaughter. 

;Electrical (stunning or slaughtering with electric current known as [[electronarcosis]]):This method is used for [[swine]], [[sheep]], [[Calf|calves]], [[cattle]], and [[goats]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=Mead only discusses poultry.}} [[Electric current|Current]] is applied either across the brain or the heart to render the animal unconscious before being killed. In industrial slaughterhouses, chickens are killed prior to scalding by being passed through an electrified water-bath while shackled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=edited by G.C.|title=Poultry meat processing and quality.|date=2004|publisher=Woodhead Pub.|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-85573-903-1|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpGkAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=O1odoa7pZ2&amp;dq=%22water%20bath%20stunner%22&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=%22water%20bath%20stunner%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Gaseous ([[Carbon dioxide]]):This method can be used for sheep, calves and swine. The animal is [[asphyxia]]ted by the use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas before being killed. In several countries, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stunning is mainly used on pigs. A number of pigs enter a chamber which is then sealed and filled with 80% to 90% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in air. The pigs lose consciousness within 13 to 30 seconds. Research has produced conflicting results, with some showing pigs tolerate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stunning and others showing they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|title=When is carbon dioxide stunning used in abattoirs?|publisher=RSPCA|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jong, E.C., Barnett, J.L. and Hemsworth, P.H., (2000).

Determination of Aversion to the Initial Inhalation of Carbon Dioxide or Argon.  Animal Welfare, Volume 4, Number 4, November 1995, pp. 273-280(8)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrogen]] has been used to induce unconsciousness, often in conjunction with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Domesticated turkey|Domestic turkeys]] are averse to high concentrations of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (72% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in air) but not low concentrations (a mixture of 30% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 60% argon in air with 3% residual oxygen).&lt;ref&gt;Raj, M., (1999). Aversive reactions of turkeys to argon, carbon dioxide and a mixture of carbon dioxide and argon. Veterinary Record, 138:592-593 DOI:10.1136/vr.138.24.592&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Killing hen for lunch.jpg|thumb|A hen being slaughtered in Brazil]]
;Mechanical ([[Captive bolt pistol]]):This method can be used for sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, and other [[Equidae|equines]]. A captive bolt pistol is applied to the head of the animal to quickly render them unconscious before being killed.  There are three types of  captive bolt pistols, penetrating, non-penetrating and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts has largely been discontinued in commercial situations to minimize the risk of transmission of disease when parts of the brain enter the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

;[[Firearm]] (gunshot/free bullet): This method can be used for cattle, calves, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines. A conventional firearm is used to fire a bullet into the brain of the animal to render the animal quickly unconscious (and presumably dead). 

=== Killing ===
[[File:Hen being slaughtered.ogv|thumbnail|Video of hen being slaughtered]]
;Exsanguination: The animal either has its throat cut or has a chest stick inserted cutting close to the heart.  In both these methods, main [[veins]] and/or [[arteries]] are cut and allowed to bleed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmed animal welfare: Slaughter|publisher=Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs|date=3 September 2009|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/index.htm#3a |accessdate=March 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926035316/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/welfare/slaughter/index.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hsa.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Red%20Meat%20Slaughter.htm |title=Slaughter Red |publisher=Hsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National laws ==
=== Europe ===
[[File:051 Uccisione del maiale.jpg|thumb|A pig being slaughtered in Italy.]]
The measures for sanitary checks, animal welfare protection and slaughtering procedures are harmonised throughout the European Union, and detailed by the European Commissions' regulations CE 853/2004, 854/2004 and 1099/2009.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the handling and slaughter of food animals is a shared responsibility of the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] (CFIA), industry, stakeholders, transporters, operators and every person who handles live animals.
Canadian law requires that all federally registered slaughter establishments ensure that all species of food animals are handled and slaughtered humanely. The CFIA verifies that federal slaughter establishments are compliant with the Meat Inspection Regulations.
The CFIA's humane slaughter requirements take effect when the animals arrive at the federally registered slaughter establishment. Industry is required to comply with the Meat Inspection Regulations for all animals under their care.
The Meat Inspection Regulations define the conditions for the humane slaughter of all species of food animals in federally registered establishments. Some of the provisions contained in the regulations include:
*guidelines and procedures for the proper unloading, holding and movement of animals in slaughter facilities
*requirements for the segregation and handling of sick or injured animals
*requirements for the humane slaughter of food animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Handling and Slaughter of Food Animals in Canada|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets/specific-products-and-risks/meat-and-poultry-products/humane-handling/eng/1363460100144/1363460243413|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Animal slaughter in the UK is governed under both its own laws and EU law regarding slaughter. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ([[Defra]]) is the main governing body responsible for legislation and codes of practice covering animal slaughter in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the UK the methods of slaughter are largely the same as those used in the United States with some differences.
The use of captive bolt equipment and electrical stunning are approved methods of stunning sheep, goats, cattle and calves for consumption&lt;ref name="hsa.org.uk" /&gt;- with the use of gas reserved for swine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html |title=Pig Slaughter |publisher=Hsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) specifies the approved methods of livestock slaughter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animallaw.info/administrative/adus9cfr313.htm | title= Humane Slaughter of Livestock Regulations (National Citation: 9 C.F.R. 313.1 – 90) | publisher=Animal Legal and Historical Center (regulations from [[USDA]]) | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these methods is outlined in detail, and the regulations require that inspectors identify operations which cause "undue" "excitement and discomfort" of animals.

In 1958, the law that is enforced today by the USDA [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) was passed as the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1978. This Act requires the proper treatment and humane handling of all food animals slaughtered in USDA inspected slaughter plants. It does not apply to chickens or other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Methods of Slaughter Act|url=https://awic.nal.usda.gov/government-and-professional-resources/federal-laws/humane-methods-slaughter-act|publisher=National Agricultural Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== 4D Meat  ======
Meat from animals which are dead, diseased, disabled or dying (4-D meat) on the arrival at the slaughterhouse is often salvaged for [[Rendering_(animal_products)|rendering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/4D+meat|title=4D meat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and used by a wide range of industries including pet food manufacturers, zoos, greyhound kennels, and mink ranches. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074712.htm|title=Compliance Policy Guides - CPG Sec. 690.500  Uncooked Meat for Animal Food|first=Office of Regulatory|last=Affairs|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Code (Title 21, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, § 644) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/644|title=21 U.S. Code § 644 - Regulation of transactions, transportation, or importation of 4–D animals to prevent use as human food|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulates transactions, transportation, or importation of 4–D animals to prevent use as human food: 

''"No person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of buying, selling, or transporting in commerce, or importing, dead, dying, disabled, or diseased animals, or any parts of the carcasses of any animals that died otherwise than by slaughter, shall buy, sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, or import, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules or other equines, or parts of the carcasses of any such animals that died otherwise than by slaughter, unless such transaction, transportation or importation is made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe to assure that such animals, or the unwholesome parts or products thereof, will be prevented from being used for human food purposes."''

The 2004 report to US Congress titled “Animal Rendering: Economics and Policy” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs9085/|title=Animal Rendering: Economics and Policy|first=Becker, Geoffrey|last=S.|date=17 March 2004|publisher=|journal=Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;, available in the library of Congressional Research Service, in the ‘Introduction’ paragraph explains Renderers in the US and Canada convert dead animals and other waste material into sellable products: 

''“Renderers convert dead animals and animal parts that otherwise would require disposal into a variety of materials, including edible and inedible tallow and lard and proteins such as meat and bone meal (MBM). These materials in turn are exported or sold to domestic manufacturers of a wide range of industrial and consumer goods such as livestock feed and pet food, soaps, pharmaceuticals, lubricants, plastics, personal care products, and even crayons.”''

Although some authors have found health problems associated with the consumption of 4D meat by certain species in its raw form &lt;ref&gt;https://www.grey2kusa.org/pdf/4-DMeatFactSheet.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; or found it potentially hazardous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegepets.info/diets/meat.html|title=Meat-based diets|website=www.vegepets.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Food_and_Drug_Administration|FDA]] considers it fit for animal consumption: 

''"Pet food consisting of material from diseased animals or animals which have died otherwise than by slaughter, which is in violation of 402(a)(5) will not ordinarily be actionable, if it is not otherwise in violation of the law. It will be considered fit for animal consumption."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 690.300 about Canned Pet Food|url=https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074710.htm|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious laws for ritual slaughter ==
[[Ritual slaughter]] is the overarching term accounting for various methods of slaughter used by religions around the world for food production. While keeping religious autonomy, these methods of slaughter, within the United States, are governed by the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] and various religion-specific laws, most notably, [[Shechita]] and [[Dhabihah]].

=== Buddhism ===
Animal slaughter in [[Buddhism]] is not accepted . According to the 1st Pancasila ([[Five Precepts|Precept]]) "I undertake the training rule to avoid killing"; however, in practice animal slaughter commonly takes place in majority Buddhist countries and most Buddhists are not vegetarian. In addition, Buddhist monks must eat all foods given to them, including meat. Some Buddhists interpret killing for food as acceptable.

=== Shechita – Jewish law for slaughtering animals ===
[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|Shechita slaughter of a chicken]]
Animal slaughter in [[Judaism]] falls in accordance to the religious law of [[Shechita]]. In preparation, the animal being prepared for slaughter must be considered [[kosher]] (fit) before the act of slaughter can commence and consumed. The basic law of the Shechita process requires the rapid and uninterrupted severance of the major vital organs and vessels. They slit the throat, resulting in a quick drop in blood pressure, restricting blood to the brain. This abrupt loss of pressure results in the rapid and irreversible cessation of consciousness and sensibility to pain (a requirement held in high regard by most institutions.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Sam|title=Halal, shechita and the politics of animal slaughter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/halal-shechita-politics-animal-slaughter|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhabihah – Islamic law for slaughtering animals ===
{{Main|Dhabihah}}
Animal slaughtering in [[Islam]] is in accordance with the [[Qur’an]]. To slaughter an animal is to cause it to pass from a living state to a dead state. For the meat to be lawful ([[Halal]]) according to Islam, it must come from an animal which is a member of a lawful species and it must be ritually slaughtered, i.e. according to the Law, or the sole code recognized by the group as legitimate. The animal is killed in ways similar to the Jewish ritual with the throat being slit (dabh), resulting in a quick drop in blood pressure, restricting blood to the brain. This abrupt loss of pressure results in the rapid and irreversible cessation of consciousness and sensibility to pain (a requirement held in high regard by most institutions.). The slaughterer must say ''Bismillah'' (In the name of Allah/God) before slaughtering the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benkheira|first=Mohammed|title=Artificial death, canonical death: Ritual slaughter in Islam.|journal=Food and Foodways|date=2000|volume=8|series=4|issue=4|pages=227–252|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/07409710/v08i0004/227_adcdrsii.xml|doi=10.1080/07409710.2000.9962092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood must be drained out of the carcass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|title=Halal, shechita and the politics of animal slaughter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/halal-shechita-politics-animal-slaughter|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
There has been controversy over whether or not animals should be slaughtered and over the various methods used.  Some people believe [[sentient]] beings should not be harmed regardless of the purpose, or that meat production is an insufficient justification for harm. Religious slaughter laws and practices have always been a subject of debate, and the certification and labeling of meat products remain to be standardized. Animal welfare concerns are being addressed to improve slaughter practices by providing more training and new regulations. There are differences between conventional and religious slaughter practices, although both have been criticized on grounds of animal welfare. Concerns about religious slaughter focus on the stress caused during the preparation stages before the slaughtering, pain and distress that may be experienced during and after the neck cutting and the worry of a prolonged period of time of lost brain function during the points between death and preparation if a stunning technique such as electronarcosis is not applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anil|first=Haluk|title=Religious slaughter: A current controversial animal welfare issue|url=http://www.animalfrontiers.org/content/2/3/64.full|publisher=Animal Frontiers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antihaitianismo''' ({{IPA-es|ˈanti.aitjanˈizmo}}, {{lang-fr|Antihaitienisme}}, {{lang-en|italic=yes|anti-Haitianism}}), also called '''anti-Haitianism''' in some English sources, is prejudice or social discrimination against Haitians in the Dominican Republic.

Antihaitianismo includes prejudice against, hatred of, or discrimination against [[Haiti]]ans and their language, culture, but not their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fX8rAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |title=Joaquín Balaguer, Memory, and Diaspora: The Lasting Political Legacies of and Diaspora |page=63 | author=Liberato, Ana S.

==Antihaitianismo in the Dominican Republic==

===Origins: 16th century through 19th century===

[[Human Rights Watch]] has stated in their reports that the differences between Haitians and Dominicans can be based on colonial times from linguistic, cultural, and racial differences. For instance, the [[Dominican Republic]] was governed by the Spanish, and thus acquired part of their culture from the Spanish, mixed with African and Native American. [[Haiti]], on the other hand, was governed by the French, and its culture is a mixture of French, African and Native American. The majority of Haiti's population is descended almost entirely from [[African diaspora|African]] slaves, while [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominicans]] possess a [[multiracial]] mix of Spanish, African and to a lesser extent, Native American ancestry. It is evident that historical background is related between the two countries, however, there are major cultural divisions.
 
''Antihaitianismo'' can be traced back to a policy of [[racial segregation]] instituted by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] in the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]] (present-day Dominican Republic).&lt;ref name="sagas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagás |first=Ernesto |title=A Case of Mistaken Identity: Antihaitianismo in Dominican Culture |publisher=Webster University |url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |accessdate=2007-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008042155/http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/antihaiti.htm |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Hispaniola|the island]] was split into absolutist [[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola|chiefdoms]], three where modern-day Santo Domingo now exists, and two where modern-day Haiti now exists (albeit also including some territory which is currently part of Santo Domingo).  [[Island Caribs|Carib people]] from islands further south were often at war with the [[Taíno people]]. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] reached the island in 1492 (slaves imported from Africa arrived from 1503 onwards&amp;mdash;many natives were also soon enslaved), and within a few decades the Spanish controlled most of the island. During the 17th century, however, the French also began maneuvering for control, and in 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick|acquired the western portion]] (now part of Haiti&amp;mdash;whereas the Spanish portion encompassed the modern Dominican Republic). During the 1790s and early 19th century, the French and Spanish battled back and forth across the island; by 1809 the [[Haitian Revolution]] had resulted in the overthrow of both French and Spanish control.  The [[Reconquista (Santo Domingo)|Spanish briefly retook]] the eastern portion that same year, but in 1821 [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|lost control again]] in another rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Haitian forces [[Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo|again briefly controlled the entire island]], from 1822 to 1844. In 1844 the secret revolutionary movement called "La Trinitaria" took place and the Dominican Republic declared its independence defeating the Haitian forces. After several tumultuous decades, the Spanish [[Dominican Restoration War|briefly acquired nominal control]] of the Dominican Republic in the 1860s, setting off another war. By the late 19th century, over three hundred years of European control was ended; the modern history of [[Haiti#20th century|west Hispaniola (Haiti)]] and [[Dominican Republic#20th century|east Hispaniola (Dominican Republic)]] had begun.

===Under Trujillo: 1930s and 1940s===
''Antihaitianismo'' was strongly institutionalized during the regime of [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Border disputes under Trujillo culminated in the order of a military intervention and to massacre Haitians accused of practicing [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] or [[witchery]], practices that were against the religious beliefs of the time. Claims range "from several hundred to 26,000"&lt;ref name="sagas2" /&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=May 2018}} or even "recorded as having a death toll reaching 30,000"&lt;ref name="Cambeira'96"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Cambeira |title=Quisqueya la bella |edition=October 1996 |page=182 |publisher=M.E.

===Present day: 1990s===
Trujillo's policies served to perpetuate antihaitianismo within the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref name="sagas2"/&gt;  In the 1996 Dominican presidential election, [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (historical leader of the [[Right-wing populism|populist Right]] and former right-hand of dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo|Trujillo]]) united in a "National Patriotic Front" with PLD candidate [[Leonel Fernández]] in order to prevent [[José Francisco Peña Gómez|Peña Gómez]] from becoming President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/world/dominican-republic-holds-runoff-capping-fierce-race.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Dominican Republic Holds Runoff, Capping Fierce Race | first=Larry | last=Rohter | date=1996-07-01 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/43/051.html James Ferguson, Two Caudillos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baopuzi.JPG|thumb|First Page of ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 9]]
[[File:Laojunfu.gif|thumb|''Laojun rushan fu'' 老君入山符 "Lord [[Laozi|Lao]]'s amulet for entering mountains" from ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 17]]
The '''''Baopuzi''''' ({{zh|s=抱朴子|t=抱朴子|p=Bàopǔzǐ|w=Pao-p'u-tzu|l=[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity}}), written by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]] 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric ''Neipian'' 內篇 "Inner Chapters" and exoteric ''Waipian'' 外篇 "Outer Chapters". The [[Daoist]] Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], elixirs, and demonology. The [[Confucianist]] Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese literature]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], politics, and society.

==Title==
The [[eponymous]] title ''Baopuzi'' derives from Ge Hong's [[Art name|''hao'']] 號 "sobriquet; pseudonym" Baopuzi (lit. "embrace simplicity master"), which compounds ''bao'' [[Wikt:抱|抱]] "embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' or [[Wikt:朴|朴]] "uncarved wood, [a [[Taoism#Pu|Daoist metaphor]] for a] person's original nature; simple; plain", and ''zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; offspring; master [title of respect]". ''Baopu'' is a classical allusion to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), "Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries."

Ge Hong's autobiography explains choosing his [[pen name]] Baopuzi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (''Pao-p'u''), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) "people all call me a ''pao-p'u'' scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)"; (Sailey 1978:251) "among the people of his district there were those who called him "The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity"."  Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, "This name has been translated ''Old Sober-Sides'', but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated ''Solemn-Seeming Philosopher''." Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates "Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature".

==History==
Compared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the ''Baopuzi'' are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]] founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).

Ge Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the ''Baopuzi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed ''Nei p'ien'' in 20 scrolls, ''Wai p'ien'' in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My ''Nei p'ien'', telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My ''Wai p'ien'', giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), "I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready."

Ge's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), [[Emperor Cheng of Jin]] granted Ge the fief of "Marquis of [[Guanzhong]]" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the ''Baopuzi'' during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).

The ''Baopuzi'' consists of 70 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters; books" divided between the 20 "Inner Chapters" and 50 "Outer Chapters" (cf. the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' textual division). [[Nathan Sivin]] (1969:389) described it as "not one book but two, considerably different in theme". The ''Neipian'' and ''Waipian'' "led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time".

The (1444–1445) [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist canon" first printed the two ''Baopuzi'' parts together. This ''Zhengtong Daozang'' 正統道藏 "Daoist Canon of the [[Zhengtong Emperor|Zhengtong]] Era (1436-1450)" bibliographically categorized the ''Baopuzi'' under the ''Taiqing'' 太清 "Supreme Clarity" section for alchemical texts. ''Daozang'' editions encompass six ''juan'' (卷 "scrolls; fascicles; volumes"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of ''Baopuzi'' descend from this Ming ''Daozang'' text.

==Content==
The ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from [[esotericism]] to [[social philosophy]]. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], meditation, [[Daoist yoga]], [[Daoyin]], [[Taoist sexual practices|sexual techniques]], [[Chinese herbology]], demons, and [[Fulu|''fu'']] 符 "magic talismans". The Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called "the fullest document of this kind that early China produced".

According to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the ''ben'' 本 "root; trunk; origin" and Confucianism as the ''mo'' 末 "tip; branch; end" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, "Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?" – Baopuzi replies, "Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism."

While the ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is ''Huowen yue'' 或問曰 "Someone asked, saying" and ''Baopuzi da yue'' 抱樸子答曰 "Baopuzi answered, saying".

===Inner Chapters===
The twenty ''Neipian'' "Inner Chapters" record arcane techniques for achieving ''xian'' "transcendence; immortality". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars later differentiated into ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir; internal alchemy" and ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir; external alchemy". The word ''dan'' [[Wikt:丹|丹]] "[[cinnabar]]; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill" means  "[[Pill of Immortality|pill of immortality]], or [[elixir of life]]. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. "Internal alchemy" concerns creating an "immortal body" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). "External" or "laboratory alchemy" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing ''fu'' talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.

Lai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) proofs of the ''per se'' existence of immortals and transcendent states of immortality of the body; (2) stipulation of the accessibility to the perfect state of long life to everyone, irrespective of one's social status but dependent on whether one could study deeply and strenuously cultivate the necessary esoteric methods; (3) elaboration of diverse esoteric techniques leading one to become a ''hsien''-immortal; and (4) descriptions and criticism of the diverse contemporary Taoist discourses and sects. (1998:191-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).

Many scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:437), who called Ge Hong "the greatest alchemist in Chinese history", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Interlocutor'': Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. &lt;br&gt;
''Ko'': According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, "Admittedly there is much in the ''Pao Phu Tzu'' which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce."

In addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention  the ''Baopuzi'' formula for making [[mosaic gold]] "a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment" from ''chiyan'' 赤塩 "red crystal salt" (produced from [[amethyst]], [[calcite]] [[crystal]], and [[alum]]; Ware 1966:273) and ''huizhi'' 灰汁 "[[limewater]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or "mosaic gold" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of ''Ch'ih Yen'' (Red Salt) and ''Huei Chih'' (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of ''Ch'ih Yen''." They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). "All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." (1935:232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors add, "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make [[tin foil]] and that he made magic or spirit money out of it."

===Outer Chapters===
The fifty ''Waipian'' "Outer Chapters" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This ''Baopuzi'' portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of [[Luoyang]].

Some of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the ''[[Qingtan]]'' "pure conversation" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of [[Cao Cao]]; and [[Pao Ching-yen|Bao Jingyan]] 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.

==Translations==
The Chinese ''Baopuzi'' has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.

The Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the [[history of alchemy]]. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 "On the Gold Medicine" and 16 "On the Yellow and White" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 "Overcoming Obstructions" and 11 "On ''hsien'' Medicines", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).

The Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). "Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion."

Translating the fundamental Daoist word ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' or ''Tao'' "way; path; principle" as English ''[[God]]'' is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's ''Baopuzi'' version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of ''[[Daodejing]]'' 25, "Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet ''Tao'' (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, upon noticing that ''Tao Te Ching'', verse 34, is willing to call the Something "Minimal," every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by ''God''. In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from ''Exod''. 3:13-15 and ''Mark'' 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, "My name is I am, I live, I exist," while the second reads, "God is not of the dead but of the living." Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware admitted his ''God'' for ''Dao'' translation cannot be applied consistently.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the word ''tao'' appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as "the divine process." In instances where either this or "God" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term ''tao shih'' is rendered "processor"; ''hsien'' is translated "genie" rather than "immortal". (1966:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These Chinese words are ''daoshi'' [[Wikt:道士|道士]] "Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner" and [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] [[Wikt:仙|仙]] "immortal; transcendent". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the [[History of science and technology in China]], criticized Ware's mistranslations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that "Genii," as used for rendering the word ''hsien'', does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the ''Thousand-and-One Nights''. The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. ''Tao'' left untranslated and "immortal" for ''hsien''. (1967:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. "Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China."

Ge Hong wrote the ''Baopuzi'' in elegant [[Classical Chinese grammar]] and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing ''xian'' medicines illustrates the translational choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best ''hsien'' medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, ''chih'', the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, ''t'ai i yü yü liang'', ''shih chung huang tzu'' 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), ''shih kuei'' 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, ''shih nao'' 石腦, ''shih liu huang'' 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and ''tseng ch'ing''. (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many ''chih'', then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then ''ming-chu'', then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baoppuzi'' Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on "Buddhism and the ''Pao-p'u-tzu''", "Biography of Ko Hung" from the ''[[Jin Shu]]'', and "Recensions" of lost ''Baopuzi'' fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, "Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture."

==Significance==
For centuries, traditional scholars have revered the ''Baopuzi'' as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.

Traditional scholarship viewed the ''Baopuzi'', especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Wu and Davis described it as, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;probably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Arthur Waley]] praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 "metal-lord" and 河車 "river chariot", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 "the virgin on the river", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the ''Baopuzi'' is a "more important" alchemical text than [[Wei Boyang]]'s (ca. 142) ''[[Cantong qi]]'' 參同契 "The Kinship of the Three". The ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Neijing'' 內經 "Inner Classic" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's ''Cantong ji''.

Modern scholarship has taken another look at the ''Baopuzi''. Sivin demeans the text's significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what "fundamentalist Confucian" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, "an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector", with [[Alan Watts]]. "Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time."  However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, "This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate."

Chi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a "new discourse" on ''xian''-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional "imperial discourse" that only the rich could afford ''xian''-hood. For example, histories record that both [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the "elixir of immortality" from mythical [[Mount Penglai]]. "That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful."
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Ko Hung, the ''hsien''-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that ''hsien''-immortality are distinctive "human" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of ''hsien''-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, "Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power."' Second, in placing the ideal of ''hsien''-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were "models" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, "These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao." (Lai 1998:210) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces ''daoshi'' "Daoist practitioners" seeking ''xian'' techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I asked further, "Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes."

Said Cheng Chun in reply, "The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But ''Tao-shih'' are all poor; witness the adage that ''Hsien'' are never stout and ''Tao-shih'' never rich. ''Tao-shih'' usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware (1966:268) translates this adage, "There are no fat genii and no rich processors".

For a wealthy person seeking ''xian''-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding ''jinye'' 金液 (lit. "gold liquid/fluid") "golden liquor" in a ''huachi'' 花池 (lit. "flower pond") "a vinegar solvent" (fortified with [[saltpeter]]; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional ''jiuding'' 九鼎 "nine tripods" elixirs (attributed to the [[Yellow Emperor]]), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;True it is that the nine medicines are the best of ''Hsien'' medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a ''Hua Ch'ih'' (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into ''Hsien''. Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:251) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pregadio (2006:215) says recent studies show Ge's intent was "glorifying the religious and ritual legacy of [[Jiangnan]] 江南 (the region south of the lower Yangzi River), emphasizing the superiority of certain traditions over others, and enhancing their prestige among the social elite to which Ge Hong belonged." Nonetheless, Pregadio concludes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Ge Hong's testimony deserves attention as a valuable overview of the religious traditions of Jiangnan just before the Way of the Celestial Masters ([[Tianshi dao]]) spread to that area, soon followed by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] revelations. From this point of view, the ''Baopu zi'' documents important links between the earlier and later history of Taoism, as it also does for medicine and other fields. (2006:217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''David Stephen Forbes''' (born November 16, 1948) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] retired professional [[ice hockey]] player.

Signed as a free agent in 1973 by the [[Boston Bruins]], Forbes made an impact as a defensive-minded forward as he helped guide the Bruins to the finals in 1974 during his rookie season, and to the finals in 1977. Forbes played four seasons with Boston until he was claimed by the [[Washington Capitals]] in the Waiver Draft prior to the 1977–78 season. After playing one season with the Capitals, he was released after only playing two games during the 1978–79 season and signed to play for the [[Cincinnati Stingers]] of the [[World Hockey Association]].

==Criminal charges==
Forbes was charged with [[aggravated assault]] in Minneapolis in 1975 after butt-ending [[Henry Boucha]]'s eye socket in a game against the Minnesota North Stars. The trial received much publicity as it was highly unusual for an athlete to face criminal charges for assault during a game. The trial ended with a hung jury; the charges were not refiled.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Kennedy, "A nondecision begs the question," Sports Illustrated, July 28, 1975.  https://www.si.com/vault/1975/07/28/606678/a-nondecision-begs-the-question&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joy Angelia Gardner''' (née '''Burke''', 29 May 1953&amp;nbsp;– 1 August 1993) was a 40-year-old [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] [[Adult learner|mature student]] living as an [[Illegal immigration in the United Kingdom|undocumented migrant]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite news|title=A life without Joy|first=Heather|last=Mills|date=7 March 1999|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/celldeaths/article/0,2763,195387,00.html|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died following an attempt by police officers to detain her for [[deportation]].{{sfn|Bowling|Phillips|2001|page=131}}{{sfn|Scraton|McCulloch|2006|page=7}}

During a police raid on her home in [[Crouch End]], London, she was restrained with handcuffs and leather straps and gagged with a 13-foot length of adhesive "[[Elastoplast]]" tape wrapped around her head.{{sfn|Chigwada-Bailey|2008|page=126}} Unable to breathe, she collapsed and suffered brain damage due to asphyxia.&lt;ref name="amnesty"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Amnesty International]]|title=Death in Police Custody of Joy Gardner|id=EUR/45/05/95|date=1 August 1995|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/172000/eur450051995en.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was placed on [[Mechanical ventilation|life support]] but died following a [[cardiac arrest]] four days later.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=70}} In 1995, three of the police officers involved stood trial for Gardner's manslaughter, but were acquitted.{{sfn|Evans|2011|page=107}}

The case became a [[cause célèbre]] for [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and justice campaigners, and for the first time brought wide public attention to what the ''[[Modern Law Review]]'' called "the inhumanity of the methods used routinely in the execution of deportation orders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Straw in the wind|authorlink=Michael Mansfield|first=Michael|last=Mansfield|journal=[[Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers|Socialist Lawyer]]|issue=32|date=Summer 2000|pages=16-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harlow|1994|page=624}} Despite continuing pressure by campaigners, no [[Inquests in England and Wales|coroner's inquest]] or [[public inquiry]] into the circumstances of Gardner's death has been held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlawful Killing verdicts and prosecutions: 1995|work=Inquest|date=8 July 2015|url=http://www.inquest.org.uk/statistics/unlawful-killing-verdicts-and-prosecutions|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
===Joy Gardner===
Joy Gardner was born in [[Long Bay Beach]], Jamaica, in May 1953.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=67}} Her mother, Myrna Simpson, emigrated to Britain from Jamaica – then still a [[Colony of Jamaica|British colony]] – in 1961, with the intention of sending for her child once she had achieved some financial stability, a common and accepted practice at the time.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt;{{sfn|Young|1996|p=67}} Simpson subsequently became a British citizen.&lt;ref name=mills/&gt; Prior to 1981, Gardner would have had the right to British citizenship through her mother, but changes to immigration legislation in the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] meant this was no longer possible.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=68}} As well as her mother, Gardner's half-brother, three uncles and two aunts were also living in England at the time.{{sfn|Malik|1996|page=38}}

===Immigration status===
Gardner first travelled to England in 1987, leaving an adult daughter behind in Jamaica.{{sfn|Young|1996|p=67}}&lt;ref name=timeshistory/&gt; She entered the country legally using a six-month visitor's [[Visa (document)|visa]], but overstayed when the visa elapsed.&lt;ref name="torode"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Torode|date=3 August 1993|title=When deportation means death: Joy Gardner died after police raided her home|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/when-deportation-means-death-joy-gardner-died-after-police-raided-her-home-john-torode-sifts-fact-from-prejudice-1458919.html|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was pregnant at the time of her arrival, and subsequently gave birth to a son. In September 1990 she married Briton John Gardner, who applied to the Home Office for his new wife to be granted permanent residence. Five weeks later they separated and he withdrew the request. 

In October 1990, Gardner was advised by the Home Office that she should leave the country voluntarily or risk deportation. In December 1990 she applied for a judicial review of her case which was turned down in April 1991. A notice of intention to deport was served on her in October 1991, which she subsequently appealed. During the appeal process a restriction order was applied requiring her to report regularly to local police.&lt;ref name="times65294"&gt;{{cite news|title=Long search for a better life that ended in death|first=Richard|last=Ford|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=15 June 1995|page=3|issue=65294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Appeals Tribunal denied the appeal and a deportation order was issued in April 1992.&lt;ref name="timeshistory"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Gardner: Case History|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=3 August 1993|page=3|issue=64713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=torode/&gt;&lt;ref name=times65294 /&gt; Gardner was interviewed by immigration officials again in early June 1992, and reported to [[Stoke Newington]] police station later that month.&lt;ref name="victor"&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour puts on the pressure for inquiry into death of Joy Gardner: Investigation of deportee case stalled by disputes|first=Peter|last=Victor|date=20 March 1994|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/labour-puts-on-the-pressure-for-inquiry-into-death-of-joy-gardner-investigation-of-deportee-case-1430401.html|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flight to Jamaica was arranged for Gardner in the summer of 1992, but she failed to attend at the airport, stating later that she had not received notification to do so, and her solicitor Djemal Dervish lodged a further appeal, citing "compelling compassionate circumstances."&lt;ref name=times65294 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt;

While living in the UK Gardner moved home several times, but remained in contact with the police, her mother's local MP [[Bernie Grant]] and immigration services. By the summer of 1993 she was studying Media Studies at [[London Metropolitan University]] and living in a [[housing association]] home in Topsfield Close, Crouch End.&lt;ref name=victor /&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; On 28 July 1993 — the day the police raided Gardner's home — Dervish received 2 letters from the Home Office, dated 26 and 27 July. The first letter informed him that arrangements to deport his client would be made "shortly". The second stated that arrangements would be made "now".&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; [[Charles Wardle]], the immigration minister, later admitted that the letters were held back and timed to arrive after the raid to prevent any further judicial appeals being made and to avoid giving Gardner any notice of her deportation, which was to take place at 3.00pm the same day from Heathrow Airport.{{sfn|Young|1996|page=70}}&lt;ref name=victor /&gt;{{sfn|Young|1996|page=69}}

===Aliens Deportation Group===
The [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s (MPS) Aliens Deportation Group (ADG) was a specialist squad of uniformed police officers belonging to Scotland Yard's SO1(3), part of the  [[Specialist Operations]] branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Leppard|title=A question of restraint: Joy Gardner|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|location=London|date=8 August 1993|page=10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squad was composed of a Detective Inspector, a Detective Sergeant, and seven Detective Constables.&lt;ref name=ford/&gt; They were tasked with accompanying immigration officers - who had no [[power of arrest]] - who were serving deportation orders where violent resistance by the deportee was considered probable. The squad operated in groups of three, with two officers then accompanying the deportee on their flights out of the country.&lt;ref name=ford/&gt;

==Police raid==
At 7.40&amp;nbsp;am on 28 July 1993, three officers from the ADG, accompanied by two officers from [[Hornsey]] police station and an official from the [[UK Immigration Service]], raided Gardner's home with orders to "detain and remove" her and her 5-year-old son for immediate deportation to Jamaica.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite news|title=Focus turns on aliens squad|first=Richard|last=Ford|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=3 August 1993|page=3|issue=64713}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Young|1996|p=69}}&lt;ref name="duce"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police used 13ft of sticky tape to gag woman, court told|first=Richard|last=Duce|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=16 May 1995|page=3|issue=65268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why did Joy Gardner die?|first=Nick|last=Cohen|date=8 August 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/why-did-joy-gardner-die-it-should-not-surprise-anyone-that-an-illegal-immigrants-death-can-cause-a-national-scandal-nick-cohen-reports-1459872.html|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers had with them a 4-inch wide restraint belt with attached handcuffs, and leather straps and rolls of adhesive tape to restrain her thighs and ankles.&lt;ref name="times64714"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police suspended after deportation death|first1=Bill|last1=Frost|first2=Richard|last2=Ford|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=4 August 1993|page=1|issue=64714}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gardner resisted the officers' attempts to place her in the restraint belt, she was overpowered, shackled, gagged, and adhesive tape was also wrapped around her head and face.{{sfn|Chigwada-Bailey|2008|page=126}}&lt;ref name="alibhaibrown"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 January 2012|authorlink=Yasmin Alibhai-Brown|first=Yasmin|last=Alibhai-Brown|title=We will repeat the past if we don't remember it|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/yasmin-alibhaibrown-we-will-repeat-the-past-if-we-dont-remember-it-6287054.html|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ford2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Gardner died 'after form of suffocation'|first=Richard|last=Ford|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=11 August 1993|page=5|issue=64720}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suffered [[respiratory failure]] almost immediately and was taken to the [[Whittington Hospital]], [[North London]].&lt;ref name=timeshistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnstone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother claims police taped deportee's mouth|first=Helen|last=Johnstone|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=5 August 1993|page=3|issue=64715}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on 1 August 1993 due to [[cerebral hypoxia]] and [[cardiac arrest]], without regaining consciousness.&lt;ref name=ford2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jamaican dies after deportation collapse|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=2 August 1993|page=2|issue=64712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of death==
Gardner was examined by four [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologists]] who concluded that the cause of death was [[cerebral hypoxia]]. As she had suffered a minor head injury during the struggle samples of brain tissue were subsequently examined by an independent [[Neuropathology|neuropathologist]] to establish whether brain injury may have caused the hypoxia rather than asphyxiation as a direct result of the gag and tape. Two further tests were then conducted by independent neuropathologists who both dismissed the head injury as a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doubts delay inquiry into Joy Gardner's death|first=Terry|last=Kirby|date=12 December 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/doubts-delay-inquiry-into-joy-gardners-death-1466994.html|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manslaughter trial==
On 15 May 1995, three police officers from the ADG stood trial accused of Gardner's [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Gardner's son issues writ over immigration case death|first=Jamie|last=Wilson|date=15 February 1999|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/15/jamiewilson|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key part of the defence case was that Gardner's death was caused by head trauma sustained as she violently resisted the officers and not as a direct result of the tape used to gag her.&lt;ref name=amnesty /&gt;&lt;ref name="times65274"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Gardner 'was not killed by gag'|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=23 May 1995|page=8|issue=65274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Lannas, a forensic pathologist, testified: "There were bruises on the scalp that indicates the head had struck a hard surface. The lack of oxygen was secondary to the head injury. The brain was injured. That led to deprivation of oxygen and death. Such a swelling would lead to cardiac arrest and the deprivation of oxygen."&lt;ref name=times65274 /&gt; Experts for the prosecution and other pathologists disputed Lannas' findings.&lt;ref name=amnesty /&gt;

On 2 June 1995, Detective Constable John Burrell was acquitted on the directions of the judge, [[Charles Mantell|Mr Justice Mantell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Policeman cleared of suffocating Gardner|first=Richard|last=Duce|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=3 June 1995|page=3|issue=65284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detective Sergeant Linda Evans and Detective Constable Colin Whitby were found not guilty by the jury on 14 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Gardner case police cleared of manslaughter|first1=Richard|last1=Duce|first2=Stewart|last2=Tendler|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=15 June 1995|page=1|issue=65294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the trial, the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] announced that there would be no internal disciplinary inquiry.&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gardner police in clear|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=13 July 1995|page=2|issue=65318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCA said that "a disciplinary charge of authority would in substance be the same as the criminal charge of which the officers have been acquitted" and "an officer cannot be tried on both criminal and discipline charges for the same
offence".&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result of Gardner's death, the use of mouth gags was suspended by the Commissioner of the MPS in August 1993 and banned by [[Michael Howard]], the [[Home Secretary]], in January 1994.{{sfn|Haacke|1997|page=37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gardner death ends gagging of deportees|first=Stewart|last=Tendler|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=13 January 1994|page=5|issue=64851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, questions were raised about the work of Paula Lannas, the defence pathologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second pathologist under scrutiny after Clark case|first=Robert|last=Verkaik|date=31 January 2003|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/second-pathologist-under-scrutiny-after-clark-case-133613.html|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in June 1998 she testified that bruising on the neck of a 16-month-old child "resulted from strangulation by the mother's boyfriend." The defendant was acquitted when forensic pathologist Iain West testified that the post mortem examination had been so "[[wikt:cack-handed|cack-handed]]" that the bruising may have been inflicted by Lannas, and the prosecution informed the jury that her conclusions were "suspect" and could not be relied on as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 January 2003|title=Hopes grow for 'Rettendon Two'|first=Chris|last=Summers|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2604343.stm|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pathologist disciplinary case collapses|first=Steven|last=Morris|date=25 April 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/25/ukcrime.stevenmorris|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, two men had their convictions for manslaughter quashed when it was disclosed that Lannas had testified at their trial that the victim had been killed by a stab wound and had no other injuries. Subsequent examination found a potentially fatal skull fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Inside Time]]|issue=39|year=2000|url=http://www.mojuk.org.uk/Portia/archive%207/integrity.html|accessdate=22 December 2015|title=Pathologist's integrity dealt fatal blow|via=Miscarriages of Justice UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 disciplinary tribunal alleged that Lannas's pathology work "consistently fell substantially short" of expected standards and there were "substantive deficiencies" in "her technical approach and medical knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expert witness's work 'deficient'|first=Steven|last=Morris|date=20 March 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/20/stevenmorris|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1999 Gardner's family brought a civil suit against the police for compensation.&lt;ref name=wilson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=15 February 1999|title=Joy Gardner's family sues police|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/279922.stm|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google's program popularized the term (deep) "dreaming" to refer to the generation of images that produce desired [[activation (neural network)|activation]]s in a trained [[deep neural network|deep network]], and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches.

==History==
The DeepDream software originated in a deep [[convolutional neural network|convolutional network]] codenamed "Inception" after the [[Inception|film of the same name]],&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed for the [[ImageNet#ImageNet_Challenge|ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]] (ILSVRC) in 2014&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt; and released in July 2015.

The dreaming idea and name became popular on the internet in 2015 thanks to Google's DeepDream program.  The idea dates from early in the history of neural networks,&lt;ref name=lewis88&gt;{{cite conference |last=Lewis |first=J.P. |title=Creation by refinement: a creativity paradigm for gradient descent learning networks |conference=IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks|year=1988|doi=10.1109/ICNN.1988.23933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar methods have been used to synthesize visual textures.&lt;ref name=portilla00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portilla |first=J |last2=Simoncelli |first2=Eero |title=A parametric texture model based on joint statistics of complex wavelet coefficients |journal=International Journal of Computer Vision |year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1026553619983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Related visualization ideas were developed (prior to Google's work) by several research groups.&lt;ref name=erhan09&gt;{{cite conference |last=Erhan |first=Dumitru. |title=Visualizing Higher-Layer Features of a Deep Network |conference=International Conference on Machine Learning Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies|year=2009|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron_Courville/publication/265022827_Visualizing_Higher-Layer_Features_of_a_Deep_Network/links/53ff82b00cf24c81027da530.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simonyan14&gt;{{cite conference |last=Simonyan |first=Karen |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |last3=Zisserman |first3=Andrew |title=Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps |conference=International Conference on Learning Representations Workshop |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Google published their techniques and made their code [[open source]],&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{GitHub|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of tools in the form of web services, mobile applications, and desktop software appeared on the market to enable users to transform their own photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/03/google-deep-dream |title= These Google "Deep Dream" Images Are Weirdly Mesmerising |work= Wired |author= Daniel Culpan |date= 2015-07-03 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The software is designed to [[face detection|detect faces]] and other patterns in images, with the aim of automatically classifying images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8904641/fear-and-loathing-clip-google-deep-dream-visualization |title= Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is terrifying through the eyes of a computer |date= 7 July 2015 |accessdate= 2015-07-25 |author= Rich McCormick |work= The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once trained, the network can also be run in reverse, being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron (e.g. the one for faces or certain animals) yields a higher confidence score. This can be used for visualizations to understand the emergent structure of the neural network better, and is the basis for the DeepDream concept. However, after enough reiterations, even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of [[pareidolia]] results, by which [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] and [[Surrealism|surreal]] images are generated algorithmically. The optimization resembles [[Backpropagation]], however instead of adjusting the network weights, the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted.

For example, an existing image can be altered so that it is "more cat-like", and the resulting enhanced image can be again input to the procedure.&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage resembles the activity of looking for animals or other patterns in clouds.

Applying gradient descent independently to each pixel of the input produces images in which
adjacent pixels have little relation and thus the image has too much high frequency information.
The generated images can be greatly improved by including a prior or [[regularization (mathematics)|regularizer]] that prefers inputs
that have natural image statistics (without a preference for any particular image), or are simply smooth.&lt;ref name="simonyan14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mahendran&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mahendran |first=Aravindh |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |title=Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them |conference=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299155 |arxiv=1412.0035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yosinski15&gt;{{cite conference |last=Yosinski |first=Jason |last2=Clune |first2=Jeff |last3=Nguyen |first3=Anh |last4=Fuchs |first4=Thomas |title=Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization |conference=Deep Learning Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Deep Learning Workshop |year=2015 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Mahendran et al.&lt;ref name=mahendran/&gt; used the total variation regularizer that prefers images that are piecewise constant. Various regularizers are discussed further in.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt; An in-depth, visual exploration of feature visualization and regularization techniques was published more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olah|first=Chris|last2=Mordvintsev|first2=Alexander|last3=Schubert|first3=Ludwig|date=2017-11-07|title=Feature Visualization|url=https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/|journal=Distill|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.23915/distill.00007|issn=2476-0757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cited resemblance of the imagery to [[LSD]]- and [[psilocybin]]-induced hallucinations is suggestive of a functional resemblance between artificial neural networks and particular layers of the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaFrance|first1=Adrienne|title=When Robots Hallucinate|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/robots-hallucinate-dream/403498/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Deep Dreamscope (19822170718).jpg|thumb|left|A late-stage ''DeepDream'' processed photograph of three men in a pool]]
The dreaming idea can be applied to hidden (internal) neurons other than those in the output, 
which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt;
It is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron (this usage is sometimes called Activity Maximization)&lt;ref name=nguyen16&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nguyen |first=Anh |last2=Dosovitskiy |first2=Alexey |last3=Yosinski |first3=Jason |last4=Brox |first4=Thomas |title=Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1605.09304 |year=2016 |bibcode=2016arXiv160509304N }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an entire layer of neurons.

While dreaming is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art, it has recently been proposed that adding "dreamed" inputs to the training set can improve training times for abstractions in Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Arora |first=Sanjeev |last2=Liang |first2=Yingyu |last3=Tengyu |first3=Ma |title=Why are deep nets reversible: A simple theory, with implications for training |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1511.05653 |year=2016 |bibcode=2015arXiv151105653A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DeepDream model has also been demonstrated to have application in the field of [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spratt|first=Emily L.|date=2017|title=Dream Formulations and Deep Neural Networks: Humanistic Themes in the Iconology of the Machine-Learned Image|url=https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/18452/19403/Spratt%20-%20final.pdf|journal=Kunsttexte|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeepDream was used for [[Foster the People]]'s music video for the song "Doing It for the Money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=fosterthepeopleVEVO|title=Foster The People - Doing It for the Money|date=2017-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ1VorN9Cl0|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Grande''' was a massive ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' (''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'') in [[Tasmania]] and [[Australia]]'s largest tree.   It was located on a ridge in the upper [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|Derwent valley]], adjacent to the World Heritage Area of the Florentine Valley, approximately {{convert|100|km}} from [[Hobart]].  The tree stood {{convert|79|m}} in height, had a girth of {{convert|19|m}}, and a volume of 439 cubic metres. While it was not the tallest tree in Australia, it was considered to be the largest in terms of volume,&lt;ref name="BBC2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3306655.stm|title=Forestry officials admit killing biggest tree|date=10 December 2003|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's biggest-stemmed flowering plant.&lt;ref name="WildernessSociety2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/forests/elgrande_4 |title=El Grande, Australia's most massive tree topples |date=7 March 2007 |publisher=The Wilderness Society (Tasmania) Inc |accessdate=18 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222043404/http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/forests/elgrande_4 |archivedate=22 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of the tree, which had already been used as a symbol in the [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|Wilderness Society]]'s campaign against logging, brought national and international media attention.

'''Eleanor de Montfort, Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon''' (1252 – 19 June 1282) was an English noble. She was the daughter of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] and [[Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester|Eleanor of England]].  She was also the second woman who can be shown to have used the title [[Princess of Wales]].

==Early life==
Eleanor's maternal grandparents were [[John of England]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Isabella of Angoulême]]. 
Her maternal uncles included [[Henry III of England]] and [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]]. Her maternal aunts included [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland]], [[Isabella of England]], and [[Joan, Lady of Wales]].

When Eleanor was thirteen years old, her father Earl Simon and brother Lord Henry were killed at the [[Battle of Evesham]] (4 August 1265). According to the chroniclers, [[Nicholas Trivet]], [[William Rishanger]] and others, Earl Simon had earlier made an alliance with [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], whereby it was agreed that Llywelyn and Eleanor would marry.  
After Earl Simon's death, his family was forced to flee the [[Kingdom of England]]: Countess Eleanor took her daughter to the safety of the Dominican nunnery at [[Montargis]], France, a Montfort foundation.

==Marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd==
Countess Eleanor died in Spring 1275, and shortly afterwards Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, and Eleanor de Montfort [[Marriage by proxy|married by proxy]], (per nuncios) ''per verba de presenti'' (Canon law endorsed a marital bond that was made in this way, with the full consent of both of the individuals, before witnesses).{{sfn|Norgate|1894}}

==Capture and imprisonment by Edward I==
Eleanor began the sea voyage from France to north Wales, avoiding making a land passage through England.  
The two ships carrying Eleanor, her brother Amaury and their entourage, sailing off the south coast of England, were captured by sailors from the port of [[Bristol]], just off the [[Isles of Scilly]]. 
Six named men together with the crews of four ships of Bristol were rewarded with a payment of 220 marks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Calendar Patent Rolls]], 1272–81, 161; PRO Liberate Rolls C62&lt;/ref&gt;
'Thomas Larchdeacon', 'Thomas the Archdeacon', who masterminded the capture on behalf of her first cousin [[Edward I of England]] was paid £20 in May 1276 by the king's orders, through the sheriff of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Close Rolls, 1272–79, 292&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleanor was taken by ship to Bristol, then held prisoner at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for nearly three years.&lt;ref&gt;PRO: Liberate Rolls, C62/ 52&lt;/ref&gt;
She was released in 1278 following the signing of the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] between Edward I of England and Llywelyn ap Gruffydd.

==Married life==
Eleanor and Llywelyn were formally married (''secundum formam ecclesie'') at the cathedral door, as was the custom, of the cathedral church at [[Worcester]], on the Feast Day of St Edward, 1278; Edward gave the bride, his cousin, away and paid for the wedding feast. 
Before the wedding mass was celebrated, Edward insisted that Llywelyn should put his seal to an adjustment to the agreement that they had previously made. 
Llywelyn had no alternative but to comply, and he later stated that he did it under duress, 'moved by the fear that can grip a steadfast man'.&lt;ref&gt;''Registrum Epistolarum Fratis Johannis Peckham Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis'', Lambeth Palace Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ceremony, Eleanor became officially known as Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1272–81, 306; CPR, 1281–92, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Ancient Correspondence'', 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Foedera'' I, ii, 576, 584, 587&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Eleanor died giving birth to [[Gwenllian of Wales]] on 19 June 1282 &lt;ref&gt;The chronicle of Bury St Edmunds, p.74-76&lt;/ref&gt; at the royal palace in [[Abergwyngregyn]], on the north coast of Gwynedd. Her body was taken across the Lafan Sands to the [[Franciscan|Franciscan Friary]] at [[Llanfaes]], Anglesey.&lt;ref&gt;''Brut y Tywysogion'', Peniarth MS20, 223; Peniarth MS20Tr, 117&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Friary had been founded by [[Llywelyn the Great]], the grandfather of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, in memory of his wife [[Joan, Lady of Wales|Joan]] (Eleanor's aunt).

On 12 July 1282, members of Eleanor's personal household were given safe-conduct while traveling back into England.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Welsh Rolls'', 234)&lt;/ref&gt; Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was killed on 11 December 1282. Her one-year-old daughter, Gwenllian, was captured the following year by English forces. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had the child banished to the remote [[Sempringham Priory]] in [[Lincolnshire]], where she remained until her death in 1337.{{sfn|Norgate|1894}}

'''Eli Lilly and Company''' is a global [[pharmaceutical]] company headquartered in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], with offices in 18 countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by Col. [[Eli Lilly]], a pharmaceutical [[chemist]] and veteran of the [[American Civil War]], after whom the company was named.

Lilly's notable achievements include being the first company to mass-produce the [[polio vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]], and [[insulin]]. It was one of the first [[pharmaceutical]] companies to produce human [[insulin]] using [[recombinant DNA]] including Humulin ([[Insulin (medication)|insulin medication]]), Humalog ([[insulin lispro]]), and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the US, Basaglar ([[insulin glargine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/12/28/10-all-time-greatest-eli-lilly-drugs/76070470/ | title=10 all-time greatest Eli Lilly drugs | first=Jeff | last=Swiatek | work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] | date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly is currently the largest manufacturer of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] medications and produces Prozac ([[fluoxetine]]), Dolophine ([[methadone]]), Cymbalta ([[duloxetine]]), and Zyprexa ([[olanzapine]]).

The company is ranked 132nd on the [[Fortune 500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/eli-lilly/ | title=Fortune 500: Eli Lilly | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ranked 221st on the [[Forbes Global 2000]] list of the largest public companies in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/eli-lilly-co/ | title=Forbes: The World's Biggest Public Companies | work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 252nd on the Forbes list of America's Best Employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/lilly/ | title=Forbes: America's Best Employers | work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a [[Paris, Illinois]], drugstore with James W. Binford.&lt;ref name=b911&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis|author=David J. Bodenhamer and Robert G. Barrows, eds. |publisher=Indiana University Press | location =Bloomington and Indianapolis | year=1994 |page=911| isbn=0-253-31222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.&lt;ref name=LillyBio&gt;{{cite web| title =Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898) | work = | publisher =Lilly Archives  | date =January 2008 | url =http://www.in.gov/governorhistory/mitchdaniels/files/Press/lillybio.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =m6&gt;{{cite book | author=James H.

===Early days: 1870–1900===
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b540 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Indiana Historical Society]] recreated a replica of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street for its exhibition, "You Are There: ''Eli Lilly at the Beginning''," at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis. The temporary exhibition (October 1, 2016, to January 20, 2018) also includes costumed interpreters portraying Colonel Lilly, among others.

Lilly Sr.|Josiah]] (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.&lt;ref name=p59/&gt;&lt;ref name = m6/&gt;

One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was [[quinine]], a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.&lt;ref name=p57&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4470|1876|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|11318|1877|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars),&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|48000|1879|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=p57/&gt; Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878.

The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR14&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =1 and 4 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m27&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective [[patent medicine]]s. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt; Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company's other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.&lt;ref name=p59/&gt;

In 1881, Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.&lt;ref name=Kahn23/&gt; Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science|Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.&lt;ref name=b913&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for [[syphilis]], some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as [[eczema]] and [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref name=m27/&gt;&lt;ref name=MadisonM72&gt;{{cite journal | author =James H.

As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert M. Taylor Jr. |author2=Errol Wayne Stevens |author3=Mary Ann Ponder |author4=Paul Brockman | title=Indiana: A New Historical Guide | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =1989 | location =Indianapolis | page =423 | isbn=0-87195-048-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eli Lilly Medicines, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of Lilly's [[throat lozenge]]s from a 1906 sales book.]]

Around 1890, Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.&lt;ref name = b911/&gt;&lt;ref name = p60&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.&lt;ref name=PodczekJones&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Capsules|author1=Fridrun Podczeck  |author2=Brian E. Jones, |pages=12–13|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |year=2004 |location=Chicago|isbn=0-85369-568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did&amp;mdash;manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups".&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs than the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt;

In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.&lt;ref name=p60/&gt; As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli]] and [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.|Josiah Jr.]] (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | pages =2, 5 and 6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1898|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=bb912&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', pp. 17–18, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', pp. 51, 112–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.&lt;ref name=IHSindustry3&gt;{{cite web | title =The Pharmaceutical Industry in Indiana | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =3 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/The%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20in%20Indiana.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-20 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130608203946/http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/The%20Pharmaceutical%20Industry%20in%20Indiana.pdf | archive-date =8 June 2013 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1905|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt;

===Modernization:1900–1940===
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began constructions of the [[Lilly Biological Laboratories]], a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Taylor|title =Indiana: A New Historical Guide | page =481|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SHAARD"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html| title = Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) | publisher = Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology | format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-04-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url =https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/1b3be/N/Lilly_Biological_Labs_Hancock_CO_Nom.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Lilly Biological Laboratories| accessdate = 2016-04-01| author=Eugene F. Rodman| format = PDF| date=April 1976}} and Accompanying photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR1/&gt; Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.&lt;ref name=MadisonM73&gt;Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1917 ''Scientific American'' article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".&lt;ref name=MadisonM73/&gt; One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.&lt;ref name = p59&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.&lt;ref name=PodczekJones/&gt;

Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.&lt;ref name=MadisonM73/&gt; In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MadisonM74&gt;Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."&lt;ref name=MadisonM74/&gt; This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"/&gt;

During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.&lt;ref name=MadisonM72/&gt; In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, [[J. J. R. Macleod]], [[Frederick G. Banting]], and [[Charles H. Best]], were working on the development of [[insulin]] for treatment of diabetes.&lt;ref name=MadisonM76/&gt; Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the [[University of Toronto]] scientists to mass-produce insulin.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Sickening sweet|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=12–15|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/sickening-sweet|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.&lt;ref name=MLilly61&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."&lt;ref name=MadisonM76/&gt;

The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.&lt;ref name="IHSHBR256"/&gt; In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two [[Harvard University]] scientists, [[George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]]. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with [[George Whipple]], a [[University of Rochester]] scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 66&amp;ndash;67.&lt;/ref&gt; Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.&lt;ref name=MLilly67&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5/&gt; That same year [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli Lilly]], the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 28&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 62&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new [[Lilly Research Laboratories]], "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.&lt;ref name=MLilly111&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in [[England]], with headquarters in [[London]] and a manufacturing plant in [[Basingstoke, England|Basingstoke]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5/&gt;&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt;

===Expansion: 1940–1970===
[[World War II]] brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of [[Thiomersal|Merthiolate]] and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the [[American Red Cross]] to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".&lt;ref name="Madison, Eli Lilly, p. 105"&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 65 and 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MLilly65&gt;{{cite book | last = Madison | first = James H. | title =Eli Lilly: A Life, 1885&amp;ndash;1977 | page=65| publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =1989 | location =Indianapolis | isbn =0-87195-047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing [[penicillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 107&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

International operations expanded even further during World War II.&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt; Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref name=MLilly111/&gt;

At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.&lt;ref name=b540&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.]] (Joe).&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91, 119&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt; During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.&lt;ref name="bb912"/&gt; He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 120 and 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.

Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[Polio vaccine|poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine]]. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.&lt;ref name=IHSpolio5&gt;{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=5| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.&lt;ref name=IHSpolio6&gt;{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=6| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.

During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in [[Lafayette, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=b541&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased [[antibiotic]] production with its patent on [[erythromycin]]. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of [[veterinary]] pharmaceuticals. In 1969, the company opened a new plant in [[Clinton, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=b541/&gt;

After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6/&gt; In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in [[Liverpool]], England. In 1968, Lilly built its first research facility, the [[Lilly Research Centre]] Limited, outside the United States near [[London|London, England]] in [[Surrey]].

===1970-present===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, [[Cefalexin|Keflex]], in 1971; a heart drug, [[Dobutamine|Dobutrex]], in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a [[leukemia]] drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, [[Benoxaprofen|Oraflex]]; and an analgesic, [[Dextropropoxyphene|Darvon]]. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.

In 1971, the company became a component of the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]].

To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]] for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]] in 1987 for $657 million.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR7&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =7 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and [[intravenous]] fluid infusion monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/14/archives/eli-lilly-signs-agreement-to-acquire-ivac-corp.html?nytmobile=0|title=Eli Lilly Signs Agreement To Acquire Ivac Corp.|last=Times|first=Special to the New York|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of [[Artificial pacemaker|heart pacemakers]] in 1977. In 1980, Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s, Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1989, a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and [[Dow Chemical]] created DowElanco. In 1997, Lilly sold its 40% share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to [[Dow AgroSciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-16/business/fi-59266_1_dow-elanco | title=Dow to Buy Lilly's 40% Stake in Dow Elanco | agency=[[Reuters]] | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=May 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR8&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =8 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.&lt;ref name=Kokomo73194&gt;{{cite news | last =Armor | first =Nancy | title =New Lilly Chief Nurtures Change | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomo, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1994-07-31 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Vaughn Bryson was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.&lt;ref name=KokomoTrib62893/&gt; In 1993 [[Randall L.

[[Sidney Taurel]], former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.

In 1998, Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with [[Icos|Icos Corporation]] (ICOS), a [[Bothell, Washington]]-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize [[Tadalafil|Cialis]], a product for the treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]].

==Collaborative research==
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR12&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page =1 and 2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhardt and Evans were [[Purdue University]] graduates. See {{cite web | title=Eli Lilly &amp; Company | page=2 | url=http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2013-02-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date=29 July 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase&amp;mdash;its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."&lt;ref name=b540 /&gt; The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MLilly55&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed [[insulin]] at the [[University of Toronto]] significantly impacted the company’s future.&lt;ref name=MLilly55/&gt; Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=MadisonM76&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR4&gt;{{cite web| title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company| page =4| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| archive-date =29 July 2016| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.

===Publicly funded research===
In addition to internal research and development activities, Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the [[European Commission]] to improve the safety of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Alliances | work = | publisher =Genedata | location =Basel, Switzerland | url =http://www.genedata.com/alliances.html | accessdate =2013-02-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Consortium&gt;{{cite web | title = InnoMed PredTox Consortium Members Present Preliminary Study Results | publisher =Genedata | location = Basel, Switzerland | date =2008-05-15 | url =http://www.genedata.com/index.php?id=211&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5bpS%5d=1259741735&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=22&amp;cHash=139a0c79812ccfccf9dbf2a79a1001ab| archive-url =https://archive.is/20130411003210/http://www.genedata.com/index.php?id=211&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5BpS%5D=1259741735&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22&amp;cHash=139a0c79812ccfccf9dbf2a79a1001ab| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2013-04-11}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A.

==Pharmaceutical brands==
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included [[insulin]], which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.&lt;ref name=MLilly65/&gt; Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).&lt;ref&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are [[cephalosporin]], [[erythromycin]], and [[Prozac]] (fluoxetine), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) for the treatment of [[clinical depression]]. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[mental health]]-related conditions, including [[clinical depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[narcotic]] addiction, [[insomnia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Cialis===
{{further|Tadalafil}}
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] (tadalafil), a competitor to [[Pfizer]]'s blockbuster [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]]. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with [[biotechnology]] company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.&lt;ref&gt;With its television advertisement for Cialis during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show]], Eli Lilly was one of several companies whose costly 2004 [[Super Bowl]] Halftime advertisements were largely overshadowed by the [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cymbalta===
{{further|Duloxetine}}
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, [[Duloxetine|Cymbalta]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history.  It is also used in the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]], [[neuropathy]], [[chronic pain]] and [[osteoarthritis]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Gemzar===
{{further|Gemcitabine}}
In 1996, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[gemcitabine|Gemzar]] for the treatment of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU [[chemotherapy]] and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell [[lung cancer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Methadone===
{{further|Methadone}}
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of [[methadone]], an [[analgesic]] used frequently in the treatment of [[heroin]], [[opium]] and other [[opioid]] and [[narcotic]] [[drug addiction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Prozac===
{{further|Fluoxetine}}
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of [[serotonin]] within the [[human brain]].  It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other [[central nervous system]] disorders such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], and panic disorders.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Prozac in popular culture====
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. ''[[Prozac Nation (book)|Prozac Nation]]'' (1994), an autobiographical book by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]], was turned into a [[Prozac Nation (film)|film]] of the same name in 2001 and starred [[Christina Ricci]]. ''[[Listening to Prozac]]'' (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. ''Talking Back to Prozac'' (1994), by psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]], focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper [[Jay-Z]] referenced Prozac in the song, "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)|Nigga What, Nigga Who]]" (1998). In [[HBO]]'s fictional series, ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano]]'s use of Prozac is periodically referenced.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Secobarbital===
{{further|Secobarbital}}
Eli Lilly has manufactured [[Secobarbital]], a [[barbiturate]] derivative with [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of [[epilepsy]], temporary [[insomnia]] and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Secobarbital overdoses====
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]]. On September 18, 1970, [[rock music|rock]] guitarist legend [[Jimi Hendrix]] died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress [[Judy Garland]]. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1966) by [[Jacqueline Susann]] in which three highly successful [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Thimerosal===
{{further|Thiomersal}}
Eli Lilly has developed the [[vaccine]] preservative [[thiomersal]] (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyze]]. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the [[University of Maryland]] with support of a Lilly research fellowship."&lt;ref name=MLilly65/&gt;

===Zyprexa===

Zyprexa ([[Olanzapine]]) (for [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[off-label]] uses) Released in 1996, (see criminal prosecution section) it was the company's best selling drug through 2010, when the [[patent]] expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=Duff|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?pagewanted=all | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.&lt;ref name=MLilly112&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR6/&gt; In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Lilly Director Dies in Hawaii | newspaper =Anderson Herald | location =Anderson, IN | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =1977-03-29 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Lilly Move No Big Surprise | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomi, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1991-09-18 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.&lt;ref name=KokomoTrib62893 /&gt;

[[Randall L. Tobias]], a vice chairman of [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.&lt;ref name=KokomoTrib62893&gt;{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =New Lilly Chief Doesn't Have Own 'Agenda' | newspaper =[[Kokomo Tribune]] | location =Kokomi, IN | date =1993-06-26 | url =https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/2578015/ | accessdate =2015-10-27|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-03-29/pdf/CREC-2006-03-29-pt1-PgS2546-3.pdf|title=Congressional Record, March 29, 2006, S2546|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidney Taurel]], former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR9&gt;{{cite web| title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company| page =9| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf| archive-date =29 July 2016| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. [[John C. Lechleiter]] was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.&lt;ref name=TaurelRetires&gt;{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Lechleiter Named Lilly CEO | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomo, IN | page =A7 | language = | publisher = | date =2007-12-19 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=Drew|last2=Koons|first2=Cynthia|title=Lilly Turns From One Company Veteran to Another for New CEO|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-27/lilly-ceo-lechleiter-to-retire-will-be-replaced-by-david-ricks|work=Bloomberg|date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==

===Community service===
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt; Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref name=b399&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charity Organization Society]], a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by [[United Way of America|United Way]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 402&amp;ndash;03, 911&amp;ndash;12, and 560&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.&lt;ref name=b91012&gt;Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 910&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3 /&gt; Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 [[Johnstown Flood]].&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; 
 
In 1917, Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR3/&gt; Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.&lt;ref name=IHSHBR5&gt;{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly &amp; Company | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | page =5 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160729072945/http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | archive-date =29 July 2016 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.&lt;ref name="Madison, Eli Lilly, p. 105"/&gt;

===Lilly Endowment===
{{main|Lilly Endowment}}
In 1937, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the [[Lilly Endowment]], a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.&lt;ref name=MLilly20506&gt;Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 205&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eli Lilly and Company Foundation===
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Meek  | first =Heather  | title =Lilly, Eli  | work =  | publisher =LearningToGive.org and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University | url =http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper108.html  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements}}
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies.  Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of [[Bovine somatotropin|BGH]] having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from [[Monsanto]].

===Prozac===

A landmark study found that [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) was more likely to increase overall suicidal behavior. 14.7% of the patients (n = 44) on fluoxetine had suicidal events, compared to 6.3% in the psychotherapy group and 8.4% from the combined treatment group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702701/pdf/nihms101259.pdf | pmc=2702701 | pmid=19552869 | volume=70 | title=Suicidal events in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS) | year=2009 | journal=J Clin Psychiatry | pages=741–7 | last1 = Vitiello | first1 = B | last2 = Silva | first2 = SG | last3 = Rohde | first3 = P | last4 = Kratochvil | first4 = CJ | last5 = Kennard | first5 = BD | last6 = Reinecke | first6 = MA | last7 = Mayes | first7 = TL | last8 = Posner | first8 = K | last9 = May | first9 = DE | last10 = March | first10 = JS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eli Lilly, the manufacturer, and the lead researcher did not make these findings obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undark.org/article/wilo-lenzer-danger-within-us/|title=When the Cure Is the Cause: The Case of the Green Hairy Tongue|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several internal documents, which were released by the [[British Medical Journal]], indicated a link between use of Prozac and suicidal or violent behavior. The FDA has warned that Prozac and similar antidepressants could cause agitation, panic attacks and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fda-reportedly-reviewing-eli-lilly-prozac-papers|title=Eli Lilly in Prozac controversy|first=CBS|last=MarketWatch|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents revealed that Eli Lilly knew about this as early as 1984, years before the drug was FDA-approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahrp.org/eli-lilly-prozac-documents-what-do-they-reveal/|title=Eli Lilly Prozac Documents: What do They Reveal? - AHRP|date=26 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAFTA Suit===
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs.  The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854 | title=Eli Lilly files $500M NAFTA suit against Canada over drug patents | author=Stastna, Kazi | publisher=CBC | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal prosecution===
{{See also|Olanzapine#Controversy, lawsuits and settlements|James Gottstein#Eli Lilly memos}}
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate [[qui tam]] lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing olanzapine (branded Zyprexa), an [[antipsychotic]] medication, for uses not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for [[off-label]] uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The [[US Justice Department]] said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a healthcare case and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a US criminal prosecution of any kind.&lt;ref name="usdoj-2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/January/09-civ-038.html | title=Eli Lilly and Company Agrees to Pay $1.415 Billion to Resolve Allegations of Off-label Promotion of Zyprexa | date=January 15, 2009 | work=09-civ-038 | publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/Pr/2009/jan/lillyrelease.pdf | title=Pharmaceutical Company Eli Lilly to Pay Record $1.415 Billion for Off-Label Drug Marketing | work=United States Attorney, Eastern District of Pennsylvania | publisher=United States Department of Justice | date=January 15, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203119/http://www.justice.gov/usao/pae/News/Pr/2009/jan/lillyrelease.pdf | archivedate=17 October 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "That was a blemish for us," [[John C.

The '''''Epic of Gilgamesh''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|ɡ|ə|m|ɛ|ʃ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gilgamesh "Gilgamesh"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature. The literary history of [[Gilgamesh]] begins with five [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for "Gilgamesh"), king of [[Uruk]], dating from the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa|2100 BC}}). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the "Old Babylonian" version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its ''[[incipit]]'', '''''Shūtur eli sharrī''''' ("Surpassing All Other Kings"). Only a few [[clay tablet|tablets]] of it have survived. The later "standard" version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the ''incipit'' '''''Sha naqba īmuru''''' ("He who Saw the Abyss", in modern terms: "He who Sees the Unknown"). Approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library ruins]] of the 7th-century BC [[Assyrian king]] [[Ashurbanipal]].

The first half of the story discusses [[Gilgamesh]], king of [[Uruk]], and [[Enkidu]], a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a prostitute, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins the contest; nonetheless, the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary [[Cedar Forest]], where they plan to slay the Guardian, [[Humbaba]] the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Epic of Gilgamesh Classical and Medieval Literature Criticism | editor-first=Jelena O. | editor-last=Krstovic | volume=74 | publisher=Gale | location=Detroit, MI | date=2005 | isbn=9780787680213 | oclc=644697404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess [[Ishtar]] sends the [[Bull of Heaven]] to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances.  Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull of Heaven after which the gods decide to sentence Enkidu to death and kill him.

In the second half of the epic, distress over Enkidu's death causes Gilgamesh to undertake a long and perilous journey to discover the secret of eternal life. He eventually learns that "Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands".&lt;ref name="Mesopotamia: The Good Life"&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Thrower | title=The Alternative Tradition: A Study of Unbelief in the Ancient World | date=1980 | publisher=Mouton Publishers | location=The Hague, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Henri | last=Frankfort | publisher=Penguin | date=1974 | orig-year=1949 | oclc=225040700 | chapter=Chapter VII: Mesopotamia: The Good Life | title=Before Philosophy: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, an essay on speculative thought in the ancient near East | page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of his great building projects, his account of [[Siduri]]'s advice, and what the immortal man [[Utnapishtim]] told him about [[Flood myth|the Great Flood]], Gilgamesh's fame survived well after his death with expanding interest in the ''Gilgamesh'' story which has been translated into many languages and is featured [[Gilgamesh in popular culture|in works of popular fiction]].

{{quote box|width=25% | align=right|...this discovery is evidently destined to excite a lively controversy. For the present the orthodox people are in great delight, and are very much prepossessed by the corroboration which it affords to Biblical history. It is possible, however, as has been pointed out, that the Chaldean inscription, if genuine, may be regarded as a confirmation of the statement that there are various traditions of the deluge apart from the Biblical one, which is perhaps legendary like the rest|''[[The New York Times]]'', front page, 1872&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=The New York Times | at=front page | date=22 December 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;||}}

The ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was discovered by [[Austen Henry Layard]], [[Hormuzd Rassam]], and W. K. Loftus in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/id/eprint/7497|title=Shattered tablets and tangled threads: Editing Gilgamesh, then and now|last=George|first=Andrew R.|date=2008|website=SOAS University of London|page=1|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central character of Gilgamesh was initially reintroduced to the world as "''Izdubar''", before the [[cuneiform]] [[logograph]]s in his name could be pronounced accurately. The first modern translation was published in the early 1870s by [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=George |date=3 December 1872 |title=The Chaldean Account of the Deluge |work=Sacred-Texts.com |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/chad/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith then made further discoveries of texts on his later expeditions, which culminated in his final translation which is given in his book ''The Chaldaean Account of Genesis'' (1880).

The most definitive modern translation is a two-volume critical work by [[Andrew R. George|Andrew George]], published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2003. A book review by the Cambridge scholar, Eleanor Robson, claims that George's is the most significant critical work on Gilgamesh in the last 70 years.&lt;ref name="Bryn Mawr Classical Review"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2004.04.21 | work=Bryn Mawr Classical Review | date=21 April 2004 | first=Bryn | last=Mawr | url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html | accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; George discusses the state of the surviving material, and provides a tablet-by-tablet [[exegesis]], with a dual language side-by-side translation.  In 2004, Stephen Mitchell supplied a controversial version that takes many liberties with the text and includes modernized allusions and commentary relating to the [[Iraq War]] of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30044781|title=When the Light Came on: The Epic Gilgamesh|first=Mark|last=Jarman|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Mitchell|date=1 January 2005|journal=[[The Hudson Review]]|volume=58|issue=2|pages=329–34|doi=10.2307/30044781|doi-broken-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Stephen |date=24 January 2006 |title=Gilgamesh: A New English Version |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-6169-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrrWd4MsVIAC |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first direct Arabic translation from the original tablets was made in the 1960s by the Iraqi archaeologist [[Taha Baqir]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The discovery of artifacts ({{circa|2600 BC}}) associated with [[Enmebaragesi]] of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], mentioned in the legends as the father of one of Gilgamesh's adversaries, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.&lt;ref name="Dalley" /&gt;{{rp|40–41}}

== Versions ==
From the diverse sources found, two main versions of the epic have been partially reconstructed: the standard Akkadian version, or ''He who saw the deep'', and the Old Babylonian version, or ''Surpassing all other kings''. Five earlier [[Sumer]]ian poems about Gilgamesh have been partially recovered, some with primitive versions of specific episodes in the Akkadian version, others with unrelated stories.

=== Standard Akkadian version ===
The standard version was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in the [[library of Ashurbanipal]] in [[Nineveh]] in 1853. It was written in a dialect of Akkadian that was used for literary purposes. This version was compiled by [[Sin-liqe-unninni]] sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC from earlier texts.

The standard Akkadian version has different opening words, or [[incipit]], from the older version. The older version begins with the words "Surpassing all other kings", while the standard version has "He who saw the deep" (''ša nagba īmuru''), "deep" referring to the mysteries of the information brought back by Gilgamesh from his meeting with Uta-Napishti ([[Deluge (mythology)|Utnapishtim]]) about [[Enki|Ea]], the fountain of wisdom.&lt;ref name="Epic, AG trans"&gt;{{cite book | title= The Epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian Epic Poem and Other Texts in Akkadian and Sumerian |first=Andrew R. |last= George |date=2003 |origyear=1999, 2000 |edition= Third |location= London |publisher= Penguin Books |series= Penguin Classics |oclc=901129328 |isbn=978-0-14-044919-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eCZRK_61adMC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate= 8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilgamesh was given knowledge of how to worship the gods, why death was ordained for human beings, what makes a good king, and how to live a good life. The story of Utnapishtim, the hero of the [[Deluge (mythology)|flood myth]], can also be found in the Babylonian Epic of [[Atrahasis]].

The 12th tablet is a sequel to the original 11, and was probably added at a later date. It bears little relation to the well-crafted 11-tablet epic; the lines at the beginning of the first tablet are quoted at the end of the 11th tablet, giving it circularity and finality. Tablet 12 is a near copy of an earlier Sumerian tale, a prequel, in which Gilgamesh sends Enkidu to retrieve some objects of his from the Underworld, and he returns in the form of a spirit to relate the nature of the Underworld to Gilgamesh.

==== Content of the standard version tablets ====
This summary is based on [[Andrew R. George|Andrew George]]'s translation.&lt;ref name="Epic, AG trans"/&gt;

===== Tablet one =====
The story introduces Gilgamesh, king of [[Uruk]]. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third man, is oppressing his people, who cry out to the gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression takes the form of a ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', or "lord's right", to sleep with brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects. The gods respond to the people's pleas by creating an equal to Gilgamesh who will be able to stop his oppression. This is the primitive man, [[Enkidu]], who is covered in hair and lives in the wild with the animals. He is spotted by a trapper, whose livelihood is being ruined because Enkidu is uprooting his traps. The trapper tells the sun-god [[Shamash]] about the man, and it is arranged for Enkidu to be seduced by [[Shamhat]], a [[Sacred prostitution|temple prostitute]], his first step towards being tamed. After six days and seven nights (or two weeks, according to more recent scholarship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Rawi|first=F. N. H.|last2=George|first2=A. R.|date=2014|title=Back to the Cedar Forest: The Beginning and End of Tablet V of the Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgameš|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/jcunestud.66.2014.0069|journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies|volume=66|pages=69–90|doi=10.5615/jcunestud.66.2014.0069|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of lovemaking and teaching Enkidu about the ways of civilization, she takes Enkidu to a shepherd's camp to learn how to be civilized. Gilgamesh, meanwhile, has been having dreams about the imminent arrival of a beloved new companion and asks his mother, [[Ninsun]], to help interpret these dreams.

===== Tablet two =====
Shamhat brings Enkidu to the shepherds' camp, where he is introduced to a human diet and becomes the night watchman. Learning from a passing stranger about Gilgamesh's treatment of new brides, Enkidu is incensed and travels to Uruk to intervene at a wedding. When Gilgamesh attempts to visit the wedding chamber, Enkidu blocks his way, and they fight. After a fierce battle, Enkidu acknowledges Gilgamesh's superior strength and they become friends. Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the Cedar Forest to slay the monstrous demi-god [[Humbaba]] in order to gain fame and renown. Despite warnings from Enkidu and the council of elders, Gilgamesh is not deterred.

===== Tablet three =====
The elders give Gilgamesh advice for his journey. Gilgamesh visits his mother, the goddess [[Ninsun]], who seeks the support and protection of the sun-god [[Shamash]] for their adventure. Ninsun adopts Enkidu as her son, and Gilgamesh leaves instructions for the governance of Uruk in his absence.

===== Tablet four =====
Gilgamesh and Enkidu journey to the [[Cedar Forest]]. Every few days they camp on a mountain, and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five terrifying dreams about falling mountains, thunderstorms, wild bulls, and a thunderbird that breathes fire. Despite similarities between his dream figures and earlier descriptions of Humbaba, Enkidu interprets these dreams as good omens, and denies that the frightening images represent the forest guardian. As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not to be afraid.

===== Tablet five =====
[[File:Tablet V of the Epic of Gligamesh.JPG|thumb|Tablet V of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'']]
[[File:Reverse side of the newly discovered tablet V of the Epic of Gilgamesh.

The heroes enter the cedar forest. [[Humbaba]], the guardian of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god [[Shamash]] sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. Humbaba pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers to make Gilgamesh king of the forest, to cut the trees for him, and to be his slave. Enkidu, however, argues that Gilgamesh should kill Humbaba to establish his reputation forever. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with a blow to the neck, as well as killing his seven sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Rawi|first=F. N. H.|last2=George|first2=A. R.|date=2014|title=Back to the Cedar Forest: The Beginning and End of Tablet V of the Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgameš|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/jcunestud.66.2014.0069|journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies|volume=66|pages=69–90|doi=10.5615/jcunestud.66.2014.0069|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a gate for the temple of Enlil. They build a raft and return home along the [[Euphrates]] with the giant tree and (possibly) the head of Humbaba.

===== Tablet six =====
Gilgamesh rejects the advances of the goddess [[Ishtar]] because of her mistreatment of previous lovers like [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]]. Ishtar asks her father [[Anu]] to send [[Gugalanna]], the Bull of Heaven, to avenge her. When Anu rejects her complaints, Ishtar threatens to raise the dead who will "outnumber the living" and "devour them". Anu becomes frightened, and gives in to her. Ishtar leads Gugalanna to Uruk, and it causes widespread devastation. It lowers the level of the Euphrates river, and dries up the marshes. It opens up huge pits that swallow 300 men. Without any divine assistance, Enkidu and Gilgamesh attack and slay it, and offer up its heart to Shamash. When Ishtar cries out, Enkidu hurls one of the hindquarters of the bull at her. The city of Uruk celebrates, but Enkidu has an ominous dream about his future failure.

===== Tablet seven =====
In Enkidu's dream, the gods decide that one of the heroes must die because they killed Humbaba and Gugalanna. Despite the protestations of Shamash, Enkidu is marked for death. Enkidu curses the great door he has fashioned for Enlil's temple. He also curses the trapper and Shamhat for removing him from the wild. Shamash reminds Enkidu of how Shamhat fed and clothed him, and introduced him to Gilgamesh. Shamash tells him that Gilgamesh will bestow great honors upon him at his funeral, and will wander into the wild consumed with grief. Enkidu regrets his curses and blesses Shamhat instead. In a second dream, however, he sees himself being taken captive to the [[Underworld|Netherworld]] by a terrifying Angel of Death. The underworld is a "house of dust" and darkness whose inhabitants eat clay, and are clothed in bird feathers, supervised by terrifying beings. For 12&amp;nbsp;days, Enkidu's condition worsens. Finally, after a lament that he could not meet a heroic death in battle, he dies. In a famous line from the epic, Gilgamesh clings to Enkidu's body and denies that he has died until a maggot drops from the corpse's nose.

===== Tablet eight =====
Gilgamesh delivers a lament for Enkidu, in which he calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception in the realm of the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, ''The Death of Gilgamesh''.

===== Tablet nine =====
Tablet nine opens with Gilgamesh roaming the wild wearing animal skins, grieving for Enkidu. Having now become fearful of his own death, he decides to seek [[Utnapishtim]] ("the Faraway"), and learn the secret of eternal life. Among the few survivors of the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], Utnapishtim and his wife are the only humans to have been granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh crosses a mountain pass at night and encounters a pride of lions. Before sleeping he prays for protection to the moon god Sin. Then, waking from an encouraging dream, he kills the lions and uses their skins for clothing. After a long and perilous journey, Gilgamesh arrives at the twin peaks of Mount [[Mashu]] at the end of the earth. He comes across a tunnel, which no man has ever entered, guarded by two [[Scorpion man|scorpion monsters]], who appear to be a married couple. The husband tries to dissuade Gilgamesh from passing, but the wife intervenes, expresses sympathy for Gilgamesh, and (according to the poem's editor Benjamin Foster) allows his passage. He passes under the mountains along the Road of the Sun. In complete darkness he follows the road for 12 "double hours", managing to complete the trip before the Sun catches up with him. He arrives at the Garden of the gods, a paradise full of jewel-laden trees.

===== Tablet ten =====
Gilgamesh meets [[Alewife (trade)|alewife]] [[Siduri]], who assumes that he is a murderer or thief because of his disheveled appearance. Gilgamesh tells her about the purpose of his journey. She attempts to dissuade him from his quest, but sends him to [[Urshanabi]] the ferryman, who will help him cross the sea to Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh, out of spontaneous rage, destroys the stone charms that Urshanabi keeps with him. He tells him his story, but when he asks for his help, Urshanabi informs him that he has just destroyed the objects that can help them cross the Waters of Death, which are deadly to the touch. Urshanabi instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and fashion them into punting poles. When they reach the island where Utnapishtim lives, Gilgamesh recounts his story, asking him for his help. Utnapishtim reprimands him, declaring that fighting the common fate of humans is futile and diminishes life's joys.

===== Tablet eleven =====
[[File:Mr. George Smith, the man who transliterated and read the so-called the Babylonian Flood Story of Tablet XI.jpg|thumb|George Smith, the man who transliterated and read the so-called "Babylonian Flood Story" of Tablet XI]]
Gilgamesh observes that Utnapishtim seems no different from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Ea told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[Asphalt|bitumen]]. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and "all the animals of the field". A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which "all the human beings turned to clay". Utnapishtim weeps when he sees the destruction. His boat lodges on a mountain, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she will never forget the brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she will always remember this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Ea also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account matches the flood story that concludes the ''Epic of [[Atra-Hasis]]'' (see also [[Gilgamesh flood myth]]).

The main point seems to be that when Enlil granted eternal life it was a unique gift. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh falls asleep, and Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread on each of the days he is asleep, so that he cannot deny his failure to keep awake. Gilgamesh, who is seeking to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep. After instructing Urshanabi the ferryman to wash Gilgamesh, and clothe him in royal robes, they depart for Uruk.

As they are leaving, Utnapishtim's wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that at the bottom of the sea there lives a [[boxthorn]]-like plant that will make him young again. Gilgamesh, by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant. Gilgamesh proposes to investigate if the plant has the hypothesized rejuvenation ability by testing it on an old man once he returns to Uruk.

{{quote | There is a plant that looks like a box-thorn, it has prickles like a dogrose, and will prick one who plucks it. But if you can possess this plant, you'll be again as you were in your youth

This plant, Ur-shanabi, is the "Plant of Heartbeat", with it a man can regain his vigour. To Uruk-the-sheepfold I will take it, to an ancient I will feed some and put the plant to the test!&lt;ref name="Epic, AG trans"/&gt;{{rp|98}}}}

Unfortunately, when Gilgamesh stops to bathe, it is stolen by a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], who sheds its skin as it departs. Gilgamesh weeps at the futility of his efforts, because he has now lost all chance of immortality. He returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls prompts him to praise this enduring work to Urshanabi.

===== Tablet twelve =====
This tablet is mainly an Akkadian translation of an earlier Sumerian poem, Gilgamesh and the Netherworld (also known as "Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld" and variants), although it has been suggested that it is derived from an unknown version of that story.&lt;ref name="Dalley" /&gt;{{rp|42}} The contents of this last tablet are inconsistent with previous ones: Enkidu is still alive, despite having died earlier in the epic. Because of this, its lack of integration with the other tablets, and the fact that it is almost a copy of an earlier version, it has been referred to as an 'inorganic appendage' to the epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maier |first=John R. |date=1997 |title=Gligamesh: A reader |publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers |isbn=978-0-86516-339-3 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0Ok5WbdWi3QC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=tablet+XII++++++the+Netherworld#v=onepage&amp;q=tablet%20XII%20%20%20%20%20%20the%20Netherworld&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been suggested that "its purpose, though crudely handled, is to explain to Gilgamesh (and the reader) the various fates of the dead in the Afterlife" and in "an awkward attempt to bring closure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patton |first1=Laurie L. |last2=Doniger |first2=Wendy |date=1996 |title=Myth and Method |publisher=University of Virginia Press |isbn=978-0-8139-1657-6 |page=306 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OgsTmeRHpeUC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=tablet+XII++++++the+Netherworld#v=onepage&amp;q=tablet%20XII%20%20%20%20%20%20the%20Netherworld&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; it both connects the Gilgamesh of the epic with the Gilgamesh who is the King of the Netherworld,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kovacs |first=Maureen |date=1989 |title=The Epic of Gilgamesh |publisher=University of Stanford Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1711-3 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is "a dramatic capstone whereby the twelve-tablet epic ends on one and the same theme, that of "seeing" (= understanding, discovery, etc.), with which it began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=van Driel |editor1-first=G. |editor2-last=Krispijn |editor2-first=Th.

Kraus on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday |isbn=978-90-6258-126-9 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilgamesh complains to Enkidu that various of his possessions (the tablet is unclear exactly what&amp;nbsp;— different translations include a drum and a ball) have fallen into the underworld. Enkidu offers to bring them back. Delighted, Gilgamesh tells Enkidu what he must and must not do in the underworld if he is to return. Enkidu does everything which he was told not to do. The underworld keeps him. Gilgamesh prays to the gods to give him back his friend. [[Enlil]] and [[Suen]] don't reply, but [[Enki|Ea]] and [[Shamash]] decide to help. Shamash makes a crack in the earth, and Enkidu's ghost jumps out of it. The tablet ends with Gilgamesh questioning Enkidu about what he has seen in the underworld.

=== Old Babylonian versions ===
This version of the epic, called in some fragments ''Surpassing all other kings'', is composed of tablets and fragments from diverse origins and states of conservation.&lt;ref name="Epic, AG trans"/&gt;{{rp|101–26}} It remains incomplete in its majority, with several tablets missing and big [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] in those found. They are named after their current location or the place where they were found.

==== Pennsylvania tablet ====
''Surpassing all other kings'' Tablet II, greatly correlates with tablets I-II of the standard version.
Gilgamesh tells his mother Ninsun about two dreams he had. His mother explains that they mean that a new companion will soon arrive at Uruk. In the meanwhile the wild Enkidu and the priestess (here called Shamkatum) are making love. She tames him in company of the shepherds by offering him bread and beer. Enkidu helps the shepherds by guarding the sheep. They travel to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh and stop his abuses. Enkidu and Gilgamesh battle but Gilgamesh breaks off the fight. Enkidu praises Gilgamesh.

==== Yale tablet ====
''Surpassing all other kings'' Tablet III, partially matches tablets II-III of the standard version.
For reasons unknown (the tablet is partially broken) Enkidu is in a sad mood. In order to cheer him up Gilgamesh suggests going to the Pine Forest to cut down trees and kill Humbaba (known here as Huwawa). Enkidu protests, as he knows Huwawa and is aware of his power. Gilgamesh talks Enkidu into it with some words of encouragement, but Enkidu remains reluctant. They prepare, and call for the elders. The elders also protest, but after Gilgamesh talks to them, they agree to let him go. After Gilgamesh asks his god (Shamash) for protection, and both he and Enkidu equip themselves, they leave with the elder's blessing and counsel.

==== Philadelphia fragment ====
Possibly another version of the contents of the Yale Tablet, practically irrecoverable.

==== Nippur school tablet ====
In the journey to the cedar forest and Huwawa, Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams.

==== Tell Harmal tablets ====
Fragments from two different versions/tablets tell how Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams on the way to the Forest of Cedar, and their conversation when entering the forest.

==== Ishchali tablet ====
After defeating Huwawa, Gilgamesh refrains from slaying him, and urges Enkidu to hunt Huwawa's "seven auras". Enkidu convinces him to smite their enemy. After killing Huwawa and the auras, they chop down part of the forest and discover the gods' secret abode. The rest of the tablet is broken.

The auras are not referred to in the standard version, but are in one of the Sumerian poems.

==== Partial fragment in Baghdad ====
Partially overlapping the felling of the trees from the Ishchali tablet.

==== Sippar tablet ====
Partially overlapping the standard version tablets IX–X.
Gilgamesh mourns the death of Enkidu wandering in his quest for immortality. Gilgamesh argues with Shamash about the futility of his quest. After a lacuna, Gilgamesh talks to [[Siduri]] about his quest and his journey to meet [[Utnapishtim]] (here called Uta-na'ishtim). Siduri attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="Mesopotamia: The Good Life"/&gt; After one more lacuna, Gilgamesh smashes the "stone ones" and talks to the ferryman Urshanabi (here called Sur-sunabu). After a short discussion, Sur-sunabu asks him to carve 300 oars so that they may cross the waters of death without needing the "stone ones". The rest of the tablet is missing.

The text on the Old Babylonian Meissner fragment (the larger surviving fragment of the Sippar tablet) has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', and it has been suggested that a "prior form of the story – earlier even than that preserved on the Old Babylonian fragment – may well have ended with Siduri sending Gilgamesh back to Uruk..." and "Utnapistim was not originally part of the tale."&lt;ref&gt;Abusch, T. Gilgamesh's Request and Siduri's Denial.

=== Sumerian poems ===
There are five extant Gilgamesh stories in the form of older poems in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].&lt;ref name="Epic, AG trans"/&gt;{{rp|141–208}} These probably circulated independently, rather than being in the form of a unified epic. Some of the names of the main characters in these poems differ slightly from later Akkadian names; for example, "Bilgamesh" is written instead of "Gilgamesh", and there are some differences in the underlying stories such as the fact that Enkidu is Gilgamesh's servant in the Sumerian version:
# ''The lord to the Living One's Mountain'' and ''Ho, hurrah!'' correspond to the [[Cedar Forest]] episode (standard version tablets II–V). Gilgamesh and Enkidu travel with other men to the Forest of Cedar. There, trapped by Huwawa, Gilgamesh tricks him (with Enkidu's assistance in one of the versions) into giving up his auras, thus losing his power.
# ''Hero in battle'' corresponds to the [[Bull of Heaven]] episode standard version tablet VI) in the Akkadian version. The Bull's voracious appetite causes drought and hardship in the land while Gilgamesh feasts. [[Lugalbanda]] convinces him to face the beast and fights it alongside Enkidu.
# ''The envoys of [[Aga of Kish|Akka]]'' has no corresponding episode in the epic, but the themes of whether to show mercy to captives, and counsel from the city elders, also occur in the standard version of the Humbaba story. In the poem, Uruk faces a siege from a Kish army led by King Akka, whom Gilgamesh defeats and forgives.
# ''In those days, in those far-off days'', otherwise known as ''Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld'', is the source for the Akkadian translation included as tablet XII in the standard version, telling of Enkidu's journey to the Netherworld. It is also the main source of information for the [[Sumerian creation myth]] and the story of "[[Inanna#The huluppu tree|Inanna and the ''Huluppu'' Tree]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=Sumerian Mythology: A Study of Spiritual and Literary Achievement in the Third Millennium B.C.: Revised Edition|date=1961|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-8122-1047-7|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/|pages=30–41|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The great wild bull is lying down'', a poem about Gilgamesh's death, burial and consecration as a semigod, reigning and giving judgement over the dead. After dreaming of how the gods decide his fate after death, Gilgamesh takes counsel, prepares his funeral and offers gifts to the gods. Once deceased, he is buried under the Euphrates, taken off its course and later returned to it.

==Later influence==
=== Relationship to the Bible ===
{{Further|Panbabylonism}}
Various themes, plot elements, and characters in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' have counterparts in the [[Hebrew Bible]]—notably, the accounts of the [[Garden of Eden]], the advice from [[Ecclesiastes]], and the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

==== Garden of Eden ====
The parallels between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gmirkin | first=Russell | title=Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus.. | publisher=Continuum | date=2006 | page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blenkinsopp | first=Joseph | title=Treasures old and new.. | publisher=Eerdmans | date=2004 | pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both, a man is created from the soil by a god, and lives in a natural setting amongst the animals. He is introduced to a woman who tempts him. In both stories the man accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former realm, unable to return. The presence of a snake that steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity.

==== Advice from Ecclesiastes ====
Several scholars suggest direct borrowing of [[Siduri]]'s advice by the author of [[Ecclesiastes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Van Der Torn | first=Karel | chapter=Did Ecclesiastes copy Gilgamesh? | title=Bible Review | volume=16 | issue=1 | date=February 2000 | page=22ff | url=https://www.baslibrary.org/bible-review/16/1/9 | accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rare proverb about the strength of a triple-stranded rope, "a triple-stranded rope is not easily broken", is common to both books.

==== Noah's flood ====
[[Andrew R. George|Andrew George]] submits that the [[Genesis flood narrative]] matches that in Gilgamesh so closely that "few doubt" that it derives from a Mesopotamian account.&lt;ref name="George2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=George |first=A. R. |authorlink=Andrew R. George |date=2003 |title=The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-927841-1 |pages=70– |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21xxZ_gUy_wC&amp;pg=PA70 |accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the ''Gilgamesh'' flood tale "point by point and in the same order", even when the story permits other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Rendsburg, Gary. "The Biblical flood story in the light of the ''Gilgamesh'' flood account," in ''Gilgamesh and the world of Assyria'', eds Azize, J &amp; Weeks, N. Peters, 2007, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar [[Robert Wexler (rabbi)|Robert Wexler]] stated: "The most likely assumption we can make is that both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Wexler | title=Ancient Near Eastern Mythology | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ziusudra]], [[Utnapishtim]] and [[Noah]] are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the [[ancient Near East]].

==== Additional biblical parallels ====
Matthias Henze suggests that [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s madness in the biblical [[Book of Daniel]] draws on the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''. He claims that the author uses elements from the description of Enkidu to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar... | last=Leiden | first=Brill | date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many characters in the Epic have mythical biblical parallels, most notably [[Ninti]], the [[Sumerian goddess]] of life, was created from [[Enki]]'s rib to heal him after he had eaten forbidden flowers. It is suggested that this story served as the basis for the story of [[Eve]] created from [[Adam]]'s rib in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Meagher 1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meagher |first=Robert Emmet |date=1995 |title=The meaning of Helen: in search of an ancient icon |publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Pubs (IL) |location=United States |isbn=978-0-86516-510-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Esther J. Hamori, in ''Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story'', also claims that the myth of [[Jacob and Esau]] is paralleled with the wrestling match between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamori |first1=Esther J. |title=Echoes of Gilgamesh in the Jacob Story |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |date=Winter 2011 |volume=130 |issue= 4 |pages=625–642 |jstor=23488271 |doi=10.2307/23488271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on Homer ===
Numerous scholars have drawn attention to various themes, episodes, and verses, indicating that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' had a substantial influence on both of the [[epic poems]] ascribed to [[Homer]]. These influences are detailed by [[Martin Litchfield West]] in ''The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth | first=Martin Litchfield | last=West | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | date=2003 | isbn=978-0198152217 | oclc=441880596 | orig-year=1997 | pages=334–402}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tzvi Abusch of Brandeis University, the poem "combines the power and tragedy of the ''[[Iliad]]'' with the wanderings and marvels of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. It is a work of adventure, but is no less a meditation on some fundamental issues of human existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abusch |first=Tzvi |date=Dec 2001 |title=The Development and Meaning of the Epic of Gilgamesh: An Interpretive Essay |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |doi=10.2307/606502 |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=614–22|jstor=606502 |bibcode=1964JAOS...84..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===
{{Main|Gilgamesh in popular culture}}
The ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' has inspired many works of literature, art, and music, as [[Theodore Ziolkowski]] points out in his book ''Gilgamesh Among Us: Modern Encounters With the Ancient Epic'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Theodore | last=Ziolkowski | authorlink=Theodore Ziolkowski | title=Gilgamesh Among Us: Modern Encounters With the Ancient Epic | publisher=Cornell Univ Pr | date=8 December 2011 | isbn=978-0-8014-5035-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berfrois&gt;{{cite web | first=Theodore | last=Ziolkowski | authorlink=Theodore Ziolkowski | date=1 November 2011 | url=http://www.berfrois.com/2011/11/theodore-ziolkowski-gilgamesh | title=Gilgamesh: An Epic Obsession | publisher=Berfrois | accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after [[World War I]] that the ''Gilgamesh'' epic reached a modern audience, and only after [[World War II]] that it was featured in a variety of genres.&lt;ref name=berfrois /&gt;

[[File:Volkov during Russian EVA28.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Sergey Volkov (cosmonaut)|Sergey Volkov]] works outside the International Space Station on August 3, 2011.]]
[[File:Sts114 033.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stephen Robinson]] riding the [[Canadarm|robotic arm]] during [[STS-114]], doing a first in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle. The landmass in the backdrop is the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari region]] of [[Somalia]].]]
'''Extravehicular activity''' ('''EVA''') is any activity done by an [[astronaut|astronaut or cosmonaut]] outside a [[spacecraft]] beyond the [[Kármán line|Earth's appreciable atmosphere]]. The term most commonly applies to a '''spacewalk''' made outside a craft orbiting Earth (such as the [[International Space Station]]), but also has applied to [[Moon|lunar]] surface exploration (commonly known as '''moonwalks''') performed by six pairs of American astronauts in the [[Apollo program]] from 1969 to 1972. On each of the last three of these missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. Astronauts also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station.

A "Stand-up" EVA (SEVA) is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft, but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support.&lt;ref name="standup"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.seva.html|title=Stand-Up EVA|accessdate=October 21, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2007|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from the astronaut "standing up" in the open hatch, usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.

EVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an [[umbilical cable]]; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the [[Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue]] (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.

The Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, and China have conducted EVAs.

==Development history==
[[NASA]] planners invented the term ''extravehicular activity'' (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the [[Apollo program]] to land men on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect [[moon rock|lunar material samples]] and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the [[Project Gemini|Gemini program]] was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the [[Soviet Union]] was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight, so the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], led by [[Nikita Khrushchev]], ordered the conversion of its single-pilot [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] capsule into a two- or three-person craft named [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]], in order to compete with Gemini and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]].&lt;ref name="Siddiqi 384-6"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first manned Gemini.

The Voskhod's [[avionics]] required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating, therefore an [[airlock]] was required for the spacewalking [[cosmonaut]] to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now [[Russia]]n) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in [[vacuum]]. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Walking to Olympus'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The USA has changed its EVA definition since.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===First spacewalk===
[[File:FirstSpaceWalk.png|thumb|right|[[Alexei Leonov]] performs the first spacewalk during Voskhod 2 (March 1965)]]
The first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov]], who spent 12 minutes outside the [[Voskhod 2]] spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his {{convert|15.35|m|abbr=on}} tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his [[space suit]] ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt;

At the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking "[[decompression sickness|the bends]]". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by {{convert|1.8|C-change|F-change}} from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in [[weightlessness]] and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="portree"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/walking/EVAChron.pdf |title=Walking to Olympus: An EVA Chronology |accessdate=2015-07-30 |last=Portree |first=David S.

===Project Gemini===
[[File:EdWhiteFirstAmericanSpacewalker.1965.ws.jpg|thumb|[[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] performs the first American spacewalk during Gemini IV (June 1965).]]
The first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] from the second manned Gemini flight, [[Gemini 4]], for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} [[umbilical cable|umbilical]], which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]], which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt; However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.&lt;ref name="mcdivittoh"&gt;Oral History Transcript / [http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/mcdivittja.pdf James A. McDivitt] / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan – June 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

No EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by [[David Scott]] on [[Gemini 8]], but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights ([[Eugene Cernan]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.|Richard Gordon]]), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force [[Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] which included a self-contained oxygen system.

On November 13, 1966, [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin]] became the first to successfully work in space without tiring, on the [[Gemini 12]] last flight. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in [[scuba diving]] inspired the use of [[Neutral buoyancy simulation as a training aid|underwater EVA training]] to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.

===First EVA crew transfer===
On January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts [[Aleksei Yeliseyev]] and [[Yevgeny Khrunov]] transferred from [[Soyuz 5]] to [[Soyuz 4]], which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt;

===Apollo lunar EVA===
[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buzz Aldrin]] walks on the Moon during the pioneering [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969]]
American astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 ([[UTC]]), after landing their [[Apollo 11]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained [[Portable Life Support System]]s, lasted 2 hours 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including [[Pete Conrad|Charles "Pete" Conrad]], [[Alan Bean]], [[Alan Shepard]], [[Edgar Mitchell]], [[David Scott]], [[James Irwin]], [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], [[Charles Duke]], [[Eugene Cernan]], and [[Harrison Schmitt|Harrison "Jack" Schmitt]]. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt;

[[File:Astronaut Charles Duke with a hammer on the lunar surface - pone.0006614.s003.ogv|thumb|[[Charles Duke]] with a hammer on the lunar surface.]]
[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module|Command Module]] Pilot [[Al Worden]] made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module|Service Module]]. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by [[Ken Mattingly]] and Charles Duke on [[Apollo 16]], and by [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and Harrison Schmitt on [[Apollo 17]].&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt;

===Post-Apollo EVAs===
The first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by [[Pete Conrad|Charles "Pete" Conrad]], [[Joseph Kerwin]], and [[Paul J. Weitz]] on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the [[Skylab 2]] mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged [[Skylab]] [[space station]] by freeing a stuck [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panel]], deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt; They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2½ times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered [[spacesickness]] early in their flights.&lt;ref name="reusestudy"&gt;''[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790075817_1979075817.pdf Skylab Reuse Study]'', p. 3-53. Martin Marietta and Bendix for NASA, September 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the [[Space Shuttle]] program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]] space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.&lt;ref name="portree"/&gt;

When the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Chinese EVA===
China became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008 during the [[Shenzhou 7]] mission. Chinese astronaut [[Zhai Zhigang]] completed a spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed [[Feitian space suit]], with astronaut [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]] wearing the Russian-derived [[Orlan space suit]] to help him. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.

==Milestones==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}

===Capability milestones===
* The first '''untethered spacewalk''' was made by American [[Bruce McCandless II]] on February 7, 1984, during ''Challenger'' mission [[STS-41-B]], using the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]]. He was subsequently joined by [[Robert L. Stewart]] during the 5 hour 55 minute spacewalk. A self-contained spacewalk was first attempted by [[Eugene Cernan]] in 1966 on [[Gemini 9A]], but Cernan could not reach the maneuvering unit without tiring.
* The first '''metalwork in open space''', consisting of welding, brazing and metal spraying, was conducted by Soviet cosmonauts [[Svetlana Savitskaya]] and [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]] on July 25, 1984. A specially designed multipurpose tool was used to perform these activities during a 3-hour, 30 minute EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station.&lt;ref name="Salyut7Welding1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/salt7ep4.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica Salyut 7 EP-4|publisher=Astronautix.com|author=Mark Wade|accessdate=November 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111213510/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/salt7ep4.htm|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salyut7Welding2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aws.org/about/time_by5.html|title= A pictorial history of welding as seen through the pages of the Welding Journal| publisher=American Welding Society|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salyut7Welding3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruspace.blogspot.com/2009/07/space-welding-anniversary.html|title=Space welding anniversary|date=July 16, 2009|accessdate=November 18, 2011|publisher=RuSpace.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first '''three-person EVA''' was performed on May 13, 1992, as the third EVA of  [[STS-49]], the maiden flight of ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.&lt;ref name="sts49"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-49/mission-sts-49.html|title=STS-49|accessdate=December 7, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=2001|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre J. Thuot|Pierre Thuot]], [[Richard Hieb]], and [[Thomas Akers]] conducted the EVA to hand-capture and repair a non-functional [[Intelsat]] VI-F3 [[satellite]]. {{As of|2013}} it was the only three-person EVA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacesuits/facts/facts-index.html Facts about spacesuits and spacewalks (NASA.gov)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603133402/http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacesuits/facts/facts-index.html |date=2013-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first EVA to perform an '''[[STS-114#In-flight repair|in-flight repair of the Space Shuttle]]''' was by American [[Stephen Robinson|Steve Robinson]] on August 3, 2005, during "Return to Flight" mission [[STS-114]]. Robinson was sent to remove two protruding gap fillers from [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']]'s heat shield, after engineers determined there was a small chance they could affect the shuttle upon re-entry. Robinson successfully removed the loose material while ''Discovery'' was docked to the [[International Space Station]].
* The '''longest EVA''' as of 2007, was 8 hours and 56 minutes, performed by [[Susan Helms]] and [[James S. Voss]] on March 11, 2001.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/evastats.html|title=ISS EVA Statistics|accessdate=November 8, 2007|publisher=[[CBS]] News|year=2007|author=William Harwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
The first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexey Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps (see [[Alexey Leonov#Stamps]]). Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.

The U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating  [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]'s first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the [[Gemini IV]] spacecraft and White's [[space suit]].&lt;ref&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Postage Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designations==
NASA "spacewalkers" during the space shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/evarm.html_prt.htm |title=Extravehicular Activity Radiation Monitoring (EVARM) |date=2001-10-01 |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/evarm.html |title=Extravehicular Activity Radiation Monitoring (EVARM)|date= 2001-10-01 |publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camp-out procedure==
For EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA now routinely employs a [[Quest Joint Airlock#Camp-out procedure|''camp-out'' procedure]] to reduce the risk of decompression sickness.&lt;ref name="tanner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts115/interview_tanner.html|title=Preflight Interview: Joe Tanner|accessdate=February 8, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2006|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp out, astronauts sleep overnight in the [[Quest Joint Airlock|airlock]] prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to {{convert|10.2|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, compared to the normal station pressure of {{convert|14.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tanner"/&gt; Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing "[[Decompression sickness|the bends]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = International Space Station Status Report #06-7 | url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2006/iss06-7.html | publisher = NASA|author=NASA|accessdate=2006-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Vice-Admiral]] '''Sir George Tryon''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|KCB}} (4 January 1832 – 22 June 1893) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[admiral]] who died when his [[flagship]] [[HMS Victoria (1887)|HMS ''Victoria'']] collided with [[HMS Camperdown (1885)|HMS ''Camperdown'']] during manoeuvres off [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].

==Early life==

Tryon was born at [[Bulwick|Bulwick Park]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], the third son of Thomas Tryon and his wife Anne Trollope. He had three brothers: the eldest, Thomas, joined the 7th Royal Fusiliers, fought at Alma and Inkerman and served through the Indian Mutiny. The second, Henry, passed through [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]] before joining the Rifle Brigade, fighting at Alma, Inkerman and Balaclava before being killed in an attack on Russian positions in 1854. George was the third son: the fourth, Richard, also served in the Rifle Brigade. George attended a preparatory school and then [[Eton College]] before becoming a naval cadet in 1848, two years older than usual, aged sixteen. The choice of a naval career was made by George himself, rather than his family. Other students reported him to be a quick learner with a wide breadth of knowledge, whether because of his natural ability or his longer period of education before joining the [[Royal Navy|Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.1113&lt;/ref&gt; George was described as 'a tall lanky lad nearly six feet high, full of spirits and fond of a lark'&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bulwick Park 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Bulwick|Bulwick Park]], Northamptonshire, the Tryon family home]]
Naval training at this time took place on board ship, and having obtained a nomination and passing the modest exams, he was posted to [[HMS Wellesley (1815)|HMS ''Wellesley'']] in spring 1848. ''Wellesley'' (Captain George Goldsmith under Admiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a [[two-decker]] sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was how to handle a sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster at the rate of £5 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. ''Wellesley'' sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, much alike with others on board, never became ill or died.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.13-16&lt;/ref&gt;

As a midshipman, Tryon was not an official member of the crew, but a supernumerary, available as spare crew for posting to other ships. He narrowly avoided a posting to [[HMS Imaum|''Imaum'']], a hulk lying in Port Royal harbour which needed crew, which would have been a very unpromising start to his career. Although officially posted to that ship, he prevailed upon Lieutenant Cochran (son of Lord Dundonald) to arrange that he would remain on loan to ''Wellesley''. Tryon started to make sketches of the places he visited, which while not very good at the start, improved steadily. In November the ship reached Halifax, where George noted, 'the other day another of our men was murdered here'.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.17-20, quote p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Wellesley'' was a sailing ship, it was accompanied by a paddle-wheel steamer: when the wind failed the steamer would tow the sail ship, when the wind blew well the steamer would be towed to save coal.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1849, Tryon had the chance of joining a tour of the United States, but declined in favour of study, and to allow him command of a cutter, which was unusual for a junior cadet. In the summer of 1850, he took the tour, visiting Boston, New York, Washington, where they visited the House of Representatives, were introduced to senior politicians and witnessed a debate over California's requested admission to the Union as a free rather than slave state. He commented on the great welcome given to them once it became known that they were English. He also commented on the absence of beggars in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mediterranean fleet==
''Wellesley'' returned to [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] in June 1851. After leave, Tryon was posted to [[HMS Vengeance (1824)|HMS ''Vengeance'']], captained by [[Lord Edward Russell]]. ''Vengeance'' sailed for the Mediterranean in August 1851.  The ship was second fastest of the battleships and frigates (after ''Phaeton''), lending considerable prestige to her crew at a time when sailing ability and speed were still considered all important. Admiral [[William Robert Mends]] later said of Tryon, 'He served with me, when I was commander of the ''Vengeance'', for two years as a midshipman, and a better young officer never existed; ever full of energy and zeal. As a boat midshipman and signal midshipman he was unrivalled.'&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The ship stopped at Alexandria, and Tryon was given ten days leave to visit Cairo, where the party were received as guests of the [[Pasha]]. The party were obliged to stay on as guests, missing the sailing of their ship. The consul advised Captain Russell who then joined the party, which had now transformed into a diplomatic mission promoting British plans for a railway from Alexandria to Cairo. Tryon wrote home, explaining the British desire to create a land route to India, and the continuous vying for power in the region between Britain and France. On a trip to Gibraltar, Tryon and others from the ship joined the local foxhunt in a group of around forty (some in red), riding across the rugged and precipitous terrain on local ponies. ''Vengeance'' returned to England in 1852, reaching Spithead on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 30-38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Sinope Tryon.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing by Tryon of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]] Bay after the [[Battle of Sinop|battle]]]]
On 10 April 1853 she sailed again for the Mediterranean, arriving at [[Malta]] early June to join the Mediterranean fleet under vice-admiral [[James Whitley Deans Dundas|James Dundas]]. The ship had a new commander, George Le Geyt Bowyear, who reported that Tryon was now signal officer. Considerable competition existed between ''Vengeance'' and the fleet flagship in manoeuvres, where ''Vengeance''  frequently performed best. Part of Tryon's duties included keeping watch on the flagship before exercises, including going out in a boat at night to see what preparations were being made for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet took station in Bashika Bay outside the [[Dardanelles]] between June and October, because of the increasing tension with Russia before the [[Crimean War]]. In October the fleet moved through the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus and moored at Beikos Bay.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November, the Russian fleet destroyed a squadron of Turkish ships at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinop]], just after Turkey declared war. Britain was not yet at war with Russia, but ''Vengeance'' visited Sinop January 1854 and saw the remains of the ships, which had been caught at anchor by the Russians. The British fleet moved into the Black Sea to land troops at Varna and took part in the [[bombardment of Odessa]] on 22 April. [[Cholera]] broke out through the fleet in August and eighteen died on board ''Vengeance''. The effect varied from ship to ship, with few officers affected: 140 out of 950 died on board the flagship {{HMS|Britannia|1820|6}}&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.46&lt;/ref&gt; The ship assisted with the transportation of the army across the Black Sea to the Crimea before attending at the [[Battle of Alma]] on 20 September. Tryon as signal midshipman was stationed at the main top and so had a good view of the battle in which two of his brothers were taking part.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 38-48&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vengeance'' was once again offshore anchored in Kasatch Bay with Tryon as signals officer watching events during the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. After the battle he joined the Naval Brigade in the trenches and was wounded. Captain [[Stephen Lushington (Royal Navy officer)|Stephen Lushington]], commanding the Naval Brigade, described him as 'a very promising officer.' Tryon arranged the construction of a hut for himself and two other officers from ''Vengeance'', which uniquely boasted glass windows scrounged from the navy.

Tryon passed his seamanship examination on 17 March 1854, at which time he was already acting mate. Having started late, he was anxious to obtain promotion as speedily as possible. Promotion above the rank of captain was on the basis of seniority, so it was important to obtain rapid promotion in the lower ranks. He spent only eight months as mate, then six years as Lieutenant and five and a half years as commander, which was one of the fastest rates of promotion at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October Lieutenant Greathead of ''Britannia'' was killed, and in November Tryon was promoted to his position, thereby transferring to ''Britannia''. However, he remained ashore as part of the Naval Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1855 ''Britannia''{{'}}s shore party, together with those from other ships which had been serving together ashore, were all embarked on ''Vengeance'' to return to England. ''Britannia'' had already departed for England with Admiral Dundas, who had now been replaced as Commander in Chief of the Black Sea fleet by Admiral Sir [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]]. Tryon took and passed examinations at the Royal naval college Portsmouth and [[HMS Boyne (1810)|HMS ''Excellent'']] before returning to a ship. Commander Mends from the ''Vengeance'' had now become flag-captain to Admiral Lyons and requested Tryon be appointed to his ship. {{HMS|Royal Albert|1854|6}} was a three-decker, steam-powered and brand new. Tryon returned to the Black Sea in June. Tryon now acted as aide-de-camp to the admiral, travelling ashore to report progress in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|siege of Sebastopol]] and later describing the plundering of the town by the victorious armies. He was present at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|fall of Kinburn]] on 17 October 1855, where he was placed in charge of fire-fighting parties. On account of being on duty, he regretfully was unable to liberate any souvenirs for himself. In his letters home he commented on repeated failures by the British and their allies to follow up successes, instead allowing the Russians time to withdraw and regroup.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 61-65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Tryon 1857 by Easton.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|Tryon in 1857, from a miniature by Easton]]
In December 1855 Lyons went to Marseilles to attend the peace conference for the Crimea, leaving his ship to sail to Malta. While in the Aegean Sea the gland surrounding the propellor shaft failed, allowing water to flood into the ship. The bilge pumps could not cope with the flow, but the ship was kept afloat by connecting the cooling water pumps used to condense steam in the engine to the bilge instead of open sea. After use the water was pumped overboard and provided the engine remained running the ship could be kept clear of water. The ship was near the island of [[Zea (island)|Zea]], so Captain Mends circled the island through the night until with daylight he was able to beach the ship on a sandy bay. The engines then had to be kept working for four days while a dam was built around the ship to keep out the water and allow repairs to be made. Mends chose Tryon to go to Piraeus to summon help rather than a more senior officer because of his 'marked intelligence'.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.67-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of Tryon's time on ''Royal Albert'' was largely uneventful. In November 1857 he had an attack of rheumatic fever, requiring him to spend time in hospital in Malta, before being granted leave in Italy to recover. He visited Naples, Rome, Florence and Pompeii, where the volcano was unusually active. When the ship went to Gibraltar he visited Cadiz and Seville. His considerations turned to his career, which risked faltering because he was older than other officers and lacked a patron. However, his good reports meant that his name was submitted to Queen Victoria for consideration for appointment to the royal yacht [[HMY Victoria and Albert II|HMY ''Victoria and Albert II'']]. This carried with it automatic promotion to commander after two years' service. ''Royal Albert''  returned to England where in July 1858 she acted as part of the escort for Queen Victoria's visit to Cherbourg to meet the Emperor and Empress of France. The queen's yacht entered and departed the harbour between lines of British warships stationed at the approach. Ashore, Tryon came within ten yards of the royal party: the event was celebrated with much firing of guns in salute, fireworks and the lighting up of the ships by lights spread through the rigging and shown at all portholes. Tryon commented that some of the noisiest and most eccentrically dressed attendees were those on the steamer bringing members of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

''Royal Albert'' paid off on 24 August 1858 and on 4 November he joined ''Victoria and Albert''. Each year one of the two lieutenants on board would be promoted and replaced. For nine months of the year the yacht had little to do and her officers lived on board the ''Royal George'' hulk in Portsmouth harbour. At the end of his two years he duly received promotion, leaving with a commendation from Captain [[Joseph Denman]], 'as an officer of great zeal and promise. His ready resource, active intelligence, sound judgement and good temper, especially qualify him for success in his profession; and I consider it my duty to recommend him strongly to their Lordships as an officer likely to perform any service required of him with ability.'&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 76-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commander (1860–1866)==
Tryon was placed on half pay after promotion to commander in October 1860. In June 1861 he was selected to become second in command of [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']], the world's first ocean-going iron-hulled armoured [[battleship]]. ''Warrior'' was still under construction, so temporarily he was appointed to Fisguard. ''Warrior's'' sister ship {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|2}} was a year later in entering service, but in November 1862 the two ships carried out speed trials, where ''Warrior'' was deemed to be the faster. Although the ships' armour was considered impregnable at the time they were constructed, they immediately instigated an arms race between armour and gun designers which continued up to World War II, where each successive ship had to have more of each to remain ahead. This meant that despite her initial claim to invulnerability, she rapidly became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.79–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1863 ''Warrior'' acted as escort for Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], who came to Britain to marry the Prince of Wales (the future [[Edward VII]]). Alexandra was much impressed by the station-keeping of the much larger warship, so much so that her signal to the ship, 'Princess is much pleased,' was inscribed into the ship's wheel. In the autumn the Channel fleet toured ports around the coast of Britain where ''Warrior'' was much admired.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.88-&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1864 Tryon was appointed to command {{HMS|Surprise|1856|6}}, a 680-ton screw- and sail-propelled gunboat in the Mediterranean.  Tryon was given the task of rescuing the British barque ''Energy'', which had run aground on the coast of Sicily seven miles from [[Pozzallo]], and had been abandoned. In two days the ship was refloated and taken back to Malta. Admiral Sir [[Robert Smart]], Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean, recommended Tryon and his crew should receive salvage for the ship, and the sum of £595 was granted to be divided between them. Once again Tryon received a commendation in the Admiral's report. During this time he wrote a report on punishments within the navy, which was forwarded by his commander to the Admiralty. He recommended that fines to sailors absent from duty or incapable should be limited to forfeiting pay for the time they failed to carry out their duties, and this was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1866 ''Surprise'' was visiting the Greek island of [[Santorini]], which is part of the rim of a volcano. The ship witnessed clouds of steam and explosions as a new island 100 yards long and 50 wide had just begun to appear from the seabed a few days earlier. The eruption completely filled a channel through Santorini and then began to encroach on houses on the land. ''Surprise'' visited a number of ports around the Mediterranean, reporting on their facilities for the Admiralty.

An issue arose as to whether the Admiralty should retain control of warehouses at Gibraltar, which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be vitally important to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He was one of the few at that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet.

''Surprise'' returned to England to pay off at Plymouth Sound in April 1866. On arrival, Tryon found waiting his promotion to post-captain on 11 April 1866, which he had achieved by the comparatively early age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.93-98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Captain (1866–1884)==
Tryon now spent eighteen months away from ships. Aside from time on half pay on leave, he attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth to study steam technology. In August 1867 while touring Norway on a fishing expedition, he received a recall and appointment as 'additional captain' to {{HMS|Octavia}}. ''Octavia'' was the flagship of the East India Station commanded by Commodore [[Leopold Heath]]. Tryon was attached to ''Octavia'', but his duties were to act as transport officer at [[Annesley Bay]], which was to be used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Robert Napier's]] [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|expedition]] to [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]] in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to [[Zula|Zoulla]] in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships' steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships, and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a scroll recording the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.99-117&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he continued working as hard as ever throughout the campaign, Tryon's health suffered. He injured his leg while fighting a fire on board one of the ships, and on returning to England, at first could not walk a modest distance without resting. In April 1869 he married Clementina Heathcote, and had time away from the navy for the next two years. Clementina was the daughter of [[Gilbert Heathcote, 1st Baron Aveland|Gilbert Heathcote]] (later Baron Aveland) who was a neighbour of the Tryon's and had been a friend since childhood.  Their honeymoon was spent at [[Bulby]] Hall, home of Clementina's brother, the [[Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster|Earl of Ancaster]]. They then travelled in Europe for three months before renting [[Tickhill Castle]] near [[Doncaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1871, Tryon was appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, [[George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|George Goschen]]. The appointment normally went to an experienced captain with ten years' service, whereas Tryon had yet to serve at sea in that rank. The post carried considerable influence, equivalent in practice to that of other Lords of the Admiralty, in advising upon naval appointments. Goschen said of Tryon, "I had an immensely high opinion not only of his naval knowledge, but of his general savoir faire, rapidity of judgement, decision, extraordinary shrewdness, and great knowledge of men. He was somewhat cynical in his views of human nature but his cynicism was of a good humoured and harmless cast."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.121-122&lt;/ref&gt; A story was related of the Admiralty board travelling to Dover to meet the Shah of Persia in 1872. At the railway station it was found they would have to walk some distance through a large crowd. Tryon commented to a friend that he would get one of the admirals to carry his bag for him, which he duly did by asking the admiral to hold his bag while he opened a way through the crowd. Tryon then avoided reclaiming his luggage until they reached their destination.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

===HMS ''Raleigh''===
[[File:HMS Raleigh (1873) and Serapis(1866).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Raleigh|1874|6}} and {{HMS|Serapis|1866|6}}]]
Tryon left the Admiralty to take up command of {{HMS|Raleigh|1874|6}}, a new ship under construction. He was attached to the depot ship {{HMS|Pembroke}} about a month before, until ''Raleigh'' was commissioned on 13 January 1874. Tryon took the opportunity to suggest improvements to her final fitting out. After a cruise of Ireland she was attached to the 'Flying Squadron' commanded by Rear Admiral Sir [[George Granville Randolph]]. ''Raleigh'' proved to be the fastest of the six ships under steam, but still also the second fastest under sail alone, after ''Immortalite''. The squadron set out on a tour to Gibraltar, then South America where, at the Falkland Islands, officers from the ships hired a schooner to tour around and organised hunting parties across the island. Next they went to South Africa, arriving at the Cape of Good Hope on 6 March 1875. There ''Raleigh'' took on board Sir [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolesley]] and his staff to transport them to Natal. The remainder of the squadron returned to the Mediterranean, where ''Raleigh '' joined them later. At Gibraltar, Randolph was replaced by Rear Admiral [[Rowley Lambert]], and the whole squadron was ordered to go to Bombay, to attend the Prince of Wales who would shortly be making a tour of India.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 128-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon showed concern for the wellbeing of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before ''Raleigh'' had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more took the opportunity to escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a memo to the Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason for absconding, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 133-134, 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelling to the cape, a man fell overboard in high seas. Tryon had to make the difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking, taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and a boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking as best she could to follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery.  All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 139-141&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron arrived in Bombay shortly before the Prince, who was travelling on {{HMS|Serapis|1866|6}} and {{ship|HMY|Osborne|1870|6}}, and a number of grand events took place. On one evening a dinner was arranged for the Prince in the Caves of Elephanta, on an island near Bombay.  The ships were arranged around the approach with illuminations and fireworks brought from England. As the Prince's ship approached, rockets were set off, one or two hundred at a time. One of ''Raleigh''{{'}}s sails caught fire, but preparations had been made in anticipation that something would catch fire in the rigging, and it was soon put out. As ''Raleigh'' was the only ship fast enough to keep up with ''Serapis'' and ''Osborne'', Tryon then accompanied the royal progress to Goa, Bepore, and Colombo, where the party disembarked for a tour of Ceylon.  ''Raleigh'' was required to accommodate all the newspaper correspondents who wished to accompany the Prince. The royal party rejoined at Madras to travel to Calcutta, where ''Raleigh'' had to leave the party, being too big to navigate the [[Hooghly River|Hooghly]].  ''Raleigh'' rejoined once more at Bombay for the return trip to England via the Suez canal, setting out on 13 March 1876. Now she was required to accommodate gifts given to the Prince, including two tigers, a leopard, a number of birds and smaller animals, which occupied the space previously taken by the journalists.  The remainder of the Flying Squadron left for China. The royal party arrived at Portsmouth on 11 May and were met at [[The Needles]] by the Princess of Wales. The whole party proceeded through the [[Solent]] with an elephant standing on each of the paddleboxes on ''Osborne''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.142 -146&lt;/ref&gt;

''Raleigh'' was refitted and sent to join the Mediterranean squadron, where tension was once again rising with Turkey and Russia. In autumn 1876 Tryon was at Bashika Bay, where he had been twenty-two years before. He noted the improved health of the sailors this time, which he ascribed to the fact that fresh water was now produced on board ship rather than having to be brought aboard. The political tension came to nothing, and the tour was highlighted by escort duty to the [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Edinburgh]] aboard the Russian Imperial yacht, hunting trips and visits to places of interest. In June 1877 Tryon was replaced by Captain Jago as commander of ''Raleigh'' after a tour of three and a half years and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.146-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee to revise the Signal Book===
From June 1877 to October 1878, Tryon remained in England. In January 1878 he was appointed to a committee set up to revise the general signal book. President of the committee was Rear Admiral Hope, other members were Captain [[Philip Howard Colomb|Philip Colomb]], Captain [[Lord Walter Kerr|Walter Kerr]], Commanders Bruce and Romilly. Colomb and Tryon represented divergent views on signalling, but all members of the committee were experts in the field while Kerr and Hope held the balance.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.154-156&lt;/ref&gt;

===HMS ''Monarch'' 1878===
On 1 October 1878, Tryon was appointed to {{HMS|Monarch|1868|6}} of the Mediterranean fleet under Admiral [[Geoffrey Hornby]], joining her at Artaki in the Sea of Marmora on 18 November. The British were concerned to protect the Bulair peninsula from Russian advances and had stationed ships at Gallipoli and in the Gulf of Xeros so as to have artillery commanding possible approaches. The main part of the British fleet stayed in the eastern part of the Sea of Marmora during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon was required to sit on the court of enquiry into the explosion of a 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) gun on board {{HMS|Thunderer|1872|6}}. On 2 January 1879 while carrying out target practice in the [[Gulf of İzmit|Gulf of Ismid]], one of the guns burst, killing seven men and injuring thirty-six. This was of considerable concern since similar guns were used by many ships. It was eventually concluded that the muzzle-loading gun had been double loaded, which produced exactly the same result when tested on another gun.

In the summer of 1879 ''Monarch'' cruised the Levant, visiting various places where Tryon would land, both for pleasure but also seeking useful information. Britain had just acquired Cyprus, which it was intended to develop into a base for 10,000 troops and a resort, but of which Tryon was skeptical because of its poor climate and lack of a good harbour. In his travels he discovered deposits of coal at Ayas in the Gulf of Scanderoon, and was responsible for organising the transport of marble statues from Aleppo for the British Museum. In March 1880 Hornby was replaced as commander of the fleet by Admiral Sir [[Beauchamp Seymour]], who in the summer sent ''Monarch'' and ''Thunderer'' to attend the launching of the battleship {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}} by the King of Italy at Naples. Tryon was commended by the king for his handling of the British ships.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 157-164&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1881 Tryon was sent as senior officer with a group of ships to patrol the coast of Tunisia. Although there was no war, France was concerned about events in Tunisia, and the French gunboat ''Leopold'' searched two British schooners looking for gunpowder. This was a breach of international law and might have escalated into a serious incident, but Tryon handled the matter with tact. He suggested to the senior French officer, Captain Rieunnier, that perhaps a mistake had been made. The French apologised and explained that the commander of ''Leopold'' had misunderstood his instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald  p. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;

A more serious incident took place when the region of [[Sfax]] in Tunisia rose in revolt against French intervention. The revolt was started by a local artillery commander, who was called upon to produce his troops in support of the French, but in fact despite receiving pay for the men, had none. To divert attention, he organised a local demonstration against the French. This led to other foreign nationals fleeing the region, although it was only the French who were affected. Local Bedawin then took up the revolt which grew out of control, although order and respect for foreign property in the town was maintained by a local leader, Camoum. The French sent ships and then a fleet to bombard the town, and eventually troops which landed to occupy it on 16 July. After order was restored, the French set up a commission of enquiry to investigate claims for damages and invited the British and Italians each to appoint a representative. Tryon was chosen to represent the British on the commission which first met 29 August. The Commission sat for six weeks, by which time the evidence submitted already indicated strongly that damage to property and looting had been carried out by the French troops, at which point the commission was suddenly dissolved. The British official position was one of neutrality, and in effect allowing the French to do what they wanted. This placed Tryon in a delicate position that while he confirmed the views of locals that the French had caused much of the problems and intended to take control of the region, Britain would do nothing to intervene. He was instructed to send reports directly to the Admiralty and foreign office, rather than to his commander, Admiral Seymour. ''Monarch'' spent much of a six-month period at anchor off Tunisia in temperatures of 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit, without any leave being permitted, which made the task an uncomfortable one for all concerned. Although the warship was not required, the Foreign office specifically requested that Tryon should remain for as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald  p. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Tryon was commended for his handling of the affair by Earl Granville from the foreign office, the Lords of the Admiralty, and by the French Government.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 179-185&lt;/ref&gt;

''Monarch'' was paid off at Malta in January 1882, and the crew returned to England on board ''Tamar''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty (1882)===
Tryon had four months leave before being appointed Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. This post, in charge of a civilian staff, was sometimes given to serving officers and sometimes civilians. Tryon demonstrated great powers of persuasion and an ability to get his way in an argument without offending. His appointment was initially temporary, following the sudden death of the previous appointee, but he proved a great success.  One of his most significant contributions was in advancing proposals for the creation of a naval intelligence committee, whose duties would be to collect together all available intelligence both from naval officers and from the army intelligence department.  Those first appointed to the committee were Mr Hoste from the civilian establishment and Commander [[William Henry Hall|William Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.186-193&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Permanent Secretary included many invitations to social engagements, receptions banquets and dinners. Tryon's guiding rule in choosing which invitations to accept was to seek out people who might have useful information. He stated that he learnt something from everybody.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 195-220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rear Admiral Australian Station (1884)==
In 1884 Tryon was promoted to rear admiral and placed in command of the [[Australia|Australian Station]]. He left England on 4 December 1884 on board the P&amp;O steamer ''Indus'', arriving on board his new flagship {{HMS|Nelson|1876|6}} in Sydney 22 January 1885. The growing importance of the Australian colonies (at that time separate colonies under the crown rather than united under one Australian government) meant that the squadron was becoming more important also, so now an admiral was appointed to replace the previous commander, Commodore [[James Erskine (Royal Navy officer)|James Erskine]]. Tryon's political and social skills were considered important for the role, which involved negotiations with the Australian colonies for financing a fast cruiser squadron in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 196-198&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicting interests also existed within Australia, particularly in the northern colony of [[Queensland]], where plantation owners sought to expand their holdings on the northern coastlands using imported cheap native labour. Local 'white' labourers objected to this as it undercut their wages and prospects, and the government also had some objections, preferring to establish a pattern of smaller farms operated by resident owners, rather than absentee landlords creating vast estates. Part of the squadron's duties included patrolling the waters between Queensland and the islands of New Guinea to prevent kidnapping and human trafficking of native labourers to supply new plantations. The South East corner of New Guinea around Port Moresby had only been annexed as a British protectorate the previous year (1884) by Commodore Erskine on behalf of Queen Victoria. The Germans had similarly claimed an area in the north-east corner of the island, and France was using New Caledonia as a penal colony. The convicts would from time to time escape to Australia where they would cause difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 199-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1885 tension had been growing between Britain and Russia because of the [[Panjdeh Incident|Penjdeh incident]] in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, which could not be prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the Admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence might best be achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even if this had not in reality been entirely achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 206-227&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial proposal was made by Tryon for a squadron of six {{HMS|Archer|1885|2}}-class ships of 1,800 tons armed with 6-in guns capable of 16 knots costing around £105,000 each, accompanied by eight 150-ton torpedo boats priced around £53,000. However, at this time the French commenced a construction programme for 19-knot cruisers, so the plans were revised. Eventually five 2,500-ton cruisers capable of 19 knots designed by Sir [[William Henry White]] were constructed in England and sent to the Australian squadron. A conference of colonial delegates was held in London in 1887 to discuss Australian defence, to which Tryon was not invited despite the large part he had played thus far in negotiations on behalf of the Admiralty and British government. His exclusion from the conference prompted him to request to be relieved from the Australian command after two years rather than the normal term of three.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 228-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon as admiral was provided with a house by the New South Wales government on the north shore of Sydney Harbour, near the navy anchorages. This was undergoing refurbishment at the time he took command but, once installed, his time as admiral was well remembered for the programme of social engagements and hospitality given to Sydney society as part of his duties. He took an interest in furthering development of the supply depot and repair dock in Sydney Harbour, and the construction of a new sailors' home to replace an existing one which had become overtaken by demand. Partly because of the unfinished accommodation, and the war scare, his wife did not accompany him to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 231-234&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Tryon's time was spent in Sydney, but he visited Victoria, Queensland and twice visited New Zealand in the summers (southern hemisphere) of '85-'86 and '86-'87. On the first visit he attempted to reassure ministers that their defence was better served by one combined squadron rather than dispersed ships, even if some were posted there. He also visited the beautiful hot lakes and terraces of the volcanic region, shortly before it was wiped back to blackened ash by an earthquake and eruption.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose p. 235-238&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1887 he handed command of the squadron to Rear Admiral [[Henry Fairfax (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Fairfax]] before travelling to Melbourne and thence by P&amp;O steamer ''Ballarat'' to England. He was commended and thanked by the lords of the Admiralty for his efforts in encouraging adoption of a combined defensive position by the Australian colonies, and contributed in some part to encouraging the states to work increasingly closer together and move towards unification. Shortly after returning home he was awarded the KCB for his services in Australia in the Jubilee honours list.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 239-243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary candidate 1887==
Tryon stood for parliament in a by-election held on 1 July 1887 in the [[Spalding (UK Parliament constituency)|Spalding division]] of Lincolnshire. He was hampered in the campaign by having only reached England on 5 June and the constituency on the 14th, and by an injured leg acquired during the voyage requiring him to walk with a stick. He stood on a platform of maintaining the union of Britain with Ireland, which  mirrored his own views from his Australian experience that the colonies there should unite. It was his intention also to speak on colonial issues in the House once elected. He was aided by unionists from northern Ireland who came to plead their cause, but opposed by a local candidate who had had two years to become known and had his own supporting Parnellites from Ireland to tell their own stories. At the time there was a considerable depression in agriculture, and this was the deciding issue in this rural constituency. Farmers sided with Tryon and the unionist government, while their workers who had suffered pay cuts and lost jobs, causing many to emigrate or move away splitting up families, sided with his Liberal opponent, [[Halley Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.244-249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Times 18 June 1887, issue 32102, pg 12&lt;/ref&gt; Halley Stewart received 5110 votes against Tryon's 4363. At the previous election in 1886 Stewart had lost by 288 votes. It was considered that Tryon's lack of agricultural background had counted against him.&lt;ref&gt;The Times 4 July 1887, issue 32115 pg 6&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 1887 to April 1888 Tryon remained on half pay enjoying time with his family. He suffered a broken arm in a fall from a stable attic while visiting his mother in law, Lady Willoughby de Eresby at [[Grimsthorpe Castle]] in Lincolnshire. Tryon showed considerable regard for his mother in law, who died not long afterwards in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 251-252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admiral Superintendent of Reserves 1888==
In April 1888 Tryon was appointed Admiral Superintendent of Reserves, which included the coastguard service, and became chairman of a committee on coastguard buildings.&lt;ref name=Fitz252/&gt; He was promoted to [[vice-admiral]] on 15 August 1889.&lt;ref name="dnb" &gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Tryon, George |first=John Knox |last=Laughton |authorlink=John Knox Laughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 Tryon chaired a committee on naval reserves, where he expressed his views on the importance of cooperation between merchant shipping and the navy in times of war.&lt;ref name=Fitz252&gt;Fitzgerald p. 252-254&lt;/ref&gt; The committee consisted of Allen Young, [[Charles Rivers Wilson|C. Rivers Wilson]], [[Thomas Henry Ismay|Thomas Ismay]], and two or three naval officers.  The committee noted that although traditionally the merchant navy was looked upon as a pool of trained sailors which could be called upon in wartime, the proportion of non-British sailors in British ships was steadily increasing. Moreover, that modern warships were becoming increasingly different from merchant ships, so it was felt a man could not simply be called from a merchantman and placed into a naval ship. A system of reserves was required where men received training and a retainer fee to be ready for war service when needed. Tryon felt it important that men from the reserve should wear the same uniform as regular sailors, so that no sense of inferiority might attach to them. Tryon had been impressed by the quality of merchant sailors serving in the Naval Brigade in Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.274-281&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon was consulted on the best design for  new battleships following the naval defence act of 1889, which had authorised seventy new ships including ten battleships. Tryon favoured  a high freeboard to allow ships to perform well in rough seas, guns at least twenty-three feet above the waterline, and a minimum length of 380 feet. He opposed the very large 100-ton guns which had become available at that time, preferring smaller guns of around 45 tons. This proved a correct choice, as the 100-ton guns which did enter service proved unsuccessful. Their introduction had been experimental and in part in reaction to other navies trying such guns.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.281-283&lt;/ref&gt;

===1888 naval manoeuvres, 'Achill admiral'===
In 1885 a programme of annual naval manoeuvres had begun, where the British navy would divide into opposing fleets and conduct war exercises as near as possible to real conditions which might be experienced. By 1888 this had become a source of great interest to the public and the navy alike. The navy encouraged attention, allowing reporters on board during manoeuvres, believing that the publicity furthered their campaigns for greater funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hough p.15-16&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the intention was to test the practicality of blockading an enemy fleet in its home ports when the ships concerned were modern iron and steam vessels rather than traditional sailing ships. The idea was that a superior fleet, taking the role of the British, would surprise an inferior enemy force before it could sail from two home ports.

Tryon commanded the 'Achill' fleet based in [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]] in Bantry Bay on the south-west coast of Ireland and [[Lough Swilly]] on the north coast. Tryon chose the nickname 'Achill admiral' for himself, from the name of a small island midway between the two bases. All Irish territory was considered friendly to 'Achill', and hostile to their opponents.  The 'Achill' fleet consisted of 19 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats.  The major warships were as follows:&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;

*'''Ironclads:''' {{HMS|Hercules|1868|2}}, {{HMS|Ajax|1880|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|1885|2}}, {{HMS|Rupert|1872|2}}, {{HMS|Warspite|1884|2}},  {{HMS|Rodney|1884|2}}, {{HMS|Devastation|1871|2}}, {{HMS|Invincible|1869|2}}, and {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|2}}.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;
*'''Unarmoured ships:''' {{HMS|Severn|1885|2}}, {{HMS|Volage|1869|2}}, {{HMS|Iris|1877|2}}, {{HMS|Cossack|1886|2}}, {{HMS|Sandfly|1887|2}}, {{HMS|Amphion|1883|2}}, {{HMS|Calypso|1883|2}}, {{HMS|Serpent|1887|2}}, {{HMS|Curlew|1885|2}}, and {{HMS|Spider|1887|2}}.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;

Opposing was [[John Kennedy Erskine Baird|Vice Admiral John K.E. Baird]], whose force of 26 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats represented the British fleet.  England, Scotland and Wales were considered friendly to the 'British' fleet and hostile to 'Achill'.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;  Baird's major warships consisted of:&lt;!-- The New York Times says that Baird had 26 warships, but only lists 25. --&gt;

*'''Ironclads:''' {{HMS|Northumberland|1866|2}}, {{HMS|Benbow|1885|2}}, {{HMS|Collingwood|1882|2}}, {{HMS|Monarch|1868|2}}, {{HMS|Conqueror|1881|2}}, {{HMS|Hotspur|1870|2}}, {{HMS|Northampton|1876|2}}, {{HMS|Agincourt|1865|2}}, {{HMS|Inflexible|1876|2}}, {{HMS|Neptune|1878|2}}, {{HMS|Iron Duke|1870|2}}, {{HMS|Belleisle|1876|2}} and {{HMS|Shannon|1875|2}}.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;
*'''Unarmoured ships:''' {{HMS|Mersey|1885|2}}, {{HMS|Arethusa|1882|2}}, {{HMS|Rover|1874|2}}, {{HMS|Active|1869|2}}, {{HMS|Racoon|1887|2}}, {{HMS|Rattlesnake|1886|2}}, {{HMS|Thames|1885|2}}, {{HMS|Inconstant|1868|2}}, {{HMS|Mercury|1878|2}}, {{HMS|Mohawk|1886|2}}, {{HMS|Tartar|1886|2}}, and {{HMS|Grasshopper|1887|2}}.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93/&gt;

Hostilities commenced on 24 July. Tryon was of the view at the outset that there was little he could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness. They had to continuously maintain station outside his ports, while he and his men enjoyed the Irish countryside. They suffered the difficulties of communicating while at sea whereas Tryon could simply use the telegraph. [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert Markham]] commanded the blockader's squadron of cruisers, whose job was to stay close to Berehaven, watch for ship movements and attack anyone who emerged, while the ironclads stayed further away.&lt;ref&gt;Hough p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and a battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For the next two days he did nothing, except fire occasional shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries if they came too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing no lights with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, ''Warspite'', ''Iris'', ''Severn'', ''Volage'', ''Cossack'' and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance, staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the ''Hercules'' was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around and headed back to port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that, too late, one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.&lt;ref&gt;Hough p.17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Fitzroy at Lough Swilley with ''Rodney'' and two other ships also broke the blockade on 4 August, joining Tryon's ships which had escaped.

Baird, on discovering the breakout, had no choice but to break off the failed blockade. He sent his deputy Admiral Rowley to guard Liverpool, while himself proceeding to coal at Portland, ready to defend the Thames and London. Fitzroy took his ships north around Scotland, 'destroying' Aberdeen, Grimsby, Newcastle and the ships berthed there, before returning to Lough Swilley. Meanwhile, Tryon, no longer blockaded at Berehaven, took his slower ships to Lough Swilley, where they joined the similar slow ships from Fitzroy's command, before proceeding to attack Liverpool. He claimed ''Belleisle'', which had been guarding the port, as captured, and 'destroyed' the shipping there. Baird regrouped his forces to defend London, leaving Tryon in command of the English Channel and most of the rest of the British coast.&lt;ref name=NYT02Jul93&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E4DB143EEF33A25751C0A9619C94629ED7CF ''New York Times'', 2 July 1893, ''Tryon's brilliant tactics; dazing his opponents in the manoeuvres of 1888'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon was criticised by officers from the enemy fleet that he had not given due warning to merchant vessels before attacking, nor allowed their crews time to escape as required under international law. He had bombarded defenceless cities and 'killed' civilians, and it was claimed he used false flags and captured signalling equipment. He was praised by the Admiralty for his handling of the fleet, but his opponents in turn felt criticised for their failings. The public felt comforted that such an officer was really on the British side.&lt;ref&gt;Hough p. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The conclusion drawn from the exercise was the serious danger posed by even a small force of fast ships, and the need for considerably greater forces than those available in the exercise to successfully impose a blockade. The official report of events was prepared by Admirals Sir William Dowell, [[Richard Vesey Hamilton|Sir Vesey Hamilton]] and [[Frederick Richards|Sir Frederick Richards]]. They stressed the importance to Britain of an effective navy to protect its waters and the much greater importance of this to the country as a whole than the army. If control of the seas around Britain could be maintained, then no army was needed to defend it. Whereas, if control was lost then no army however great would suffice to defend it, because it must starve deprived of shipping. This contributed to the adoption of the principle that the British navy must equal the combined force of the other two greatest world navies.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.260-262&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the manoeuvres, Tryon wrote a fictional history of the 'Achill' campaign, describing the opening events of the war against a foreign naval power which had just been played out in the exercise, then going on with an account of what happened next. This incorporated and publicised many of his own views about how national defence should be conducted, without mentioning any real countries which might take offence.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.283-294&lt;/ref&gt;

===1889 naval manoeuvres===
The manoeuvres of 1889 were similar to the previous year, with an enemy fleet based at Queenstown and Berehaven, but this time Baird commanded the 'enemy' fleet and Tryon the 'British'. Baird's task was to launch raids against Britain, and while Tryon would not attempt to blockade his enemy in port, it was his task to prevent the raiding.  Both admirals had slow flagships, while their second in commands, Tracey for Tryon's fleet and D'Arcy Irvine for Baird, had fast ships. Tryon's headquarters was at Milford Haven but he moved to Falmouth during the exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.263-264&lt;/ref&gt;

Baird attempted to send his fast battleships by different routes to regroup off Dover and then attack the Thames. Tryon succeeded in intercepting him, and was deemed to capture ''Camperdown'', ''Immortalite'' and ''Hero''. Tryon also managed to seal up Baird's slower ships in Queenstown. After the abortive attack on London, D'Arcy-Irvine with ''Anson'' and ''Collingwood'' was sent to raid the north of Scotland where he ransomed Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He was now joined by the slower but powerful ''Inflexible'' and proceeded down the east coast of Britain, bombarding Newcastle and Sunderland.  On the day before the exercise was to end they moved on to Scarborough, but were surprised in hazy weather by Tracey with ''Rodney'', ''Howe'', ''Ajax'' and three cruisers. D'Arcy Irvine was obliged to retreat, but the slow ''Inflexible'' was surrounded and captured. ''Collingwood'' was caught next, but D'Arcy-Irvine managed to escape with ''Anson''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.264-266&lt;/ref&gt;

The four umpires (Admirals Bowden-Smith and  Morant accompanying Baird, Lord Charles Scott and Sir R. Molyneux with Tryon) found that Tryon had succeeded in his objective as well as might be done with the inadequate ships at his disposal, but that had the exercise continued his capture of enemy ships would have given him an advantage. Baird's raid on the Thames had failed, but with six fast cruisers he had managed to capture ninety-five merchant ships around the British coast. The cruisers had been chased by Tryon's ships several times, but were able to run and continue elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.266-267&lt;/ref&gt;

===1890 naval manoeuvres===
Tryon  and Tracey commanded a 'British' fleet a little larger than their enemy commanded by Sir Michael Seymour and Admiral Robinson. Seymour's task was to remain  at sea interfering with British trade but avoiding action, while Tryon was to attempt to chase him down. Seymour was given 24 hours start from Berehaven before Tryon was allowed to sail from English ports, although Tryon was allowed to use cruisers to scout his movements. Obtaining supplies of coal for the ships was the limiting factor, and Seymour overcame this difficulty by arranging colliers to meet his fleet at sea. Thus he picked a spot off the trade routes he wished to attack, and stayed there. Tryon succeeded in defending the Channel, but could not prevent Seymour intercepting merchant ships 300 miles away at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.267-269&lt;/ref&gt; Tryon commented that although this year's exercises were on the face of it the least exciting, they had still been the most useful of the three.

The exercises were not without critics as to whether they accurately represented real war situations. A number of captains were criticised for not taking the rules sufficiently seriously, continuing to fight their ships after they should have considered themselves sunk or captured. Vice-Admiral Batsch of the German navy published a critique of the 88 and 89 exercises, arguing that the objectives of the admirals had become reversed from those of a real war, where coastal raids would follow opportunistically to main fleet engagements, rather than being main aims in themselves. In the '89 exercise the enemy fleet started at a 25% disadvantage, but steady attrition during raiding reduced it to 43% the size of the British fleet, so that any chance of a decisive victory steadily diminished. The result of dividing forces had been that they were picked off one by one. Nevertheless, the exercises served to improve morale for the sailors concerned, and to raise considerable interest amongst the general public in naval affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 269-273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime Marine Insurance===
Tryon became a strong supporter of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 295-301&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon claimed that he had first heard of the idea from Admiral Hopkins. Having become convinced of its importance he wrote an article explaining the idea in the 'United Service Magazine' of May 1890 as well as having pamphlets printed which he distributed to those likely to be interested.  The idea gave rise to an immense amount of discussion nationally. ''The Times'' came out against the idea of government intervention in commerce, arguing the important issue was not who paid for sunk ships, but having a navy capable of preventing them being sunk. It argued that the scheme was a diversion from this main objective and would simply provide a false sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 September 1890&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller papers took the same line, as did a number of naval officers including [[Lord Charles Beresford]]. Their concern was chiefly that a government might see the scheme as an alternative to a larger navy.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 296-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryon responded in a letter to ''The Times'' on 19 September arguing the need for the scheme whatever the size of the navy. The Chairman of P&amp;O, Sir [[Thomas Sutherland (banker)|Thomas Sutherland]], wrote arguing that a scheme ought to be considered and prepared in peace time, but no legislation should be passed or anything else done unless an actual war situation arose. When it did, it might turn out that insurance would be available privately or that shipowners might benefit from higher wartime profits. He questioned whether any amount of compensation would convince owners to send ships if they expected them to be lost. Sir [[Sir Arthur Forwood, 1st Baronet|Arthur Forwood]] (shipowner and later parliamentary secretary to the Admiralty) wrote observing that during the American war of Independence shipowners had responded to the initial insurance rate of 20% by building better ships and choosing their routes carefully, with the results that the best blockade runners could then obtain lower premiums. He added that they bought cotton at 2d, and sold it at 2s, a 1000% profit if they succeeded. Retired admiral [[Alfred John Chatfield|Alfred Chatfield]], then a city businessman, observed that the scheme would disproportionately favour smaller and slower  ships at the greatest risk of enemy capture, perhaps even making them more profitable and thus discouraging the construction of safer but more expensive replacements. Others, such as Thomas Ismay of the White Star line were in favour of the plan, arguing it would prevent many ships simply being laid up in safety for the duration of hostilities, and suggesting that many who were relying on flying under a neutral flag which theoretically guaranteed safety, were liable for a nasty surprise. Tryon himself argued that the scheme might only be needed at the onset of hostility until shippers had become accustomed to the safest ways of maintaining trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 303-312&lt;/ref&gt;

==C-in-C Mediterranean Fleet 1891==
[[File:Grand Harbour Malta circ1890.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Harbour, [[Malta]], home of the [[British Mediterranean Fleet]]]]

In August 1891 Tryon was appointed to command the [[Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean station]], the most powerful force within the Royal Navy at that time. The Mediterranean was recognised as the sea area then of greatest importance to Britain. Tryon left England on 11 September on board HMS ''Nile'' meeting the first division of the fleet under its previous commander, vice admiral Sir [[Anthony Hoskins]], on board the flagship [[HMS Victoria (1887)|HMS ''Victoria'']] at Gibraltar. Tryon assumed command on 21 September. The division toured Port Mahon, Madelena, Naples, Malta, Nauplia and Milo, where they were joined by the second division under rear-admiral Lord Walter Kerr. The fleet then exercised until November, when they again divided: the first division wintering at Malta while the second remained in the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.313-314&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the fleet held a regatta where officers and men from different ships competed against each other, training for months in advance. It was customary for the admiral to provide a cup to be presented to the winner of a sailing race between bona fide service boats of all types. In November 1891 the regatta took place at Suda Bay and the winner of 'the admiral's cup' from 60 boats was Lieutenant [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Evan-Thomas]]. The race was initially instituted by admiral [[Phipps Hornby]] in 1872 with the intention of encouraging skill in sailing, which was becoming a sideline in a steam powered navy.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 326-328&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Tryon's first actions as commander was to write a memorandum to all commanders requesting that they draw to his attention anything which might concern the fleet or British interests  which they might discover but which in the ordinary way they would not pass on.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.320&lt;/ref&gt; After the grounding of {{HMS|Howe|1885|6}} in 1892 he circulated a memorandum to the fleet concerning safe manoeuvring of ships, particularly in difficult circumstances. Of particular relevance to later events, the memorandum warned commanders that their first duty was always to safeguard their ship (at least, during times of peace) and that should they ever be faced with an order which for some reason might be dangerous, then they should attempt to carry out the intention of the order, but only if it could be done without risk to their ship or others.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 323-325&lt;/ref&gt;

As at other stations, the commander of the fleet was provided with a residence and expected to entertain society. The admiral's house in the Strada Mezzodi was one of the smaller auberges, originally palaces for the Knights of St. John. The small size was a disadvantage for the lavish parties which Tryon and his wife were expected to host, but the parties held in the winters of 1891-92 and 92-93 were very popular. The admiral was the second most important person on the island, after the Governor. The admiral's other duties, aside from running the fleet, included corresponding with the director of Naval Intelligence, Captain [[Cyprian Bridge]], passing on and receiving intelligence reports. This required replying personally to information received from his officers: he was described as a fast writer but with difficult handwriting. The correspondence covered everything from problems the Italian were having with their carrier pigeons to details of international law.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.328-333&lt;/ref&gt;

===TA, manoeuvres without signals===
Admiral Tryon was concerned that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out.  The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.350-354&lt;/ref&gt; This was a radical departure from contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance ''[[The Times]]'' [[newspaper]] considered it "unsound in theory and perilous in practice",{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} whilst Rear-Admiral [[William Kennedy (Royal Navy officer)|William Kennedy]] on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Grounding of HMS ''Victoria''===
{{Main|HMS Victoria (1887)}}
HMS ''Victoria'', flagship of the Mediterranean fleet, was in retrospect an unlucky ship. In January 1892 she was at [[Platea]] in Greece carrying out exercises firing torpedoes, when she ran aground on [[Snipe Point]]. Tryon was not on board, as the fleet ships went individually for torpedo practice. This involved firing torpedoes while travelling at speed, but was made more difficult by the need to conduct the practices in shallow waters so the torpedoes could be recovered. Captain Bourke had sent men to mark the point where the waters shallowed to ten fathoms, but they had misjudged the buoy's proper position. ''Victoria'' ran aground at nine knots, leaving the fore end of the ship seven feet higher out of the water than normal, while the stern still had 66 feet of water beneath it. The ship was secured with anchors and unsuccessful attempts were made by the nearby  torpedo-depot ship to tow her free. Tryon arrived from Malta on board the ''Surprise'', having given orders for the dockyard tug ''Sampson'', ''Phaeton'', ''Edinburgh'', ''Dreadnought'', ''Scout'' and ''Humber'' to come to assist. ''Victoria'' was refloated six days after grounding, towed by ''Dreadnought'' and ''Edinburgh'', with the tug lashed to her side and her own engines running astern. 1200 tons had been removed from the ship to lighten her. ''Victoria'' returned to Malta for repairs to torn plates along her bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.333-338&lt;/ref&gt;

''Victoria'' was repaired  in time for the fleet summer cruise in May. The first division sailed from Malta on 31 May for Nauplia, where they were joined by the second division commanded by rear-admiral Markham. The entire fleet then exercised in the Aegean Sea. In June Tryon visited the Sultan of Turkey in Constantinople. Warships were not permitted in the Dardanelles, so the party went on the admiral's steam yacht, ''Surprise''. Captains Bourke from ''Victoria'', Noel from ''Nile'' and Wilson from ''Sans Pareil'' accompanied Tryon, who received the [[Medjidie]] of the first class from the Sultan. They rejoined the fleet at Vourlah Bay on 25 June. In July the fleet divided, with the second division going to the Levant while Tryon and the first division went to Sicily, where the volcano [[Mount Etna]] was erupting. The tour continued around Italian and Spanish ports with a fortnight at [[Gibraltar]], before returning to Malta on 29 September. On 10 October once again they set out to Nauplia to meet the second division.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p.338-340&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual regatta pulling races were held at [[Salonica]], and the sailing races at [[Lemnos]]. An additional prize was presented by the Vali of Salonica to the winners of the all-comers race. Tryon directed that the junior midshipman should accept the prize for the winners, on the grounds that he would most likely live longest to remember the event. The sailing events took place at [[Moudros Bay]], a large expanse of water largely surrounded by low-lying land providing good sailing conditions, and  plenty of opportunity for officers to go ashore and hunt local game. On this occasion the admiral's cup was won by Commander Tate of the ''Colossus''. The two divisions now separated again, the first with Tryon returning to Malta for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald p. 340-342&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking of HMS ''Victoria'' and drowning of Vice-Admiral Tryon===
{{Main|HMS Victoria (1887)}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a bizarre order from him which brought it in collision with the flagship of his second in command, Rear Admiral Sir [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert Markham]]. Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being "It is all my fault". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/aj.cashmore/.features/sailors/georgetryon.html |title=Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon |author=Andrew Cashmore |publisher=ukonline.co.uk |accessdate=8 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222155856/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/aj.cashmore/.features/sailors/georgetryon.html |archivedate=22 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in ''Society Journal Talk'' in July 1893 (following the accident) said, "Much has been said about George Tryon's charm of manner, and the rest of it, but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man. Unfortunately he was a 'viewy' man too, a man of theories..."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honour''' (or '''honor''' in [[American English]]; either spelling in [[Canadian English]])&lt;ref&gt; The ''Gage Canadian Dictionary'' (1997) (p. vii) states: "Canadian usage is almost equally divided between -our and -or spellings in words such as colour/color and honour/honor, so both spellings are accepted by this Canadian dictionary as standard Canadian spelling."&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal [[ethos]], that manifests itself as a [[code of conduct]], and has various elements such as valor, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific [[honour code|code of honour]], and the moral code of the society at large.

[[Samuel Johnson]], in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was "[[nobility]] of soul, [[magnanimity]], and a scorn of [[meanness]]".
This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it.  On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to "reputation" and "fame"; to "privileges of rank or birth", and as "respect" of the kind which "places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence". This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, ''honour'' has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) "chastity" or "virginity", or in case of married men and women, "fidelity". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.

Honour as a code of behaviour defines the duties of an individual within a social group.  Margaret Visser observes that in an honour-based society "a person is what he or she is in the eyes of other people".&lt;ref name=Visser&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A '''code of honour''' differs from a legal code, also socially defined and concerned with justice, in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified.

One can distinguish honour from [[dignity]], which Wordsworth assessed as measured against an individual's conscience&lt;ref&gt;
"...dignity abides with him alone / Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, / Can still suspect, and still revere himself...." [[William Wordsworth]], "Yew Tree" http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww119.html.
&lt;/ref&gt; rather than against the judgement of a community. Compare also the sociological concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|"face"]].

In the early medieval period, a lord's or lady's honour was the group of manors or lands he or she held. "The word was first used indicating an estate which gave its holder dignity and status."&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases,'' Christopher Corédon, 2004, D.S. Brewer, Cambridge, {{ISBN|1-84384-023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a person to say "on my honour" was not just an affirmation of his or her [[integrity]] and rank, but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee.

The concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern [[Western world|West]];  [[conscience]] has replaced it&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Ignatieff|first= Michael|title= The Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience|year= 1997|publisher= Henry Holt and Co.|location= New York, New York|pages= paraphrased from whole book}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in the individual context, and the rule of law (with the rights and duties defined therein) has taken over in a social context.  Popular [[stereotype]]s would have it surviving more definitively in more tradition-bound cultures (e.g. [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Arab]], [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], "[[Old South]]" or [[Dixie]]) in a perception akin to [[Orientalism]]. Feudal or other agrarian societies, which focus upon land use and land ownership, may tend to "honour" more than do contemporary industrial societies. Note that Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (c. 1033 – 1109) in ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' extended the concept of honour from his own feudal society to postulate God's honour.&lt;ref&gt;

An emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the [[military]] (serving officers may conduct a [[court of honour]]) and in organisations with a military ethos, such as [[Scouting]] organisations (which also feature "Courts of Honour"&lt;ref&gt;

Honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates, historically, to [[fidelity]]: preservation of "honour" equates primarily to maintenance of the [[virginity]] of singles and to the exclusive [[monogamy]] of the remainder of the population. Further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures; some cultures regard [[honour killing]]s of (mostly female) members of one's own family as justified if the individuals have "defiled the family's honour" by marrying against the family's wishes, or even by becoming the victims of [[rape]]. Western observers generally see these honour killings as a way of men using the culture of honour to control female sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Honour killings of girls and women | date = 1999-08-31 | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA33/018/1999/en | work = Amnesty International library | accessdate = 2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinners, [[executioner]]s, [[Gravedigger|grave-diggers]], shepherds, [[Barber surgeon|barber-surgeons]], millers, linen-weavers, sow-gelders, [[Manual scavenging|latrine-cleaners]], and bailiffs and their families were among the "dishonourable people" (''unehrliche Leute'') in early modern German society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 Defiled Trades and Social Outcasts - Honor and Ritual Pollution in Early Modern Germany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003064153/http://www.cambridgeindia.org/showbookdetails.asp?ISBN=9780521652391&amp;category_id=63 |date=3 October 2013 }}, Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultures of honour and cultures of law ==

Various sociologists and anthropologists have contrasted cultures of honour with cultures of law. A culture of law has a body of laws which all members of society must obey, with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates a social contract: members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries, on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors.

An alternative to government enforcement of laws is community or individual enforcement of social norms.

One way that honor functions is as a major factor of [[reputation]]. In a system where there is no court that will authorize the use of force to guarantee the execution of contracts, an honorable reputation is very valuable to promote [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] among transaction partners.  To dishonor an agreement could be economically ruinous, because all future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie, steal their money or goods, not repay debts, mistreat the children they marry off, have children with other people, abandon their children, or fail to provide aid when needed.  A dishonorable person might be shunned by the community as a way to punish bad behavior and create an incentive for others to maintain their honor.

If one's honor is questioned, it can thus be important to disprove any false accusations or [[slander]].  In some cultures, the practice of [[dueling]] has arisen as a means to settle such disputes firmly, though by physical dominance in force or skill rather than by objective consideration of evidence and facts.

Honor can also imply [[duty]] to perform certain actions, such as providing for and disciplining one's children, serving in the military during war, contributing to local collective projects like building infrastructure, or exacting [[revenge]] in retaliation for acts one is directly harmed by.

The concept of personal honor can be extended to [[family honor]], which strengthens the incentives to follow social norms in two ways. First, the consequences of dishonorable actions (such as suicide or attempted robbery that results in death) outlive the perpetrator, and negatively affect family members they presumably care about.  Second, when one member of the family misbehaves, other members of the family are in the position to and are incentivized to strongly enforce the community norms.

In strong honor cultures, those who do not conform may be forced or pressured into conformance and transgressors punished physically or psychologically. The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hedersfortryck.se/hedersfortryck/vad-ar-hedersrelaterat-vald-och-fortryck/kollektivistiska-strukturer/|title=Kollektivistiska strukturer {{!}} Hedersförtryck.se|last=|first=|date=|work=County administrative board of Ostrogothia ([[Länsstyrelsen]] [[Östergötland]])|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme form of punishment is [[honor killing]].  Dueling and vengeance at a family level can result in a sustained [[feud]].

Honor-based cultures are also known as [[honor-shame culture]]s and contrasted with [[guilt society|guilt cultures]] on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

Cultures of honor are often conservative, encoding pre-modern traditional family values and duties.  In some cases these values clash with those of post-[[sexual revolution]] and [[egalitarian]] societies.  Add to this the prohibition against [[vigilante]] or individual justice-taking, [[cultures of law]] sometimes consider practices in honor cultures to be unethical or a violation of the legal concept of [[human right]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396607/obo-9780195396607-0160.xml|title=Honor Cultures and Violence - Criminology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/gavleborg/polisens-utredare-utbildades-i-om-hederskulturer|title=Polisens utredare utbildades om hederskulturer|last=Nyheter|first=SVT|work=SVT Nyheter|access-date=2017-11-15|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/middleeast/jordan-lebanon-marriage-rape-law/index.html|title=Activists demand end to marriage rape laws|last=CNN|first=Tamara Qiblawi,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples around the world==

Historians have especially examined the [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor in American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertram.  Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern honor: Ethics and behavior in the Old South'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Greenberg, ''Honor &amp; Slavery: Lies, Duels, Noses, Masks, Dressing as a Woman, Gifts, Strangers, Humanitarianism, Death, Slave Rebellions, the Proslavery Argument, Baseball, Hunting, and Gambling in the Old South'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have looked at specialized subcultures such as South Asian Muslims in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pnina Werbner]], "Honor, shame and the politics of sexual embodiment among South Asian Muslims in Britain and beyond: An analysis of debates in the public sphere." ''International Social Science Review'' 6#1 (2005): 25-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have compared multiple modern nations.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Helkama, et al. "Honor as a value in Finland, Estonia, Italy, Russia, and Switzerland." ''Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations'' 16#3 (2013): 279-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

One paper finds that present-day Canadians born in communities that historically lay outside the reach of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (Mounties) seem to inherit a violent code of honour that drives their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/canadas-history-of-violence.html|title=Canada’s History of Violence|last=Restrepo|first=Pascual|date=2015-10-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the viewpoint of anthropologists, cultures of honour typically appear among [[nomad]]ic peoples and among herdsmen who carry their most valuable [[property]] with them and risk having it stolen, without having recourse to law enforcement or to [[government]]. Due to the lack of strong institutions, cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate [[revenge]] increases the safety of one's person and property against aggressive actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Evolutionary Basis of Honor Cultures|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/24/0956797615602860|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2015-11-25|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 26607976|pages = 0956797615602860|doi = 10.1177/0956797615602860|language = en|first = Andrzej|last = Nowak|first2 = Michele J.|last2 = Gelfand|first3 = Wojciech|last3 = Borkowski|first4 = Dov|last4 = Cohen|first5 = Ivan|last5 = Hernandez|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers ranging from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] to [[Steven Pinker]] have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour.

According to Richard Nisbett, cultures of honour will often arise when three conditions&lt;ref name=coh&gt;
Richard Nisbett. ''Culture of Honor''. 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-1992-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; exist:

# a scarcity of resources
# situations in which the benefit of theft and crime outweighs the risks
# a lack of sufficient law-enforcement (such as in geographically remote regions)

Historically, cultures of honour exist in places where the herding of animals dominates an economy. In this situation the geography is usually extensive, since the soil cannot support extensive sustained farming and thus large populations; the benefit of stealing animals from other herds is high since it is the main form of wealth; and there is no central law-enforcement or rule of law. However cultures of honour can also appear in places like modern inner-city slums. The three conditions exist here as well: lack of resources (poverty); crime and theft have a high rewards compared to the alternatives (few); and law enforcement is generally lax or corrupt.&lt;ref name=coh/&gt;

Once a culture of honour exists in a society, its members find it difficult to make the transition to a culture of law; this requires that people become willing to back down and refuse to immediately retaliate, and from the viewpoint of the culture of honour, the feeling humiliation makes personal restraint extremely difficult as it reflects weakness and appeasement.

==Honour as a cause of war ==
===The War of 1812===
Historian Norman Risjord has emphasised the central importance of honor as a cause of the [[War of 1812]], which the United States launched in against Britain despite its much more powerful naval and military strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Risjord | first1 = Norman K. | year = | title = 1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor | journal = William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History | volume = 1961 | issue = | pages = 196–210 | jstor=1918543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivie | first1 = Robert L. | year = 1982 | title = The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812 | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Speech | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 240–253 | doi=10.1080/00335638209383610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by HMS ''Leopard'' against USS ''Chesapeake'' in June 1807 was a decisive event.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer  Tucker, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22'', 1807  (Naval Institute Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians have documented  the importance of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = William | last2 = Powell | first2 = David O. | year = 1978 | title = Congressman Ezekiel Bacon of Massachusetts and the Coming of the War of 1812 | url = | journal = Historical Journal of Massachusetts | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = William R. | year = 1963 | title = Ohio's Congressmen and the War of 1812 | url = | journal = Ohio History | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 175–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Sapio, ''Pennsylvania and the War of 1812'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaufman, "War Sentiment in Western Pennsylvania: 1812."

:National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake&amp;nbsp;... National honor had [now] been satisfied," says historian Lance Banning, "Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&amp;pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British showed a respect for American honor. "Some of the strongest praise for America and swiftest recognition of what the young republic had achieved for American honor, prestige, and power came from within British naval circles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pietro S.

A 2016 study suggests that honour culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under U.S. presidents who were raised in the American South "are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[international relations]], the concept of "credibility" resembles that of honour, as when the credibility of a state or of an alliance appears to be at stake, and honour-bound politicians call for drastic measures.

Compare the concepts of [[integrity]] and [[Face (social concept)|face]] in [[stereotype]]d East Asian cultures, or of [[mana]] in [[Polynesia]]n society.

The [[ancient Greek]] concepts of honour (''timē'') included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of [[hubris]]. This concept of honour resembles a [[zero-sum game]].

In ancient [[China]] during the [[Warring States]] period, honour in battle was one of the many forms of virtue practised by the nobility. In one oft-cited example, [[Duke Xiang of Song|Duke Xiang]] of the Song state chose not to take the enemy by surprise; instead, he and his forces waited for the enemy to go across the river.  This marked conduct worthy of the accolade descriptor ''ren'' ([[wikt:仁|仁]]), worthy of the name of "gentleman". In response to this textbook example, Mao Zedong is quoted: "We are not Duke Xiang of Song and have no use for his idiotic virtue and morality."

Pre-modern [[Korea]]n thought and society was largely dominated by the preservation of honour and was especially concerned with the ruling [[yangban]] elite in the [[Joseon]] dynasty. In particular, one of the most profound influences from the Joseon Dynasty is the figure of the [[Seonbi]], or "virtuous scholar". The seonbi were ideal, exemplary noblemen of Confucian teachings who exhibited high competency in both academics and martial arts. Despite their obvious qualifications for important government posts, the seonbi eschewed titles and extravagance for the sake of personal development, often living in humble homes. They were expected to be fiercely loyal to the [[King of Joseon]] and lay down their lives in battle or in defense of their King, rather than choose treason. Inspired by the righteous nature of the seonbi, the modern Korean term of the "seonbi spirit" calls for maintaining personal honour and conduct, even in the face of certain death.

According to [[Bushido]], honour was always seen as a duty by [[Samurai]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} When one lost their honour or the situation made them lose it, the only way to save their dignity was by death. [[Seppuku]] (vulgarly called "[[harakiri]]", or "belly-cutting") was the most honourable death in that situation. The only way for a Samurai to die more honourably was to be killed in a battle by a sword.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

As a countable noun, ''honour'' may refer to an award, e.g. given   by the [[State (polity)|state]]. Such honours include military [[medal]]s, but more typically imply a civilian award, such as a British [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], a [[knighthood]] or membership of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].

'''Huntingdon Life Sciences''' ('''HLS''') is a [[contract research organisation]] (CRO) founded in 1951 in Cambridgeshire, England. It has two laboratories in the United Kingdom and one in the United States. With over 1600 staff, it is now the largest non-clinical CRO in Europe.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrow.com/multimedia/archive/00068/DS239_68757a.pdf |title=AGROW'S 30 LEADING CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Huntingdon Life Sciences, [[Harlan (company)|Harlan Laboratories]], GFA, NDA Analytics and LSR associates merged into [[Envigo]].

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and is now in private ownership. Prior to this, the latest Annual Report (2008) showed that the company had revenues of $US242.4m and an Operating Profit of 14.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQbXuxCXzquQ | work=Bloomberg | title=LSR Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HLS is the third-largest non-clinical CRO in the world, it is probably better known to the general public as the target of a high-profile [[animal rights]] campaign. The campaign, in the main, has been orchestrated by the animal rights group [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC).&lt;ref name="SHAC website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net |title=SHAC website |publisher=Shac.net |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
HLS has two facilities in the UK ([[Huntingdon]], Cambridgeshire and Eye, Suffolk), one in the USA ([[East Millstone, New Jersey]]) and an office in Japan (Tokyo).

==History==
Huntingdon Life Sciences was founded in the UK in 1951 as Nutrition Research Co. Ltd., a commercial organisation that initially focused on [[nutrition]], [[veterinary]], and [[biochemical]] research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House in the town of Huntingdon, Cambs, UK; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station (just over a mile away). It then became involved with [[pharmaceuticals]], [[food additives]], and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd. The company benefited in the early 1960s from increased government regulatory testing requirements, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1964 it was acquired by the U.S. medical supply firm of Becton Dickinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/92/Huntingdon-Life-Sciences-Group-plc.html |title=HLS Group |publisher=Reference for Business |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1983, [[Becton Dickinson]] created Huntingdon Research Centre PLC. It then offered four million [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs) for sale at $15 each, representing the company's entire interest in Huntingdon. In 1985, as it began to expand its operations, the company changed its name to Huntingdon International Holdings plc. In that year it established Huntingdon Analytical Services Inc. to conduct business in the United States.

To augment its CRO business, Huntingdon acquired Minnesota's Twin City Testing Laboratory Inc. and affiliated companies in 1985, followed by the acquisition of Nebraska Testing Corporation in 1986; Travis Laboratories and Kansas City Test Laboratory Inc. in 1989; and Southwestern Laboratories, Inc. in 1990. Huntingdon also diversified its operations, primarily in the United States, becoming involved in engineering and environmental services.

In 1987, HLS purchased Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc., and then in 1988 bought Empire Soils Investigations Inc., Chen Associates Inc., and Asteco Inc. In 1988 HLS was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in 1989 obtained a listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1990 Huntingdon acquired the St. Louis branch of Envirodyne Engineers Inc. and Whiteley Holdings Ltd. And in 1991 it acquired Austin Research Engineers, Inc., followed by Travers Morgan Ltd.

By the early 1990s, Huntingdon was organised into three business groups: the Life Sciences Group, the Engineering/Environmental Group, and the Travers Morgan Group, which offered engineering and environmental consulting services outside of the United States. However, only the Life Sciences Group showed long-term promise. Travers Morgan was allowed to lapse into insolvency, control passed into other hands, and Huntingdon wrote off the investment. In 1995 the engineering and environmental businesses were sold to Maxim Engineers Inc. of Dallas, Texas.

To bolster its CRO business and reinforce its U.S. presence, Huntingdon in 1995 acquired the toxicology business of Applied Biosciences International for $32.5 million in cash, plus the Leicester Clinical Research Centre. The deal not only included a U.S. laboratory located near [[Princeton, New Jersey]], it brought with it two British facilities as well. In 1997 Huntingdon International Holdings changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group. The U.K. subsidiary, Huntingdon Research Centre, changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd., while the U.S. business operated as Huntingdon Life Sciences Inc.

In 2002, HLS moved its financial centre to the [[United States]] and incorporated in [[Maryland]] as Life Sciences Research.

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and once again is in private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;BusinessWire: Life Sciences Research, Inc. Announces Consummation of Going Private Transaction [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091124006124/en/Life-Sciences-Research-Announces-Consummation-Private-Transaction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core industries==
HLS provides [[Contract Research Organisation]] services in pre-clinical and non-clinical biological safety evaluation research. As with other major CROs operating in this business area, its major business is serving the pharmaceutical industry. However, more than a third of its business comes from non-pharmaceutical sources, the most important of which is the [[crop protection]] industry which accounts for around 60% of their non-pharmaceutical business.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"/&gt;

==Staff numbers==
The latest available public figures from 2008 show that HLS employs more than 1600 staff across all of its facilities. They break down as:&lt;ref&gt;HLS Annual Report 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of animals==
HLS uses animals in the biomedical research it conducts for its customers. The most recent numbers released state that in the UK around 60,000 animals are used annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html Huntingdon Life Sciences website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227223520/http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is broken down by species:

==Controversy==
Huntingdon is criticised by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] groups for using animals in research, for instances of [[animal abuse]] and for the wide range of substances it tests on animals, particularly non-medical products. It is claimed by SHAC that 500 animals died every day at HLS (182,500 a year),&lt;ref name="SHAC website 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net/news/2011/august/26-27.html |title=&gt;&gt; Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty |publisher=SHAC |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure at odds with HLS' published numbers.

Huntingdon's labs were infiltrated by [[undercover]] animal rights [[activists]] in 1997 in the UK and in 1998 in the US.

In 1997, film secretly recorded inside HLS in the UK by [[BUAV]] and subsequently broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television as "It's a Dog's Life", showed serious breaches of animal-protection laws, including a [[beagle]] puppy being held up by the scruff of the neck and repeatedly punched in the face, and animals being taunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |title=Small World TV |publisher=Small World TV |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308224555/http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory technicians responsible were suspended from HLS the day after the broadcast. All three were later dismissed.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4276376/The-men-who-stood-up-to-animal-rights-militants.html The men who stood up to animal rights' militants], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the men seen hitting and shaking dogs were found guilty under the Animals Act of 1911 of "cruelly terrifying dogs." It was the first time laboratory technicians had been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK. HLS admitted that the technicians' behaviour was deplorable and a new management team was introduced the following year which, according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "introduced greater openness and new training methods."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

In 1998, an undercover investigator for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) used a camera hidden in her glasses to make 50 hours of videotape of the HLS laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. She also made four 90-minute audiotapes, photocopied 8,000 company documents, and copied the company's client list. According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, [[Alan Staple]], said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/science/tough-tactics-in-one-battle-over-animals-in-the-lab.html|title=Tough Tactics In One Battle Over Animals In the Lab|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=24 March 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HLS obtained a "gagging order" in the US that prevents PETA from publicising or talking about any of the information that they discovered. The order also prevented PETA from communicating with the American Department of Agriculture, which had been going to investigate the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2465/is_2_31/ai_71634854/ |title=Seeing Is Believing - cruelty to dogs at Huntingdon Life Sciences, The Ecologist,March, 2001. |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests and intimidation===
The [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC) campaign is based in the UK and US, and has aimed to close the company down since 1999. According to its website, the campaign's methods are restricted to non-violent [[direct action]], as well as [[lobbying]] and demonstrations. It targets not only HLS itself, but any company, institution, or person allegedly doing business with the laboratory, whether as clients, suppliers, or even disposal and cleaning services, and the employees of those companies.

Despite its stated non-violent position, SHAC members have been convicted of crimes of violence against HLS employees. On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging [[arson]] and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child.&lt;ref name=Piercy125&gt;Piercy, Nigel. ''Market-Led Strategic Change: A Guide to Transforming the Process of Going to Market''. Butterworth-Heinemann 2002, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; HLS managing director [[Brian Cass]] was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades,&lt;ref name=Piercy125/&gt; and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1494924.stm Jail for lab boss attacker], BBC News, 16 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Another businessman with links to HLS was attacked and knocked unconscious adjacent to a barn his assailants had set alight.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

Both SHAC and [[Animal Liberation Front]] activists have engaged in [[harassment]] and [[intimidation]], including issuing hoax bomb threats and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=288432003 Counting the cost of fear], Scotland on Sunday, 9 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'' cites as an example the sending of 500 letters to the neighbours of a company manager who did business with HLS; the letter contained an unsupported allegation that the man was a paedophile, with police having to inform all 500 households that the allegations were false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html "The Animals of Hatred"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629082805/http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html |date=29 June 2006 }}, ''Daily Mail'', 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 seven of SHAC's senior members were described by prosecutors as "some of the key figures in the Animal Liberation Front" and found guilty of conspiracy to blackmail HLS.&lt;ref name="TimesYeoman"&gt;Fran Yeoman [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5391798.ece "Extremists face long jail sentences after blackmail conviction"], ''The Times'', 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of campaign===
The campaign against HLS led to its share price crashing, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] closing its bank account, and the British government arranging for the [[Bank of England]] to give them an account.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 2000, HLS was dropped from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because of its [[market capitalization]] had fallen below NYSE limits.&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, Will. [http://www.counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html "Green is the New Red"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408094959/http://counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html |date=8 April 2007 }}, ''Counterpunch'', 4 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
{{Expand section|reason= The government of the day responded to the 1997 investigative work, and additional responses were made before 2006|date=August 2012}}
From 2006, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reports, the British Government took the decision to tackle "the problem of animal rights extremism."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt; On 1 May 2007, a police campaign called ''Operation Achilles'' was enacted against SHAC, a series of raids involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,517875-2,00.html "Britain's other war on terror"], Spiegel online, 19 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 32 people linked to the group were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 "Animal rights extremism – police arrest 32 people"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074535/http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit press release, 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and seven leading members of SHAC, including [[Greg Avery]], were found guilty of blackmail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92cf1796-93d2-11dd-b277-0000779fd18c.html "Activists in live testing trial deny blackmail"], ''[[Financial Times]]'' 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Police estimated in 2007 that, as a consequence of the operation, "up to three quarters of the most violent activists" were jailed. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' writes that the number of attacks on HLS and their business declined drastically but "the movement is by no means dead."&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

'''Internet vigilantism''' is the act of carrying out [[vigilante]] activities through the [[Internet]] (the communication network or [[Internet Service Provider|its service providers]]) or carried out using applications ([[World Wide Web]], [[e-mail]]) that depend on the Internet. The term encompasses vigilantism against alleged scams, crimes, and non-Internet related behavior. It was termed '''netilantism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Lennon Y.C|last2=Poon|first2=Ryan|title=Online Vigilantism: Attitudes and Experiences of University Students in Hong Kong|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|volume=61|issue=16|pages=1912–1932|doi=10.1177/0306624X16639037|pmid=26992831|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''digilantism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/21/dawn-of-the-digilante |title=Dawn Of The Digilante |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].

Some have suggested that the Internet's lack of central control prompted the tendency towards vigilante reactions against certain behaviors in the same way that they have prompted those behaviors to occur in the first place.&lt;ref name="crews cei"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cei.org/pdf/5569.pdf |title=Giving Chase in Cyberspace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers note that the emergence of Internet vigilantism is an offshoot of the inability of governments to effectively police the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention, Volume 1|last=Fisher|first=Bonnie|last2=Lab|first2=Steven|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412960472|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|4}}

== Typology of internet vigilantism ==
Vigilante activities on the Web are often based on denunciations that take a punitive turn. There are many methods and ways to vigilante on the web, but they can be defined into four main dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Vigilantism, Between Denunciation and Punitive Action|last=Loveluck|first=Benjamin|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=127–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flagging ===
Mainly based on indignation, this dimension is punctual, people most of the time do not even realize they have been reported. These actions are often of low intensity, such as taking pictures, and the objective is a call to reinforce security or civility.

People most of the time do not even realize that they have been reported, so the consequences for them a generally weak. The Instagram account "[https://www.instagram.com/passengershaming/ Passenger Shaming]" is an example of that kind of vigilante.

=== Investigation ===
Investigation is the next step, it is about seeking to identify a person or a group of people. It most often rely on collective work and with more important means. Also, this field of vigilantism refers to action whose intentionality is more assertive. The investigation can be useful to help police institutions, but the risk, with a public denonciation is to make a witch hunt and limit the presumption of innocence.

=== Hounding ===
Identification and investigation with a clear objective of punishing the guilty party. It is a lot more organised than investigation. The method is very controversial because the targeting of the individual is very important {{elaboration needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Organized denunciation ===
Unlike the first three forms of online self-righteousness, these are practices that are framed by devices specifically designed for whistle-blowing and, on the other hand, more explicitly rooted in justifications. They also refer themselves to the general interest. [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]] is an example of that kind of organized vigilante.

==Methods==
The following are methods of Internet vigilantism that have been used or proposed for use:

===Scam baiting===
{{Main|Scam baiting}}

Scam baiting is the practice of feigning interest in a [[scam]] in order to manipulate the scammer behind it. The purpose of scam baiting might be to waste the scammers' time, embarrass him or her, cause them to reveal information which can be passed on to legal authorities in the hope that they will be prosecuted, get them to spend money, or simply to amuse the baiter.

Scam baiting emerged in response to [[e-mail]] based frauds such as the common [[Advance fee fraud|Nigerian 419 scam]]. Many websites publish transcripts of correspondences between baiters and scammers, and also publish their "trophies" online, which include videos and images scam baiters have obtained from scammers.

===Public shaming===
{{Main|Online shaming}}

The [[social networking]] tools of the World Wide Web have been used as a tool to easily and widely publicize instances of perceived anti-social behavior.

David Furlow, chairman of the Media, Privacy and Defamation Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], has identified the potential privacy concerns raised by websites facilitating the distribution of information that is not part of the [[public record]] (documents filed with a government agency), and has said that such websites "just [give] a forum to people whose statements may not reflect truth."&lt;ref name="snitching redeye"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Swartz, RedEye |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-31/news/0705310470_1_unique-visitors-web-drivers |title=The wide world of cyber snitching |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some controversial incidents of public shaming, the popular link-sharing and discussion website [[Reddit]] introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public [[personally-identifying information]] via the site (colloquially known on Reddit and elsewhere as "[[doxing]]"). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

Public shaming as a form of Internet vigilantism is also prevalent in China. One of the recent cases involved a woman who cheated on her husband, who posted his wife's romantic alliance online. Online groups began targeting her lover on the street, harassing him relentlessly until he finally quit his university and stayed at home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Wilbur|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2015|isbn=9781483305936|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, online shaming was the subject of a book titled [[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]] by [[Jon Ronson]].

===Distributed denial-of-service===
{{Main|Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack}}
A DDoS attack can be used to take down malicious websites, such as those being used for phishing or [[drive-by download]]s. Thousands of people generate traffic to a website, flooding it such that it goes over quota or simply can't serve that many requests in a timely manner.

==== "Project Chanology" ====
{{Main|Project Chanology}}

Project Chanology was a protest movement against the practices of the [[Church of Scientology]] by members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], a leaderless Internet-based group that defines itself as ubiquitous. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] from the Internet in January 2008.

Project Chanology began its campaign by organizing and delivering a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers. This resulted in a large amount of coverage on social bookmarking websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/25/hackers-declare-war-on-scientology.html|title=Hackers Declare War on Scientology: A shadowy Internet group has succeeded in taking down a Scientology Web site after effectively declaring war on the church and calling for it to be destroyed.|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Operation Payback" ====
{{Main|Operation Payback}}

In September 2010, Girish Kumar, the founder of [[Aiplex Software]], admitted to using distributed denial of service attacks against known and suspected copyright violators including some large-profile P2P sites resulted in the company's servers as well as those of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] and [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] suffering a DDoS attack themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sg.hu/cikkek/77117|title=DDoS attack against the MPAA and RIAA servers (Hungarian)|date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was launched by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], coordinated through IRC; the participants have willingly given control over their [[LOIC]] to the IRC, forming a voluntary [[botnet]] in order to overpower their targets.

As a result, Aiplex went offline for a full 24 hours while the MPAA's website was unreachable for 22 hours. The RIAA, the Gallant Macmillan and ACS Law firm, as well as AFACT and the Ministry of Sound has been targeted as well.

On 16 October 2010, Anonymous launched an attack against the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] website. The attack commenced at 17:00 [[GMT]], causing the site to go down swiftly. It was brought back online on October 22. The rationale for the attack was that the site was "Perpetuating the system that is allowing the exploitative usage of copyright and intellectual property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anonymous Takes Out UK Intellectual Property Office Website|url=http://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-takes-out-uks-intellectual-property-office-website-101017/|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alan Ralsky spamming incident====
{{Main|Alan Ralsky#Spamming}}

In December 2002, convicted spammer [[Alan Ralsky]] was interviewed by the [[Detroit News]]. In the interview, Ralsky defended his position by arguing that spamming was a "perfectly legal business." He also claimed that he would never quit spamming and expressed interest at some of the newest spamming technologies such as "stealth spamming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwend22_20021122.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021124052946/http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwend22_20021122.htm|archivedate=2002-11-24|title=Spam king lives large off others' e-mail troubles  (English)|date=2002-11-22|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, this article was posted on [[Slashdot]], a popular technology news site. In response to Ralsky's remarks, the members of Slashdot posted his personal information and urged people to use this information to subscribe Ralsky to a number of free mailing subscriptions for the purpose of sending [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] to his home. As a result, Ralsky's home received bags of mail daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/10-biggest-cases-of-revenge1.htm|title=10 Big Cases of Revenge (English)|date=2002-11-22|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MegaUpload retaliation====
In response to MegaUpload's seizure by the US Department of Justice and [[FBI]], the hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] announced on Twitter, "We Anonymous are launching our largest attack ever on government and music industry sites. Lulz. The FBI didn't think they would get away with this did they? They should have expected us." Later that week, as many as 10 sites had been taken offline in response to the Megaupload shutdown including the FBI, Universal Music, RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) and Hadopi - the French government agency responsible for "protecting creative works on the Internet" and "the attacks were carried out by spreading links via Twitter and other parts of the Internet which carried out distributed denial-of-service attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16646023|title=Hackers retaliate over Megaupload website shutdown (English)|date=2012-01-20|accessdate=2013-03-27|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-terrorism===
[[United States|American]] judge [[Shannen Rossmiller]], serving in [[Montana]], has a controversial role as a [[vigilante]] online terrorist-hunter, posing as militant anti-American Muslim radicals online, hoping to attract the eye of those with similar mindsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/27/bbc_al_qaeda_internet/ |title=Internet has 'given Al Qaeda wings' claims BBC potboiler |publisher=The Register |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google bombing===
{{main|Google bomb}}
Google bombing is a process where website owners manipulate Internet search ranking algorithms to link searches from one term to another. A group of activists chose to manipulate Google by adding hyperlinks to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]] with the [[anchor text]] "miserable failure", so that a person searching for the term "miserable failure" was more likely to find political figures.

The [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"]] started with a contest held in May 2003 by Dan Savage, a columnist and LGBT rights activist. Savage asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be." Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "[[wikt:santorum|santorum]]" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, spreadingsantorum.com (and santorum.com), to promote the definition, which became a top Internet search result displacing the Senator's official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing. Savage offered in May 2010 to remove the site if Santorum donated $5 million to Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group for [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=MotherJones&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mencimer |first=Stephanie |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage |title=Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem |journal=Mother Jones |issn=0362-8841 |date=September–October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lizard Squad Attacks===
In September 2014 the hacker group '[[Lizard Squad]]' carried out multiple [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS]] attacks against a variety of online games, including Destiny, Call of Duty: Ghosts, FIFA, Madden, and The Sims 4. The game servers were brought offline multiple times, which caused a large commotion in the gaming community and on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hacker Group Lizard Squad Takes Down Destiny, Call of Duty, FIFA And More. (2014, September 24). Retrieved March 25, 2015, from https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/09/29/hacker-group-lizard-squad-takes-down-destiny-call-of-duty-fifa-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-pedophile Internet vigilantism===
[[Perverted Justice]] is a well-known example of an anti-pedophile organization that engages [[Virtual volunteering|online volunteers]] in its activities to expose and convict adults who, using email or web sites, solicit minors in order to commit child sexual abuse. As part of its initiatives, this organization posts the personal information of offenders online, including their pictures, homes, and places of business or work. It carries out its activities offline, after its members reportedly harass offenders who have been previously arrested at their workplaces and even at home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also often collaborates with television crews such as those from [[To Catch a Predator|Dateline]]. Some freely hosted [[blogs]] claim to expose real or potential child sex offenders. The television series ''To Catch a Predator,'' aired 12 episodes featuring this form of [[sting operation]] to lure predators into sexual liaisons. Producers used the Internet, particularly chat rooms, to entrap would-be offenders into fake assignations with minors. Once the pedophile arrives at the scene, he was publicly shamed and harangued by a television personality before getting arrested by a local law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The humiliation also entailed being booked and questioned, which were recorded for network viewing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another initiative, Predator Hunter, headed by Wendell Kreuth, aims to track down and expose the pornography-related activities of alleged 'sexual predators'. In 2002, Kreuth disclosed details of his activities in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200204/11_robertsont_predators-m/ Chasing online predators], April 15, 2002, retrieved May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian group [http://www.mako.org.au/ MAKO] has used the Internet to warn families about sex offenders in their areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Advertiser|title=Public warned about abuser|author=Kim Wheatley|date=2007-02-22|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/public-warned-about-abuser/story-e6freo8c-1111113044891}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to coordinate warnings about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2007/12/17/9743_news.html |title=Dad's anger at sex offender's approach - Local News - Geelong, VIC, Australia |publisher=Geelongadvertiser.com.au |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the subculture [[Anonymous (group)|"Anonymous"]] have also been credited for seeking out pedophiles and collaborating with law enforcement.&lt;ref name="PoliceReport"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; They describe themselves as a collection of individuals united by ideas. They left a mark with the arrest of Canadian pedophile [[Chris Forcand]].  In early November 2011, Anonymous launched Operation Darknet, which targeted websites that distribute and traffic child pornography. Anonymous reportedly leaked the personal details of more than 1,100 [[pedophile]]s to [[Pastebin]], and invited [[FBI]] and [[Interpol]] to investigate the information for leads.

Members of the [[Usenet]] group Alt.Hackers.Malicious have also been known to target and expose child predators, taking credit for dozens of arrests and convictions.  They are most well known for breaking into the [[NAMBLA]] servers on three separate occasions, downloading and disseminating the organization's membership information as well as emails which directly led to several arrests and convictions of child sexual abuse.

In June, Anonymous members claimed to have located and identified two predators in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. After passing on the information and "evidence" including a video purportedly showing one of the alleged pedophiles attempting to lure youths, Edmonton police announced they would not be able to lay charges due to a lack of real evidence. They also stated that Anonymous' interference and public attacks on their integrity in the media were interfering with their investigation of legitimate cases, and not providing them with any help. An e-mailed statement to media from Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams’ Integrated Child Exploitation (ICE) Unit in Edmonton said, "The video postings this week have not only hampered our investigations, but have also distracted our ICE team and investigators from other work," adding "The time we have spent dealing with these videos has been at the expense of other important child sexual exploitation investigations." ICE followed up by saying they are committed to working with any tipster who can help them stop child exploitation, including Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Edmonton+police+call+Anonymous+information+child+luring/8515656/story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615030103/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Edmonton%2Bpolice%2Bcall%2BAnonymous%2Binformation%2Bchild%2Bluring/8515656/story.html |title=Edmonton police call Anonymous information on child luring insufficient to act upon |archivedate=15 June 2013 |author=Brent Wittmeier |date=June 12, 2013 |work=www.edmontonjournal.com |accessdate=19 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity theft activism===
{{Main|Identity theft}}
Organizations similar to vigilante action against pedophiles also target ID theft. Posing as ID thieves, they gather stolen personal information such as "dumps" (the raw encoded information contained on a payment or identification card's magnetic stripe, microchip or transponder), bank account numbers and login information, social security numbers, etc. They then pass this information on to the associated banks, to credit monitoring companies, or to law enforcement.

Other groups specialize in the removal of [[phishing]] websites, fake banks, and fraudulent online storefronts, a practice known as "site-killing". [http://wiki.aa419.org/index.php/Main_Page Artists Against 419] is a web site specializing in the removal of fake bank websites. Such groups often use tactics like DDoS attacks on the offending website, with the aim of drawing attention to the site by its hosting service or rapid consumption of the site's monthly [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] allowance. The Artists Against 419 always argued their tools were not a denial-of-service attack. At any rate they abandoned such tactics in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.aa419.org/index.php/Bandwidth_tools_FAQ |title=New Bandwidth Policy - aa419 |publisher=Wiki.aa419.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Profit===
Some companies engage in Internet vigilantism for profit. One such example is [[MediaDefender]], a company which used methods such as entrapment, P2P poisoning, and DDoS attacks.

===Other political activism===
{{See also|Patriot hacking}}

Around the time of the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]], which was marred by [[2008 Tibetan unrest|unrest in Tibet]], Chinese hackers claim to have hacked the websites of [[CNN]] (accused of selective reporting on the [[2008 Lhasa riots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-cnn.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409202554/http://www.anti-cnn.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-09 |title=Anti-CNN website |publisher=Anti-cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Carrefour]] (a French shopping chain, allegedly supporting Tibetan independence),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-swdOEI5V5g|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328115459/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-swdOEI5V5g|archivedate=March 28, 2011|title=SBS Dateline 08年08月06日 - Chinese Nationalists and Hackers|date=6 Aug 2008|author= benlisquare| publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;!-- video is now private --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  while websites and forums gave tutorials on how to launch a [[DDoS]] attack specifically on the CNN website.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Real crime vigilantes===
Some people form themselves into vigilante groups aiming (overtly) to expose injustice, whitewash and cover-ups in high-profile criminal cases against innocent victims, often children. Recent cases include the death of [[JonBenét Ramsey]] in the US and the disappearance of the British girl [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] in Portugal.

===Anti-software piracy Internet vigilantism===
An example cited on the tech news site securityfocus.com by Kevin Poulsen illustrates how two coders implemented and distributed a program that disguised itself as activation key generators and cracks for illegal software circulating on peer-to-peer file sharing sites. The duo researched software that was popular on these file sharing sites and tagged their code with their names. As soon as the software was executed, it displayed a large message: “Bad Pirate! So, you think you can steal from software companies do you? That's called theft, don't worry your secret is safe with me. Go thou [sic] and sin no more." The software then called back to a central server and logged the file name under which it was executed, amount of time the message was displayed on the downloader’s computer screen and their IP address. The information gathered was then re-posted onto a public website showing the downloader’s IP address and country of origin. The program also had a unique ID embedded into each downloaded copy of it for tracking purposes to keep track of how it traversed the different networks.

==Prevention==
Many sites have taken measures to prevent vigilantism. One form is the reporting and deletion of any sensitive information regarding an individual or group that can lead to their identity being known. Admins, moderators, users, and bots all take action to find and detect doxing.

==Legislative framework==
In 2002 in the [[United States]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Howard Berman]] proposed the ''[[Peer to Peer Piracy Prevention Act]]'', which would have protected copyright holders from liability for taking measures to prevent the distribution, reproduction or display of their copyrighted works on [[peer-to-peer]] computer networks.&lt;ref name="crews cei" /&gt; Berman stated that the legislation would have given copyright holders "both carrots and sticks" and said that "copyright owners should be free to use reasonable, limited self-help measures to thwart P2P piracy if they can do so without causing harm."&lt;ref name="findlaw berman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20021001_berman.html |title=The Truth About The Peer To Peer Piracy Prevention Act |publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com |date=2002-10-01 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] assistant professor James D. Miller acknowledged the threats to the privacy of legitimate Internet users that such actions would pose, but drew comparisons with other successful crime-fighting measures that can invade privacy, such as [[metal detector]]s at [[airport]]s.&lt;ref name="miller hollywood hack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techcentralstation.com/082202B.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210184712/http://www.techcentralstation.com/082202B.html|archivedate=2005-02-10 |title=Let Hollywood Hack |publisher=Techcentralstation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janet Graeme Travell''' (December 17, 1901 – August 1, 1997) was an [[United States|American]] physician and medical researcher.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Virginia|title=A Daughter's Recollection|pmc=152828|publisher=Texas Heart Institute Journal|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early Life and Education==
She was born in 1901 to John Willard and Janet Eliza (Davidson) Travell.  Heavily influenced by her father's profession of [[physician]], Travell made the decision to pursue a career in the medical field. In June 1929, in [[New York City]], Janet married John William Gordon Powell, who was an investment counselor. They had two daughters—Janet and Virginia.  At the age of 95, Travell died of [[heart failure]] at her home in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[Massachusetts]].
[[File:JFKWHP-AR6661-E(1).jpg|thumb|President John F. Kennedy's Physician Dr. Janet G. Travell Briefs the Press]]

She is remembered as President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s personal physician and a researcher of the concept of [[trigger point]]s as a cause of musculoskeletal [[referred pain]].

== Career ==

During her career, Dr. Travell pioneered techniques for the treatment of [[myofascial pain]], including [[dry needling]].  Her career began with her educational pursuits at [[Wellesley College]] and continued in graduate school as she pursued an M.D. from [[Cornell University Medical College]] in [[New York City]].  Upon graduating in 1926, Travell completed two years of residency at [[New York Hospital]] while concurrently serving as an ambulance surgeon for the New York City police force.  After completion of residency, Travell became a research fellow at [[Bellevue Hospital]], where she studied the effects of [[digitalis]] in patients with [[lobar pneumonia]]. Once her fellowship was concluded, Dr. Travell returned to [[Cornell University]] to serve as Instructor in Department of Pharmacology and later as Associate Professor of Clinical Pharmacology. While working for Cornell, she also acted as a cardiology consultant for [[Sea View Hospital]] in [[Staten Island]].

Travell accepted a Josiah Macy, Jr. Fellowship at [[Beth Israel Medical Center|Beth Israel Hospital]] in New York to study arterial disease from 1939 to 1941.  It was during her tenure that she first became interested in skeletal [[muscle pain]], which defined her later career.  Her research produced new anesthetic techniques for the treatment of painful [[lower back pain|back]] [[muscle spasm]]s that proved very successful among patients.  Travell's techniques included the use of a local [[procaine]] injection and [[vapocoolant]] sprays to relieve pain.  The sprays are still popular in [[sports medicine]] treatments today.

It was her success with alleviating skeletal muscle pain that resulted in Travell being the first female personal [[Physician to the President]]. Travell was called upon by the personal orthopedic surgeon of Senator John F. Kennedy to assist with back pain treatments.  Kennedy suffered from terrible pain resulting from invasive back surgeries related to injuries sustained during [[World War II]].  When Kennedy won the [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential election in 1960]], he appointed her as his personal physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lewis |first=David D. |date=January 25, 1961 |title=Kennedy Selects Woman Doctor |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7806010// |newspaper=The Terre Haute Tribune |location=Terre Haute, IN |agency=[[United Press International]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=January 30, 2017 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her treatments included the use of a [[rocking chair]] to help alleviate back pain, in the process popularizing their use among the public, who saw the President pictured in his rocker in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms0704.xml Guide to the Janet G. Travell Papers, 1910-1997], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt;  She continued to serve as Personal Physician to the President following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], with his successor [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. She continued through Johnson's re-election, but decided to leave the White House in 1965.

While serving as the President's personal physician, Travell also took on the role of Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at the [[George Washington University]] in 1961.  Even after leaving the White House, she continued teaching at the University as a faculty for the School of Medicine. She occupied positions as Associate Clinical Professor 1961–1970, Emeritus Clinical Professor of Medicine 1970–1988, and Honorary Clinical Professor of Medicine from 1988 until her death in 1997.  Travell remained active in the medical field until the end: writing articles, giving lectures, and attending conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/ms0704.xml Guide to the Janet G. Travell Papers, 1910-1997], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Her personal interest led her to investigate, explain and expound on the phenomenon of [[myofascial pain syndrome]], secondary to [[trigger point]]s, first written about in the 1920s by Dr Dudley J. Morton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyyoureallyhurt.com/resources/dr-janet-travell/ "Morton's Toe"]&lt;/ref&gt; She drew attention to the role of "[[Morton's Toe]]" and its responsibility for causing physical pain throughout the body.

Travell's research resulted in over 100 scientific articles, as well as the acclaimed co-authored book with David G. Simons: ''Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction. The Trigger Point Manual.''  She also wrote her autobiography, ''Office Hours: Day and Night'', which sheds light on her career and life.

== Quote ==

: "I have lived in a very special world - a world of love and security; beauty and serenity; opportunity, adventure, and variety; challenge and achievement; and the appreciation of my peers. I have had a sufficiency of everything that I desired and a surfeit of nothing." Dr. Travell, author's note to ''Office Hours: Day and Night'', 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/exhibits/travell/ "The President's Physician: The life and legacy of Dr. Janet G.

'''Joan of Acre''' (April 1272 – 23 April 1307) was an English princess, a daughter of King [[Edward I of England]] and Queen [[Eleanor of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2008), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; The name "[[Acre, Israel|Acre]]" derives from her birthplace in the [[Holy Land]] while her parents were on a [[crusade]].

She was married twice; her first husband was [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester]], one of the most powerful nobles in her father's kingdom; her second husband was [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a [[squire]] in her household whom she married in secret.

Joan is most notable for the claim that [[miracles]] have allegedly taken place at her grave, and for the multiple references to her in literature.

==Birth and childhood==
Joan (or Joanna, as she is sometimes called) of Acre was born in the spring of 1272 in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Kingdom of Acre]], [[Outremer]], now in modern [[Israel]], while her parents, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[Eleanor of Castile]], were on [[crusade]].&lt;ref name="Green 1850, p.318"&gt;Green (1850), p.318&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Joan's birth, her grandfather, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was still alive and thus her father was not yet king of England. Her parents departed from Acre shortly after her birth, traveling to Sicily and Spain&lt;ref&gt;Green 1850, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; before leaving Joan with Eleanor's mother, [[Joan, Countess of Ponthieu]], in France.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons (1995), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Joan lived for several years in France where she spent her time being educated by a bishop and "being thoroughly spoiled by an indulgent grandmother."&lt;ref name="Parsons 1995, p.40"&gt;Parsons (1995), p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Joan was free to play among the "vine clad hills and sunny vales"&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p 319&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding her grandmother's home, although she required "judicious surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p.320&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joan was growing up with her grandmother, her father was back in England, already arranging marriages for his daughter. He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very "business like style".&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p.321&lt;/ref&gt; He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Edward then brought her home from France for the first time to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p321.&lt;/ref&gt; As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she "stood in no awe of her parents"&lt;ref name="Parsons 1995, p.40"/&gt; and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.

Unfortunately for King Edward, his daughter's suitor died before he was able to meet or marry Joan. The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while "amusing himself in skating" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

==First marriage==
Edward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, p. 626.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p.327&lt;/ref&gt; The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks.&lt;ref name="Green 1850, p.328"&gt;Green (1850), p.328&lt;/ref&gt; By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old.&lt;ref name="Green 1850, p.328"/&gt; Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p329.&lt;/ref&gt; He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.&lt;ref&gt;Green 1850, p329&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.&lt;ref name="Oxford, p. 626"&gt;Oxford, p. 626&lt;/ref&gt; They were:

#[[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford]]
#[[Eleanor de Clare]]
#[[Margaret de Clare]]
#[[Elizabeth de Clare]]

Joan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare died on 7 December 1295.&lt;ref name="Acre, Countess p. 626"&gt;"Joan or Joanna of Acre, Countess." Oxford, p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret second marriage==
Joan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a squire in Joan's father's household.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p.342&lt;/ref&gt; Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, Joan secretly married Ralph in January 1297.&lt;ref name="Green 1850, p.343"&gt;Green (1850), p.343&lt;/ref&gt; Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]],&lt;ref name="Green 1850, p.343"/&gt; to occur on 16 March 1297. Being already married, unbeknownst to her father, Joan was in a dangerous predicament.

Joan sent her four young children to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850) p.345&lt;/ref&gt; The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet aware that she had already committed to them,&lt;ref name="Acre, Countess p. 626"/&gt; he seized Joan's lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.&lt;ref name="Oxford, p. 626"/&gt; Soon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father that she had married Ralph. The king was enraged and retaliated by immediately imprisoning Monthermer at [[Bristol Castle]].&lt;ref name="Oxford, p. 626"/&gt; The people of the land had differing opinions on Joan's predicament. It has been argued that the noblemen who were most upset were those who wanted her hand in marriage.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.3"&gt;Higginbotham (2009), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the matter, Joan famously said, "It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful, for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing for a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth."&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Coming at the time of a pregnancy which may have been obvious, Joan's statement seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.3"/&gt; Her first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to the king, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, helping to convince Edward that he had no choice but to recognize his daughter's second marriage. Edward I eventually relented, for the sake of his daughter, and released Monthermer from imprisonment in August 1297.&lt;ref name="Oxford, p. 626"/&gt; Monthermer paid homage on 2 August, was granted the titles of [[Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Earl of Hertford]], and rose in the King's favour during Joan's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Oxford, p.627"&gt;Oxford, p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

Monthermer and Joan had four children:

# [[Mary de Monthermer]], born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to marry [[Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife]].
# Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at [[Amesbury]].
# [[Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer]], born 1301.
# Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.

== Relationship with family ==
Joan of Acre was the seventh of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her elder siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1988), p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Those who survived to adulthood were Joan, her younger brother, Edward of [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] (later [[Edward II]]), and four of her sisters: [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], [[Margaret of England (1275–1333)|Margaret]], [[Mary of Woodstock|Mary]], and [[Elizabeth of Rhuddlan|Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="Prestwich 1988, p.52"&gt;Prestwich (1988), p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan, like her siblings, was raised outside her parents' household. She lived with her grandmother in Ponthieu for four years, and was then entrusted to the same caregivers who looked after her siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (2009), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet "he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons."&lt;ref name="Prestwich 1988, p.52"/&gt;

However, Joan of Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts with her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn "seized seven robes that had been made for her".&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.2"&gt;Higginbotham (2009), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1988), p.54&lt;/ref&gt; While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even giving him the title of Earl,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.2"/&gt; there appears to have been a notable difference in the Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon birth of Joan's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Prestwich (1988), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan retained a fairly tight bond with her siblings. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward, which was maintained through letters. After Edward became estranged from his father and lost his royal seal, "Joan offered to lend him her seal".&lt;ref name="Prestwich 1988, p.53"&gt;Prestwich (1988), p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Joan died on 23 April 1307, at the manor of Clare in Suffolk.&lt;ref name="Oxford, p.627"/&gt; The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. While Joan's age in 1307 (about 35) and the chronology of her earlier pregnancies with Ralph de Monthermer suggest that this could well be the case, historians have not confirmed the cause of her death.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.4"&gt;Higginbotham (2009), p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than four months after her death, Joan's father died. Joan's widower, Ralph de Monthermer, lost the title of Earl of Gloucester soon after the deaths of his wife and father-in-law. The earldom of Gloucester was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert, who was its rightful holder. Monthermer continued to hold a nominal earldom in Scotland, which had been conferred on him by Edward I, until his death.

Joan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. She is interred in the Augustinian priory at Clare, which had been founded by her first husband's ancestors and where many of them were also buried. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have "inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact",&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.4"/&gt; which in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church is an indication of sanctity. This claim was only recorded in a fifteenth-century chronicle, however, and its details are uncertain, especially the statement that her corpse was in such a state of preservation that "when her [[Breasts|paps]] [breasts] were pressed with hands, they rose up again." Some sources further claim that miracles took place at Joan's tomb,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2009, p.4"/&gt; but no cause for her [[beatification]] or [[canonization]] has ever been introduced.

==Joan in fiction==
Joan of Acre makes an appearance in Virginia Henley's historical romance ''Infamous''. In the book, Joan, known as Joanna, is described as a promiscuous young princess, vain, shallow and spoiled. In the novel she is only given one daughter, when she historically had eight children. There is no evidence that supports this picture of Joan.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (2009) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Love Knot'' by Vanessa Alexander, Joan of Acre is an important character. The author portrays a completely different view of the princess from the one in Henley's novel. ''The Love Knot'' tells the story of the love affair between Ralph de Monthermer and Joan of Acre through the discovery of a series of letters the two had written to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, (2009) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Between historians and novelists, Joan has appeared in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In ''Lives of the Princesses of England'' by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a "giddy princess" and neglectful mother.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1850), p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think there is little evidence to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham (2009), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5769">'''John Herbert Holdridge''' (August 21, 1924 – July 12, 2001) was an [[United States|American]] foreign service officer and diplomat, who was best known for having taken part in, and later recounted, [[Henry A. Kissinger|Henry A. Kissinger's]] secret 1971 initiative to restore [[United States]] diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]]. He also served as [[United States Ambassador to Singapore|U.S. Ambassador to Singapore]] (1975–1978) and [[United States Ambassador to Indonesia|Indonesia]] (1982–1986).

==Biography==

===Early life===
John Holdridge was born August 21, 1924, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. His parents were Marie Gunther and [[Herbert C. Holdridge]], a [[West Point]] graduate who reached the rank of [[Brigadier General]] in the [[United States Army]].  His parents later divorced, and John gained his only sibling, a much younger stepsister, [[Cheryl Holdridge]], after his father remarried.

Holdridge attended [[Dartmouth College]] in 1941, but transferred to the US Military Academy at West Point upon the US entry into [[World War II]]. After graduation in 1945, he was commissioned an officer in the US Army, and served briefly in [[Korea]]. He resigned his commission in 1948, after passing the State Department's foreign service exam. He then began a two-year intensive study of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] at [[Cornell University]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/033/000127649/ John H Holdbridge] nndb.com. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
John Holdridge's first State Department posting was as US [[Vice Consul]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], from 1950 to 1953. He was promoted to [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] and assigned to first [[Hong Kong]] (1953–56), then [[Singapore]] (1956–58). He returned to Hong Kong in 1962 as Chief of the Political Section, a post he held for four years.  In 1966 he became Director of Research and Analysis, East Asian and Pacific Affairs, for the State Department in Washington, DC.

With the election of [[Richard Nixon]] as [[President of the United States]] in 1968, Holdridge became a Senior Staff Member for the Far East of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], probably upon the recommendation of Henry Kissinger, the incoming [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]].  Though not involved with domestic politics, Holdridge would be largely identified with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administrations and the [[real politik]] policies of Kissinger throughout his later career.

While serving on the [[United States National Security Council|NSC]], Holdridge was selected by Kissinger to help lay the groundwork for diplomatic reproachment between the US and [[People's Republic of China|Red China]].  He accompanied Kissinger on his secret 1971 trip to the Mainland, and helped draft the protocol agreement between [[Zhou En-lai]] and Henry Kissinger that marked the beginning of normalized relations. For his services, he was appointed [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] in [[Beijing, China]] for 1973-75.

Holdridge was then selected by [[Gerald R. Ford]] in 1975 to serve as the fourth [[United States Ambassador to Singapore]]. After the election of [[Jimmy Carter]], Holdridge continued to serve in Singapore until 1978. After that he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency until early 1981 as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia/Pacific, on detail from the State Department. In 1981 he became Assistant Secretary of State of East Asian &amp; Pacific Affairs, then was appointed US Ambassador to Indonesia from 1983-86.

Holdridge is also known for giving the final format for the so-called "[[Six Assurances]]" to Taiwan in 1982, formally adopted by the US House of Representatives in 2016.

===Later life===
John Holdridge had three children with his wife Martha. After retiring from active service, he wrote a memoir on the restoration of US-China diplomatic relations. He also made occasional appearances as a commentator on Asian political affairs for American television. Holdridge died of [[pulmonary fibrosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on July 12, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chi, [http://www.uscpf.org/v2/johnholdridge.html Remember John H. Holdridge] US-China Policy Foundation. Retrieved March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1678">'''Julia''', or possibly '''Ilia''' (c. 129 BC – c. 104 BC), was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] noblewoman who was the first wife of [[Sulla]], later a [[Roman dictator]]. Little is known of her life and sources are confused as to whether her name was ''[[Julia (gens)|Julia]]'' or ''Ilia''. If Julia is correct, she could have been a daughter of [[Lucius Julius Caesar II]], and therefore a sister of future consul [[Lucius Julius Caesar III]] and [[Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo Vopiscus]].&lt;ref name=Keaveney8&gt;Keaveney, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 110 BC, while both were young, Julia married Sulla. A marital connection to the [[Julii Caesares]] may have served Sulla in his political life, as when he was chosen to serve under [[Gaius Marius]] in the [[Jugurthine War]].&lt;ref&gt;Keaveney, p. 8, 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Julia and Sulla had a daughter, [[Cornelia (daughter of Sulla)|Cornelia]], who later was active in Roman society. Julia apparently died young, and Sulla married his second wife, Aelia.&lt;ref name=Keaveney8/&gt; 

In the historical novel, ''[[The First Man in Rome (novel)|The First Man in Rome]]'' by [[Colleen McCullough]] she is a character with the name Julilla who is the younger daughter of [[Gaius Julius Caesar II|Gaius Julius Caesar]].

'''''Enterobacteria phage λ''''' ('''[[lambda]] [[phage]]''', '''coliphage λ''') is a bacterial virus, or [[bacteriophage]], that infects the bacterial species ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'').  It was discovered by [[Esther Lederberg]] in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two ''E. coli'' strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was "nibbled and [[viral plaque|plaqued]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estherlederberg.com/Papers.html#LAMBDAP Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg: Published Works&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Lederberg, "Lysogenicity in ''Eescherichia coli'' strain K-12, ''Microbial Genetics Bulletin'', v.1, pp. 5–8 (January 1950); followed by {{cite journal|last1=Lederberg|first1=EM|last2=Lederberg|first2=J|title=Genetic Studies of Lysogenicity in Escherichia Coli|journal=Genetics|volume=38|issue=1|pages=51–64|year=1953|pmid=17247421|pmc=1209586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wild type of this virus has a [[Temperate (virology)|temperate]] lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the [[genome]] of its host through [[lysogeny]] or enter into a [[lytic]] phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells – instead, they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=Anthony|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Suzuki|first3=David|last4=Lewontin|first4=Richard|last5=Gelbart|first5=William|title=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis|date=2000|publisher=W.

The phage particle consists of a head (also known as a [[capsid]]), a tail, and tail fibers (see image of virus below). The head contains the phage's double-strand linear [[DNA]] genome. During infection, the phage particle recognizes and binds to its host, ''E. coli'', causing DNA in the head of the phage to be ejected through the tail into the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell. Usually, a "[[lytic cycle]]" ensues, where the lambda DNA is replicated and new phage particles are produced within the cell. This is followed by cell [[lysis]], releasing the cell contents, including virions that have been assembled, into the environment. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA may integrate itself into the host cell chromosome in the [[lysogenic]] pathway. In this state, the λ DNA is called a [[prophage]] and stays resident within the host's [[genome]] without apparent harm to the host. The host is  termed a [[lysogen]] when a prophage is present. This prophage may enter the lytic cycle when the lysogen enters a stressed condition.

The virus particle consists of a head and a tail that can have tail fibers. The whole particle consists of 12–14 different proteins with more than 1000 protein molecules total and one DNA molecule located in the phage head. However, it is still not entirely clear whether the L and M proteins are part of the virion.&lt;ref name="Raja_lambda" /&gt;

The '''[[genome]]''' contains 48,490 base pairs of double-stranded, linear DNA, with 12-base single-strand segments at both 5' ends.&lt;ref name="CampbellPhage"&gt;Campbell, A.M. Bacteriophages. In: Neidhardt, FC et al. (1996) ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Salmonella typhimurium'': Cellular and Molecular Biology (ASM Press, Washington, DC)&lt;/ref&gt; These two single-stranded segments are the "sticky ends" of what is called the ''cos'' site. The ''cos'' site circularizes the DNA in the host cytoplasm. In its circular form, the phage genome, therefore, is 48,502 base pairs in length.&lt;ref name="CampbellPhage"/&gt;  The lambda genome can be inserted into the '' E. coli'' chromosome and is then called a '''prophage'''.

=== Infection ===
[[File:MANXYZ permease Step 4.jpg|thumb|450px|right|upright|Lambda phage J protein interaction with the LamB porin]]

Lambda phage is a non-contractile tailed phage, meaning during an infection event it cannot 'force' its DNA through a bacterial cell membrane. It must instead use an existing pathway to invade the host cell, having evolved the tip of its tail to interact with a specific pore to allow entry of its DNA to the hosts.
# Bacteriophage Lambda binds to an ''E. coli'' cell by means of its '''J protein''' in the tail tip. The J protein interacts with the maltose outer membrane [[porin (protein)|porin]] (the product of the ''lamB'' gene) of ''E. coli'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werts|first=C|author2=Michel, V |author3=Hofnung, M |author4=Charbit, A |title=Adsorption of bacteriophage lambda on the LamB protein of Escherichia coli K-12: point mutations in gene J of lambda responsible for extended host range.|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=February 1994|volume=176|issue=4|pages=941–7|pmid=8106335|pmc=205142 |doi=10.1128/jb.176.4.941-947.1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; a porin molecule, which is part of the [[maltose]] operon.
# The linear phage genome is injected through the outer membrane.

# The DNA passes through the mannose permease complex in the inner membrane &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The mannose permease of Escherichia coli consists of three different proteins.

The single-strand viral DNA ends are ligated by host [[DNA ligase]].

[[File:MANXYZ permease Step 10.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Lambda phage DNA injection into the cell membrane using Mannose PTS permease a sugar transporting system as a mechanism of entry into the cytoplasm.]]

# Host [[DNA gyrase]] puts negative [[supercoil]]s in the circular chromosome, causing A-T-rich regions to unwind and drive transcription.
# Transcription starts from the constitutive '''''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''''', '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;''''' [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] producing the 'immediate early' transcripts. At first, these express the '''''N''''' and '''''cro''''' genes, producing N, Cro and a short inactive protein.

[[File:N protien.svg|thumb|200px|Early activation events involving N protein]]

# '''Cro''' binds to ''OR3'', preventing access to the ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter, preventing expression of the ''cI'' gene. N binds to the two ''Nut'' (N utilisation) sites, one in the ''N'' gene in the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reading frame, and one in the ''cro'' gene in the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' reading frame.
# The N protein is an [[antiterminator]], and functions to extend the reading frames to which it is bound. When [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes these regions, it recruits the N and forms a complex with several host '''Nus''' proteins. This complex skips through most termination sequences. The extended transcripts (the 'late early' transcripts) include the '''''N''''' and '''''cro''''' genes along with '''''cII''''' and '''''cIII''''' genes, and '''''xis''''', '''''int''''', '''''O''''', '''''P''''' and '''''Q''''' genes discussed later.
# The '''cIII''' protein acts to protect the '''cII''' protein from proteolysis by '''FtsH''' (a membrane-bound essential E. coli protease) by acting as a competitive inhibitor. This inhibition can induce a [[bacteriostatic]] state, which favours lysogeny. cIII also directly stabilises the cII protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kobiler, O.|title=Phage Lambda CIII: A Protease Inhibitor Regulating the Lysis-Lysogeny Decision|year=2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000363|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=4|page=e363|pmid=17426811|pmc=1838920|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..363K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On initial infection, the stability of [[CII protein|cII]] determines the lifestyle of the phage; stable cII will lead to the lysogenic pathway, whereas if [[CII protein|cII]] is degraded the phage will go into the lytic pathway. Low temperature, starvation of the cells and high [[multiplicity of infection]] (MOI) are known to favor lysogeny (see later discussion).

}}
This occurs without the '''N protein''' interacting with the DNA; the protein instead binds to the freshly transcribed mRNA. Nut sites contain 3 conserved "boxes," of which only '''BoxB''' is essential.
# The boxB RNA sequences are located close to the 5' end of the pL and pR transcripts. When transcribed, each sequence forms a hairpin loop structure that the N protein can bind to.
# N protein binds to boxB in each transcript, and contacts the transcribing RNA polymerase via RNA looping. The N-RNAP complex is stabilized by subsequent binding of several host '''Nus''' (N utilisation substance) proteins (which include transcription termination/antitermination factors and, bizarrely, a ribosome subunit).
# The entire complex (including the bound ''Nut'' site on the mRNA) continues transcription, and can skip through termination sequences.

===Lytic life cycle===
{{Main|Lytic cycle}}
This is the lifecycle that the phage follows following most infections, where the cII protein does not reach a high enough concentration due to degradation, so does not activate its promoters.
# The 'late early' transcripts continue being written, including '''''xis''''', '''''int''''', '''''Q''''' and genes for replication of the lambda genome (''OP''). Cro dominates the repressor site (see [[Lambda phage#Repressor|"Repressor" section]]), repressing synthesis from the ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter  (which is a promoter of the lysogenic cycle).
# The '''O''' and '''P proteins''' initiate replication of the phage chromosome (see "Lytic Replication").
# '''Q''', another [[antiterminator]], binds to '''''Qut''''' sites.
# Transcription from the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter can now extend to produce mRNA for the lysis and the head and tail proteins.
# Structural proteins and phage genomes self-assemble into new phage particles.
# Products of the lysis genes '''''S''''','''''R''''', '''''Rz''''' and '''''Rz1''''' cause cell lysis. S is a [[holin]], a small membrane protein that, at a time determined by the sequence of the protein, suddenly makes holes in the membrane. R is an [[endolysin]], an enzyme that escapes through the S holes and cleaves the cell wall. Rz and Rz1 are membrane proteins that form a complex that somehow destroys the outer membrane, after the endolysin has degraded the cell wall. For wild-type lambda, lysis occurs at about 50 minutes after the start of infection and releases around 100 virions.

====Rightward transcription====
Rightward transcription expresses the '''''O''''', '''''P''''' and '''''Q''''' genes. O and P are responsible for initiating replication, and Q is another antiterminator that allows the expression of head, tail, and lysis genes from ''P&lt;sub&gt;R’&lt;/sub&gt;''.

=====Lytic replication=====
# For the first few replication cycles, the lambda genome undergoes [[Theta structure|θ replication]] (circle-to-circle).
# This is initiated at the '''''ori''''' site located in the '''''O''''' gene. O protein binds the ''ori'' site, and P protein binds the DnaB subunit of the host replication machinery as well as binding O. This effectively commandeers the host DNA polymerase.
# Soon, the phage switches to a [[rolling circle replication]] similar to that used by phage M13. The DNA is nicked and the 3’ end serves as a primer. Note that this does not release single copies of the phage genome but rather one long molecule with many copies of the genome: a [[concatemer]].
# These concatemers are cleaved at their ''cos'' sites as they are packaged. Packaging cannot occur from circular phage DNA, only from concatomeric DNA.

=====Q antitermination=====
{{multiple image
| width     = 400
|direction = vertical  
|align = center
|footer =  The Q protein modifies the RNA polymerase at the promoter region and is  recruited to RNA polymerase. The Q protein turns into a RNA polymerase subunit after it is recruitment to RNAP and modifies the enzyme into a processive state.

'''Q''' is similar to '''N''' in its effect: Q binds to [[RNA polymerase]] in ''Qut'' sites and the resulting complex can ignore terminators, however the mechanism is very different; the Q protein first associates with a DNA sequence rather than an mRNA sequence.&lt;ref name="Deighan, P. and Hochschild, A."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Padraig Deighan |author2=Ann Hochschild |title=The bacteriophage λQ anti-terminator protein regulates late gene expression as a stable component of the transcription elongation complex |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume= 63|issue= 3|pages=911–20 |year=2007 |pmid=17302807 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05563.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Qut'' site is very close to the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R’&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter, close enough that the σ factor has not been released from the RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Part of the ''Qut'' site resembles the -10 [[Pribnow box]], causing the holoenzyme to pause.
# Q protein then binds and displaces part of the σ factor and transcription re-initiates.
# The head and tail genes are transcribed and the corresponding proteins self-assemble.

====Leftward transcription====
Leftward transcription expresses the ''gam'', ''red'', ''xis'', and ''int'' genes. Gam and red proteins are involved in recombination. Gam is also important in that it inhibits the host RecBCD nuclease from degrading the 3’ ends in rolling circle replication. Int and xis are integration and excision proteins vital to lysogeny.

=====xis and int regulation of insertion and excision=====
[[File:Phage Lambda int xis Retroregulation.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Diagram showing the retro-regulation process that yields a higher concentration of xis compared to int. The mRNA transcript is digested by bacterial RNase starting from the cleaved hairpin loop at sib.]]
# '''''xis''''' and '''''int''''' are found on the same piece of mRNA, so approximately equal concentrations of ''xis'' and ''int'' proteins are produced. This results (initially) in the excision of any inserted genomes from the host genome.
# The mRNA from the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter forms a stable secondary structure with a [[stem-loop]] in the '''''sib''''' section of the mRNA. This targets the 3' (''sib'') end of the mRNA for RNAaseIII degradation, which results in a lower effective concentration of ''int'' mRNA than ''xis'' mRNA (as the ''int'' cistron is nearer to the ''sib'' sequence than the ''xis'' cistron is to the ''sib'' sequence), so a higher concentrations of ''xis'' than ''int'' is observed.
# Higher concentrations of ''xis'' than ''int'' result in no insertion or excision of phage genomes, the evolutionarily favoured action - leaving any pre-insterted phage genomes inserted (so reducing competition) and preventing the insertion of the phage genome into the genome of a doomed host.

===Lysogenic (or lysenogenic) life cycle===
{{Main|Lysogenic cycle}}
The lysogenic lifecycle begins once the '''cI''' protein reaches a high enough concentration to activate its promoters, after a small number of infections.
# The 'late early' transcripts continue being written, including '''''xis''''', '''''int''''', '''''Q''''' and genes for replication of the lambda genome.
# The stabilized cII acts to promote transcription from the '''''P&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt;''''', '''''P&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;antiq&lt;/sub&gt;''''' promoters.
# The ''P&lt;sub&gt;antiq&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter produces antisense mRNA to the ''Q'' gene message of the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter transcript, thereby switching off Q production. The ''P&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter produces antisense mRNA to the cro section of the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter transcript, turning down cro production, and has a transcript of the '''''cI''''' gene. This is expressed, turning on cI repressor production. The '''''P&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;''''' promoter expresses the ''int'' gene, resulting in high concentrations of Int protein. This int protein integrates the phage DNA into the host chromosome (see "Prophage Integration").
# No '''Q''' results in no extension of the '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;''''' promoter's reading frame, so no lytic or structural proteins are made. Elevated levels of int (much higher than that of xis) result in the insertion of the lambda genome into the hosts genome (see diagram). Production of cI leads to the binding of cI to the '''''OR1''''' and '''''OR2''''' sites in the ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter, turning off  ''cro'' and other early gene expression. cI also binds to the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter, turning off transcription there too.
# Lack of cro leaves the '''''OR3''''' site unbound, so transcription from the ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter may occur, maintaining levels of cI.
# Lack of transcription from the '''''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''''' promoters leads to no further production of cII and cIII.
# As cII and cIII concentrations decrease, transcription from the ''P&lt;sub&gt;antiq&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' stop being promoted since they are no longer needed.
# Only the '''''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;''''' promoters are left active, the former producing cI protein and the latter a short inactive transcript. The genome remains inserted into the host genome in a dormant state.

The prophage is duplicated with every subsequent cell division of the host. The phage genes expressed in this dormant state code for proteins that repress expression of other phage genes (such as the structural and lysis genes) in order to prevent entry into the lytic cycle. These repressive proteins are broken down when the host cell is under stress, resulting in the expression of the repressed phage genes. Stress can be from [[starvation]], [[poison]]s (like [[antibiotics]]), or other factors that can damage or destroy the host. In response to stress, the activated prophage is excised from the DNA of the host cell by one of the newly expressed gene products and enters its lytic pathway.

====Prophage integration====
The '''integration''' of phage λ takes place at a special '''att'''achment site in the bacterial and phage genomes, called ''att&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;''. The sequence of the bacterial '''att''' site is called ''attB'', between the ''gal'' and ''bio'' operons, and consists of the parts B-O-B', whereas the complementary sequence in the circular phage genome is called ''attP'' and consists of the parts P-O-P'. The integration itself is a sequential exchange (see [[genetic recombination]]) via a [[Holliday junction]] and requires both the phage protein Int and the bacterial protein IHF (''integration host factor''). Both Int and IHF bind to ''attP'' and form an intasome, a DNA-protein-complex designed for [[site-specific recombination]] of the phage and host DNA. The original B-O-B' sequence is changed by the integration to B-O-P'-phage DNA-P-O-B'. The phage DNA is now part of the host's genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Groth AC, Calos MP | title=Phage integrases: biology and applications | journal= [[Journal of Molecular Biology]] | volume=335 | issue=3 | year=2004 | pages=667–678  | id= | pmid=14687564 | doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2003.09.082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maintenance of lysogeny====
[[File:Phage Lambda Integration Excision.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|A simplified representation of the integration/excision paradigm and the major genes involved.]]
* Lysogeny is maintained solely by '''cI'''. cI represses transcription from '''''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''''' while upregulating and controlling its own expression from ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;''. It is therefore the only protein expressed by lysogenic phage.
[[File:Polymerase cl protien.svg|thumb|Lysogen repressors and polymerase bound to OR1 and recruits OR2, which will activate PRM and shutdown PR.]]
* This is coordinated by the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' operators. Both operators have three binding sites for cI: ''OL1'', ''OL2'', and ''OL3'' for ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''OR1'', ''OR2'' and ''OR3'' for ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.
* cI binds most favorably to ''OR1''; binding here inhibits transcription from ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''. As cI easily dimerises, the binding of cI to ''OR1'' greatly increases the affinity of the binding of cI to ''OR2'', and this happens almost immediately after ''OR1'' binding. This activates transcription in the other direction from ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'', as the N terminal domain of cI on ''OR2'' tightens the binding of RNA polymerase to ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'' and hence cI stimulates its own transcription. When it is present at a much higher concentration, it also binds to ''OR3'', inhibiting transcription from ''P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt;'', thus regulating its own levels in a negative feedback loop.
* cI binding to the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' operator is very similar, except that it has no direct effect on cI transcription. As an additional repression of its own expression, however, cI dimers bound to ''OR3'' and ''OL3'' bend the DNA between them to tetramerise.
* The presence of cI causes immunity to superinfection by other lambda phages, as it will inhibit their ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoters.

====Induction====
[[File:Phage Lambda SwitchStates.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|Transcriptional state of the P&lt;sub&gt;RM&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; promoter regions during a lysogenic state vs induced, early lytic state.]]
The classic induction of a lysogen involved irradiating the infected cells with UV light. Any situation where a lysogen undergoes DNA damage or the [[SOS response]] of the host is otherwise stimulated leads to induction.
# The host cell, containing a dormant phage genome, experiences DNA damage due to a high stress environment, and starts to undergo the [[SOS response]].
# RecA (a cellular protein) detects DNA damage and becomes activated. It is now RecA*, a highly specific co-protease.
# Normally RecA* binds LexA (a [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] repressor), activating LexA auto-protease activity, which destroys LexA repressor, allowing production of [[DNA repair]] proteins. In lysogenic cells, this response is hijacked, and RecA* stimulates  cI autocleavage. This is because cI mimics the structure of LexA at the autocleavage site.
# Cleaved cI can no longer dimerise, and loses its affinity for DNA binding.
# The ''P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoters are no longer repressed and switch on, and the cell returns to the lytic sequence of expression events (note that cII is not stable in cells undergoing the SOS response). There is however one notable difference.
[[File:Lambda phage LexA inihibition.svg|thumb|right|200px|The function of LexA in the SOS response.  LexA expression leads to inhibition of various genes including LexA.]]

=====Control of phage genome excision in induction=====
# The phage genome is still inserted in the host genome and needs excision for DNA replication to occur. The ''sib'' section beyond the normal ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter transcript is, however, no longer included in this reading frame (see diagram).
# No ''sib'' domain on the ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' promoter mRNA results in no hairpin loop on the 3' end, and the transcript is no longer targeted for RNAaseIII degradation.
# The new intact transcript has one  copy of both '''''xis''''' and '''''int''''', so approximately equal concentrations of xis and int proteins are produced.
# Equal concentrations of xis and int result in the excision of the inserted genome from the host genome for replication and later phage production.

==Multiplicity reactivation and prophage reactivation==
Multiplicity reactivation (MR) is the process by which multiple viral genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact within an infected cell to form a viable viral genome. MR was originally discovered with phage T4, but was subsequently found in phage λ (as well as in numerous other bacterial and mammalian viruses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michod | first1 = RE | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = H | last3 = Nedelcu | first3 = AM | year = 2008 | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | url = | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 267–285 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | pmid=18295550}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  MR of phage λ inactivated by UV light depends on the recombination function of either the host or of the infecting phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huskey RJ |title=Multiplicity reactivation as a test for recombination function |journal=Science |volume=164 |issue=3877 |pages=319–20 |date=April 1969 |pmid=4887562 |doi=  10.1126/science.164.3877.319|url=|bibcode = 1969Sci...164..319H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absence of both recombination systems leads to a loss of MR.

Survival of UV-irradiated phage λ is increased when the E. coli host is lysogenic for an homologous prophage, a phenomenon termed prophage reactivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanco M, Devoret R |title=Repair mechanisms involved in prophage reactivation and UV reactivation of UV-irradiated phage lambda |journal=Mutat. Res. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=293–305 |date=March 1973 |pmid=4688367 |doi= 10.1016/0027-5107(73)90001-8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prophage reactivation in phage λ appears to occur by a recombinational repair process similar to that of MR.

==Repressor==
[[File:Lambda phage temperate controls.png|thumbnail|right|Protein interactions that lead to either Lytic or Lysogenic cycles for Lambda phage]]
The [[repressor]] found in the phage lambda is a notable example of the level of control possible over gene expression by a very simple system. It forms a 'binary switch' with two genes under mutually exclusive expression, as discovered by [[Barbara J. Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/gender/meyer.html "Barbara J. Meyer"], ''[[HHMI]] Interactive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LambdaPhage Repressor Cooperativity.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.75|Visual representation of repressor tetramer/octamer binding to phage lambda L and R operator sites (stable lysogenic state)]]

The lambda repressor gene system consists of (from left to right on the chromosome):
* ''cI'' gene
* O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3
* O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2
* O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1
* ''cro'' gene

The lambda repressor is a self assembling dimer also known as the [[cI protein]].&lt;ref name="pmid8031775"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It binds DNA in the helix-turn-helix binding motif. It regulates the transcription of the cI protein and the Cro protein.

The life cycle of lambda phages is controlled by cI and Cro proteins. The lambda phage will remain in the lysogenic state if cI proteins predominate, but will be transformed into the lytic cycle if cro proteins predominate.

The cI dimer may bind to any of three operators, O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1, O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2, and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3, in the order O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1 = O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2 &gt; O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3.
Binding of a cI dimer to O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1 enhances binding of a second cI dimer to O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2, an effect called [[cooperativity]]. Thus,  O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1 and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2 are almost always simultaneously occupied by cI. However, this does not increase the affinity between cI and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3, which will be occupied only when the cI concentration is high.

At high concentrations of cI, the dimers will also bind to operators O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;1 and O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;2 (which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators). When cI dimers are bound to O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;1, O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;2, O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1, and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2 a loop is induced in the DNA, allowing these dimers to bind together to form an octamer. This is a phenomenon called ''long-range cooperativity''. Upon formation of the octamer, cI dimers may cooperatively bind to O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;3 and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3, repressing transcription of cI. This ''autonegative'' regulation ensures a stable minimum concentration of the repressor molecule and, should SOS signals arise, allows for more efficient prophage induction.&lt;ref&gt;Ptashne, Mark (2004). ''A Genetic Switch'', p. 112. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York. {{ISBN|978-0879697167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the absence of cI proteins, the ''cro'' gene may be transcribed.
* In the presence of cI proteins, only the ''cI'' gene may be transcribed.
* At high concentration of cI, transcriptions of both genes are repressed.

|-
| '''cIII''' || Regulatory protein CIII.  Lysogeny, cII Stability || P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; || (Clear 3) ''HflB'' (FtsH) binding protein, protects ''cII'' from degradation by proteases.
|-
| '''cII''' || Lysogeny, Transcription activator || P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; || (Clear 2) Activates transcription from the P&lt;sub&gt;AQ&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;RE&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; promoters, transcribing ''cI'' and ''int''. Low stability due to susceptibility to cellular ''HflB'' (FtsH) proteases (especially in healthy cells and cells undergoing the SOS response). High levels of ''cII'' will push the phage toward integration and lysogeny while low levels of ''cII'' will result in lysis.
|-

At low concentrations blocks the P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; promoter (preventing cro production). At high concentrations downregulates its own production through O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;3 binding. Repressor also inhibits transcription from the P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; promoter. Susceptible to cleavage by ''[[RecA]]*'' in cells undergoing the SOS response.

At high concentrations downregulates its own production through O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;2 and O&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;1 binding. No cooperative binding (c.f. below for cI binding)
|-
| '''O''' || Lysis, DNA replication || P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; || Replication protein O.  Initiates Phage Lambda DNA replication by binding at ''ori'' site.

| '''int''' || Genome Integration, Excision || P&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; || [[Integrase]], manages insertion of phage genome into the host's genome. In Conditions of low ''int'' concentration there is no effect. If ''xis'' is low in concentration and ''int'' high then this leads to the insertion of the phage genome. If ''xis'' and ''int'' have high (and approximately equal) concentrations this leads to the excision of phage genomes from the host's genome.

This RNApol modification prevents its recognition of termination sites, so normal RNA polymerase termination signals are ignored and RNA synthesis continues into distal phage genes (''cII, cIII, xis, int, O, P, Q'')
|-
| '''Q''' || Antitermination for Transcription of Late Lytic Genes || P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; || [[Antiterminator]], DNA binding protein and RNApol cofactor, binds DNA (at Qut sites) and transfers onto the initiating RNApol. This RNApol modification alters its recognition of termination sequences, so normal ones are ignored; special Q termination sequences some 20,000 bp away are effective. Q-extended transcripts include phage structural proteins (A-F, Z-J) and lysis genes (''S, R, Rz and Rz1''). Downregulated by P''&lt;sub&gt;antiq&lt;/sub&gt;'' antisense mRNA during lysogeny.
|-
| '''[[RecA]]''' || [[SOS Response]] || Host protein || DNA repair protein, functions as a co-protease during SOS response, auto-cleaving ''LexA'' and ''cI'' and facilitating lysis.

==Lytic vs. Lysogenic==
[[File:Lambda temperate life cycle.png|thumbnail|Diagram of temperate phage life cycle, showing both lytic and lysogenic cycles.]]
An important distinction here is that between the two decisions; lysogeny and lysis on infection, and continuing lysogeny or lysis from a prophage. The latter is determined solely by the activation of RecA in the SOS response of the cell, as detailed in the section on induction. The former will also be affected by this; a cell undergoing an SOS response will always be lysed, as no cI protein will be allowed to build up. However, the initial lytic/lysogenic decision on infection is also dependent on the cII and cIII proteins.

In cells with sufficient nutrients, protease activity is high, which breaks down cII.&lt;ref&gt;Ptashne M (1986). "A Genetic Switch. Gene Control and Phage lambda". Cell Press {{ISBN|0-86542-315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the lytic lifestyle. In cells with limited nutrients, protease activity is low, making cII stable. This leads to the lysogenic lifestyle. cIII appears to stabilize cII, both directly and by acting as a competitive inhibitor to the relevant proteases. This means that a cell "in trouble", i.e. lacking in nutrients and in a more dormant state, is more likely to lysogenise. This would be selected for because the phage can now lie dormant in the bacterium until it falls on better times, and so the phage can create more copies of itself with the additional resources available and with the more likely proximity of further infectable cells.

A full biophysical model for lambda's lysis-lysogeny decision remains to be developed. Computer modeling and simulation suggest that random processes during infection drive the selection of lysis or lysogeny within individual cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arkin A, Ross J, McAdams HH |title=Stochastic kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage lambda-infected Escherichia coli cells |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=1633–48 |year=1998 |pmid=9691025 |pmc=1460268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent experiments suggest that physical differences among cells, that exist prior to infection, predetermine whether a cell will lyse or become a lysogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=St-Pierre F, Endy D |title=Determination of cell fate selection during phage lambda infection |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=52 |pages=20705–20710 |year=2008 |pmid=19098103 |pmc=2605630 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0808831105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10520705S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lambda as a genetic tool==
Lambda phage has been used heavily as a [[model organism]], and has been a rich source for useful tools in [[microbial genetics]], and later in [[molecular genetics]]. Uses include its application as a vector for the cloning of [[recombinant DNA]]; the use of its site-specific recombinase (int) for the shuffling of cloned DNAs by the [[Gateway Technology|gateway method]]; and the application of its Red [[operon]], including the proteins Red alpha (also called 'exo'), beta and gamma in the DNA engineering method called [[recombineering]]. The 48 kb DNA fragment of lambda phage is not essential for productive infection and can be replaced by foreign DNA. Lambda phage will enter bacteria more easily than plasmids making it a useful vector that can destroy or can become part of the host's DNA. Lambda phage can be manipulated and used as an anti-cancer vaccine, nanoparticle, targeting human aspartyl (asparaginyl) β-hydroxylase (HAAH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=Steven|last2=Stewart|first2=Solomon|last3=Lebowitz|first3=Michael|last4=Malhotra|first4=Kanam|last5=Semenuk|first5=Mark|last6=Biswas|first6=Biswajit|last7=Ghanbari|first7=Hossein|date=2013-11-07|title=Immunogenicity of a lambda phage-based anti-cancer vaccine targeting HAAH|journal=Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer|volume=1|issue=Suppl 1|pages=P210|doi=10.1186/2051-1426-1-S1-P210|issn=2051-1426|pmc=3991175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambda phage has also been of major importance in the study of [[transduction (genetics)|specialized transduction]].

'''Lawrence Joseph Ellison''' (born August 17, 1944) is an American [[businessman]], [[entrepreneur]], and [[philanthropist]] who is co-founder, executive chairman and chief technology officer of [[Oracle Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Larry Ellison|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-ellison/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2018, he was listed by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as the fifth-wealthiest person in the United States and as the tenth-wealthiest in the world, with a fortune of $54.5 billion.&lt;ref name="Larry Ellison topic page"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-ellison/|title=Larry Ellison|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellison was born in [[New York City]] and grew up in [[Chicago]]. He studied at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] and the [[University of Chicago]] without graduating before moving to [[California]] in 1966. While working at [[Ampex]] in the early 1970s, he became influenced by [[Edgar F. Codd|Edgar F. Codd's]] research on [[relational database]] design, which led in 1977 to the formation of what became Oracle. Oracle became a successful database vendor to mid- and low-range systems, competing with [[Sybase]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]], which led to Ellison being listed by Forbes as one of the richest men in the world.

Ellison has donated up to 1% of his wealth to charity and has signed [[The Giving Pledge]]. In addition to his work at Oracle, Ellison has had success in yachting, through [[Oracle Team USA]]. He is a licensed aircraft pilot who owns two military jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minyanville.com/investing/articles/ORCL-ellison-yachts-ceos-architecture-immortality/8/28/2008/id/18703 |title=CEOs Gone Wild: Larry Ellison |publisher=Minyanville.com |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2013 |first1=Justin |last1=Rohrlich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellison moved to Chicago's [[South Shore, Chicago|South Shore]], then a middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who adopted the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, [[Ellis Island]]. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=ell/&gt;

Although Ellison was raised in a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. Ellison states: "While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don't believe that they are real. They're interesting stories. They're interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don't. I see no evidence for this stuff." At age thirteen, Ellison refused to have a [[bar mitzvah]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Symonds and Ellison, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OOYb-0DNG18C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fy6EWUqJSt&amp;sig=pDxV5AhFxrOlLZygnCVz6bud0jI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fYiAT5vsAufX0QHIjJmBCA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA%23v=onepage&amp;q=jewish&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=jewish&amp;f=false pp. 19–20].&lt;/ref&gt; Ellison says that his love affair with Israel is not connected to religious sentiments, but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Symonds |first1=Matthew |last2=Ellison |first2=Larry |title=Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle |date=2003 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=9780743225052 |page=389 |url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Softwar/Matthew-Symonds/9780743225052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellison left the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] after his second year, not taking his final exams, because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending a summer in [[Northern California]], he attended the [[University of Chicago]] for one term, where he first encountered computer design. In 1966, aged 22, he moved to Northern California.

==Early career and Oracle==

[[File:Larry Ellison in Oracle OpenWorld 2010.JPG|thumb|Larry Ellison lecturing at the [[Oracle OpenWorld]], San Francisco 2010]]

=== 1977–1994 ===

During the 1970s, after a brief stint at [[Amdahl Corporation]], Ellison began working for [[Ampex Corporation]]. His projects included a [[database]] for the [[CIA]], which he named "Oracle". Ellison was inspired by a paper written by [[Edgar F. Codd]] on [[relational database management system|relational database systems]] called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodd |first1=E. F. |title=A relational model of data for large shared data banks |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |date=June 1970 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=377–387 |doi=10.1145/362384.362685 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=362384.362685}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.

In 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc., and in 1982, officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product, the [[Oracle Database]]. Ellison had heard about the [[International Business Machines|IBM]] [[IBM System R|System R]] database, also based on Codd's theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R's code. The initial release of Oracle in 1979 was called Oracle 2; there was no Oracle 1.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money. This crisis, which almost resulted in the company's bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle's "up-front" marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle [[class-action]] lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made "an incredible business mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gilbert |first1=Alorie |title=Oracle cuts rewards for last-minute deals |url=https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/oracle-cuts-rewards-for-last-minute-deals/ |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=31 December 2016 |date=20 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its [[IBM DB2|DB2]] and [[IBM SQL/DS|SQL/DS]] database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on [[Unix]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating systems. This left the door open for [[Sybase]], Oracle, [[Informix Corporation|Informix]], and eventually [[Microsoft]] to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers. Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry's darling vendor, but soon fell victim to [[merger mania]]. Sybase's 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name "SQL Server".

In his early years at Oracle, Larry Ellison was named an Award Recipient in the High Technology Category for the [[Ernst and Young|EY]] Entrepreneur of the Year Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Drake |last=Martinet |url=http://allthingsd.com/20110627/larry-ellison-has-one-and-now-11-more-entrepreneurs-do-too/ |title=Larry Ellison Has One, and Now 11 More Entrepreneurs Do, Too |publisher=[[All Things Digital]] |date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994–2010 ===
[[File:Larry Ellison on stage.jpg|thumb|left|Ellison in 2009]]
In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle's most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and [[IBM]] absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of [[Apple Computer]] after [[Steve Jobs]] returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002, saying "my schedule does not currently allow me to attend enough of the formal board meetings to warrant a role as a director".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/09/20Larry-Ellison-Resigns-as-Apple-Director.html |publisher=[[Apple Computer]] |type=Press release |title=Larry Ellison Resigns as Apple Director |first=Lynn |last=Fox |date=September 20, 2002 |accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM's acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their [[IBM DB2|DB2]] database. {{As of | 2013}} Oracle's main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, [[Linux]], and Windows operating systems comes from IBM's DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server, which only runs on Windows. IBM's DB2 still dominates the [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] database market.

In 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777676/000119312505177313/ddef14a.htm |title=Definitive Proxy Statement |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ORACLE_CORP_Lawrence_J._Ellison.php |title=Executive Compensation: Lawrence J.

On February 14, 2010, Ellison's yacht ''[[USA 17 (yacht)|USA 17]]'' won the second race (in the best of three "[[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|deed of gift]]" series) of the [[2010 America's Cup|33rd America's Cup]], after winning the first race two days earlier. Securing a historic victory, Ellison and his BMW Oracle team became the first challengers to win a "deed of gift" match. The Cup returned to American shores for the first time since 1995. Ellison served as a crew member in the second race.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=4913750 |title=BMW Oracle wins America's Cup |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 14, 2010 |quote=Ellison and Kostecki were the only Americans on BMW Oracle's crew for the clincher.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Ellison had filed several legal challenges, through the [[Golden Gate Yacht Club]], against the way that [[Ernesto Bertarelli]] (also one of the world's richest men) proposed to organize the [[33rd America's Cup]] following the 2007 victory of Bertarelli's team [[Alinghi]].&lt;ref name="ESPN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cory E. |last=Friedman |url=http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/07/cf/ |title=A Perpetual Cup for Not So Friendly Competition Between Lawyers |publisher=Sailingscuttlebutt.com |date= |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The races were finally held{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- this Ellison WP article seems to bring up the legal challenges in an Ellison bio, but then fails to state what the issue was or why Ellison was directly involved, morphing to merely "the races were finally held".  Why "finally"?  Was the issue timing?  Is this paragraph notable in the Ellison bio article? --&gt;
in February 2010 in Valencia.

In 2002, Ellison's Oracle's team introduced kite yachting into the American Cup environment. The kite traction flying lasted about 30 minutes in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myplainview.com/article_c2af0a8a-4310-55b6-91e2-17786b498ee4.html |title=Oracle Flies Kite in America's Cup Test |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ellison ended his ownership of the [[List of motor yachts by length|eighth largest]] [[yacht]] in the world, named ''[[Rising Sun (yacht)|Rising Sun]]''. He sold his remaining shares in the yacht to music and film mogul [[David Geffen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superyachttimes.com/superyachttimes/www/editorial/20/article/id/5141 |title=David Geffen now sole owner of 138 metre superyacht Rising Sun – Yacht Owners |website=Superyacht Times |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rising Sun'' is {{convert|453|ft|m|abbr=off}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/14809 |title=Brad Reese on Cisco: Yachting with Oracle CEO Larry Ellison |website=Network world |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly cost over $200{{nbsp}}million to build.

Oracle Racing lost the [[2017 America's Cup]] to Team New Zealand.

===Aviation===

Ellison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft. He was cited by the city of [[San Jose, California]], for violating its [[Noise mitigation#Aircraft noise abatement|limits on late-night takeoffs and landings]] from [[San Jose International Airport|San Jose Mineta International Airport]] by planes weighing more than 75,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (34,019&amp;nbsp;kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his [[Gulfstream V]] aircraft "is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds, for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carolyne |last=Zinko |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-01-07/news/17636763_1_airport-noise-curfew-hours-san-jose-international-airport |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |title=Ellison Sues Over Airport Rule On Noise at Night / He wants right to land his jet anytime |date=January 7, 2000 |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; US District Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] ruled in Ellison's favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison's jet, but did not invalidate the curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew B. |last=Stannard |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/16/MNW222177.DTL |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |title=Judge clears Ellison for landing at night / Curfew left intact at San Jose airport |date=June 16, 2001 |accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellison also owns at least two military jets: a [[SIAI-Marchetti S.211]], a training aircraft designed in Italy, and a decommissioned [[MiG-29]], which the US government has refused him permission to import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minyanville.com/investing/articles/ORCL-ellison-yachts-ceos-architecture-immortality/8/28/2008/id/18703 |title=CEOs Gone Wild: Larry Ellison |publisher=Minyanville.com |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennis===

In 2009, Larry purchased the [[Indian Wells Tennis Garden]] tennis facility in California's [[Coachella Valley]] and the [[Indian Wells Masters]] tournament, both of which he still owns.

===Homes===

Ellison styled his estimated $110&amp;nbsp;million [[Woodside, California]], estate after feudal Japanese architecture, complete with a man-made {{convert|2.3|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake and an extensive [[seismic retrofit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.house-arch.com/japanese-imperial-palace-of-oracle-ceo%E2%80%99s.html |title=Japanese Palace Style of Oracle CEO House |website=House &amp; Architecture Design |date=October 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029231947/http://www.house-arch.com/japanese-imperial-palace-of-oracle-ceo%E2%80%99s.html |archivedate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 and 2005 he purchased more than 12 properties in [[Malibu, California]], worth more than $180&amp;nbsp;million. The $65&amp;nbsp;million Ellison spent on five contiguous lots at [[Malibu, California|Malibu's]] Carbon Beach made this the most costly residential transaction in United States history until [[Ron Perelman]] sold his [[Palm Beach, Florida]] compound for $70&amp;nbsp;million later that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Geist |first=Isabella |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/11/05/cx_cd_1105movers.html |title=Ron's $70 Million Sale |newspaper=Forbes |date=November 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entertainment system cost $1&amp;nbsp;million, and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool, using the gaping hole as a giant subwoofer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Boulware |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.11/power_houses_pr.html |title=Power Houses |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |issue=October 2011 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, Ellison purchased the [[Astor's Beechwood Mansion]]&amp;nbsp;– formerly the summer home of the [[Astor family]]&amp;nbsp;– in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], for $10.5&amp;nbsp;million. In 2011 he purchased the 249-acre Porcupine Creek Estate and private golf course in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], for $42.9&amp;nbsp;million. The property was formerly the home of [[Yellowstone Club]] founders [[Edra Blixseth|Edra]] and [[Tim Blixseth]], and was sold to Ellison by creditors following their divorce and bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Candy |last=Evans |accessdate=April 9, 2011 |url=http://www.luxist.com/2011/02/09/larry-ellison-buys-porcupine-creek |title=Larry Ellison Buys Porcupine Creek |website=Luxist |date=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 2012, the governor of Hawaii, [[Neil Abercrombie]], declared that Ellison had signed an agreement to buy most of the island of [[Lanai]] from the [[Castle &amp; Cooke]] company, owned by [[David H. Murdock]]. Following the purchase Ellison owns 98% of Lanai, Hawaii's sixth-largest island.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===

In 1992, Ellison shattered his elbow in a high-speed bicycle crash. His search for a highly skilled orthopedic surgeon led him to Dr. Michael W. Chapman at the [[University of California, Davis]]. Impressed by his care, Ellison donated $5&amp;nbsp;million to seed the Lawrence J. Ellison Musculo-Skeletal Research Center. In 1998, the Lawrence J. Ellison Ambulatory Care Center opened on the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] campus of the [[UC Davis Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=August 4, 2014 |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20080130_Chapmans/index.html |title=UC Davis Health System: Philanthropic Pioneers |publisher=UC Davis Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to settle an [[insider trading]] lawsuit arising from Ellison's selling nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion of Oracle stock, he was allowed to donate $100&amp;nbsp;million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison's legal fees of $24&amp;nbsp;million. Ellison's lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to [[Stanford University]] raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case's merits for Oracle.&lt;ref&gt;In Re Oracle Corp. Derivative Litigation (824 A.2d 917 (2003))&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], Ellison made a controversial offer to donate software to the federal government that would enable it to build and run a national identification database and issue [[Identity documents in the United States|ID cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oracle of National ID Cards |url=https://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,47788,00.html |website=Wired |date=October 27, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011027160301/http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0%2C2100%2C47788%2C00.html |archive-date=October 27, 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Forbes|Forbes's]]'' 2004 list of charitable donations made by the wealthiest 400 Americans stated that Ellison had donated $151,092,103, about 1% of his estimated personal wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Whelan |url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/09/23/cz_dw_0923philan_rl04.html |accessdate=10 May 2016 |title=Charity And The Forbes 400 |newspaper=Forbes |date=September 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, he announced he would not honor his earlier pledge of $115&amp;nbsp;million to [[Harvard University]], claiming it was due to the departure of former President [[Lawrence Summers]]. Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne announced, "It was really Larry Summers' brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered&amp;nbsp;... [I]t was Larry Ellison and Larry Summers that had initially come up with this notion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/06/28/oracles_ceo_cancels_115m_gift_to_harvard/ |title=Oracle's CEO cancels $115m gift to Harvard |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Ellison pledged $500,000 to fortify a community centre in [[Sderot]], [[Israel]], after discovering that the building was not fortified against rocket attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3435691,00.html |title=Oracle's Ellison promises $500,000 donation |website=[[Ynet]] |first=Shmulik |last=Hadad |date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other charitable donations by Ellison include a $10&amp;nbsp;million donation to the [[Friends of the Israel Defense Forces]] in 2014, about which he said: "In my mind, there is no greater honor than supporting some of the bravest people in the world&amp;nbsp;... These men and women come together with indefatigable purpose, to defend Israel and strive to co-exist in peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hollywood-gala-raises-a-record-33-million-for-idf/#ixzz3JBayfWVj |title=Hollywood gala raises a record $33 million for IDF |newspaper=[[Times of Israel]] |date=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Ellison donated $16.6 million  to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. His donation will support the construction of well-being facilities on a new campus for [[co-ed]] conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2017/11/05/news-opinion/united-states/record-53-8-million-raised-for-idf-soldiers-at-beverly-hills-gala Record $53.8 million raised for IDF soldiers at Beverly Hills gala], November 5, Jewish Telegraphic Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, it was reported that Ellison is one of the 40 billionaires who have signed "[[The Giving Pledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Giving Pledge: Larry Ellison |url=http://givingpledge.org/#larry_ellison |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ellison joins billionaire charity pledge |date=August 8, 2010 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/08/BU9A1EPNPE.DTL |publisher=Bloomberg in ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellison wrote: "Many years ago, I put virtually all of my assets into a trust with the intent of giving away at least 95&amp;nbsp;percent of my wealth to charitable causes. I have already given hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research and education, and I will give billions more over time. Until now, I have done this giving quietly because I have long believed that charitable giving is a personal and private matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fried |first=Ina |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20012631-56.html |title=Larry Ellison, dozens more, to give away wealth |website=[[CNET]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Ellison donated $200 million to [[University of Southern California]] for establishing a cancer research center: Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC.

===Politics===

Ellison was critical of [[National Security Agency|NSA]] whistle-blower [[Edward Snowden]], saying that "Snowden had yet to identify a single person who had been 'wrongly injured' by the NSA's data collection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/orcales-larry-ellison-data-privacy-working-japan/ |title=Oracle's Larry Ellison talks about Edward Snowden, isn't a big fan |first=J.

Ellison is one of the top donors to Conservative Solutions PAC, a super [[Political action committee|PAC]] supporting [[Marco Rubio]]'s 2016 presidential bid. As of February 2016, Ellison had given $4 million overall to the PAC.&lt;ref name="RubioPAC"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vogel |first1=Kenneth |title=Larry Ellison gives another $1 million to boost Marco Rubio |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/marco-rubio-larry-ellison-219549 |website=Politico |publisher=Politico |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jane Doe 1921 - 1951 (retouched).jpg|thumb|150px|Retouched morgue photograph of the female victim killed in a dynamite explosion between 1921 and 1951.]]

Two children were witnessed playing with sticks of dynamite in Los Angeles County, California between the years of 1921 and 1951. Poor record keeping resulted in the exact date of the incident being unknown; the time range was established from the thirty-year career of the particular crime scene photographer. The dynamite subsequently exploded and killed both the victims, one male and one female. Very little is known about these two victims, especially the male child, as it was impossible to create a reconstruction from his body due to the injuries he suffered.  The female was in much better condition.  She was most likely a teenager, though a wider possible age range is not known.  Her height, weight, hair and eye color are unknown; though she most likely was Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 225UFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/225ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Bernardino County John Doe 1930.jpg|thumb|left|150px|San Bernardino County John Doe, killed by a truck in 1930.]]

A man estimated to be between the ages of fifty-five and sixty years old was struck by a truck on Cajon Highway on October 22, 1930 in Verdemont, San Bernardino County, California. The victim had been walking alongside the road and was presumed to have been killed as soon as the vehicle collided with his body. He had hazel eyes, a beard and gray hair. His height and weight were five feet eight inches and 180 pounds, respectively. The unidentified man's fingerprints have since been obtained, but his dental records were not and his DNA was not possible to use to create a genetic profile to compare to potential matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8893|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/8893|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Los Angeles Jane Doe 1968.jpg|150px|thumb|1968 Los Angeles County Jane Doe]]

An African-American female was found dead on September 30, 1968 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The woman was estimated to be over the age of twenty five and was at a height of five feet three inches tall and weighed about 110 pounds. Her hair was black and her eyes were brown, coinciding with her race. The teeth were left in a natural condition, as no evidence of dental work was noted. Her wisdom teeth had yet to erupt. The woman wore a pullover shirt, pants, black shoes and matching socks. The colors of the pants and shirt are unknown. She may have died of a drug overdose and her body was abandoned behind a building, presumably transported from the place of death. It is believed she was seen alive immediately prior to her death, but this has not led to the discovery of her identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 729UFCA|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/729ufca.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=12 July 2015|date=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''living funeral''', also called a '''pre-funeral''', is a [[funeral]] held for a living person. One of the more famous living funerals was that for [[Morrie Schwartz]] which was documented in both the book and film ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]'' and feature ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' sports columnist [[Mitch Albom]] as one of the central characters.  It may be important to the person's psychological state and also that of the dying person's family to attend the living funeral.  It is also sometimes used as a time to read the will and explain the reasons behind some of the decisions contained within it.

==Purpose==
A living [[funeral]] is usually done by someone who knows that he or she does not have much time left to live. Whether the reason is that the person is terminally ill or is at an old age, the person knows death is near and could use it as closure. It is used to celebrate the happy times, and forgive the body for "failing".&lt;ref&gt;Ceremonies. Close, Henry. Ceremonies for Spiritual Healing and Growth. Taylor and Francis, 2012. http://reader.eblib.com/(S(l3pwge1uoxu5akgi5booohoz))/Reader.aspx?p=1099476&amp;o=785&amp;u=mKyUaTgCatU4QFkEYCpDmA%3d%3d&amp;t=1359430452&amp;h=7AC69DD72F8AD341C0215D22214BA5A21AB5CCA9&amp;s=15609797&amp;ut=2445&amp;pg=1&amp;r=img&amp;c=-1&amp;pat=n#.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
Money is a big part of living funerals. This is another reason that people have them. Regular funeral prices can be extremely high. Having a living funeral can save some money. Some feel that the living funeral is more meaningful.  In the end, it can be around the same price for the living funeral ceremony and when the person does eventually die, the burial.&lt;ref&gt;video. "Serenity Funeral Chapel Living Funeral KMVT." KMVT, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of a living funeral==
Most living funerals have the same aspects of a normal funeral, the deceased person aside.  A common theme is for the funeral to start off the same way that a normal funeral would; sombre music, a casket, bible readings, etc. From there the tone is usually switched. Different music is played along with an all around happier atmosphere. The goal is for this to be happy, to celebrate a life and to give thanks to everyone attending. During a living funeral, families and friends will share stories and memories of the person who is nearing death. This ceremony is often a very happy event where there can be closure. The soon-to-be-deceased person often speaks about their life and who has affected it. Many people want to be able to show their appreciation through the living funeral. Friends and family of the person hosting the funeral will say things that they would have said at a normal funeral. Except now their loved one is there to hear it.

==Japan==
Living funerals, called {{nihongo|''seizensō''|生前葬}} in Japanese, started being done in Japan in the 1990s. Elders in Japan feel that they are burdening their children with their old age. They are ashamed of their failing body. By having a living funeral they feel that they can take some of the stress away from the funeral. After this ceremony many Japanese "expect nothing" from their families after they die; including a funeral.&lt;ref&gt;ShiftingLives. Suzuki, Hikaru. “Shifting Lives of Japanese Elders: Emerging Communal Relationships with Funeral Companies.” Research Collection School of Social Sciences Paper 78 (October 2005):http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&amp;context=soss_research&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dseizenso%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C39%26as_sdtp%3D#search=%22seizenso%22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
There is a lot of controversy surrounding living funerals.

Critics believe funerals should be performed after death. They feel that this is the only way to truly respect the dead. Another argument that is used states that since people have been doing funerals after death for so long, it is impossible to change anything about it. However, this appeal to tradition is a [[Appeal to tradition|common fallacy]]. In Japan a living funeral is also considered “a denial of ancestral significance.”&lt;ref&gt;Japan.Breen, John. “Death Issues in 21st Century Japan” 9, no. 1 (2004): 2–12. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13576270410001652578#tabModule&lt;/ref&gt;

Living funerals can also be seen as egocentric because the person having the funeral might use it as an opportunity to brag, since listing accomplishments during one's life is often a popular thing to do during this ceremony. However, [[Mizunoe Takiko]], who had a living funeral on television, said that the purpose of her funeral was “to express appreciation to all those who have been dear to me while I am still alive.”&lt;ref&gt;Handbook.Bryant, Clifton D. Handbook of Death and Dying. Vol. 1. SAGE, 2003. https://books.google.com/books?id=3z9EpgisKOgC&amp;q=%22living+funeral%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22living%20funeral%22&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Fiction==
*''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]''
Living funerals became much more popular because of the book Tuesdays with Morrie. He brought up the question of why one should wait until he is dead to be appreciated. "What a waste," he said. "All those people saying all those wonderful things, and Irv never got to hear any of it."

The living funeral is a time to honor and appreciate the living.

'''Margo Jones''' (December 12, 1913 – July 24, 1955&lt;ref name="TSHAbio"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjo59|title = JONES, MARGARET VIRGINIA|publisher = Texas State Historical Association|accessdate = August 11, 2013|website = Handbook of Texas Online|first = Helen|last = Sheehy}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[United States|American]] [[Theatre director|stage director]] and [[Theatrical producer|producer]] best known for launching the American regional theater movement and for introducing the [[theatre in the round|theater-in-the-round]] concept in [[Dallas, Texas]]. In 1947, she established the first regional professional company when she opened '''Theatre '47''' in Dallas. Of the 85 plays Jones staged during her Dallas career, 57 were new, and one-third of those new plays had a continued life on stage, television and radio.

==Early career and Theatre '47==
Born '''Margaret Virginia Jones''' in [[Livingston, Texas]], Jones worked in community and professional theaters in [[California]], [[Houston]], and [[New York City]].  "Since 1936, Margo Jones had served as assistant director of the Federal Theatre in Houston, traveled to Soviet Russia for a festival at the Moscow Art Theatre, and founded and directed the Houston Community Theatre.  She had recently joined the faculty of the University of Texas's drama department in Austin (around 1942)."&lt;ref&gt;Leverich, Lyle; "Tom:  The Unknown Tennessee" (New York:  Crown Publishers, 1995), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled the world, experiencing theater everywhere, eventually gaining commercial success on Broadway as co-director of the original production of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]. She directed Williams' ''[[Summer and Smoke]]'', a flop in its first production but highly regarded years later. After she directed [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s successful ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] as [[Joan of Arc]], she was fired during the [[Washington, D.C.]] tryout. However, her name remained on the marquee and playbills, and no other director was ever credited for the production. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

All three plays were filmed. Bergman repeated her Joan of Lorraine role in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), for which she was Oscar-nominated. [[Geraldine Page]] was Oscar-nominated for her performance in ''Summer and Smoke'' (1961). Since 1950, there have been at least five different film/TV productions of ''The Glass Menagerie''.

The success of ''The Glass Menagerie'' allowed her to take the next step toward her dream of running a repertory theatre outside of New York. She moved back to Dallas and opened Theatre '47 (which changed its name to the corresponding year every New Year's Eve). {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Her theater was in the sleek "Magnolia Lounge" ([[Magnolia Petroleum Company]], later Mobil Oil) building, designed by Swiss-born architect William Lescaze, in 1936 for the Texas Centennial and situated on the grounds of [[Fair Park]] in Dallas. The theater was America's first modern nonprofit professional resident theater and also the first professional arena theater (theater-in-the-round) in the country. Jones was inspired by [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s Depression era National Theater Project and the European arts movement which she had experienced directly during the 1930s. The resident company was dedicated to staging new plays and classics of world theater rather than revivals of past Broadway hits. The initial season introduced [[William Inge]]'s first play, ''[[Farther Off from Heaven]]'', later revised as ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjo59 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'': Margo Jones]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional theater movement==
Though touring shows did exist at this time, there were no quality professional American theatre companies outside of New York. Jones believed in the decentralization of theater. She wanted her art to exist all across America, beyond the realm of commercialized Broadway. She reasoned that if she and her collaborators succeeded "in inspiring the operation of 30 theatres like ours, the playwright won't need Broadway." (Sheehy 2). Playwrights Inge, [[Jerome Lawrence]] and Robert E. Lee championed this sentiment when they received their first big breaks from Jones' Dallas theater.

Jones envisioned it as a place where actors, writers and technicians could have steady jobs and not be subject to the problems found in the volatile New York scene. When the Ford Foundation began giving grants outside of New York during the 1950s, the movement gathered momentum and Theatre '47 became the model of how to build a new company. (Weeks)

In her book ''Theatre in the Round'', Jones outlined inexpensive methods to enable companies to get started, detailing valuable information on subscription sales, board development, programming, actor/artist relations and other issues relevant to new regional theatre companies. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Her theater-in-the-round concept requires no stage curtain, little scenery and allows the audience to sit on three sides of the stage. That concept was used by directors in later years for such well-known shows as the original stage production of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', and all plays staged at the [[ANTA Washington Square Theatre]] (demolished in the late 1960s), including [[Arthur Miller]]'s autobiographical play ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' (1964). {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Death==
On July 17, 1955, Jones invited friends over to a party. However, during the party she spilled red paint on the carpet, so her secretary later brought professional cleaners to deal with it. They used [[carbon tetrachloride]], a strong solvent commonly used in dry-cleaning processes at the time. Jones, satisfied with the cleaning, fell asleep into the night. Unfortunately, some carbon tetrachloride had been absorbed into the carpet and later evaporated, filling her home with toxic fumes. So she woke up dizzy; it was later discovered the gas had caused [[kidney failure]]. She was then found unconscious on the couch resting and she was rushed to hospital, but died 7 days later. According to her friends, she briefly regained consciousness and found out she was going to die, and made elaborate preparations for her burial, including asking her friends to dress her properly and grooming her for her funeral. She died July 24, 1955 at the age of 43, never realizing what killed her. In 1959, her theater was closed.

==Legacy==
For eight years Jones balanced her career between Broadway and regional projects. In Dallas, she staged the world premiere of [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee]]'s ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', a fictionalized retelling of the [[Scopes monkey trial]], after it had been rejected by several Broadway producers. The play received rave reviews and subsequently opened on Broadway in April 1955, where it became a major hit. ''Inherit the Wind'' become an Oscar-nominated film in 1960 and has been revived as a TV special three times. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Jones' innovative ideas inspired the growth of numerous resident companies, and made it possible for regions across America to experience the art she loved. In 1950-55, producer [[Albert McCleery]] brought the concept of theater-in-the-round to television with his ''[[Cameo Theatre]]''.

The Margo Jones Award was established in 1961 by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.

The television series [[Curious &amp; Unusual Deaths]] features an episode of Season 2 about Jones' death.

==Television==
In 2006, a [[documentary film]] about her life and career, ''Sweet Tornado: Margo Jones and the American Theater'', was shown on [[PBS]]. With Jones portrayed by [[Judith Ivey]], the film dramatized scenes from her life, adapted from her letters and correspondence with Broadway producers and Tennessee Williams (portrayed by [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]]). The film features interviews with people who worked with her, including actor [[Ray Walston]], who got his first big break in the original production of ''Summer and Smoke''. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

This is a '''list of numbers of motorcycle deaths in U.S. by year''' from 1994 to 2014. United States [[motorcycle]] fatalities increased every year for 11 years after reaching a historic low of 2,116 fatalities in 1997, then increased to over 5,000 around 2008 and then plateaued in the 4 to 5 thousands range in the 2010s. In nine years motorcycle deaths more than doubled from the late 1990s to 2008. Despite providing less than 1% of miles driven, they made up 15% of traffic deaths in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/motorcycles/|title=Motorcycle Safety - Safety - Federal Highway Administration|author=|date=|website=safety.FHWA.dot.gov|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2004 over 4,000 people have died every year up to 2014 in motorcycle accidents, and in 2007 and 2008 deaths exceeded 5000 per year.&lt;ref name="statsiihs"/&gt; At the same time occupant deaths of other types of vehicles have decreased in the 21st century, so motorcycle accident deaths have become an increased share of all deaths and noted for being 26 times more deadly than cars.&lt;ref name="statsiihs"/&gt; Operators of sport motorcycle models had a higher rate of death compared to other motorcycle types, and speeding was noted in roughly half of fatal sport and super sport accidents compared to about a fifth for fatal accidents of other types.&lt;ref name="iii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/issue-update/motorcycle-crashes|title=Motorcycle Crashes|author=|date=|website=iii.org|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport and super sport riders were also likely to be younger among those involved in a fatal accident, with an average age of 27 (for the year 2005).&lt;ref name="iii.org"/&gt; The number of fatalities of those under 30 has gone from 80% percent in 1975 to 30% in 2014.&lt;ref name="statsiihs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/motorcycles/fatalityfacts/motorcycles|title=Motorcycles|author=|date=|website=IIHS.org|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly half of all deadly accidents involve only the motorcycle (so-called single-vehicle accidents) and a major issue is the loss of control during a bend in the road.&lt;ref name="statsiihs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurt"/&gt; There is a reported 80% chance of injury or death on a motorcycle in the event of an accident, compared to about 20% for passenger vehicles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/motorcycle03/|title=Motorcycle Safety Program INTRODUCTION|author=|date=|website=www.NHTSA.gov|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other over half of fatal accidents that do involve multiple vehicles, more than 75% involve head-on collisions, especially with vehicles that cross the lane of traffic but failed to spot the motorcycle.

In the United States, vehicles classed as motorcycles usually include both motorized bicycles and motorized tricycles, even though in the common language when people say motorcycle, they usually mean either motorized bicycle or motorized bicycle with a sidecar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Annual rates==
Between 1966 and 2008, the NHTSA estimated 148,000 people died in motorcycle accidents.&lt;ref name="nhtsa8"/&gt; In 2010, motorcycle accident fatalities accounted for 14% of all accident fatalities.&lt;ref name="nhtsa1"/&gt; It was also 14% in 2008.&lt;ref name=nhtsa8/&gt; In 2008, 47% of fatal accidents were with another vehicle, and of those 77% involved a head-on collision with a motorcycle and in 7% the motorcycle was struck from behind.&lt;ref name=nhtsa8/&gt; 59% of those killed were wearing a helmet, which were estimated to give a 37% increased chance of overall survival and reduction in the chance of a head injury;helmet use has been the subject of various studies and laws.&lt;ref name=nhtsa8/&gt; In 2013, 6% of the fatalities were passengers (non-operator) of the total deaths that year for motorcycles 4,688.&lt;ref name="injured"/&gt;

From 1980 motorcycle ownership among riders aged 40 and over increased dramatically, from 15.1 percent of all riders in 1980 to 43.7 percent in 1998. The mean engine displacement of the motorcycles involved in fatal crashes also increased, from an average engine size of {{Convert|769|cc|abbr=on}} in 1990, to {{Convert|959|cc|abbr=on}} in 2001, an increase of 24.7 percent.&lt;ref name="NHSTA"&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/motorcycle03/recent.htm |access-date= April 4, 2011 |author=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |location=US |title=Motorcycle Safety Program }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the combination of older riders on higher-powered motorcycles might have been partially responsible for the increase in motorcycle deaths from the late 1990s until 2004.&lt;ref name="NHSTA"/&gt; Blunt abdominal trauma can be caused by a motorcycle accident, and can damage the testes and intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477680403000293|title=Blunt abdominal trauma associated with testicular dislocation and contralateral inguinal hernia|first1=S. -H|last1=Ng|first2=S. -F|last2=Ko|first3=Y. -L|last3=Wan|first4=C. -C|last4=Huang|first5=T. -Y|last5=Lee|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=|journal=Clinical Radiology Extra|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–2|access-date=July 16, 2017|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/S1477-6804(03)00029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014 a rear-ending occurred every 17 seconds on the US road system, and improvements to cars especially in regards to headrests have reduced whiplash and other neck and back injuries related to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/how-to-save-your-neck-in-a-rear-end-crash/index.htm|title=Protection Against Whiplash Injuries - Consumer Reports|author=|date=|website=ConsumerReports.org|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hope may be [[Collision avoidance system]]s on more vehicles.

However, it is head-on collisions with cars that make up one of the biggest types of fatal collisions.&lt;ref name="nolo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Motorcycle Accidents: Causes and Consequences|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/motorcycle-accidents|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 56% of fatal collisions with other vehicles, 78% percent were head-on collisions and 5% were a fatal rear-ending of the motorcycle by another vehicle type.&lt;ref name="nolo"/&gt; Of those fatal head-on collisions one of the most common is when a car makes a turn and another situation is when a motorcycle is trying to pass another car.&lt;ref name="nolo"/&gt; 

In 2012, 75% of two-vehicle motorcycle accidents involved the motorcycle crashing into the vehicle ahead of it and only 7% involved the motorcycle being hit in the rear.&lt;ref name="2012 Motorcycle statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812035.pdf|title=2012 Motorcycle statistics|author=|date=|website=DOT.gov|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year half of all fatal accidents were two-vehicle crashes,&lt;ref name="2012 Motorcycle statistics"/&gt; However, they also had the highest rate of collision with fixed object between passenger cars, light trucks, and heavy trucks; with a 22% of fatalities being single-vehicle crashes with a fixed object.&lt;ref name="2012 Motorcycle statistics"/&gt; Of the two-vehicle crashes one nearly 40% involved the motorcycle hitting another vehicle turning left.&lt;ref name="2012 Motorcycle statistics"/&gt;

A quarter of motorcycle fatalities are single-vehicle crashes into a fixed object.&lt;ref name="nolo"/&gt; Other dangers to motorcycles include enhanced risks compared to other vehicles include potholes, uneven pavement, and unexpected objects in the road such as animals.&lt;ref name="nolo"/&gt;

* Another vehicle fails to spot a motorcycle in an oncoming lane, and does a left turn and the motorcycle either has a head-on collision with car, or crashes during the evasive maneuver
* The motorcyclist exceeds the performance abilities of the bike and crashes.
* Road to bike interactions, such as large pothole triggers a loss of vehicle control
* Hits oncoming vehicles during a passing maneuver on a bi-directional road

'''Mstislav Romanovich the Old''' ({{lang-uk|Мстислав Романович Старий}}; {{lang-ru|Мстислав Романович Старый}}) (died 1223) was [[Prince]] of [[Pskov]] (1179–?), [[Smolensk]] (1197–?), [[Belgorod Kievsky|Belgorod]] (1206), [[Halych]] (?–?) and [[Grand Prince]] of [[Kiev]] (1212–1223). He was the son of [[Roman of Kiev|Roman Rostislavich]].

Mstislav defeated an invading [[Hungary|Hungarian]] army in 1221. He went to war against the [[Mongols]] of [[Genghis Khan]] in 1223. According to the [[Novgorod Chronicle]], the Mongol commanders Tsigirkan and Teshukan defeated and captured him three days after the [[Battle of the Kalka River]] at a palisade on a nearby hill.

According to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan Shi]]'', Jebe ordered a Cathayan commander named Hesimaili to convey Mstislav of Kiev to [[Jochi]], who was then east of the Aral Sea. Jochi ordered Mstislav executed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

{{Expand French|Mutilation|date=December 2014}}
'''Mutilation''' or '''maiming''' (from the Latin: ''mutilus'') is cutting off or injury to a body part of a person so that the part of the body is permanently damaged, detached or disfigured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mutilation |volume=19 |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some ethnic groups practice ritual mutilation, e.g. [[scarification]], [[burn]]ing, [[flagellation]], [[tattooing]], or [[breaking wheel|wheeling]], as part of a [[rite of passage]]. In some cases, the term may apply to treatment of dead bodies, such as soldiers mutilated after they have been killed by an enemy.

The traditional Chinese practices of [[Slow slicing|''língchí'']] and [[foot binding]] are forms of mutilation. One form of mutilation that has captured the imagination of Westerners is the "long-neck" people, a sub-group of the [[Karen people|Karen]] known as the [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] where women wear brass rings around their neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiangdao.com/chiangmai/karenlongneck.htm|title=Karen Long Neck hilltribe - Padaung, Northern Thailand|publisher=Chiangdao.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[tattoo]]ing is also considered a form of self-mutilation according to some cultural traditions, such as within Christianity. A joint statement released by the [[United Nations]] and numerous other international bodies opposes [[female genital mutilation|female circumcision]] as a form of mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Eliminating Female genital mutilation - An interagency statement | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | isbn = 978-92-4-159644-2 | url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/fgm/fgm_statement_2008.pdf | format = pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not [[male circumcision]] amounts to mutilation is a subject of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denniston, G.

[[Castration]] is also a form of mutilation, as are [[body piercing]], some forms of extreme [[body modification]], and some [[cosmetic surgery]].

==Punishment==
''Maiming'', or mutilation which involves the loss of, or incapacity to use, a bodily member, is and has been practised by many societies with various cultural and religious significances, and is also a customary form of [[physical punishment]], especially applied on the principle of [[an eye for an eye]].

The [[mapuche|Araucanian]] warrior [[Galvarino]] suffered this punishment as a prisoner during the Spanish [[conquest of Chile]].

In law, maiming is a criminal offence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], an [[Anglo]]-[[French language|French]] variant form of the word.

Maiming of animals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offence generally grouped as malicious damage. For the purpose of the law as to this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses, pigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny at common [[law]] or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic purposes.

In Britain under the [[Malicious Damage Act 1861]] the punishment for maiming of cattle was three to fourteen years penal servitude; malicious injury to other animals is a misdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the penalty is imprisonment with hard labor for over twelve months.  Maiming of animals by their owner falls under the Cruelty to Animals Acts.

==Mutilation as human punishment== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dock]] --&gt;
In times when even judicial [[physical punishment]] was still commonly allowed to cause not only intense pain and [[public humiliation]] during the administration but also to inflict permanent physical damage, or even deliberately intended to mark the criminal for life by [[docking (animal)|docking]] or [[human branding|branding]], one of the common anatomical target areas not normally under permanent cover of clothing (so particularly merciless in the long term) were the ear(s).
[[File:Un pauvre averti Gontran - Frédégonde ordonne la mutilation d'Olericus.jpg|thumb|[[Fredegund]] ordering the mutilation of Olericus.]]
In England, for example, various pamphleteers attacking the religious views of the Anglican episcopacy under [[William Laud]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had their ears cut off for those writings: in 1630 Dr. [[Alexander Leighton]] and in 1637 still other [[Puritans]], [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (puritan)|Henry Burton]] and [[William Prynne]].

In Scotland one of the [[Covenanters]], James Gavin of [[Douglas, Lanarkshire]], had his ears cut off for refusing to renounce his religious faith. In Japan, [[Gonsalo Garcia]] and his companions were similarly punished.

Notably in various jurisdictions of colonial British North America, even relatively minor crimes, such as hog stealing, were punishable by having one's ears nailed to the [[pillory]] and slit loose, or even [[cropping (punishment)|cropped]], a [[counterfeiter]] would be branded on top (for that crime, considered [[lèse-majesté]], the older [[mirror punishment]] was boiling in oil), which was an example of western mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, John A. (2003) Historical Viewpoints. New York City, New York: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence did not render American justice any less brutal. For example, in the future state of Tennessee, an example of harsh 'frontier law' under the 1780 [[Cumberland Compact]] took place in 1793 when Judge [[John McNairy]] sentenced Nashville's first horse thief, John McKain, Jr., to be fastened to a wooden stock one hour for 39 lashes, have his ears cut off and cheeks [[branding persons|branded]] with the letters "H" and "T".

[[Tongue cutting]] is also a form of mutilation as this leads to bleeding to death in most cases with choking in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/pun.html|title=A History of Punishments|publisher=Localhistories.org|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nebahne Yohannes]], an unsuccessful claimant to the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Ethiopian imperial throne]] who had his ears and nose cut off, yet was then freed. This form of mutilation against unsuccessful claimants to thrones has been in use in middle-eastern regions for thousands of years. To qualify as a king, formerly, one had to exemplify perfection. Obvious physical deformities such as missing noses, ears, or lips, are thereby sufficient disqualifications. The victim in these cases is typically freed alive to act (''a'') as an example to others, and (''b'') as no longer a threat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4872">'''Muttonbirding''' is the seasonal harvesting of the chicks of [[petrel]]s, especially [[shearwater]] species, for food, oil and feathers by recreational or commercial hunters. Such hunting of petrels and other seabirds has occurred in various locations since prehistoric times, and there is evidence that many island populations have become extinct as a result. More recently ‘muttonbirding’ usually refers to the regulated and sustainable harvesting of shearwaters in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Anderson1998"&gt;Anderson, Atholl. (1998). Origins of Procellariidae Hunting in the Southwest Pacific. ''International Journal of Osteoarchaeology'' '''6'''(4): 403-410.&lt;/ref&gt;  These include the [[short-tailed shearwater]], also known as the yolla or [[Australian muttonbird]], in [[Bass Strait]], [[Tasmania]], as well as the [[sooty shearwater]], also known as the titi or New Zealand muttonbird, on several small islands known as the [[Muttonbird Islands]], scattered around  [[Stewart Island]] in the far south of New Zealand.
[[File:Mutton-bird-egging-chappell-island-1893-377736-medium.jpg|thumb|Mutton-bird Egging on Mount Chappell Island (1893)]]

==Australia==
Licensed commercial harvesting of short-tailed shearwater chicks on the coast and islands of Tasmania began in 1903, although it had long been a traditional form of subsistence harvesting by Tasmanian Aborigines and European settlers there.  However, by the late 20th century the industry was declining due to falling demand for the product and reduced interest by younger indigenous people in the main area of activity, the islands of the [[Furneaux Group]].&lt;ref name="Skira"&gt;Skira, I. (1996). "Aboriginal people and muttonbirding in Tasmania". In: M. Bomford &amp; J. Caughley (eds),''Sustainable use of wildlife by Aboriginal Peoples and Torres Strait Islanders'', Bureau of Resource Sciences: Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
The harvesting of sooty shearwater chicks on 36 islands, known as the [[Titi/Muttonbird Islands|Titi or Muttonbird Islands]], around [[Stewart Island/Rakiura|Rakiura]] (Stewart Island), is managed entirely by Rakiura [[Māori people|Māori]].  There is some evidence that this harvest has been occurring since at least the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Hawke2003&gt;Hawke, David; Newman, Jamie; Moller, Henrik; &amp; Wixon, John. (2003). A possible early muttonbirder’s fire on Poutama, a Rakiura titi island, New Zealand. ''Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand'' '''33'''(2): 497-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muttonbirds==
'''Muttonbird''' may refer to various [[seabird]]s, particularly [[petrel]]s in the genus ''[[Puffinus]]'', called [[shearwater]]s, where the young birds are harvested for food and oil by being extracted by hand from the nesting burrows before they fledge. Some species are:
* [[Short-tailed shearwater]], a seabird that nests in south-eastern Australia, particularly in the [[Furneaux Group]] of islands in eastern [[Bass Strait]]
* [[Sooty shearwater]], a seabird that nests mainly in [[New Zealand]] and islands in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* [[Wedge-tailed shearwater]], found throughout the tropical and subtropical parts of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s
* [[Manx shearwater]], breeding in the [[North Atlantic]] region, was harvested in historical times
* [[Cape Verde shearwater]], breeding in the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago of the Atlantic Ocean, has declined because of over-harvesting
* [[Grey-faced petrel]] (''Pterodroma gouldi'')
* [[Providence petrel]]s, harvested to extinction on [[Norfolk Island]] in the early 19th century but still existing on [[Lord Howe Island]], were known as 'muttonbirds' or 'flying sheep'

'''MyDeathSpace.com''' is a website devoted to connecting the deaths of [[social media]] website account-holders to their news obituaries. It is notable due to media attention that it garnered over the practice of seeking out dead [[MySpace]] users such as [[Taylor Behl]] and [[Anna Svidersky]].

It launched in January 2006, but did not receive national attention until March 2006. The site was started by Mike Patterson from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].

==Status==
Due to its rapid growth and popularity, MyDeathSpace has had problems with availability.  It was down for two weeks in November 2006 presenting viewers with the message "This IP address cannot be used for browsing." In December 2006, MyDeathSpace returned with the following explanation on the website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Wow, now that was quite an outage!  But what and why did it happen? Well, to put it in plain English, we outgrew our previous host.  We received no warnings from them; they simply shut our site down and sent us an email telling us how we've exceeded the capabilities of our hosting plan. However, they were kind enough to offer us an upgrade for a mere $250 a month EXTRA.  We declined. Since we were caught off guard, we had to scurry to find a host that could handle us and our users.  We were in negotiations with one hosting company for about a week, but at the last minute those plans fell through (expensive licensing issues). We attempted to use another host (which is why you saw the "coming soon" page for a few days).  This also fell through because; well... they just plain suck. We're hoping this will remain MyDeathSpace.com's new home for a while.  Happy surfing..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On July 30, 2007, the site was refusing web traffic, perhaps due to a surge in popularity following a profile on [[CNN]]'s website.  Since then, the site's popularity has declined dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The webmasters later posted a picture of the article on CNN.com and gave the following explanation:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"The Associated Press has written an article about MyDeathSpace.com, which has been picked up by ALL news sources effectively taking down MyDeathSpace.com. The traffic is causing the box to become completely unresponsive. Please stay tuned into this page for updates!!!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of August 12, 2007, the site was back online.

During 2011 the site again went down due to a reported "catastrophic hard-drive failure". The site has since come back online and is online as of April 8, 2018.

{{Nihongo|'''Mōri Takamoto'''|毛利 隆元|extra=1523 &amp;ndash; September 18, 1563}} was a ''[[daimyō]]'' (feudal lord) of [[Aki Province]] during Japan's [[Sengoku period]]. He was the eldest legitimate son of [[Mōri Motonari]].

==Life==
Born in [[Tajihi]], [[Aki Province]], Takamoto was sent at the age of 14 to [[Suō Province]] as a hostage of [[Ōuchi Yoshitaka]]. This was done to ensure his father's loyalties to Ōuchi. He was allowed to return home in 1540, three years later, to the Mōri castle of [[Yoshida Kōriyama castle|Yoshida Kōriyama]].

In 1555, [[Sue Harukata]], one of Ōuchi's vassals, staged a coup and forced Ōuchi Yoshitaka to [[seppuku|commit suicide]]. He was then attacked by Mōri Takamoto and his father, and was defeated in the [[battle of Miyajima]].&lt;ref name=Turnbull2&gt;{{Cite book |last=Turnbull |first=Stephen |title=The Samurai Sourcebook |publisher=Cassell &amp; Co. |year=1998 |ISBN=1854095234 |pp=213, 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mōri, defeating the Sue/Ōuchi forces, thus rose to power in the [[Chūgoku region]] (the western area of [[Honshū]]), and would remain a powerful and influential faction for much of the rest of the 16th century. Upon his father's retirement two years later, Takamoto inherited formal leadership of the family, but his father Motonari continued to wield actual control over the clan's affairs.

When [[Ōuchi Yoshinaga]] died that same year (1557), the Mōri saw an opportunity to seize the [[Ōuchi clan]] lands; they had to consider, however, the [[Ōtomo clan]] to the west and the [[Amago clan]] to the north who entertained similar ideas. Takamoto gained a considerable boost to his power, however, in 1560–1563, when he was appointed by ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshiteru]] as Governor (''[[shugo]]'') of Aki, [[Nagato Province|Nagato]], Suō and [[Bitchū Province]]s. [[Amago Haruhisa]] died suddenly in 1560, and [[Ōtomo Sōrin]] began to devote significant resources to attacking the Amago territory.

At the advice or orders of his father, Takamoto seized the opportunity to attack the Ōuchi territory. He was leading the Mōri armies through [[Bingo Province]] when, on September 18, 1563, he suddenly died of poisoned food at the age of 41 (or, the first day, ninth month, of the year [[Eiroku|Eiroku-6]], by the [[Japanese calendar]]). Historians have since identified [[Wachi Saneharu]], a local Bingo samurai, of committing the deed.

Mōri Motonari accused a number of samurai of conspiring in the assassination, and forced them to commit ''seppuku''. Takamoto's son [[Mōri Terumoto]] was selected as his heir, but Motonari continued to wield the true power.

'''Neural binding''' refers to the neuroscientific aspect of what is commonly known as the [[binding problem]]. The Binding Problem is an interdisciplinary term, named for the difficulty of creating a comprehensive and verifiable model for the [[unity of consciousness]]. "Binding" refers to the integration of highly diverse neural information in the forming of one's cohesive experience. The neural binding hypothesis states that neural signals are paired through synchronized [[Neural oscillation|oscillations]] of neuronal activity that combine and recombine to allow for a wide variety of responses to context-dependent [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. These dynamic [[biological neural networks|neural networks]] are thought to account for the flexibility and nuanced response of the brain to various situations.&lt;ref name="Senkowski 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Senkowski|first=D.|author2=T.R.

A viable mechanism for this phenomenon must address (1) the difficulties of reconciling the global nature of the participating ([[exogenous]]) signals and their relevant ([[endogenous]]) associations, (2) the interface between lower [[perceptual]] processes and higher [[cognitive]] processes, (3) the identification of signals (sometimes referred to as “tagging”) as they are processed and routed throughout the [[brain]], and (4) the emergence of a unity of [[consciousness]].

Proposed adaptive functions of neural binding have included the avoidance of [[hallucinatory]] phenomena generated by endogenous patterns alone as well as the avoidance of behavior driven by [[involuntary action]] alone.&lt;ref name="Rocha 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=da Rocha|first=A.F.|author2=A. Pereira Jr. | author3=F.A.B. Coutinho|title=N-methyl-D-aspartate channel and consciousness: from signal coincidence detection to quantum computing|journal=Progress in Neurobiology |date=October 2001 |volume=64|pages=555–573|issue=1|pmid=11311462 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(00)00069-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several difficulties that must be addressed in this model. First, it must provide a mechanism for the integration of signals across different brain regions (both [[cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] and [[subcortical]]). It must also be able to explain the simultaneous processing of unrelated signals that are held separate from one another and integrated signals that must be viewed as a whole.&lt;ref name="Senkowski 2008"/&gt;

== Interdisciplinary correlates ==
The study of the binding problem in [[neuroscience]] stems from the much older psychological study of the binding phenomenon, which has its roots in the ancient philosophical study of the same problems. Today, there is a close interplay between neuroscience and [[psychology]], which is especially relevant to neural binding.

=== Gestalt psychology and correlating critiques ===
[[File:Invariance.jpg|thumb|Representation of the multiple ways to perceive the same object]]
[[Gestalt psychology]] is a field that has been intertwined with neural binding due to its advances in conceptualizing how the brain views objects, reacts to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and then reacts on a global level. Since Gestalt Psychology has become so involved, “grouping” has become  an important part of understanding neural binding. The scientists that supported this theory were solely focused on the idea that mechanisms in the brain operated preattentively.

"Grouping" has become especially important for neural binding due to studies in [[gamma wave]] activity in the brain. From [[single-unit recording]] scientists have been able to measure the [[oscillatory]] neuronal activity and have been able to better their understanding of the grouping or pairing of neurons. Thus, these pairings connect with Gestalt psychology and its theory that objects are seen independently of their separate pieces, in a more global manner. A study done by Gray, Konig, Engel and Singer in 1989 reported that when studying [[visual cortex]] cells, light moving in opposite directions had low relation to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gray | first=Charles M. | last2=König | first2=Peter | last3=Engel | first3=Andreas K. | last4=Singer | first4=Wolf | title=Oscillatory responses in cat visual cortex exhibit inter-columnar synchronization which reflects global stimulus properties | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=338 | issue=6213 | year=1989 | issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/338334a0 | pages=334–337 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet when the light rays were then pointed in the same direction, the correlative relationship was stronger. A paper addressing this idea states, "Thus, correlated activity was only obtained when cells responded to different aspects of the same 'Gestalt'". Other  studies using [[EEG]]s from the human scalp also examined gamma wave activity, showing how stimuli seemed to be in accordance with preattentive binding.&lt;ref name="Muller and Elliot 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller|first=Hermann J.|author2=Mark A. Elliot|author3=Christoph S. Muller|author4=Axel Mecklinger|title=Neural Binding of Space and Time: An Introduction|journal=Visual Cognition|date=2001|volume=8|pages=273–285|doi=10.1080/13506280143000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To contrast this, another group of scientists (Treisman &amp; Gelade) believed that the mechanisms did not work preattentively. They postulated that in order to make correct bindings there had to be attention. Hence, they called their theory "attentional binding." The idea of attentional binding is that, as someone places their attention on an object with multiple features, they develop over time a coherent representation of that object and the characteristics that it holds. These characteristics, after being processed through attention, can be stored in [[short-term memory]] or as [[episodic memories]].&lt;ref name="Muller and Elliot 2001"/&gt;

One more contrast to Gestalt psychological emphasis in neural binding was brought up by L. Chen. Chen asserts that the local-global idea of Gestalt does not suffice in explaining neural processing. Instead, Chen uses the idea that perception depends on "[[topological]] invariants that describe the geometrical potentiality of the entire stimulus configuration". The idea here is that looking at a certain object creates a stimulus which in turn fires a constellation of that object, and then the object becomes recognized.&lt;ref name="Muller and Elliot 2001"/&gt;

The rebuttal to Chen's idea is that since each object has its own constellation, as well as its own particular set of neurons, there would not be enough space in the brain for all the appropriate neuronal pathways. This ratio of 1:1 simply could not support the many complex mechanisms of the human brain.

Later, more writings were produced regarding preattentive binding. Although they did not focus as much on Gestalt psychology, they were important to the idea of the preattentiveness of the brain. One such addition onto this theory was put out by Duncan and Humphreys. They said that some types of features, when trying to form the image, compete against one another for "the limited capacity object recognition stage". This means that certain parts of an object have multiple ways of being featured by the brain. Each different type of feature then competes with the others, trying to become the feature that is displayed to the individual. This can then account for the understanding of how each person views a whole object differently than another person. They also then see its global function on a very different scale.&lt;ref name="Muller and Elliot 2001"/&gt;

This idea of differential grouping is also brought up by Aksentijevic, Elliott, and Barber. Their theory is based on different perceptions of geometrical space that can then supply a "starting point for a systematic exploration of the subjective properties of certain classes of visual and auditory grouping phenomena, such as apparent motion, grouping within static two-dimensional displays and auditory streaming." This idea shows how different people perceive geometrical space, which can lead to different auditory and visual streams.&lt;ref name="Muller and Elliot 2001"/&gt;

== Proposed models ==

=== Temporal ===
[[File:QuantumHarmonicOscillatorAnimation.gif|thumb|Some trajectories of a harmonic oscillator. The [[Temporal Binding Hypothesis]] and other areas of neural binding use this idea to describe the pairing of two oscillating waves, forming an image.]]
The [[Temporal Binding Hypothesis]] has a history in neuroscience which spans back to at least the early 1980s. Christoph Von der Malsburg proposed that neurons carry two distinct signals, one of conventional rate code in relation to the ‘effectiveness’ of the feature it is encoding and another which is conveyed in terms of spike coordination between assemblies of neurons.&lt;ref name="von der Malsburg 1981"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Correlation Theory of Brain Function|last = von der Malsburg|first = C.|date = 1981|journal = MPI Biophysical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later [[Francis Crick]] &amp; [[Christof Koch]] developed the model further by explaining the synchronization of distant neurons by transient [[gamma wave]] oscillations being guided by attention.&lt;ref name="Crick &amp; Koch 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Framework for Consciousness|last = Crick |first = F. |author2= C. Koch |date = 1990|journal = Nature Neuroscience| pmid = 12555104 |doi=10.1038/nn0203-119 |volume=6 |pages=119–26|url=https://zenodo.org/record/852680}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, [[Francisco Varela]] had established the importance of the role of the oscillatory phase in the pairing of neuron assemblies.&lt;ref name="Varela 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Resonant cell assemblies: a new approach to cognitive functions and neuronal synchrony |last = Varela |first = FJ |date = 1995|journal = Biological Research|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temporal Binding Hypothesis was first proposed as a way of addressing the combinatorial problem of neural binding, which emphasizes the impossibly large number of connections that would have to be made between neurons of overlapping function and association in order to achieve the degree of observable complexity in neural binding. Modern models that are currently being developed often retain the structure of temporal synchrony due to this significant advantage as well as the strong experimental support for the existence of global brain oscillations.

==== Gamma band activity ====
[[File:Eeg gamma.svg|thumb|Gamma waves recorded from an [[EEG]]]]
It has been widely observed that distributed collections of neurons oscillate within the [[gamma wave|gamma band]] of frequencies (typically between 30–80&amp;nbsp;Hz)..

==== Phasic pairing mechanisms ====
Varela’s model describes the selection of cellular assemblies, sometimes referred to as resonant or reverberating ([[Rafael Lorente de Nó|Lorente de Nó]]) circuits, as being integrated into a larger ensemble by transient spike [[phase locking]]. This addresses the explanatory difficulty of the simultaneous nature of binding because it allows many signals to be in transit in parallel within an overlapping frequency range without [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]].

==== Criticism ====
The temporal binding models have been criticized by some for being  unwarranted in their far-reaching speculative nature.&lt;ref name="Shadlen &amp; Movshon 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shadlen|first=Michael N.|author2=J. Anthony Movshon|title=Synchrony Unbound: A Critical Evaluation of the Temporal Binding Hypothesis|journal=Neuron |date=September 1999 |volume=24|pages=67–77|pmid=10677027|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80822-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is usually made in favor of a more classical model of neural function.

=== Quantum models ===
[[File:Activated NMDAR.svg|thumb|The NMDA receptor acts as a coincidence detector that requires the binding of multiple [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] (e.g., [[glutamate]] and [[glycine]], as depicted here) for activation.]]
Some more recent models have incorporated [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] as a component of the underlying neural dynamics behind binding due to the strong explanatory power of [[quantum mechanics]] and their claim of the insufficiency of current models for explaining the complexity of the binding mechanism.

In 2001, da Rocha developed a model which utilized the basic structure of the Temporal Binding Hypothesis, with global [[phase synchronization]] being a primary mechanism of distributing information, but emphasized the importance of a [[quantum computation]] performed on a local level.&lt;ref name="Rocha 2001"/&gt; His model depicts the [[NMDA receptor]] as the coincidence detector proposed in other theories. This is a physiological mechanism which has been criticized for being absent from a full theory of temporal binding previously.&lt;ref name="Shadlen &amp; Movshon 1999"/&gt;

=== Non-synchronous models ===
Many non-temporal theories attempt to retain a more classical conception of neuron signaling based on [[hierarchy|hierarchical structures]]. This relies on the convergence of signals upon specific neural circuits as well as the dynamic routing of [[signaling pathways]] through specialized computational sub-assemblies.

These models can be vulnerable to the combinatorial and connectivity problems, which come as a natural consequence of depending solely on one-to-one communication of conventional information via [[neural coding|spike rate coding]]. These models also require the seamless directing and combining of signals, which either assumes a controller (proposed to be the [[pulvinar nuclei]]&lt;ref name="Olshausen 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olshausen |first=B.A. |author2=C. H.Anderson |title=A Neurobiological Model of Visual Attention and Invariant Pattern Recognition Based on Dynamic Routing of Information |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |date=November 1993 |volume= 13| pages= 4700–4719}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or a mechanism for the spontaneous [[self-assembly]] of neural ensembles.

== Test cases ==

=== Sensory ===
Much of the experimental evidence for neural binding has traditionally revolved around sensory awareness. Sensory awareness is accomplished by integrating things together by cognitively perceiving them and then segmenting them so that, in total, there is an image created. Since there can be an infinite number of possibilities in the perception of an object, this has been a unique area of study. The way the brain then collectively pieces certain things together via networking is important not only in the global way of perceiving but also in segmentation. Much of sensory awareness has to do with the taking of a single piece of an object's makeup and then binding its total characteristics so that the brain perceives the object in its final form. Much of the research for the understanding of segmentation and how the brain perceives an object has been done by studying cats. A major  finding of this research has to do with the understanding of [[gamma waves]] oscillating at 40&amp;nbsp;Hz. The information was extracted from a study using the cat visual cortex. It was shown that the cortical neurons responded differently to spatially different objects. These firings of neurons ranged from 40–60&amp;nbsp;Hz in measure and when observed showed that they fired synchronously when observing different parts of the object. Such coherent responses point to the fact that the brain is doing a kind of coding where it is piecing certain neurons together in the works of making the form of an object. Since the brain is putting these segmented pieces together unsupervised, a significant consonance is found with many philosophers (like [[Sigmund Freud]]) who theorize an underlying [[subconscious]] that helps to form every aspect of our conscious thought processes.&lt;ref name="Engel and Fries 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=Andreas K.|author2=Pascal Fries|author3=Peter Konig|author4=Michael Brecht|author5=Wolf Singer|title=Temporal Binding, Binocular Rivalry, and Consciousness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1999|volume=8|pages=128–151|doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0389}}&lt;/ref&gt;            	

In order for these multiple firings from multiple areas to be combined into a specific extrinsic event, there must be help from the [[dorsal thalamus]]. It is not proven whether the dorsal thalamus is the primary organizer, but it does fit the specific profile for collecting neuronal activity and rapidly coordinating between what is happening in the brain and outside of it. The space in and around the dorsal thalamus, the thalomocortical area, is able to generate fast voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations which allow it to react quickly to received messages. The types of channels that cover this area are presumed to be [[GABAergic]]. Since sensory awareness needs to be quick, the threshold for [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] in this area is quite low.&lt;ref name="Engel and Fries 1999"/&gt;

=== Cognitive ===
[[Francis Crick]] and [[Christof Koch]] proposed that specific neural activity can stimulate short-term memory, forming a continuous and dynamic consciousness.

Cognitive binding is associated with the different states of human [[consciousness]]. Two of the most studied states of consciousness are the [[wakefulness]] and [[REM sleep]]. There have been multiple studies showing, electrophysiologically, that these two states are quite similar in nature. This has led some neural binding theorists to study the modes of cognitive awareness in each state. Certain observations have even led these scientists to hypothesize that since there is little cognition going on during REM sleep, the increased thalamocortical responses show the action of processing in the waking preconscious.&lt;ref name="Pare and Llinas 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pare|first=Denis|author2=Rodolfo Llinas|title= Conscious and Pre-conscious Processes as Seen From the Standpoint of Sleep-Waking Cycle Neurophysiology|journal=Neuropsychologia|date= November 1994|volume=33|pages=1155–1164|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(95)00055-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
            	
The [[thalamus]] and [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] are important anatomical features in cognitive and sensory awareness. The understanding of how these neurons fire and relate to one other in each of these states (REM and Waking) is paramount to understanding awareness and its relation to neural binding.
            	
In the waking state, neuronal activity in animals is subject to changes based on the current environment. Changes in environment act as a form of stress on the brain so that when sensory neurons are then fired synchronously, they acclimate to the new state. This new state can then be moved to the [[hippocampus]] where it can be stored for later use. In the words of James Newman and [[Anthony A. Grace]] in their article, "Binding Across Time" this idea is put forth: "The hippocampus is the primary recipient of inferotemporal outputs and is known to be the substrate for the consolidation of working memories to long term, [[episodic memories]]."&lt;ref name="Newman and Grace 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newman|first=Newman|author2=Anthony A. Grace|title=Binding Across Time: The Selective Gating of Frontal and Hippocampal Systems Modulating Working Memory and Attentional States|date=1999|volume=8|pages=196–212|doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0392|journal=Consciousness and Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
            	
The logging of "episodes" is then used for "streaming", which can mediate by the selective gating of certain information reentering sensory awareness. Streaming and building of episodic memories would not be possible if neural binding did not unconsciously connect the two synchronous oscillations.
            	
The pairing of these oscillations can then help input the correct sensory material. If these paired oscillations are not new, then cognitively these firings will be easily understood. If there are new firings, the brain will have to acclimate to the new understanding.&lt;ref name="Newman and Grace 1999"/&gt;
            	
In REM sleep, the only extreme difference from the waking state is that the brain does not have the actual waking amount of sensory firings, so cognitively, there is not as much awareness here, although the activity of the "brain’s eye" is still quite significant and very similar to the waking state. Studies have shown that during sleep there are still 40&amp;nbsp;Hz Oscillation firings. These firings are due to the perceived stimuli happening in dreams. "&lt;ref name="Newman and Grace 1999"/&gt;

=== Learning/memory ===
Opitz argues that the binding of different brain areas is mediated by the [[hippocampus]]. Relational bindings, or relationships between separate objects, concepts, and memories, are very flexible because the targets can be combined in so many different ways to deal with the present situation, and the hippocampus ensures that these parts are arranged into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name="Opitz 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Opitz |first=Bertram |title=Neural Binding Mechanisms in Learning and Memory |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=2010 |volume=34 |pages= 1036–1046 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the hippocampus has been implicated in binding that is involved with [[episodic memory]], [[working memory]], and [[language acquisition]]. According to Opitz, this is viable because the hippocampus meets all criteria to be suitable for the regulation relational binding and, based on its patterns of activity, it is likely that it is involved.

== Clinical implications ==

=== Autism ===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.]]
Several researchers have suggested a clinical link between difficulties in neural binding and [[autism spectrum]] disorders.&lt;ref name="Brock 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock |first=J.| author2= C.C. Brown| author3= J. Boucher |author4= G. Rippon |title=The temporal binding deficit hypothesis of autism |journal=Development and Psychopathology |date=2002 |volume=14 |pages= 209–224 |doi=10.1017/s0954579402002018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been postulated that there is a level of underconnectivity between certain areas of the autistic brain, specifically those areas that involve [[social cognition]]. They also hypothesize that there may be overconnectivity within certain neuronal cell assemblies. Researchers have suggested that these issues with coherence of neural networks give rise to the hallmark autistic symptoms, namely, impaired social cognition/interactions and repetitive behaviors.

There is one major piece of evidence suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, and this could cause problems in the development of cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early overdevelopment may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. [[Diffusion tensor imaging]] studies of autistic brains are consistent with this idea, as they show reduced myelination (see:[[Myelin]]) in the areas of the brain that deal with [[social cognition]] and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may be thinking. This provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[File:Artistic view of how the world feels like with schizophrenia - journal.pmed.0020146.g001.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait of a person with schizophrenia, representing that individual's perception of the distorted experience of reality in the disorder]]
It is also possible that problems with binding give way to the fractured mental state that is characteristic of [[schizophrenia]]. Schizophrenic patients experience a “disintegration of consciousness” which involves hallucinations, delusions, and generally disordered thinking. It is hypothesized that this mental disorganization is caused by underlying neural disorganization due to disordered binding, which is then further complicated by the occurrence of complex mental processes in this disordered state.&lt;ref name="Bob 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bob |first=Petr |title=Consciousness, schizophrenia, and complexity |journal=Cognitive Systems Research |date=2012 |volume=13 |pages=87–94 |doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can essentially be viewed as a pathological rise in the neural complexity of the brain. The dissociative symptoms and disorganized speech associated with schizophrenia are consistent with this idea. It is also possible that disordered binding between the regulatory mechanisms of the brain gives rise to a lack of synchronized activation of its neural networks.

=== Anesthesia ===
A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying consciousness on the [[biochemical]] level has practical implications which extend to the development of more effective and reliable [[anesthetics]].&lt;ref name="Rocha 2001"/&gt; This method is especially useful for the study of consciousness because of anesthetic's well-known ability to elicit unconsciousness. This often happens in a single moment, giving the impression of a collapse of conscious coherence. [[Stuart Hameroff]] is a notable anesthesiologist who promotes this method in the development of a science of consciousness.

'''Neuronetics''' is a publicly traded company developing non-invasive treatments for [[Clinical depression|depression]] and other chronic psychiatric and neurological disorders based upon [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]] technology.

On September 1, 2010, the [[World Economic Forum]] announced the company as a [[World Economic Forum#Technology Pioneers Programme|Technology Pioneer]] for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/en/media/Latest%20News%20Releases/NR_TP2011 Thirty-One Visionary Companies Selected as Technology Pioneers 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Neuronetics' first product, the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System is designed to non-invasively stimulate the brain using highly focused [[MRI]]-strength magnetic pulses, or [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS).  NeuroStar delivers therapy that is highly targeted, involving a brain region that is thought to be involved in depression.  NeuroStar TMS Therapy is prescribed by a [[psychiatrist]] and is delivered in an outpatient setting.  The patient sits in the chair and undergoes 40-minute sessions over the course of four to six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Aaron|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/26/news/companies/neuronetics/index.htm |title=FDA to consider depression-fighting machine: NeuroStar machine could compete with antidepressant drug industry, if it wins FDA approval|work=[http://money.cnn.com/ CNNMoney.com]|publisher=[[CNN|Cable News Network]]. A Time Warner Company|date=2007-01-26|accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA Actions===

In January 2007 an advisory panel of the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that a TMS device had a good safety profile but had failed to demonstrate that it was effective for the treatment of depression in patients with a range of 1-4 prior antidepressant treatment failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] | last = Scudiero | first = JL | url = http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/NeurologicalDevicesPanel/ucm124779.htm | title = Brief Summary From the Neurological Devices Panel Meeting - January 26, 2007| accessdate = 2010-07-14 | date = 2007-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, based on the safety and efficacy of rTMS in patients with major depression who failed to benefit from 1 prior antidepressant medication, the FDA cleared the TMS device for marketing.  The rTMS device was cleared by the FDA De Novo process whereby the device was reclassified to Class II based on safety and efficacy in the indicated population and therefore not subject to premarket approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''pacarana''' (''Dinomys branickii'') is a rare and slow-moving [[Hystricognathi|hystricognath]] [[rodent]] indigenous to South America. Native peoples of the region {{Who|date=October 2009}} call it the ''pacarana'' (false paca) because it is superficially similar to the [[paca]], a different rodent which is not in the same family. The pacarana has a chunky body and is large for a rodent, weighing up to {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measuring up to {{convert|79|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, not including the thick, furry tail.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The pacarana is [[nocturnal]] and is found only in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s of the western [[Amazon Basin|Amazon River basin]] and adjacent foothills of the [[Andes]] Mountains. It ranges from northwestern [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] to western [[Bolivia]], including the [[Yungas]]. It is common in [[Cotapata National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area|Cotapata National Park]] in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

The pacarana is the [[monotypic|sole extant member]] of the rodent family [[Dinomyidae]] in the [[Order (biology)|infraorder]] [[Caviomorpha]]; the paca that it resembles in appearance is in a different Caviomorph family, the [[Cuniculidae]]. Initially, the pacarana was regarded as a member of the superfamily [[Muroidea]], that includes the true mice, but that view was abandoned in the face of evidence that suggests that the pacarana is in the family Dinomyidae together with extinct animals such as ''[[Phoberomys pattersoni]]'' and ''[[Josephoartigasia monesi]]'', prehistoric giant rodents that lived in South America several million years ago.

Pacaranas typically are found in family groups of four or five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saavedra-Rodríguez|first=Carlos A.|title=Multiscale patterns of habitat and space use by the pacarana ''Dinomys branickii'': factors limiting its distribution and abundance|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/esr_oa/n016p273.pdf|publisher=Inter-Research 2012|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==
[[File:Paul Klee WI (In Memoriam) 1938.jpg|thumb|An abstract painting of a person by [[Paul Klee]]. The concept of a person can be very challenging to define.]]
{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bundle theory]] of self,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} continuity of personality after the death of the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of post-mortal personhood, see Roth, S. (2013) ''Dying is only human. The case death makes for the immortality of the person''. Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 35-39. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2260793]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10633">{{Neologism|date=February 2015}}'''Phenoptosis''' (pheno – showing or demonstrating, ptosis – programmed death), designated by V.P. Skulachev in 1999, signifies the phenomenon of programmed [[death]] of an [[organism]], i.e. that an organism's [[genes]] include features that under certain circumstances will cause the organism to rapidly degenerate and die off. Recently this has been referred to as "fast phenoptosis" as aging is being explored as "slow phenoptosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skulachev|first=V.P.|title=Organism’s Aging is a Special Biological Function Rather than a Result of Breakdown of a Complex Biological System: Biochemical Support of Weismann’s Hypothesis|journal=Biokhimiya|date=November 1997|volume=62|issue=12|pages=1191–1195|pmid=9467841}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenoptosis is a common feature of living [[species]], whose ramifications for humans is still being explored.

==Evolutionary significance==
Inside of our bodies, worn-out, ineffective cells are dismantled and recycled for the greater good of the whole organism. This is a process called [[apoptosis]]. It is believed that phenoptosis is an [[evolution|evolutionary mechanism]] that culls out the damaged, aged, infectious, or those in direct competition with their own offspring&lt;ref name=weissman&gt;{{cite book|last=Weismann|first=A|title=Essays upon Heredity and Kindred Bio_|year=1889|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|isbn=1172574987|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the good of the species.  The elimination of parts detrimental to the organism or individuals detrimental to the species has been deemed "The samurai law of biology" – it is better to die than to be wrong.&lt;ref name=Skulachev_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skulachev|first=VP|title=Programmed death phenomena: from organelle to organism.|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|date=Apr 2002|issue=|pages=214–237|pmid=11976198|volume=959|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb02095.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Stress-induced, acute, or fast phenoptosis''' is the rapid deterioration of an organism induced by a life event such as breeding. Elimination of the parent provides space for fitter offspring. As a species this has been advantageous particularly to species that die immediately after spawning.&lt;ref name=weissman /&gt;  
'''Age-induced, soft, or slow phenoptosis''' is the slow deterioration and death of an organism due to accumulated stresses over long periods of time. In short, it has been proposed that aging, heart disease, cancer, and other age related ailments are means of phenoptosis. "Death caused by aging clears the population of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful traits."&lt;ref name=Skulachev_2002 /&gt; It has also been proposed that age provides a selective advantage to brains over brawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skulachev|first=VP|title=Aging as a particular case of phenoptosis, the programmed death of an organism (A response to Kirkwood and Melov "On the programmed/non-programmed nature of ageing within the life history")|journal=Aging|date=November 2011|volume=3|issue=11|pages=1120–1123|pmc=3249457|pmid=22146104}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example made by V. P. Skulachev provides that of two hares, one faster and one smarter, the faster hare may have a selective advantage in youth but as aging occurs and muscles deteriorate it is the smarter hare that now has the selective advantage.

[[Amoeba]]  '''''[[Dictyostelium]]''''' – Under stress amoeba form multicellular [[Fruiting body (disambiguation)|fruiting bodies]].

[[Septic shock]] – Severe infection by [[pathogen]]s often results in death by [[sepsis]]. Sepsis, however, is not a result of [[toxin]]s activated by the pathogen, rather it is directed by the organism itself.

==Examples in humans==
[[Vascular disease]], [[menopause]], [[cancer]], and [[osteoarthritis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yun|first=A|author2=Lee, P. |author3=Doux, J. |journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=2006|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1079–1085|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.02.026|title=Osteoarthritis: An example of phenoptosis through autonomic dysfunction?|pmid=16580787}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been suggested to be means of human phenoptosis. Phenoptosis has recently been heavily studied in the hopes of increasing human longevity. By understanding the mechanisms of slow phenoptosis we may be able to halt or even reverse the processes that cause our aging and eventual deaths.

==Proposed mechanisms==
Mitochondrial ROS – The production of [[reactive oxygen species|ROS]] by the mitochondria. This causes [[oxidative damage]] to the [[Inner mitochondrial membrane|inner compartment]] of the [[mitochondria]] and destruction of the mitochondria.&lt;ref name=Skulachev_1999 /&gt;

[[Clk1]] gene – the gene thought to be responsible to aging due to mitochondrial ROS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=X|author2=Jiang, N. |author3=Bigras, E. |author4=Shoubridge, E. |author5=Hekimi, S. |title=Evolutionary conservation of the clk-1-dependent mechanism of longevity: loss of mclk1 increases cellular fitness and lifespan in mice.|journal=Genes Dev|date=15 Oct 2005|volume=19|issue=20|pages=2424–34|pmid=16195414|doi=10.1101/gad.1352905|pmc=1257397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EF2 kinase]] – Blocks [[phosphorylation]] of [[elongation factor 2]] thus blocking protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holley|first=CL|author2=Michael R. Olson |author3=Daniel A.

[[Glucocorticoid]] [[regulation]] – A common route for phenoptosis is breakdown of glucocorticoid regulation and inhibition, leading to massive excess of these [[corticosteroids]] in the body.&lt;ref name=Skulachev_2002 /&gt;

==Other examples==
[[Robert Sapolsky]] discusses phenoptosis in his book ''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'', 3rd Ed., p.&amp;nbsp;245-247. He states that:
:"If you catch salmon right after they [[spawn (biology)|spawn]]... you find they have huge [[adrenal gland]]s, [[peptic ulcer]]s, and [[kidney]] [[lesion]]s, their [[immune system]]s have collapsed... [and they] have stupendously high glucocorticoid concentrations in their bloodstreams. When salmon spawn, regulation of their glucocortocoid secretion breaks down... But is the glucocorticoid excess really responsible for their death? Yup. Take a salmon right after spawning, remove its adrenals, and it will live for a year afterward.

:"The bizarre thing is that this sequence... not only occurs in five species of salmon, but also among a dozen species of [[Australia]]n [[Dasyuridae|marsupial mice]]... Pacific salmon and marsupial mice are not close relatives. At least twice in evolutionary history, completely independently, two very different sets of species have come up with the identical trick: if you want to degenerate very fast, secrete a ton of [[glucocorticoid]]s."

'''Princess Luise Dorothea of Prussia''' (Luise Dorothea Sophie; 29 September 1680 &amp;ndash; 23 December 1705) was Hereditary Princess of Hesse-Kassel by marriage to [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Kassel]]. She was the daughter of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia|First King in Prussia]] by his first wife [[Elisabeth Henriette of Hesse-Kassel]]. She died in childbirth.

==Biography==
{{House of Hohenzollern (Prussia)|frederick1}}
On 31 May 1700, she married her first cousin [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Kassel]]. Frederick was King of Sweden 1720-1751 and [[Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] from 1730-1751.

Luise Dorothea was married in Berlin 31 May 1700 in a grand ceremony which took place during several weeks to great costs. [[Conrad Mel]] wrote ''Font Legatio orientalis'' at the occasion.
During her five years of marriage, Luise Dorothea suffered from poor health. She died in childbirth. 

Frederick remarried to [[Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden]], becoming her prince consort and eventual King regnant of Sweden.

'''Richard James "Richey" Edwards''' (22 December 1967 &amp;ndash; disappeared 1 February 1995) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[musician]] who was the lyricist and [[rhythm guitarist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]]. He was known for his dark, politicised and intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character, has assured him [[Cult following|cult status]], as well as having been cited by some as a leading lyricist of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, Paul, "[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/nov/27/manic-street-preachers/ The Manics' Lyrics Were Something Special]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clash Music, "[http://www.clashmusic.com/news/manics-member-officially-dead/ Manics Member Officially Dead]", ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash Music]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Richey Edwards (often referred to during his years with Manic Street Preachers as '''Richey James''') was born and raised in [[Blackwood, Caerphilly|Blackwood]], [[Caerphilly]], [[Wales]]. He has one younger sister, Rachel, who was born in 1969. Edwards attended [[Oakdale Comprehensive School]]. From 1986 to 1989, Edwards attended [[University of Wales, Swansea]] and graduated with a 2:1 [[academic degree|degree]] in political history.

Edwards was initially a driver and roadie for [[Manic Street Preachers]], but he soon became accepted as the band's main spokesman and fourth member. Edwards showed little musical talent—his real contribution to the band was in their lyrics and design. He frequently [[mime artist|mimed]] playing the guitar during early live performances, but was, along with [[bassist]] [[Nicky Wire]], principal lyricist. Edwards is said to have written approximately 80% of the lyrics on their third album, ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|last2=Bellos | first2=Alex|date=26 January 1996| title=Sweet Exile|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| publication-place=London| pages=T.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are credited on all songs written before Edwards' disappearance, with Edwards receiving sole credit on three tracks from the 1996 album ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'', and co-writing credits on another two.

Despite Edwards' lack of musical input, he nevertheless contributed to their overall musical direction, and according to the rest of the band on the ''Everything Must Go'' DVD, he played a leading role in deciding the approach of the band's sound. Edwards expressed a desire to create a [[concept album]] described as "[[Pantera]] meets [[Nine Inch Nails]] meets ''[[Screamadelica]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Bailie, Stuart. "The Art of Falling Apart". ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' (February 2002) .p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bradfield has since expressed doubts over whether the band would have produced such an album: "I was worried that as chief tune-smith in the band I wasn't actually going to be able to write things that he would have liked. There would have been an impasse in the band for the first time born out of taste..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claire | last=Hill | page=7 | title=Manics frontman talks of artistic differences with missing Richey | date=3 November 2006|publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] ([[Cardiff]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Maconie|Maconie, Stuart]] "Everything Must Grow Up" ''[[Q Magazine]]'' October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=O'Connor, Rob (Producer &amp; Director), [[James Dean Bradfield|Bradfield, James Dean]] (interviewee), [[Sean Moore (musician)|Moore, Sean]] (interviewee), [[Nicky Wire|Wire, Nicky]] (interviewee)|title=The Making of Everything Must Go|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Sony BMG]]|date=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richeyedwards1.jpg|thumb|alt=|left|150px|Edwards with 4 Real carved into his arm. The ''[[NME]]'' discussion as to whether to publish this image was a bonus track on "[[Suicide Is Painless#Manic Street Preachers version|Suicide Is Painless]]".]]
On 15 May 1991, Edwards gained notoriety following an argument with ''[[NME]]'' journalist [[Steve Lamacq]], who questioned the band's authenticity and values, keen to ensure the [[punk rock|punk]] ethic was not abused, after a gig at the [[Norwich Arts Centre]]. Lamacq asked of Edwards' seriousness towards his art, and Edwards responded by carving the words "4 Real" into his forearm with a razor blade he was carrying.&lt;ref name="jinman7"&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Jinman | page=7 | title=Fans keep hopes alive for missing Manic | date=1 February 2005|publisher=The Guardian | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1402938,00.html|accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury required eighteen stitches.

[[The Daily Mail]], 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and was open about it in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Richard (1995) Seduced and Abandoned: Essays on Gay Men and Popular Music, London: Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt; He also [[self-harm]]ed, mainly through stubbing cigarettes on his body, and cutting himself: "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All the little things that might have been annoying me suddenly seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain. I'm not a person who can scream and shout so this is my only outlet. It's all done very logically.".&lt;ref name="bbcwales" /&gt; After the release of ''The Holy Bible'', he checked into [[Priory Group|The Priory]] psychiatric hospital, missing out on some of the promotional work for the album and forcing the band to appear as a three piece at the [[Reading and Leeds Festival|Reading Festival]] and [[T in the Park]].

Following release from the Priory, Manic Street Preachers [[concert tour|toured]] Europe as a four-piece band with [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Therapy?]] for what was to be the last time. Edwards' final live appearance with the band was at the [[London Astoria]], on 21 December 1994. The concert ended with the band infamously smashing their equipment and damaging the lighting system, prompted by Edwards' violent destruction of his guitar towards the end of set closer "[[You Love Us]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Boden | first =Sarah | title =25 of the greatest gigs ever (part 2) | newspaper =[[The Observer]] | page =41 | date =21 January 2007 | url =http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1992240,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995, on the day when he and [[James Dean Bradfield]] were due to fly to the [[United States]] on a promotional tour.&lt;ref name="Price 1999, pp. 177-178"&gt;Price (1999), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew £200 a day from his bank account, which totalled £2,800 by the day of the scheduled flight. Some speculated that he needed the money for the U.S. trip, and it was also mentioned he'd ordered a new desk for his flat from a shop in [[Cardiff]]. However, there was no record of the desk having been paid for, and this would have explained only half of the money withdrawn.&lt;ref name="IOS"&gt;{{cite news | first=Andy | last=Beckett | pages= | title=Missing street preacher | date=2 March 1997 | publisher=The Independent on Sunday | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/missing-street-preacher-1270691.html | accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price (1999), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Emma Forrest]], as quoted in ''A Version Of Reason'', "the night before he disappeared Edwards gave a friend a book called ''[[Novel with Cocaine]]'', instructing her to read the introduction, which details the author staying in a mental asylum before vanishing." Whilst staying at the Embassy Hotel in [[Bayswater Road]], [[London]], according to [[Rob Jovanovic]]'s biography, Edwards removed some books and videos from his bag. Among them included a copy of the play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]''. Edwards wrapped them carefully in a box with a note that said "I love you", then decorated the box like a birthday present and decorated the outside of it with collages and literary quotations. These included a picture of a Germanic-looking house and [[Bugs Bunny]]. The package was addressed to a "Jo".

The next morning, Edwards collected his wallet, car keys, some [[Prozac]] and his passport. He checked out of the hotel at 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., leaving his toiletries, packed suitcase, and some of his Prozac. He then drove to his apartment in Cardiff.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price 1999, p. 179"&gt;Price (1999), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In the two weeks that followed, Edwards was apparently spotted in the [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] passport office&lt;ref&gt;Price (1999), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Newport bus station]] by a fan who was unaware that he was [[missing person|missing]]. The fan discussed a mutual friend, Lori Fidler, before Edwards departed.&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SP180"&gt;Price (1999), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel, and drove him around the valleys, including Edwards' hometown of Blackwood. The driver reported that the passenger had spoken in a [[Cockney]] accent, which occasionally slipped into a [[Welsh English|Welsh]] one, and that he had asked if he could lie down on the back seat. Eventually they reached Blackwood and the bus station, but the passenger reportedly said "this is not the place", and asked to be taken to [[Pontypool and New Inn railway station|Pontypool railway station]]. It was later ascertained, according to Jovanovic's account, that Pontypool did not have a telephone. The passenger got out at the [[Severn View services|Severn View service station]] near [[Aust]], [[South Gloucestershire]] and paid the £68 fare in cash.&lt;ref name="Price 1999, p. 179"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alex | last=Bellos | pages=T.010 | title=Music: Desperately seeking Richey | date=26 January 1996|publisher=The Guardian | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February, Edwards' [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station, and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be dead, with evidence that the car had been lived in.&lt;ref name="Price 1999, pp. 177-178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IOS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =BBC staff reporter | title=Ten-year tragedy of missing Manic | date=1 February 2005|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4210451.stm|accessdate=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the service station's proximity to the [[Severn Bridge]], a known [[List of suicide sites|suicide site]],&lt;ref&gt;Pidd, Helen. "[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/29/richey-edwards-manic-street-preachers Richey Edwards case closed: how 14 years of hope ended]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 29 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; it was widely believed that Edwards had taken his own life by jumping from the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14264609 |title=Amy Winehouse joins iconic stars who died aged 27|date=25 July 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who knew Edwards, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he himself was quoted in 1994 as saying, "In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richeyedwards.net/index.html |title=The Last of Richey Edwards? |publisher=Richeyedwards.net |date= |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Edwards has reportedly been spotted in a [[Market (place)|market]] in [[Goa]], [[India]], and on the islands of [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]]. There have been other alleged sightings of Edwards, especially in the years immediately following his disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Caroline | last=Sullivan | title=The lost boys | date=28 January 2000 | publisher=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,239956,00.html |accessdate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these have proved conclusive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Wills | page=62 | title=Is Richey the wild rebel of rock alive or dead? | date=2 June 1996 | publisher=[[The Sunday Mirror]] | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and none have been confirmed by investigators.&lt;ref name="SH"&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen P. | last=Helan | page=10 | title=Living With Ghosts | date=30 January 2005|publisher=[[Sunday Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price (1999), pp. 183–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation itself has received criticism. In his 1999 book ''Everything (A Book About Manic Street Preachers)'', [[Simon Price]] states that aspects of the investigation were "far from satisfactory." He asserts the police may not have taken Edwards' mental state into account when prioritising his disappearance, and also records Edwards' sister Rachel as having "hit out at police handling" after [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage was analysed two years after Edwards vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1999), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Price records a member of the investigation team as stating "that the idea that you could identify somebody from that is arrant nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Price (1999), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; While his family had the option of [[declared death in absentia|declaring him legally dead]] from 2002 onwards, they chose not to for many years, and his status remained open as a missing person&lt;ref name="jinman7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; until 23 November 2008, when he became officially "presumed dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =BBC staff reporter | title=Missing guitarist 'presumed dead' | date=24 November 2008|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7745273.stm|accessdate=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cartwright | first = Garth | title = Obituary: Richey Edwards | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 26 November 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/26/richey-edwards-manic-street-preachers | accessdate = 30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan identification===
Edwards' disappearance attracted a great deal of media attention. [[Caitlin Moran]], writing in ''[[The Times]]'', commented that Edwards became "a [[cause celebre]] among depressives, [[alcoholism|alcoholics]], [[anorexia|anorexics]] and self-mutilators, because he was the first person in the public eye to talk openly about these subjects, not with swaggering bravado and a subtext of 'look how tortured and cool I am', but with humility, sense and, often, bleak humour."&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;"Cries that won't go away" ''The Times'' (London); 21 April 1995; Caitlin Moran; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Moran dismissed the news agenda of the mainstream media, which was geared towards the idea that Edwards inspired copycat actions in fans. Pointing towards the edition of 8 April 1995 of ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Moran wrote of her distaste of the media treatment: "Arms were flung aloft and tongues tutted two weeks back, when the first anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide coincided with the two-month anniversary of Manic Street Preacher Richey Edwards' disappearance, and ''Melody Maker'' instigated a debate on escalating teenage depression, self-mutilation and suicide."&lt;ref name="moran" /&gt; The magazine had received a number of letters from fans distressed at both the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] and the disappearance of Edwards. The 8 April edition saw the publication assemble a panel of readers to discuss the issues related to both cases. Moran argued "that Cobain's actions and, to a greater extent, Richey Edwards's actions, have legitimised debate on these subjects".&lt;ref name="moran" /&gt;

The 8 April issue was released in conjunction with the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]],&lt;ref&gt;"Pop paper responds to fans' cry of grief;Melody Maker" ''The Times'' (London); 22 March 1995; Dalya Alberge; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; with the then-editor Allan Jones placing the inspiration for the special nature of the issue firmly in the hands of the readers: "Every week the mailbag is just full of these letters. Richey's predicament seems to be emblematic of what a lot of people are going through."&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;"Is this music to die for? When the postbag at Melody Maker is opened these days, out pours a bleak litany of angst and agony. Andrew Smith looks at the dangerous, unprecedented trend of young pop music fans identifying closely with the torment of their heroes" ''The Guardian''; 31 March 1995; ANDREW SMITH; p. T.002&lt;/ref&gt; Jones saw the debate as focusing on the notion of whether "our rock stars are more vulnerable these days, and is that vulnerability a reflection of the vulnerability of their audience? And if so, why?"&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;

== Literature and other cultural influences ==
As well as an interest in music, Edwards displayed a love for literature. He chose many of the quotes that appear on Manics record sleeves and would often refer to writers and poets during interviews. This interest in literature has remained integral to the band's music and lyrics. [[Albert Camus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article403174.ece |work=The Times |date=17 December 2004 |title=Grow up, for Pete's sake |first=Caitlin |last=Moran |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Larkin]], [[Yukio Mishima]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]] are known to have been among his favourite authors. In a dressing room interview, he also mentioned admiration for [[Primo Levi]]. Edwards' lyrics have often been of a highly poetic nature and at times they reflected his knowledge of political history.

==Books about Edwards==
In 2009, Jovanovic's book ''A Version of Reason: The Search for Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers'' was published. The book was written with the goal of providing an authoritative factual account, pieced together through testimonials from those close to Edwards before his disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rob Jovanovic - A Version of Reason - Orion Publishing Group|url = https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409111290|website = Orion Publishing Group|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel by [[Ben Myers]], entitled ''[[Richard: A Novel]]'', was published on 1 October 2010 through Picador. ''Richard'' purports to be a fictionalised account of Edwards' life "as he might have told it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__sfm4IhHV9s/S2lJ4P2lxOI/AAAAAAAAAYI/QnrFwqwpHsI/s1600-h/January+2010+032.jpg |title=January+2010+032.jpg (image) |publisher=1.bp.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 novel by [[Guy Mankowski]], entitled ''[[How I Left The National Grid]],'' was heavily informed by Edwards and his disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Lukes |url= http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/archives-pain-holy-bible/|title= Archives Of Pain |publisher=3am Magazine |date=14 May 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesLukes2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rhian E.

In 2011, Scottish band Coholic featured a song about Edwards entitled "Escape Artist" on their debut album ''Blue Volt and the Noise''.

'''SS ''D.M. Clemson''''' was a {{convert|468|ft|m|adj=on}} long steel-hulled [[Great Lakes freighter]] that went missing on 1 December 1908, on [[Lake Superior]]. The ship was last seen coming through the [[Soo Locks]], onto Lake Superior. The ship was built in 1903 for the Provident Steamship Company. She is known for sinking on Lake Superior, on the night of 1 December 1908 with all hands; 24 men lost their lives. The wreck of ''D.M. Clemson'' is still missing, and the cause of her sinking remains a mystery to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |website=Maritime History of the Great Lakes
 |access-date=7 January 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible cause of the sinking==

Frederick Stonehouse (a historian and author) discussed the disappearance of the ''Clemson'' in his book "Went Missing". According to Stonehouse the ''Clemson'' suffered some structural damage when she struck a lighthouse pier at [[Ashtabula, Ohio]] on October 20, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://www.shipwreckmuseum.com/underwater-research/cyprus/
 |title=Cyprus
 |website=Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum
 |access-date=7 January 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident damaged 10 hull plates and a water tank on the 
starboard side. Temporary repairs were made until the ''Clemson'' went into layup for the winter of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://perdurabo10.tripod.com/ships/id95.html
 |title=Mystery ship D.M. Clemson
 |website=perdurabo10.tripod.com
 |access-date=7 January 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that the Clemson's wooden hatch covers failed causing water to leak into the cargo hold and sink the ship.

==Aftermath==

There where no survivors to tell what happened to the ship. However, for weeks debris and some bodies from the 24 crew members washed ashore from the ill-fated ship  between [[Crisp Point Light|Crisp Point]] and [[Grand Marais, Minnesota|Grand Marais]]. One of the bodies found was the body of the Clemson's watchman, Simon Dunn of [[Dublin, Ireland]], which washed ashore at [[Crisp Point Light|Crisp Point]]. Dunn was wearing a life jacket with ''D.M. Clemson'' written on it. Later, pieces of the ship's cabin, 23 of the ship's wooden hatch covers and at least three more bodies were seen floating further west. Only one other body was recovered, and was identified as second mate Charles Woods of [[Marine City, Michigan]].

'''Self-replication''' is any behavior of a [[dynamical system]] that yields construction of an identical copy of itself. [[Cell (biology)|Biological cell]]s, given suitable environments, reproduce by [[cell division]]. During cell division, [[DNA]] is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during [[reproduction]]. [[virus (biology)|Biological viruses]] can [[Viral replication|replicate]], but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Harmful [[prion]] proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8435320.stm |title='Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer virus]]es reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in [[robotics]] has been an area of research and a subject of interest in [[science fiction]]. Any self-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy (Mutation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mutation|date=2018-11-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutation&amp;oldid=867900912|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will experience [[genetic variation]] and will create variants of itself. These variants will be subject to [[natural selection]], since some will be better at surviving in their current environment than others and will out-breed them.

==Overview==

===Theory===
{{See also|Von Neumann universal constructor}}

Early research by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref name=Hixon_vonNeumann&gt;{{cite book|last=von Neumann|first=John|title=The Hixon Symposium|year=1948|location=Pasadena, California|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that replicators have several parts:

*A coded representation of the replicator
*A mechanism to copy the coded representation
*A mechanism for effecting construction within the host environment of the replicator

Exceptions to this pattern may be possible, although none have yet been achieved.  For example, scientists have come close to  constructing [https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/04/investigations-into-the-ancient-rna-world/ RNA that can be copied] in an "environment" that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase.  In this case, the body is the genome, and the specialized copy mechanisms are external.  The requirement for an outside copy mechanism has not yet been overcome, and such systems are more accurately characterized as "assisted replication" than "self-replication".

However, the simplest possible case is that only a genome exists.  Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a [[crystal]].

===Classes of self-replication===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last = Freitas | first = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - General Taxonomy of Replicators}}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require.

*Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms.
*[[Autotroph]]ic replicators can reproduce themselves "in the wild".  They mine their own materials. It is conjectured that non-biological autotrophic replicators could be designed by humans, and could easily accept specifications for human products.
*Self-reproductive systems are conjectured systems which would produce copies of themselves from industrial feedstocks such as metal bar and wire.
*Self-assembling systems assemble copies of themselves from finished, delivered parts. Simple examples of such systems have been demonstrated at the macro scale.

The design space for machine replicators is very broad. A comprehensive study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last1 = Freitas | first1 = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - Freitas-Merkle Map of the Kinematic Replicator Design Space (2003–2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to date by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] has identified 137 design dimensions grouped into a dozen separate categories, including: (1) Replication Control, (2) Replication Information, (3) Replication Substrate, (4) Replicator Structure, (5) Passive Parts, (6) Active Subunits, (7) Replicator Energetics, (8) Replicator Kinematics, (9) Replication Process, (10) Replicator Performance, (11) Product Structure, and (12) Evolvability.

===A self-replicating computer program===
{{Main article|Quine (computing)}}

In [[computer science]] a [[Quine (computing)|quine]] is a self-reproducing computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code. For example, a quine in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] is:

:&lt;code&gt;a='a=%r;print a%%a';print a%a&lt;/code&gt;

A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.

In many programming languages an empty program is legal, and executes without producing errors or other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing.

===Self-replicating tiling===
{{See also|Self-similarity}}

In [[geometry]] a self-replicating tiling is a tiling pattern in which several [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] tiles may be joined together to form a larger tile that is similar to the original.  This is an aspect of the field of study known as [[tessellation]].  The "sphinx" [[hexiamond]] is the only known self-replicating [[pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;For an image that does not show how this replicates, see: Eric W. Weisstein. "Sphinx." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, four such [[concave polygon|concave]] pentagons can be joined together to make one with twice the dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;For further illustrations, see [http://www.geoaustralia.com/italian/Sphinx/Guide.html Teaching TILINGS / TESSELLATIONS with Geo Sphinx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon W. Golomb]] coined the term [[rep-tiles]] for self-replicating tilings.

In 2012, [[Lee Sallows]] identified rep-tiles as a special instance of a [[self-tiling tile set]] or setiset. A setiset of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes that can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to form larger replicas of themselves. Setisets in which every shape is distinct are called 'perfect'.  A rep-''n'' rep-tile is just a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces.

===Applications===
It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a [[clanking replicator]], a material device that can self-replicate.  The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good.  Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self-replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] in conventional [[factory|manufactured goods]].

A fully novel artificial replicator is a reasonable near-term goal.
A [[NASA]] study recently placed the complexity of a [[clanking replicator]] at approximately that of [[Intel]]'s [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] 4 CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/883Toth-Fejel.pdf |title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata Final Report |publisher= |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the technology is achievable with a relatively small engineering group in a reasonable commercial time-scale at a reasonable cost.

Given the currently keen interest in biotechnology and the high levels of funding in that field, attempts to exploit the replicative ability of existing cells are timely, and may easily lead to significant insights and advances.

A variation of self replication is of practical relevance in [[compiler]] construction, where a similar [[bootstrapping]] problem occurs as in natural self replication. A compiler ([[phenotype]]) can be applied on the compiler's own [[source code]] ([[genotype]]) producing the compiler itself. During compiler development, a modified ([[Mutation|mutated]]) source is used to create the next generation of the compiler. This process differs from natural self-replication in that the process is directed by an engineer, not by the subject itself.

==Mechanical self-replication==
{{Main article|self-replicating machine}}

An activity in the field of robots is the self-replication of machines. Since all robots (at least in modern times) have a fair number of the same features, a self-replicating robot (or possibly a hive of robots) would need to do the following:

*Obtain construction materials
*Manufacture new parts including its smallest parts and thinking apparatus
*Provide a consistent power source
*Program the new members
*error correct any mistakes in the offspring

On a [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale, [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] might also be designed to self-replicate under their own power. This, in turn, has given rise to the "[[grey goo]]" version of [[Armageddon]], as featured in such science fiction novels as ''[[Bloom (novel)|Bloom]]'', ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'', and ''[[Recursion (novel)|Recursion]]''.

The [[Foresight Institute]] has published guidelines for researchers in mechanical self-replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foresight.org/guidelines/ |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines recommend that researchers use several specific techniques for preventing mechanical replicators from getting out of control, such as using a [[broadcast architecture]].

For a detailed article on mechanical reproduction as it relates to the industrial age see [[mass production]].

==Fields==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Research has occurred in the following areas:

* [[Biology]] studies natural replication and replicators, and their interaction.  These can be an important guide to avoid design difficulties in self-replicating machinery.
* In [[Chemistry]] self-replication studies are typically about how a specific set of molecules can act together to replicate each other within the set &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moulin, Giuseppone |title=Dynamic Combinatorial Self-Replicating Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F128_2011_198|year=2011|publisher=Springer|DOI=10.1007/128_2011_198}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often part of [[Systems chemistry]] field).
* [[Meme]]tics studies ideas and how they propagate in human culture.  Memes require only small amounts of material, and therefore have theoretical similarities to [[virus]]es and are often described as [[virus|viral]].
* [[Nanotechnology]] or more precisely, [[molecular nanotechnology]] is concerned with making [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]].  Without self-replication, capital and assembly costs of molecular machines become impossibly large.
* Space resources: NASA has sponsored a number of design studies to develop self-replicating mechanisms to mine space resources.  Most of these designs include computer-controlled machinery that copies itself.
* [[Computer security]]: Many computer security problems are caused by self-reproducing computer programs that infect computers — [[computer worm]]s and [[computer virus]]es.
* In [[parallel computing]], it takes a long time to manually load a new program on every node of a large [[computer cluster]] or [[distributed computing]] system. Automatically loading new programs using [[mobile agent]]s can save the system administrator a lot of time and give users their results much quicker, as long as they don't get out of control.

==In industry==

===Space exploration and manufacturing===
The goal of self-replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass.  For example, an [[autotroph]]ic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves.  Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products. [[Von Neumann Probe|Another model]] of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy and universe, sending information back.

In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators.  They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce.

A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 [[NASA]] study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Advanced Automation for Space Missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar [[regolith]], and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith.  The limiting element was [[Chlorine]], an essential element to process regolith for [[Aluminium]].  Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts.

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails.  Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic [[robot]].

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of [[solar cell]]s supported on pillars.  The other machinery could run under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|mold]]s.  Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes.  The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals.  An [[electricity|electric]] [[oven]] melted the materials.

A speculative, more complex "chip factory" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins".

===Molecular manufacturing===
{{Main article|molecular nanotechnology#Replicating nanorobots}}

[[Nanotechnology|Nanotechnologists]] in particular believe that their work will likely fail to reach a state of maturity until human beings design a self-replicating [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assembler]] of [[nanometer]] dimensions [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm].

These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy.  They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether [[molecular manufacturing]] is possible or not.  Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems.  Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated.  In the meantime, a [[Lego]]-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003 [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm].

Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of [[protein biosynthesis]] (also see the listing for [[RNA]]).
What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities.

In 2011, New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials.  They have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10500 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Tong | last2 = Sha | first2 = Ruojie | last3 = Dreyfus | first3 = Rémi | last4 = Leunissen | first4 = Mirjam E. | last5 = Maass | first5 = Corinna | last6 = Pine | first6 = David J. | last7 = Chaikin | first7 = Paul M. | last8 = Seeman | first8 = Nadrian C. | year = 2011 | title = Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html| journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7368 | pages = 225–228 | pmid=21993758 | pmc=3192504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm | title = Self-replication process holds promise for production of new materials. | date = 17 October 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6291">'''Siegel disc''' is a connected [[Classification of Fatou components|component in the Fatou set]] where the dynamics is analytically [[Topological conjugation|conjugate]] to an [[irrational rotation]].

==Description==
Given a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] [[endomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f:S\to S&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Riemann surface]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; we consider the [[dynamical system]] generated by the [[Iterated function|iterates]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^n=f\circ\stackrel{\left(n\right)}{\cdots}\circ f&lt;/math&gt;. We then call the [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}^+(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; as the set of forward iterates of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the orbits in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (which will usually be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[complex plane]] or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{\hat C}=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Riemann sphere]]), and we call &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the [[phase plane]] or ''dynamical plane''.

One possible asymptotic behavior for a point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is to be a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], or in general a ''periodic point''. In this last case &lt;math&gt;f^p(z_0)=z_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Orbit (dynamics)|period]] and &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed point. We can then define the ''multiplier'' of the orbit as &lt;math&gt;\rho=(f^p)'(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; and this enables us to classify periodic orbits as ''attracting'' if &lt;math&gt;|\rho|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; ''superattracting'' if &lt;math&gt;|\rho|=0&lt;/math&gt;), ''repelling'' if &lt;math&gt;|\rho|&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and indifferent if &lt;math&gt;\rho=1&lt;/math&gt;. Indifferent periodic orbits can be either ''rationally indifferent'' or ''irrationally indifferent'', depending on whether &lt;math&gt;\rho^n=1&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\rho^n\neq1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

'''Siegel discs''' are one of the possible cases of connected components in the Fatou set (the complementary set of the [[Julia set]]), according to [[Classification of Fatou components]], and can occur around irrationally indifferent periodic points. The Fatou set is, roughly, the set of points where the iterates behave similarly to their neighbours (they form a [[normal family]]). '''Siegel discs''' correspond to points where the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is analytically 
[[Topological conjugation|conjugate]] to an irrational rotation of the complex disc.

==Name==
The disk is named in honor of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]].

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;f:S\to S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] [[endomorphism]] where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riemann surface]], and let U be a [[connected component (analysis)|connected component]] of the Fatou set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(f)&lt;/math&gt;. We say U is a Siegel disc of f around the point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a biholomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:U\to\mathbb{D}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit disc and such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(f^n(\phi^{-1}(z)))=e^{2\pi i\alpha n}z&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(z_0)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel's]] theorem proves the existence of '''Siegel discs''' for [[Irrational Number|irrational numbers]] satisfying a ''strong irrationality condition'' (a [[Diophantine approximation|Diophantine condition]]), thus solving an open problem since Fatou conjectured his theorem on the [[Classification of Fatou components]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lennart Carleson]] and Theodore W. Gamelin, ''Complex Dynamics'', Springer 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Alexander Dmitrievich Bruno|A. D. Brjuno]] improved this condition on the irrationality, enlarging it to the [[Brjuno number]]s.&lt;ref name="MilnorComplexDynamics"&gt;[[John W. Milnor]], ''Dynamics in One Complex Variable'' (Third Edition), Annals of Mathematics Studies 160, Princeton University Press 2006 (First appeared in 1990 as a [http://www.math.sunysb.edu/preprints.html Stony Brook IMS Preprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424085751/http://www.math.sunysb.edu/preprints.html |date=2006-04-24 }}, available as [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/9201272 arXiV:math.DS/9201272].)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''snake pit''' is, in a literal sense, a hole filled with [[snake]]s. In idiomatic speech, "snake pits" are places of horror, torture and even death in European legends and fairy tales. The [[Viking]] [[warlord]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok]] is said to have been thrown into a snake pit and died there, after his army had been defeated in battle by King [[Aelle II of Northumbria]]. An older legend recorded in ''[[Atlakviða]]'' and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'' tells that [[Attila the Hun]] murdered [[Gunther|Gunnarr]], the [[King of Burgundy]], in a snake pit. In a medieval German poem, [[Dietrich von Bern]] is thrown into a snake pit by the [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] Sigenot – he is protected by a magical jewel that had been given to him earlier by a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;ots=rZY4rO5laI&amp;dq=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20origin%20of%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Csnake%20pit%E2%80%9D%20for%20insane%20asylum&amp;f=false "Coerrcion as Cure: A critical history of psychiatry".

He was born in [[Kingston, New Brunswick]], the son of [[Sylvester Zobieski Earle, Sr.|Sylvester Zobieski Earle]] and Maria Hughson, and studied medicine at the University of the City of New York. In 1845, Earle returned to New Brunswick and joined his father in practice at [[Hampton, New Brunswick|Hampton]]. In 1847, he married Catherine McGill Otty, the sister of judge [[George Otty]]. In 1857, he was named county [[coroner]]. He also served as surgeon with the local militia. Earle helped lead the reconstruction efforts following the great fire in Saint John in June 1877.

'''Uterine incarceration''' is an [[obstetrics|obstetrical]] [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] whereby a growing [[retroverted uterus]] becomes wedged into the [[pelvis]] after the [[first trimester]] of [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=ogs&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lettieri L, Rodis JF, McLean DA, Campbell WA, Vintzileos AM |title=Incarceration of the gravid uterus.|journal=Obstet. Gynecol. Surv.|pmid=7991232|volume=49|issue=9|date=September 1994|pages=642–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A number of situations may interfere with the natural process that would antevert a retroverted uterus during pregnancy. Such situations include [[Adhesion (medicine)|pelvic adhesion]]s, [[endometriosis]], [[uterine malformation]]s, [[leiomyomata]], and [[pelvic tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=jmcr/&gt;

==Development==
When the uterus is tilted backwards, it is considered to be retroverted; this situation is common and regarded a normal variation. It has been estimated that about 15% of pregnancies begin in a retroverted uterus.&lt;ref name=wjem&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Amy N. Sweigart |author2=Michael J. Matteucci |title= Fever, Sacral Pain, and Pregnancy: An Incarcerated Uterus |journal=West J Emerg Med. | pmid=19561753|pmc=2672273|volume=9|issue=4|year=2008|pages=232–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, during the first trimester, the growing uterus changes spontaneously to an anteverted position, thus allowing expansion of the enlarging uterus into the abdomen. The [[cervix]] is then inferior to the body of the uterus. Thus, the presence of an early  pregnancy in a retroverted uterus is not considered a problem.&lt;ref name=ogs/&gt;

On rare occasions the uterus fails to become anteverted, and the pregnancy continues to expand the retroverted uterus within the confines of the pelvis. By about 14 weeks the size of the uterus fills out most of the pelvis, pushing up the cervix.  At this point the uterus may get trapped below the [[sacral promontory]] and [[symphysis]].  With further growth the pregnant woman may experience lower abdominal and [[pelvic pain]], [[back pain]], and difficulty, even inability to void, as the bladder is pushed upward and its outflow becomes obstructed. [[Constipation]] may be encountered. 
The frequency of this complication has been estimated to be about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies.&lt;ref name=jmcr&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/3/1/103 |vauthors=van der Tuuk K, Krenning RA, Krenning G, Monincx WM |title= Recurrent incarceration of the retroverted gravid uterus at term - two times transvaginal caesarean section: a case report. |journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports |pmid=19946581 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-3-103 |volume=3 |pmc=2783044 |year=2009 |pages=103 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Retroverted uterus in pregnancy.png|thumb|A [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] showing a [[retroverted uterus]] during pregnancy. The [[cervix]] lies posteriorly to the [[urinary bladder]], and the uterus normally extends superiorly from it, but the direction of the body of the fetus reveals that the uterus extends backwards.]]
In a pregnant woman who is entering her second trimester, the combination of urinary difficulties and pelvic pain may alert the physician to consider uterine incarceration as a possibility. On physical examination, the cervix is pushed up and anterior, and the pelvis entirely filled by the soft mass of the body of the pregnant uterus. [[Sonography]] may indicate the retroverted position of the uterus, check on the viability of the fetus, and demonstrate the location of the bladder being pushed cranially and unable to be emptied.&lt;ref name=usm&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fernandes DD, Sadow CA, Economy KE, Benson CB |title= Sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings in uterine incarceration.| journal=J Ultrasound Med.| pmid= 22441922| volume=31| issue=4|date=April 2012| pages=645–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[magnetic resonance imaging]] has been found to be helpful in the diagnosis of the condition.&lt;ref name=usm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hachisuga N, Hidaka N, Fujita Y, Fukushima K, Wake N |title= Significance of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging in preoperative diagnosis of incarcerated retroverted gravid uterus with a large anterior leiomyoma: a case report| journal= J Reprod Med. |pmid=22324275|volume=57|issue=1-2|year=2012|pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequelae==
Spontaneous resolution of the condition can occur during the second trimester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rose CH, Brost BC, Watson WJ, Davies NP, Knudsen JM | title= Expectant management of uterine incarceration from an anterior uterine myoma: a case report.| journal= J Reprod Med.|pmid=18251368| volume=53| issue=1|date=January 2008| pages=65–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An unresolved incarcerated uterus can lead to further pain, vaginal bleeding, loss of pregnancy or [[premature delivery]]. Also, the uterus may develop a '''uterine sacculation''', that is a part of its back wall softens like an [[aneurysm]] and allows  expansion of the fetus into the abdomen with a risk of [[uterine rupture]].&lt;ref name=wjem/&gt; Further, urinary complications may develop such as [[cystitis]], and bladder distention could eventually lead to [[Urinary bladder disease|rupture of the bladder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Whitridge Williams| title=Obstetrics| publisher=D. Appleton and Co, 1906 |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
A pregnant woman with an incarcerated uterus may present in the [[emergency room]] because of pain, bleeding, inability to void and constipation. Upon diagnosis steps can be taken to manually position the uterus into an anteverted position. The bladder is decompressed by a [[Foley catheter]] and the obstetrician may attempt to manipulate the uterus if necessary using general or spinal anesthesia.&lt;ref name=wjem/&gt; Rarely will a woman with an incarcerated uterus reach term, - if so, a [[cesarean delivery]] is called for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Al Wadi K, Helewa M, Sabeski L |title= Asymptomatic uterine incarceration at term: a rare complication of pregnancy. |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Can.| pmid=21749750 |volume=33 |issue=7 |date=July 2011 |pages=729–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
