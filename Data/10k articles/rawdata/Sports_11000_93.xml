The '''1904–05''' season was the first season of organized [[football in Turkey]].

The [[Istanbul Football League]] featured only four clubs at the time: [[Moda FC]], [[HMS Imogene FC]], [[Elpis FC]], and [[Cadi-Keuy FC]]. The first champions of league football in Turkey was Imogene, a team made up of Englishmen.

The first league of Turkey lasted for 55 years until it was replaced with the [[Turkish First Football League]] (now [[Turkcell Super League]]).

The '''[[1980–81 NHL season|1980–81]] [[Calgary Flames]] season''' was the [[Calgary Flames seasons|first]] [[Season (sports)|season]] in [[Calgary]] and ninth for the Flames in the [[National Hockey League]].  The Flames moved to southern [[Alberta]] from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where the franchise was known as the [[Atlanta Flames]] for the first eight years of its existence.  The Flames became the third major-league team to represent the city of Calgary after the [[Calgary Tigers]] of the 1920s, and the [[Calgary Cowboys]], which had folded in 1977.

The Flames were purchased for $16 million [[USD]] by [[Nelson Skalbania]] in the spring of 1980.  Before the sale was even announced, he had already sold 50% of the franchise to a group of Calgary-based investors including [[Harley Hotchkiss]] and [[Norman Kwong|Normie Kwong]].  On May 21, 1980, it was announced that the franchise was moving to Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;Zeman, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Cowboys could not manage 2,000 season tickets three years previous, the Flames sold 10,000 full and half-season ticket packages in 1980, selling out the [[Stampede Corral]] for every game played there.&lt;ref&gt;Zeman, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flames' first game was played October 9, ending as a 5–5 tie to the [[Quebec Nordiques]].  While still in the East-coast dominated [[Patrick Division]], the Flames finished 3rd, and qualified for the playoffs.  The franchise, which had won just two playoff ''games'' in Atlanta, won two playoff ''series'' in their first year in Calgary.  After sweeping the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], Calgary then downed the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in seven games before falling to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the league semi-final.

[[Kent Nilsson]] led the Flames in scoring, and his 82 assists and 131 points remain franchise records to this day.  Nilsson was also the Flames lone representative at the [[33rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1980 All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;All-Star Selections, ''2006–07 Calgary Flames Media Guide'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The match on week 3 in Leopoldsburg (Shotgun's homefield) was suspended due to the absence of an ambulance. In the first quarter a player was driven away to the hospital without a replacement for the leaving ambulance. Rules state that a game cannot continue without an emergency vehicle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">The '''Brazilian Cricket Association''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Associação Brasileira de Críquete'')  is the official [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of the sport of [[cricket]] in [[Brazil]]. It's current headquarters is in [[Brasilia]], [[Brazil]]. The association is Brazil's representative at the [[International Cricket Council]] and has been an affiliate member of that body since 2002. It is included in the [[ICC Americas]] region.

==History==

Cricket in Brazil began in the mid-1800s in [[Rio de Janeiro]], during a period when a portion of the city’s population was British or of British descent. By the early 1860s, a number of cricket clubs were in operation, including the British CC, Artisan Amateurs CC, Rio British CC, Anglo-Brazilian CC and the British and American Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cricketbrasil.org/our-history|title=Brazil Cricket History|access-date = 11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1872, George Cox formed the Rio Cricket Club, which soon began using the field as its home. In the early 1880s, George’s son Oscar organized Brazil’s first football games on this same ground. In 1889, Brazil became a Republic and [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]] was forced to move from her residence. The cricket ground was taken over by the new government, and although the sport was allowed to continue for a time, a permanent facility was now required.
In 1922, the Brazil Cricket Association (BCA) was formed, with R.A. Brooking as its first President. 
As cricket in Rio de Janeiro faded from the scene, it was left to [[São Paulo]] to carry the torch at SPAC until 1989, when the Brasília Cricket Association (ABRAC) was formed which fields men’s and women’s teams. In 1999 in [[Curitiba]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[HSBC Bank]] built a cricket ground at its staff sports facility, which is home to Curitiba cricket. Then in 2011, the Carioca Cricket Club was founded and breathed new life into cricket in Rio. Most recently, the [[Minas Gerais]] Cricket Club in [[Belo Horizonte]], and Poços de Caldas Cricket, also in Minas, both formed in 2013.

The '''Bruce protocol''' is a [[Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures|diagnostic test]] used in the evaluation of [[heart|cardiac]] function, developed by [[Robert A. Bruce]].

==History==
Before the development of the Bruce Protocol there was no safe, standardized protocol that could be used to monitor [[cardiac]] function in exercising patients. Master's Two-Step test was sometimes used, but it was too strenuous for many patients, and inadequate for the assessment of [[respiratory]] and [[circulatory]] function during varying amounts of exercise. Most physicians relied upon patients' complaints about exertion, and examined them only at rest.

To address these problems, Bruce and his colleagues began to develop a [[treadmill]] exercise test. The test made extensive use of relatively new technological developments in [[electrocardiograph]]s and motorized treadmills. A Bruce exercise test involved walking on a treadmill while the heart was monitored by an electrocardiograph with various [[electrode]]s attached to the body. [[Ventilation (physiology)|Ventilation]] volumes and respiratory gas exchanges were also monitored, before, during and after exercise. Because the treadmill speed and inclination could be adjusted, this physical activity was tolerated by most patients. Initial experiments involved a single-stage test, in which subjects walked for 10 minutes on the treadmill at a fixed workload. Bruce's first reports on treadmill exercise tests, published in 1949, analyzed minute-by-minute changes in respiratory and circulatory function of normal adults and patients with heart or lung ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1950 Bruce joined the [[University of Washington]], where he continued research on the single-stage test, particularly as a predictor of the success of surgery for valvular or congenital heart disease. Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as [[angina pectoris]], a previous [[heart attack]], or a ventricular [[aneurysm]]. Bruce and colleagues also demonstrated that exercise testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.

Typically during a Bruce Protocol, Heart Rate and Rating of Perceived Exertion are taken every minute and Blood Pressure is taken at the end of each stage (every three minutes).

There are Bruce Protocol Tables available for Maximal and Sub Maximal (more practical with the majority of the non-athletic or competitively athletic population) efforts (see below).

Total Duration = 21 minutes

=== Modifications ===
The Modified Bruce protocol starts at a lower workload than the standard test and is typically used for elderly or sedentary patients. The first two stages of the Modified Bruce Test are performed at a 1.7&amp;nbsp;mph and 0% grade and 1.7&amp;nbsp;mph and 5% grade, and the third stage corresponds to the first stage of the Standard Bruce Test protocol as listed above.

=== Results ===
The test score is the time taken on the test, in minutes. This can also be converted to an estimated [[VO2 max|VO2max]] (maximal oxygen uptake) score using the calculator below and the following formulas, where the value "T" is the total time completed (expressed in minutes and fractions of a minute e.g. 9 minutes 15 seconds = 9.25 minutes). As with many exercise test equations, there have been many regression equations developed that may give varying results. If possible, use the one derived from a similar population and which best suits your needs.

* VO2max (ml/kg/min) = 14.76 - (1.379 × T) + (0.451 × T²) - (0.012 × T³)

* Women: VO2max (ml/kg/min) = 2.94 x T + 3.74
* Women: VO2max (ml/kg/min) = 4.38 × T - 3.9
* Men: VO2max (ml/kg/min) = 2.94 x T + 7.65
* Young Men: VO2max (ml/kg/min) = 3.62 x T + 3.91
ref: ACSM's Health-Related Physical Fitness Assessment Manual

=== Underlying Heart Rate Formulas ===
[[Maximum heart rate]] (MHR) is often calculated with the formula 220-age, which is quite inaccurate. The heart rate formula most often used for the Bruce is the  Karvonen formula (below).

A more accurate formula, offered in a study published in the journal, Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, is 206.9 - (0.67 x age) which can also be used to more accurately determine VO2 Max, but may produce significantly different results.

A diagnostician (e.g., physical therapist, personal trainer, doctor, athletic trainer, nurse, medical professional, dietitian, etc.) may be best served to conduct the test twice using both parameters and formulas.

=== Karvonen method ===
The ''Karvonen method'' factors in resting heart rate (HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) to calculate target heart rate (THR), using a range of 50–85%:

:THR = ((HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; − HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) × %Intensity) + HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;

Example for someone with a HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 180 and a HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; of 70:&lt;br&gt;
50% intensity:  ((180 − 70) × 0.50) + 70 = 125 bpm&lt;br&gt;
85% intensity:  ((180 − 70) × 0.85) + 70 = 163 bpm

'''Clifton Grove''' was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Rotherham]], [[England]]. It was the home ground of the original [[Rotherham Town F.C. (1878)|Rotherham Town]] club.

==History==
The ground was opened on 26 September 1891 for a [[Midland Football League|Midland League]] game between Rotherham and Grantham Rovers.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p38, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located to the east of Rotherham town centre and consisted of a covered seated stand on the northern touchline, which had been moved from the club's previous Clifton Land cricket ground and an open seated stand behind the eastern goal.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

In 1893 the club was elected to [[the Football League]], and the first League match at Clifton Grove was played on 9 September 1893, with Rotherham defeating [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in front of 3,000 spectators. This was also the highest League attendance recorded at the ground, and was equalled on 1 September 1894 for a 3–1 defeat by [[Burton Wanderers F.C.|Burton Wanderers]].&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

In 1896 the club was voted out of the Football League and subsequently folded. The last League game at Clifton Grove was played on 16 March 1896 with just 300 watching a 2–2 draw against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. After the club folded, the ground was subsequently used for housing.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

'''Club Oriental de Football''', sometimes referred to as '''Club Oriental de Fútbol''', '''Club Oriental de La Paz''', or simply '''Oriental''', are a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[La Paz, Canelones|La Paz, Uruguay]]. They currently play in the [[Uruguayan Segunda División]] Profesional, the second tier of the [[Uruguayan football league system]].

==History==
Founded in 1924, the club played in regional leagues in the early years of its existence, joining the [[Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol|Uruguayan Football Association]] in the 1970s. The club were champions of the [[Uruguayan Segunda División Amateur]] in 2004 and 2007, but at the time the champions were not automatically [[promotion and relegation|promoted]]. After the club won the title again in 2008-09, the Uruguayan Football Association granted promotion to the [[Uruguayan Segunda División]] Profesional; however, the club were unable to meet the financial requirements of the higher tier, ultimately not playing at all in the 2009-10 season. They re-entered the Segunda División Amateur for 2010-11. After winning that league again in 2014-15, they were able to successfully gain promotion to the Segunda División Profesional.

{{distinguish|dropkick}}
A '''drop kick''' is a type of [[Kick (football)|kick]] in various codes of [[football]]. It involves a player dropping the ball and then [[kick (football)|kicking]] it when it bounces off the ground.

Drop kicks are most importantly used as a method of restarting play and scoring points in [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]. [[Association football]] [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] also often return the ball to play with drop kicks. The kick was once in wide use in both [[Australian rules football]] and [[gridiron football]], but is today rarely seen in either sport.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Drop kick technique ===
{{See also|Drop goal}}

The drop kick technique in rugby codes is usually to hold the ball with one end pointing downwards in two hands above the kicking leg. The ball is dropped onto the ground in front of the kicking foot, which makes contact at the moment or fractionally after the ball touches the ground, called the ''half-volley''. The kicking foot usually makes contact with the ball slightly on the instep.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070623215626/http://www.coachingrugby.com/rugby/coaching/indskills/kicking/drop.htm "Kicking: The Drop Kick"] at www.coachingrugby.com. Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rugby union kick-off, or drop out, the kicker usually aims to kick the ball high but not a great distance, and so usually strikes the ball after it has started to bounce off the ground, so the contact is made close to the bottom of the ball.

=== Rugby league ===
In [[rugby league]], drop kicks are mandatory to restart play from the goal line (called a goal line drop-out) after the defending team is tackled or knocks on in the in-goal area or the defending team causes the ball to go dead or into [[Glossary of rugby league terms#touch in-goal|touch-in-goal]]. Drop kicks are also mandatory to restart play from the 20 metre line after an unsuccessful penalty goal attempt goes dead or into touch-in-goal and to score a [[drop goal]] (sometimes known as a field goal) in open play, which is worth one point.&lt;ref name="league"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rlef.eu.com/rugby_laws_book2004.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drop kicks are optional for a penalty kick to score a penalty goal (this being done rarely, as place kicks are generally used) and when kicking for touch (the sideline) from a penalty, although the option of a punt kick is usually taken instead.

=== Rugby union ===
In [[rugby union]], a drop kick is used for the kick-off and restarts and to score a [[drop goal]] (sometimes called a field goal). Originally, it was one of only two ways to score points, along with the [[place kick]].

Drop kicks are mandatory from the centre spot to start a half (a kick-off), from the centre spot to restart the game after points have been scored, to restart play from the 22-metre line (called a drop-out) after the ball is touched down or made dead in the in-goal area by the defending team when the attacking team kicked or took the ball into the in-goal area, and to score a drop goal (sometimes called a field goal) in open play, which is worth three points.&lt;ref name="union"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drop kicks are optional for a conversion kick after a try has been scored.

=== Rugby sevens ===
The usage of drop kicks in rugby sevens is the same as in rugby union, except that drop kicks are used for all conversion attempts and for penalty kicks, both of which must be taken within 40 seconds of the try being scored or the award of the penalty.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== American and Canadian (gridiron) football ==
In both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], one method of scoring a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] or [[extra point]] is by drop-kicking the football through the goal.

[[File:Zach Curlin.png|thumb|left|130px|[[Zach Curlin]] drop kicking.]]

It contrasts with the [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]], wherein the player kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first; and the [[place kick]], wherein the player kicks a stationary ball off the ground: "from placement". A drop kick is significantly more difficult; as [[Jim Thorpe]] once explained, "I regard the place kick as almost two to one safer than the drop kick in attempting a goal from the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2874126/the_ogden_standardexaminer/|author=[[Billy Evans]]|date=December 3, 1926|page=19|accessdate=July 24, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|work=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|title=Place Kick Is best Method For Point}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brickleydropkick.png|thumb|250px|Brickley's drop kick to defeat Dartmouth in 1912.]]

The drop kick was often used in early football as a surprise tactic. The ball would be [[Snap (football)|snapped]] or [[Lateral pass|lateraled]] to a back, who would fake a run or pass, but then would kick the field goal instead. This method of scoring worked well in the 1920s and early 1930s, when the football was rounder at the ends (similar to a modern rugby ball). Early football stars such as [[Charles Brickley]], [[Frank Hudson (American football)|Frank Hudson]], [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Paddy Driscoll]], and [[Al Bloodgood]] were skilled drop-kickers; Driscoll in 1925 and Bloodgood in 1926 hold a tied NFL record of four drop kicked field goals in a single game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/release.jsp?release_id=1481 |title=Release » The last dropkick |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll's 55 yard drop kick in 1924 stood as the unofficial record for [[field goal range]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/01-07-011.pdf |title=The Coffin Corner : Vol. No. 7 (1979) – A Closer Look: 50-yd DKs |publisher=Profootballresearchers.org |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232951/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/01-07-011.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Bert Rechichar]] kicked a 56-yard field goal (by placekick) in 1953.

In 1934, the ball was made more pointed at the ends. The creation of the pointed football is generally credited to [[Shorty Ray]], at the time a college football official and later the NFL's head of officiating.&lt;ref name=BS&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Football To Honor Ray: Rules Advisor's Ideas Gave Game Needed Boost|author=Seymour Smith|newspaper=The Sun (Baltimore)|date=September 14, 1966|page=C4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7676652/pro_football_to_honor_ray/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made passing the ball easier, as was its intent, but made the drop kick obsolete, as the more pointed ball did not bounce up from the ground reliably. The drop kick was supplanted by the place kick, which cannot be attempted out of a formation generally used as a running or passing set. The drop kick remains in the rules, but is seldom seen, and rarely effective when attempted.
{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
In Canadian football the drop kick can be taken from any point on the field, unlike placekicks which must be attempted behind the line of scrimmage.

=== NFL ===
Before the [[NFL–AFL merger]], the last successful drop kick in the NFL was executed by [[Scooter McLean]] of the [[Chicago Bears]] in their 37–9 victory over the [[New York Giants]] on December 21, 1941, in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1941|NFL Championship]] game at Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]]. Though it was not part of the NFL at the time, the [[All-America Football Conference]] saw its last drop kick November 28, 1948, when [[Joe Vetrano]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] drop kicked an extra point after a muffed snap against the [[Cleveland Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2006/01/29/a_get_rich_kick_scheme_fails/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+New+England+Patriots+news | work=The Boston Globe | title=A get-rich kick scheme fails | date=January 29, 2006 | first1=Ron | last1=Borges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eddie Mahan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Eddie Mahan]] preparing to drop kick.]]
The only successful drop kick in the NFL since the 1940s was by [[Doug Flutie]], the backup [[quarterback]] of the [[New England Patriots]], against the [[Miami Dolphins]] on January 1, 2006, for an [[extra point]] after a touchdown. Flutie had estimated "an 80 percent chance" of making the drop kick,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulman |first=Howard |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060102/NEWS/601020380/1002/SPORTS |title=Dolphins Win Sixth Straight Despite Flutie's Drop Kick |publisher=TheLedger.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was called to give Flutie, 43 at the time, the opportunity to make a historic kick in his final NFL game; the drop kick was his last play in the NFL. After the game, New England coach [[Bill Belichick]] said, "I think Doug deserves it,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2277308 |title=Flutie converts first drop kick since 1941 championship – NFL – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2006-01-02 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Flutie said, "I just thanked him for the opportunity."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[Dallas Cowboys]] punter [[Mat McBriar]] attempted a maneuver similar to a drop kick during the 2010 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] after a botched punt attempt, but the ball bounced several times before the kick and the sequence of events is officially recorded as a fumble, followed by an illegal kick, with the fumble being recovered by the [[New Orleans Saints]] 29 yards downfield from the spot of the kick. The Saints declined the illegal kick penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=301125006&amp;period=4 |title=New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys – Play By Play – November 25, 2010 – ESPN |publisher=Scores.espn.go.com |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010112501/2010/REG12/saints@cowboys/watch?module=HP_cp2#tab:analyze |title=Watch New Orleans Saints vs. Dallas Cowboys [11/25/2010 |publisher=NFL.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New England Patriots]] kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] attempted an onside drop kick on a free kick after a safety against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on October 30, 2011. The kick went out of bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/33071567 |title=Polamalu punch vs. Patriots was illegal |publisher=CBSSports.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000814/http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/33071567 |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=England |first=New |url=http://musketfire.com/2011/10/30/patriots-steelers-studs-duds/ |title=Patriots-Steelers Studs &amp; Duds – Musket Fire – A New England Patriots Fan Site – News, Blogs, Opinion and more |publisher=Musket Fire |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Drew Brees]], a former teammate of Flutie's, executed a drop kick late on an extra point attempt in the fourth quarter of the [[2012 Pro Bowl]]; the kick fell short.

New England Patriots special teams player [[Nate Ebner]] attempted an onside drop kick on a kickoff after a Patriots touchdown against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on December 6, 2015. The kick was recovered by the Eagles at their own 41 yard line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/12/06/patriots-attempt-unusual-drop-kick-style-kickoff/XFIH51dJek0CSQekn7W4CM/story.html |title=Patriots attempt unusual drop-kick style kickoff |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, on December 20, [[Buffalo Bills]] punter [[Colton Schmidt]] executed what is believed to be an unintentional drop kick after a botched punt against the [[Washington Redskins]]; because the Redskins recovered the kick, it was treated as a punt (and not as a field goal attempt, which would have pushed the ball back to the spot of the kick).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/12/bills-punter-drop-kick-punt-colton-schmidt-redskins-doug-flutie|title=Bills punter somehow turns punt into drop kick through beautiful incompetence|date=20 December 2015|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle Seahawks]] punter [[Michael Dickson (American football)|Michael Dickson]] drop kicked a kickoff from the 50-yard-line on September 17, 2018 against the [[Chicago Bears]]. The kick landed inside the 5-yard-line and was returned less than the touchback, making it a successful strategy. Dickson, a native of Australia, had some previous experience making drop kicks in [[Australian rules football]]. Dickson made an onside drop kick attempt at the end of the same game which was unsuccessful (recovered by the Bears).

=== NCAA ===
The last successful drop kick extra point in the NCAA was by Jason Millgan of [[Hartwick College]] on December 11, 1998, [[St. Lawrence University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVi6LBcTLOw |title=Hartwick College ESPN Drop Kick Field Goal |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frosty Peters]] of [[Montana State College]] made 17 drop kicks in one game in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msubobcats.com/sports/2012/7/26/GEN_0726122140.aspx |title=BOBCAT ATHLETIC TRADITIONS |access-date=August 9, 2016 |publisher=msubobcats.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809215242/http://www.msubobcats.com/sports/2012/7/26/GEN_0726122140.aspx |archivedate=August 9, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian football ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
In the Canadian game, the drop kick can be attempted at any time by either team. Any player on the kicking team behind the kicker, and including the kicker, can recover the kick. When a drop kick goes out of bounds, possession on the next scrimmage goes to the non-kicking team.

On September 8, 1974, [[Tom Wilkinson (football player)|Tom Wilkinson]], quarterback for the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], unsuccessfully attempted a drop kick field goal in the final seconds of a 24–2 romp over the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]. This may have been the last time the play was deliberately attempted in the CFL.

During one game in the 1980s, [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] wide receiver [[Earl Winfield]] was unable to field a punt properly; in frustration, he kicked the ball out of bounds. The kick was considered a drop kick and led to a change of possession, with the punting team regaining possession of the ball.

=== Arena football ===
In [[Arena football]], a drop-kicked extra point counts for two points rather than one and a drop-kicked field goal counts for four points rather than three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arenafootball.com/about/afl-rules.html Rules of the Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225033049/http://www.arenafootball.com/about/afl-rules.html |date=December 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent conversion of a drop kick was by Geoff Boyer of the [[Pittsburgh Power]] on June 16, 2012; it was the first successful conversion in the Arena Football League since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thealbanyjournal.com/2011/06/a-drop-kick-into-history/ |title=A drop kick into history|first=Tom |last=Knighton|date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2018, Maine Mammoth kicker Nell converted a drop kick as a PAT against the Massachusetts Pirates in the National Arena League.

== Australian rules football ==
Once the preferred method of conveying the ball over long distances, the drop-kick has been superseded by the [[Punt (Australian football)#Drop punt|drop punt]] as a more accurate means of delivering the ball to a fellow player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future direction of an evolving art form|first=Andrew|last=Faulkner|newspaper=The Australian|date=11 June 2011|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/opinion/future-direction-of-an-evolving-art-form/story-e6frg7t6-1226073279442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Easy Living''''' is a 1949 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], starring [[Victor Mature]], [[Lizabeth Scott]] and [[Lucille Ball]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15194/Easy-Living/overview |title=New York Times: Easy Living |accessdate=July 19, 2008|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features the real-life [[Los Angeles Rams (1946–94)|Los Angeles Rams]] football team.

==Plot==
Star professional [[quarterback]] Pete Wilson (Victor Mature) thinks nothing of his future after football, not even after longtime teammate Bill "Holly" Holloran ([[Gordon Jones (actor)|Gordon Jones]]) is released by the team. Pete gets advance after advance on his salary from Anne (Lucille Ball), the secretary of team owner and coach Lenahan ([[Lloyd Nolan]]).

One day, however, he goes secretly to see a doctor ([[Jim Backus]]) about various symptoms he has been experiencing and learns that he has a heart condition due to a childhood bout of [[rheumatic fever]], one that could kill him if he continues playing football. He starts to tell his wife Liza (Lizabeth Scott), but changes his mind when she is cool to Holly, whom she describes as a has-been after he is gone.

Liza is struggling to make her own interior design business a success, and drags Pete to a fancy party to try to land Gilbert Vollmer as a client. Gilbert knows she has no talent, but is interested in her for other reasons. So is his father, Howard ([[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]]). The older man is looking to replace his young girlfriend, Billy Duane, and dangles before Liza the prospect of redecorating his apartment. Knowing what he is after, Liza is willing to do whatever it takes to further her ambitions.

Meanwhile, Pete is bitterly disappointed when his friend, retiring college head coach Virgil Ryan ([[Everett Glass]]), informs him that he cannot recommend him as his replacement because Liza is unsuitable for the duties of a coach's wife. Instead, the job is given to Pete's teammate and friend, Tim "Pappy" McCarr ([[Sonny Tufts]]). Tim offers Pete the position of his assistant, but Pete turns it down.

Afraid of physical contact, Pete turns in a very poor performance and loses the next game. Lenahan cannot afford another loss if he wants to make the playoffs (and earn $100,000), so he benches Pete in favor of Tim. Tim plays well, and they win their next game.

When Pete proposes taking the assistant coaching position, Liza breaks up with him. However, when she gets dumped by Howard, she tries unsuccessfully to get Pete back. Pete is given another chance at glory when Tim is injured, but ultimately tells his teammates about his condition and walks away from the game. Though Anne has made it clear that she loves him, Pete decides to take Liza back, making it clear, however, that it will be on his terms.

==Production==
Victor Mature was under contract to [[20th Century Fox]] but had an obligation to make a movie at RKO which dated from before the war. He was announced for ''Battleground'' and ''Mr Whiskers'' before eventually being cast in a serious drama about football, ''Interference'', which became ''Easy Living''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TWO MOVIE LEADS TO VICTOR MATURE: He Will Co-Star With Lamarr in 'Samson and Delilah,' Be Seen in 'Interference'|author=THOMAS F BRADY |work=New York Times|date=June 12, 1948|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of turbulence at RKO at the time due to the fact that [[Howard Hughes]] had bought the studio and head of production [[Dore Schary]] had resigned. Films such as ''Battleground'', ''Bed of Roses'' and ''Setup'' were cancelled. However ''Interference'' went ahead started July 12, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tufts in 'Interference;' Foster 'Big Cat' Star|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 30, 1948|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

The film was not released until October 1949, by which time its title had been changed to ''Easy Living''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Of Local Origin|author=|work=New York Times|date=August 5, 1949|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' critic gave the film a favorable review, writing that while it "doesn't have the searing candor and impact of some of its predecessors, neither is it a conventional rah-rah cream puff. For Charles Schnee has written a bright, well-knit adaptation of an Irwin Shaw short story, a capable cast has given it the works and the off-screen coaching of the director, Jacques Tourneur, is as crisp and telling as the late Knute Rockne's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400E0DB113DE03ABC4B52DFB6678382659EDE |title=At Loew's Criterion |author=H. H. T. |date=October 13, 1949 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It recorded a loss of $625,000.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;Richard B. Jewell, ''Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures'', Uni of California, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">[[image:Judo foot sweep - cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|The attacker on the left sweeps the right foot of the opponent]]
The '''foot sweep''' (also '''footsweep''') is a move in many different styles of [[martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/9/24/4762484/judo-chop-chris-clements-spinning-sweep-kick-stephen-thompson-gif-andy-hug |title=UFC 165 Judo Chop: Chris Clement's Spinning Sweep Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to trip an opponent. Foot sweeps are commonly used in [[Tang Soo Do]], [[karate]], [[Muay Thai]] and [[jujutsu]]. In addition, many closer sweeps like the Trap Sweep and Two-Leg Sweep can resemble [[Judo]] throws.

:
==Types==
===Drop sweep===
Commonly thought of when someone hears “foot sweep,” the drop sweep involves spinning and sweeping one or two legs from a crouched position. This move is also known as the '''front sweep''' in martial arts circles.&lt;ref name="Fundamentals of High Performance Wushu: Taolu Jumps and Spins"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wu |first=Raymond |title= Fundamentals of High Performance Wushu: Taolu Jumps and Spins |year=2007 |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1-4303-1820-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
===Single-leg sweep=== 
When the opponent has one foot off the ground (usually in mid-kick) and the defender moves past this kick and sweeps out the standing leg.
===Trap sweep=== 
A variant of the single-leg sweep, this involves catching the opponent’s kick with one hand and sweeping the back leg. The advantage is closer proximity and less chance of failure, but it leaves the defender open to hand attacks to the head.
===Two-leg sweep===
When the opponent has both feet on the ground and the defender strikes behind both legs, usually accompanied by a blow across the chest to further off-balance the opponent.
===Forward sweep===
A sweep aimed at the front of the opponent’s legs, as opposed to the more conventional behind-the-legs strike. This is considered more dangerous due to the possibility of injuring the opponent’s knees or shins if the sweep is too powerful or misapplied.
===Scissor sweep===
The '''scissor sweep''' involves positioning one leg across the opponent’s lower chest/stomach and striking behind the knee or calves with the other leg, closing the legs in a “scissor” motion. This can be done as an offensive technique, leaping into the air toward the opponent, but is more commonly used as an escape when the opponent has trapped the defender’s kick across his chest.
====Reverse scissor sweep====
A variant of the scissor sweep, it is an offensive technique used in opposite position from a traditional scissor; that is, the higher leg strikes at the opponent’s back and the lower leg scissors against the front of the opponent’s knees. Like the forward sweep, this can be very dangerous due to potential injury to the opponent’s knees, spine, and kidneys.

'''GCS Ballpark''' is a [[minor league baseball]] facility in [[Sauget, Illinois]], that serves as the home ballpark for the [[Gateway Grizzlies]] of the [[Frontier League]].  The Grizzlies' ballpark was built in time for the start of the 2002 season, under the original name of GMC Stadium.  GCS Ballpark features reserved box seating, lawn seating, party suites, two hot tubs, and a section of bleacher seating. With the bleacher section added in 2004, the stadium's capacity has increased to 6,000 fans. In 2004, the Grizzlies became the first team in Frontier League history to draw over 200,000 fans for a season, finishing with a league best 217,500.  ProGrass synthetic turf was installed at GCS Ballpark in January 2012.

GCS Ballpark hosted the 2008 [[NCAA Division II Baseball Championship]].  The stadium also serves as the host for the annual wood-bat college baseball game between the Billikens of [[Saint Louis University]] and the Salukis of [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]].  The ballpark is also home for [[Webster University]] and [[Lindenwood University – Belleville]].

GCS Ballpark sells a unique food item called "Baseball's Best Burger", a variant of the [[Luther Burger]]. It consists of a [[bacon cheeseburger]] with a [[Krispy Kreme]] Original Glazed [[doughnut]] used as a bun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatewaygrizzlies.com/news/?id=2723 Baseball's Best Burger]&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark and the burger were showcased in a special baseball-themed episode in [[Man v. Food (season 2)|season 2]] of the [[Travel Channel]]'s ''[[Man v. Food]]''. along with their nachos

The '''Green Bay Packers''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. The Packers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC North|North division]]. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology of Professional Football|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/2013/353-372-Chronology.pdf|publisher=National Football League|date=January 22, 2015|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/green-bay-packers/team-history/|title=Green Bay Packers Team History|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], community-owned [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major league professional sports team]] based in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name = "Zirin"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Dave Zirin|Zirin, Dave]] |title=Those Non-Profit Packers |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/those-non-profit-packers |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home games have been played at [[Lambeau Field]] since 1957.

The Packers are the last of the "small town teams" which were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and '30s. Founded in 1919 by [[Curly Lambeau|Earl "Curly" Lambeau]] and [[George Whitney Calhoun]], the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the Packers as the [[Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams|world's 26th most valuable sports franchise]] in 2016, with a value of $2.35 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/07/12/full-list-the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2017/ |title=Full List: The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2017 |last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt |work=Forbes|access-date=July 31, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre–[[Super Bowl]] [[List of NFL champions|NFL titles]] and four [[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowl victories]]. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in [[Super Bowl I|1967]] and [[Super Bowl II|1968]] and were the only NFL team to defeat the [[American Football League]] (AFL) prior to the [[AFL–NFL merger]]. The [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] is named after the Packers' coach [[Vince Lombardi|of the same name]], who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two subsequent Super Bowl wins came in [[Super Bowl XXXI|1996]] and [[Super Bowl XLV|2010]].&lt;ref name=championships&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowls &amp; Championships|url=http://www.packers.com/history/super-bowls-and-championships.html|publisher=Green Bay Packers|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Packers are long-standing adversaries of the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Detroit Lions]], who today comprise the NFL's NFC North division, and were formerly members of the NFC Central Division. They have played over 100 games against each of those teams through history, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The [[Bears–Packers rivalry]] is one of the oldest in NFL history, dating back to 1921.

On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. Financial troubles plagued the team and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as "[[The Hungry Five]]", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.packers.com/news/the-truth-and-myth-about-the-hungry-five-17191426|title=The truth and myth about 'The Hungry Five'|website=www.packers.com|language=en-US|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1929–1931: Lambeau's team arrives===
After a near-miss in [[1927 Green Bay Packers season|1927]], Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|1929]] with an undefeated 12–0–1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/packers/205724981.html/|title=Dec. 8, 1929: Packers earn first league title|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Bay would repeat as league champions in [[1930 Green Bay Packers season|1930]] and [[1931 Green Bay Packers season|1931]], bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers [[Mike Michalske]], [[Johnny McNally|Johnny (Blood) McNally]], [[Cal Hubbard]] and Green Bay native [[Arnie Herber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2017/01/14/history-champions-packers-no-1-nfl/96552152/|title=History of Champions: Packers are No. 1 in NFL|work=Press Gazette Media|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://247sports.com/nfl/green-bay-packers/Bolt/Green-Bay-Packers-explain-why-three-championship-trophies-are-missing-from-Hall-of-Fame-53284003/|title=Green Bay Packers explain why three championship trophies are missing from Hall of Fame|work=Green Bay Packers|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team Records: Games Won|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/Records/2013/Team_Records.pdf|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935–1945: The Don Hutson era===
[[File:Don hutson packers.jpg|thumb|180px|Don Hutson with the Packers; his jersey number was the first retired by the Packers (1951)|left]]
The arrival of end [[Don Hutson]] from [[Alabama football|Alabama]] in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most-feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson would lead the league in receptions eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in [[1936 Green Bay Packers season|1936]], [[1939 Green Bay Packers season|1939]] and [[1944 Green Bay Packers season|1944]]. An [[One-platoon system|iron man]], Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/don-hutson |title=Don Hutson: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers, and he was inducted as a charter member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963.

===1946–1958: Wilderness===
After Hutson's retirement, Lambeau could not stop the Packers' slide. He purchased a large lodge near Green Bay for team members and families to live. Rockwood Lodge was the home of the 1946–49 Packers. The 1947 and 1948 seasons produced a record of 12–10–1, and 1949 was even worse at 3–9. The lodge burned down on January 24, 1950, and insurance money paid for many of the Packers' debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9669836/mysterious-fire-1950-saved-green-bay-packers-espn-magazine|title=Blaze of Glory|last=Fleming|first=David|date=September 27, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2014|website=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tony Canadeo 1950 Bowman.jpg|thumb|A 1950 depiction of Tony Canadeo, whose #3 was retired by the Packers in 1952]]
Curly Lambeau departed after the [[1949 Green Bay Packers season|1949]] season. [[Gene Ronzani]] and [[Lisle Blackbourn]] could not coach the Packers back to their former magic, even as a new stadium was unveiled in 1957. The losing would descend to the disastrous [[1958 Green Bay Packers season|1958]] campaign under coach [[Ray McLean|Ray "Scooter" McLean]], whose lone 1–10–1 year at the helm is the worst in Packers history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In throes of winter, a team in disarry is reborn |first=David |last=Maraniss |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&amp;dat=19990914&amp;id=3P8cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lI4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5049,7209886 |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin |date=September 14, 1999 |page=2B |accessdate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959–1967: The Lombardi era and the glory years===
[[File:Vince lombardi bart starr.jpg|thumb|180px|Vince Lombardi and Bart Starr]]
Former [[New York Giants]] assistant [[Vince Lombardi]] was hired as Packers head coach and general manager on February 2, 1959. Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become ''the'' team of the 1960s, winning five World Championships over a seven-year span, including victories in the first two [[Super Bowl]]s. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included [[Bart Starr]], [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]], [[Carroll Dale]], [[Paul Hornung]] (as halfback and placekicker), [[Forrest Gregg]], and [[Jerry Kramer]]. The defense included [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]], [[Henry Jordan]], [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Ray Nitschke]], [[Dave Robinson (American football)|Dave Robinson]], and [[Herb Adderley]].

====1959: Lombardi's first season====
[[File:Nitschke packers.jpg|thumb|left|Ray Nitschke – his #66 jersey is one of six numbers [[List of Green Bay Packers retired numbers|retired by the Packers]]]]
The Packers' first regular season game under Lombardi was on September 27, 1959, a 9–6 victory over the [[1959 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in Green Bay. After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7–5 [[1959 Green Bay Packers season|record]] represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the [[NFL Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]].

====1960====
The next year, the [[1960 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], led by [[Paul Hornung]]'s 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL Championship]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] at [[Franklin Field|Philadelphia]]. In a see-saw game, the Packers trailed by only four points when All-Pro Eagle linebacker [[Chuck Bednarik]] tackled [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]] just nine yards short of the goal line as time expired.

====1961====
[[File:1961 Topps 40 Paul Hornung.jpg|thumb|left|The "Golden Boy" Paul Hornung, featured on a 1961 sports card]]
The [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] returned to the [[NFL Championship Game, 1961|NFL Championship game]] the following season and faced the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24 second-quarter points, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special "loan" from the [[United States Army|Army]] (one touchdown, four extra-points and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37–0 rout of the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/sports/football/16giants.html |title=NYTimes article of January 15, 2008 |work=The New York Times |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2011 |first=Bill |last=Pennington}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1961 that Green Bay became known as "Titletown."

====1962====
The [[1962 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] stormed back in the [[1962 NFL season|1962 season]], jumping out to a 10–0 start, on their way to a 13–1 season. This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to being featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on "The Sport of the '60s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19621221,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Cover: Vince Lombardi – Coaches – Wisconsin|publisher=Time.com |date=December 21, 1962 |accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the [[1962 New York Giants season|Giants]] in a much more brutal [[NFL Championship Game, 1962|championship game]] than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of [[Jerry Kramer]] and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16–7.

====1965====
The [[1965 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] returned to the [[History of NFL Championships|championship game]] in [[NFL Championship Game, 1965|1965]] following a two-year absence when they defeated the Colts in a playoff for the Western Conference title. That game would be remembered for [[Don Chandler]]'s controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled "good."  The 13–10 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion [[1965 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], helping the Packers win, 23–12, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall. [[1966 NFL season#Major rule changes|Goalpost uprights]] would be made taller the next year.

====1966: the first "AFL-NFL World Championship Game"====
[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis.jpg|right|thumb|Packers [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] (left) and [[Henry Jordan]] tackling a Chiefs player in the first AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl I). ]]
The [[1966 NFL season|1966 season]] saw the [[1966 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] led to the first-ever [[Super Bowl]] by [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] quarterback Bart Starr. The team went 12–2, and as time wound down in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1966|NFL Championship]] against the [[1966 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the Packers clung to a 34–27 lead. Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' [[Tom Brown (sportsman, born 1940)|Tom Brown]] intercepted [[Don Meredith]]'s pass in the end zone to seal the win. The team crowned its season by rolling over the [[American Football League|AFL]] champion [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 35–10 in [[Super Bowl I]].

====1967: Super Bowl II, and Lombardi's departure====
The [[1967 NFL season|1967 season]] was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/LombVi0.htm|title=Vince Lombardi Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|NFL Championship game]], a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the "Ice Bowl" as a result of the brutal conditions at [[Lambeau Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/12/28/ap-was-there-1967-cowboys-packers-ice-bowl-game/108970804/|title=AP Was There: 1967 Cowboys-Packers Ice Bowl game|work=USA TODAY|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/specials/100-greatest/?q=55-the-ice-bowl|title=The 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History {{!}} The Ice Bowl|website=Sports Illustrated's 100 Greatest Moments|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 16 seconds left, [[Bart Starr]]'s touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21–17 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship. They then won [[Super Bowl II]] with a 33–14 victory over the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor. Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the [[Washington Redskins]].

After Lombardi died unexpectedly on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers. The city of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing [[Lambeau Field]] at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.

===1968–1991: Post-Lombardi===
[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 16 - Eddie Lee Ivery.jpg|thumb|right|The Packers, pictured against Cardinals in the [[1982–83 NFL playoffs|1982–83 playoffs]], only qualified for the postseason twice during the team's post-Lombardi "dark ages" (1969–91).]]
For about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 strike season]]. They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1–2 record. The period saw five different head coaches&amp;nbsp;– [[Phil Bengtson]], [[Dan Devine]], [[Bart Starr]], [[Forrest Gregg]], and [[Lindy Infante]]&amp;nbsp;– two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two second-rounders and a third) to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] for aging quarterback [[John Hadl]], who would spend only 1{{sfrac|1|2}} seasons in Green Bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.jsonline.com:80/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ Old School Packers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218153613/http://www2.jsonline.com/packer/insider/history/oldschool/ |date=February 18, 2006 }} from the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] website.

Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations, earning him [[ESPN]]'s ranking as the third "biggest sports flop" in the last 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/25biggestflops The 25 Biggest Sports Flops (1979–2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524183133/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker%2F25biggestflops |date=May 24, 2011 }} from [[ESPN25]].

===1992–2007: Brett Favre era===

He had his #4 jersey retired by the Packers in 2015.]]
The Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with [[Ron Wolf]] hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season. In 1992, Wolf hired [[San Francisco 49ers]] offensive coordinator [[Mike Holmgren]] as the Packers' new head coach.

Soon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for a first-round pick. Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback [[Don Majkowski]] and leading a comeback over the [[1992 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]]. He started the following week, a win against the [[1992 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the [[Most consecutive starts by a quarterback (NFL)|record]] for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the [[New York Jets]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] with the [[Most consecutive starts (NFL)|streak]] finally coming to an end [[Brett Favre#Consecutive starts streak|late in the 2010 season]].

The [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] had a 9–7 record in [[1992 NFL season|1992]], and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in [[Reggie White]] on the defense in 1993. White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a "total commitment to winning." With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the [[1993 NFL season|1993]] and [[1994 NFL season|1994]] seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], the [[1995 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37–20 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1995 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 27–17 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the [[NFC Championship Game]], where they lost again to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38–27.

====1996: Super Bowl XXXI champions====
[[File:19981213 28 Reggie White, Lambeau Field.jpg|thumb|Reggie White in 1998. White is widely considered one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and had his number retired by the Packers in 2005]]
In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13–3 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with [[Brett Favre]] leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Desmond Howard]] returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the [[1996 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] in a muddy 35–14 beatdown and [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] 30–13, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In [[Super Bowl XXXI]], Green Bay defeated the [[1996 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 35–21 to win their 12th world championship. [[Desmond Howard]] was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers president [[Bob Harlan]] credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at [[ESPN]] ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.

====1997: defeat in Super Bowl XXXII====
The following season the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] recorded another 13–3 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship. After defeating the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21–7 and [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 23–10 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11{{sfrac|1|2}} point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to [[John Elway]] and the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]], by the score of 31–24.

====1998: Holmgren's last season====
[[File:19981213 24 Mike Holmgren, Lambeau Field,.jpg|thumb|Holmgren, one of three Packer coaches to win a Super Bowl, pictured in 1998]]
In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] went 11–5 and met the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver [[Antonio Freeman]]. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when [[Terrell Owens]] caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver [[Jerry Rice]] fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs98/news/1999/990103/01025866.html|title=ESPN.com: Instant replay comes back to haunt Holmgren|website=static.espn.go.com|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager and head coach of the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and [[Reggie White]] also retired after the season (but later played one season for the [[Carolina Panthers]] in 2000).

====1999: Ray Rhodes' one-year tenure====
In 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. [[Ray Rhodes]] was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8–8 [[1999 Green Bay Packers season|season]]. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.

=====2000–05: Mike Sherman as head coach=====
[[File:MikeSherman2003.jpg|thumb|left|Coach Mike Sherman, pictured in 2003]]
In 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with [[Mike Sherman]]. Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.

From 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, [[Ahman Green]], and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Prior to 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13–0, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended January 4, 2003, when the [[2002 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] 27–7 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the [[2004 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] two years later.

By the end of the 2004 season, the Packers team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations [[Ted Thompson]] as the new executive vice president, general manager and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4–12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.

====2006–07: McCarthy arrives, Favre departs====
[[File:Donald Driver - October 24, 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Former Packers wide-receiver [[Donald Driver]]]]
In 2006, Thompson hired [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], the former [[offensive coordinator]] for the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[New Orleans Saints]] as his new head coach. McCarthy had also previously served as the [[quarterbacks coach]] for the Packers in 1999.

After missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; it would turn out to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13–3, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]], acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42–20. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver [[Donald Driver]] (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Ben |title=Playful Favre accurate even with snowball |url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/01/13/playful-favre-accurate-even-with-snowball/ |website=East Bay Times |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in Green Bay. The game was lost 23–20 on an overtime field goal by [[Lawrence Tynes]]. This would be [[Brett Favre]]'s final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.

[[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] coached the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team during the [[2008 Pro Bowl]] in Hawaii. [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and [[Aaron Kampman]] were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. [[Donald Driver]] was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. [[Brett Favre]] was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] [[quarterback]] [[Jeff Garcia]]. The Packers also had several first alternates, including [[offensive tackle]] [[Chad Clifton]] and [[linebacker]] [[Nick Barnett]].

In December 2007, [[Ted Thompson]] was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers. In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.

===2008–present: Aaron Rodgers era===

====2008: Transition====
{{Main|2008 Green Bay Packers season}}
[[Image:Aaron Rodgers 2008 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|240px|Quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2008.]]

On March 4, 2008, [[Brett Favre]] tearfully announced his retirement. Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], effective August 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3517219|title=NFL grants Favre reinstatement; sources say QB job is open|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 3, 2008|date=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]] for a conditional draft pick in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |title=Packers trade Favre to Jets |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |author=Jay Glazer |authorlink=Jay Glazer |date=August 6, 2008 |work=Fox Sports on MSN |quote=The month-long saga has finally come to an end, with the Packers agreeing to trade their future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to the New York Jets, FOXSports.com has learned. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819213402/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |archivedate=August 19, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Packers began their [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]] with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or less, finishing with a 6–10 record. After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by McCarthy, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by [[Dom Capers]].

====2009: Return to the playoffs====
{{Main|2009 Green Bay Packers season}}
In March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected defensive lineman [[B. J. Raji]] of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker [[Clay Matthews III]] of the [[University of Southern California]].

During the [[2009 NFL season]], two match-ups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a [[Monday Night Football]] game which broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer Board of Directors member [[Bud Selig]] forced baseball's [[Minnesota Twins]] to play 2 games within a 12-hour span. The Vikings won the game 30–23. [[Brett Favre]] threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.&lt;ref name="nfl.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/gamelogs?id=FAV540222 |title=Brett Favre: Game Logs at |publisher=NFL  |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38–26, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the win-less [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of tackle [[Mark Tauscher]] bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning a NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11–5 regular-season record. The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies [[Brad Jones (American football)|Brad Jones]] and [[Clay Matthews III]] becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like [[James Jones (wide receiver)|James Jones]], [[Brandon Jackson (American football)|Brandon Jackson]], [[Jermichael Finley]] and [[Jordy Nelson]] becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback [[Charles Woodson]] won [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]], [[Tramon Williams]], [[Will Blackmon]], [[Atari Bigby]] and [[Brandon Underwood]] severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a [[2010 NFL Playoffs#Wild Card playoffs|wild card round]] shootout at the [[Arizona Cardinals]], 51–45.

====2010: Super Bowl XLV championship====
{{Main|2010 Green Bay Packers season}}
[[File:Mike McCarthy (TJG).JPG|thumb|Former [[Super Bowl]] winning Packers head coach [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]]]]

The team lost [[Johnny Jolly]] to a season-long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy. Their running corps suffered a blow when RB [[Ryan Grant (running back)|Ryan Grant]] sustained a season-ending ankle injury in Week 1.&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/2010/09/14/2224606/nfl-news-jets-jenkins-and-packers.html] Jets’ Jenkins and Packers’ Grant are both out for the season – Associated Press {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919111508/http://www.kansascity.com/2010/09/14/2224606/nfl-news-jets-jenkins-and-packers.html|date=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the season, the team had 16 people on [[injured reserve]], including 7 starters: running back Ryan Grant, tight end [[Jermichael Finley]], linebacker [[Nick Barnett]], safety [[Morgan Burnett]], linebacker [[Brandon Chillar]], tackle [[Mark Tauscher]], and linebacker [[Brad Jones (American football)|Brad Jones]].

After finishing the regular season 10–6 the Packers clinched the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs. They first faced No. 3 seeded [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]], winning 21–16. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seeded [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]] 48–21. They then played the [[Chicago Bears]] at [[Soldier Field]] in the NFC Championship Game – only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33–14 Chicago victory which sent them to the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]]). Green Bay won 21–14 to move on to [[Super Bowl XLV]]. On February 6, 2011, they defeated the AFC champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 31–25, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/live-blog-follow-super-bowl-action-here/|title=Super Bowl XLV, Packers Beat Steelers, 31–25|date=February 7, 2011|work=New York Times|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-super-bowl-20110207,0,1269152.story|title=Ending is cheddar-perfect for Packers in Super Bowl XLV victory over Steelers|date=February 7, 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 7, 2011|first=Sam|last=Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011: 15–1 season====
{{main|2011 Green Bay Packers season}}
[[File:Clay Matthews (52), Charles Woodson (21).jpg|thumb|Clay Matthews (52) and Charles Woodson (21), two defensive stars for the Packers under Coach Mike McCarthy]]
In 2011, coming off their victory in Super Bowl XLV, the Packers won their first 13 games, eventually finishing the season 15–1. The 15 victories marked the franchise record for wins in a season, and tied for second most regular-season wins in NFL history, behind only the [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 Patriots]] who went 16–0. Following the season, Aaron Rodgers would be named the NFL's MVP, his first such award.

Despite receiving home-field advantage, Green Bay lost their first game to eventual [[Super Bowl XLVI]] champion [[New York Giants]], 37–20.

====2012====
{{main|2012 Green Bay Packers season}}
With an 11–5 record, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild card round 24–10, but lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to the [[Super Bowl XLVII|eventual NFC Champion]] [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] by a score of 45–31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2012_games.htm |title=2012 Green Bay Packers Schedule &amp; Game Results |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Packers offense finished the season fifth in points and eleventh in yards per game. The defense finished eleventh in points allowed and twenty-second in yards allowed per game.

The Packers topped the first-ever [[AP Pro32 rankings]], a new pro football version of the [[AP Top 25]] college football and basketball polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilner|first=Barry|title=Packers top first-ever AP Pro32 rankings|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/31/packers-top-first-ever-ap-pro32-rankings/|accessdate=July 31, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013: injury to Rodgers====
{{main|2013 Green Bay Packers season}}
In 2013, the Packers started 5–2, leading up to a Week 9 match-up against the Bears. It was in that game which the Packers lost Aaron Rodgers to a broken [[Clavicle|collarbone]]; Rodgers would miss the next six games, during which the club would go 2–3–1 under three different quarterbacks: [[Seneca Wallace]] (injured during first start), [[Scott Tolzien]] (benched), and [[Matt Flynn]].

Despite having a 7–7–1 record, the Packers were still in a position to win the NFC North division, if they were able to win their final game. With Rodgers returning, the Packers managed to beat the Bears in a Week 9 rematch, 33–28. Finishing at 8–7–1, the Packers won their division and were awarded a home playoff game. However, despite Rodgers' return, the Packers would lose to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] 20–23 in the first round of the playoffs.

====2014====
{{main|2014 Green Bay Packers season}}
The Packers recorded their 700th victory, against the Bears, in Week 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ketchman|first=Vic|url=http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-game-recap/article-1/Win-over-Bears-feels-like-season-saver/ca5a771c-c8d3-4a16-b1bd-29afe2c40ab1|title=Win over Bears feels like season saver|publisher=Green Bay Packers|date=September 28, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team went undefeated at home for the first time since the 2011 season; they also led the league in scoring, with 486 points, the second-most in franchise history. The 2014 season also marked the first time since 2009 that the team had a 4,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 1,000-yard rusher. Overall, the team went 12–4, clinching the #2 seed in the NFC and a fourth consecutive NFC North division title, making the playoffs for the sixth straight season, tying a franchise record. The Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional round, advancing to the NFC Championship to face the Seattle Seahawks. After leading throughout most of regulation, the Packers lost 28–22 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle.

Following the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the second time.

====2015====
{{main|2015 Green Bay Packers season}}
[[File:Jordy Nelson 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Jordy Nelson, who tore his ACL in the 2015 preseason, and would go on to be the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] the following 2016 season upon returning from his injury]]
During Week 2 of the preseason against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught an eight-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers, but then fell to the turf without contact. A few days later, it was revealed that Nelson had torn his ACL. He would remain inactive for the rest of the 2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wesseling|first=Chris|title=Jordy Nelson out for 2015 season with knee injury|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000514941/article/jordy-nelson-out-for-2015-season-with-knee-injury|publisher=National Football League|date=August 23, 2015|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even without Nelson, the Packers managed to get off to a 6–0 start, but the Packers then lost four of their next five games, falling to 7–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/schedules/2015/REG/PACKERS|title=Green Bay Packers 2015 Regular Season Schedule - NFL.com|website=www.nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, against the [[Detroit Lions]], the Packers quickly fell to a 20–0 deficit going into halftime. Green Bay started to make a comeback in the second half thanks to a touchdown by [[Davante Adams]] and a 27-yard touchdown run by Aaron Rodgers to bring the game within two points at 23–21. The Packers then got the ball back in their possession with 23 seconds left in the game. While attempting a "lateral" play, Rodgers was sacked with no time remaining but then a flag was thrown for a facemask penalty on Detroit. The Packers now had one more un-timed play, which Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown to tight end [[Richard Rodgers (American football)|Richard Rodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|title=Packers stun Lions on Aaron Rodgers' Hail Mary TD|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000593884/article/packers-stun-lions-on-aaron-rodgers-hail-mary-td|publisher=National Football League|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest Hail Mary touchdown pass thrown in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000771998/article/ranking-aaron-rodgers-three-hail-mary-completions|title=Ranking Aaron Rodgers' three Hail Mary completions|work=NFL.com|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Bay then finished the season 10–6 and 2nd in the NFC North behind the [[Minnesota Vikings]].

The Packers beat the [[Washington Redskins]] in the NFC wild card game to advance to the divisional round with the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. A similar play to tie the game against the Cardinals happened between Aaron Rodgers and [[Jeff Janis]]. Janis caught a 41-yard touchdown from Rodgers which sent the game into overtime. However, the Packers fell to Arizona 26–20, ending their season.

====2016====
{{main|2016 Green Bay Packers season}}
After a 4–6 start to the season, the Packers went on a six-game winning streak to finish the regular season with a 10–6 record. The team clinched the NFC North for the fifth time in six years with their Week 17 win over the Detroit Lions. They routed the fifth-seeded New York Giants, 38–13, in the wild-card round of the playoffs and upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, 34–31, in the divisional round of the playoffs, but their season came to an end when they were beaten by the second-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, 44–21.

====2017====
{{main|2017 Green Bay Packers season}}
The Green Bay Packers began the 2017 regular season with a 4–2 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/standings|title=2017 NFL Regular Season Standings – Nation Football League|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, during a week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Rodgers was driven to the ground by Vikings linebacker [[Anthony Barr (American football)|Anthony Barr]] after throwing a pass.

During Rodgers' absence, backup quarterback [[Brett Hundley]] stepped into the starting role for the first time in his professional career, but struggled to replicate Rodgers' success, despite a [[2018 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]]-caliber season by receiver [[Davante Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Brian |title=Packers WR Davante Adams named to 2018 Pro Bowl |url=https://247sports.com/nfl/green-bay-packers/Bolt/Green-Bay-Packers-WR-Davante-Adams-named-to-2018-NFL-Pro-Bowl--113797408 |website=247Sports |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 23–0 loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in week 11, the Packers suffered their first shutout at Lambeau Field in 11 years (the last time was a 35–0 loss to the [[New England Patriots]] in [[2006 Green Bay Packers season|2006]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrosepress.com/national/sports/green-bay-packers-shut-out-for-first-time-in-more/article_6e332621-c710-5df9-8610-db01cd9b12fb.html|title=Green Bay Packers shut out for first time in more than a decade|website=MontrosePress.com|access-date=November 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123070538/http://www.montrosepress.com/national/sports/green-bay-packers-shut-out-for-first-time-in-more/article_6e332621-c710-5df9-8610-db01cd9b12fb.html|archive-date=November 23, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Packers finished the season at 7–9, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008.

The city of Green Bay had a population of only 104,057 as of the 2010 census,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2010 Census | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html | publisher = [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060923205832/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/55/5531000.html | archivedate = September 23, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in [[Milwaukee]] through 1995. It was only when baseball-only [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay.

There have been five stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923. Most recently, $64 million was raised in 2011–2012&lt;ref name="2011 stock sale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7303647/green-bay-packers-plan-stock-sale-fifth-team-history |title=Packers plan fifth stock sale |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=December 1, 2011 |access-date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards a $143-million Lambeau Field expansion. Demand exceeded expectations, and the original 250,000 share limit had to be increased before some 250,000 new buyers from all 50 U.S. states and Canada purchased 269,000 shares at $250 apiece, approximately 99% online.&lt;ref name="sharehist"/&gt;

The original "Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation", enacted in 1923, specified that should the franchise be sold, any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the [[American Legion]] to build "a proper soldier's memorial." This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="sharehist"/&gt;

Even though it is referred to as "common stock" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with [[common stock|common]] or [[preferred stock]]. It does not include an [[equity (finance)|equity]] interest, does not pay [[dividends]], can not be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to purchase exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.&lt;ref name="WSJ Worst Stock"/&gt; Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.&lt;ref name="sharehist"/&gt;

Green Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which does not comply with current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/63869 |title=Home |publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year.

===Board of Directors===
[[Green Bay Packers, Inc.]], is governed by a seven-member Executive Committee elected from a 45-member board of directors. It consists of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large; only the president is compensated. Responsibilities include directing corporate management, approving major capital expenditures, establishing broad policy, and monitoring management performance.

The team's elected president normally represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings. During his time as coach [[Vince Lombardi]] generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings, where president Dominic Olejniczak appeared.&lt;ref name="birtem" /&gt;

===Green Bay Packers Foundation===
{{Main|Green Bay Packers Foundation}}
The team created the Green Bay Packers Foundation in December 1986. It assists in a wide variety of activities and programs benefiting education, civic affairs, health services, human services and youth-related programs.

At the team's 1997 annual stockholders meeting the foundation was designated in place of a Sullivan-Wallen Post soldiers memorial as recipient of any residual assets upon the team's sale or dissolution.

[[File:cheesehead.jpg|thumb|A cheesehead hat, commonly worn by many Packer fans]]

Packers fans are often referred to as [[cheesehead]]s,&lt;ref name="xybioh"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Big Cheese: Cheesehead inventor profits from insults | url = http://curb.journalism.wisc.edu/2002/refueling/foamation.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714205747/http://curb.journalism.wisc.edu/2002/refueling/foamation.html | archivedate = July 14, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans.&lt;ref name = "xybioh"/&gt; Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays.

During training camp in the summer months, held outside the [[Don Hutson Center]], young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at [[Ray Nitschke Field]]. This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. [[Gary Knafelc]], a Packers end at the time, said, "I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'" Each new generation of Packer fan delights at the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters to Lee Remmel, August 25, 2004 |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2004/08/25/2/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226083112/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2004/08/25/2/ |archivedate=December 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team holds an annual scrimmage called Family Night, typically an intra-squad affair, at Lambeau Field. During 2004 and 2005 sellout crowds of over 60,000 fans showed up, with an all-time mark of 62,492 set in 2005 when the [[Buffalo Bills]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Packers Training Camp – Family Night | url = http://www.packerstrainingcamp.com/family_night/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, [[ESPN.com]] ranked Packers fans as second-best in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Matt|last= Mosley|title= NFL's best fans?

Needing to outfit his new squad, team founder [[Curly Lambeau]] solicited funds from his employer, the [[Indian Packing Company]]. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as "the Indians", but by the time they played their first game "Packers" had taken hold.

Indian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with "ACME PACKERS" emblazoned on its jerseys.

===Team colors===
Lambeau, a [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] alumnus, borrowed its [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Irish]]'s navy blue and gold team colors, much as [[George Halas]] borrowed his [[University of Illinois|Illinois]] alma mater's for the [[Chicago Bears]]. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the "Bays" or the "Blues" (and even occasionally as "the Big Bay Blues").

By 1950, Green Bay had changed its colors to hunter green and gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of "throwback" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the [[Detroit Lions]], in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packers.com/history/fast_facts/uniform_history/ Packers Uniform History, 1921–2004] from Packers.com.

In 1951, the team finally stopped wearing leather helmets, adopting the metallic gold plastic headgear it has used ever since. The oval "G" logo was added in 1961 when Lombardi asked Packers equipment manager Gerald "Dad" Braisher to design a logo. Braisher tasked his assistant, St. Norbert College art student John Gordon. Satisfied with a football-shaped letter "G", the pair presented it to Lombardi, who then approved the addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Thomas |last2=Hurly |first2=Jim|title=Green Bay: A City and Its Team |year=2011 |publisher=Hurly Investments |isbn=

===Uniform variation===
While several NFL teams choose to wear white jerseys at home early in the season due to white's ability to reflect the late summer sun rays, the Packers have done so only twice, during the opening two games of the 1989 season. However, the team did wear an all-white uniform in 2016 versus the [[Chicago Bears]] during the two teams' designated [[Color Rush]] game, in which Chicago wore all-navy uniforms. The Packers again wore an all-white uniform at Lambeau in the Color Rush game against the Bears (who again wore all-navy uniforms) in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://247sports.com/nfl/green-bay-packers/Bolt/Green-Bay-Packers-to-wear-color-rush-uniforms-vs-Chicago-Bears--108117457/|title=Green Bay Packers to wear color rush uniforms vs. Chicago Bears|work=Green Bay Packers|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although alternate gold jerseys with green numbers are sold on a retail basis, the team currently has no plans to introduce such a jersey to be used in actual games.

During the 2010 season, the Packers paid tribute to their historical roots with a throwback jersey modeled after that worn by the club in 1929, during its first world championship season. The jersey was navy blue, again making the Packers "the Blues."&lt;ref name="UniWatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/ |title=There’s No Service Like Wire Service, Vol. 6 |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WLUK-TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox11online.com/dpp/sports/packers-blue-jerseys |title=Packers in blue jerseys? |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225143833/http://www.fox11online.com/dpp/sports/packers-blue-jerseys |archivedate=February 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium history==
[[File:Lambeau-field.jpg|thumb|Lambeau Field after its 2003 renovation]]
After their early seasons at [[Bellevue Park (stadium)|Bellevue Park]] and [[Hagemeister Park]], the Packers played home games in [[City Stadium (Green Bay)|City Stadium]] from 1925 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://100.packers.com/stadiums/city-stadium|title=City Stadium|website=Packers 100 Seasons|language=en|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team won its first six NFL world championships there.

By the 1950s the wooden 25,000 seat arena was considered outmoded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox11online.com/news/fox-11-investigates/fox11-investigates-close-calls-on-the-packers-calling-green-bay-home|title=FOX 11 Investigates: Close calls on the Packers calling Green Bay home|last=Investigates|first=Mark Leland, FOX 11|work=WLUK|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFL threatened to move the franchise to Milwaukee full-time unless it got a better stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2017/09/29/how-lambeau-field-saved-packers-green-bay/715588001/|title=How Lambeau Field saved the Packers in Green Bay|work=Packers News|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city responded by building a new 32,150 [[seating capacity|seat]] City Stadium for the team, the first built exclusively for an NFL team, which opened in time for the [[1957 Green Bay Packers season|1957]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/green-bay-packers-have-deep-roots-in-milwaukee-090916|title=Green Bay Packers Have Deep Roots in Milwaukee|date=September 9, 2016|work=FOX Sports|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 to honor Curly Lambeau, who had died earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/sports/packers/181932681.html/|title=Sept. 29, 1957: Birth of Lambeau Field|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanded seven times before the end of the 1990s, Lambeau Field capacity reached 60,890. In 2003, it was extensively renovated to expand seating, modernize stadium facilities, and add an atrium area. Even with a current seating capacity of 72,928, ticket demand far outpaces supply, as all Packers games have been sold out since 1960. About 86,000 names are on the waiting list for season tickets.&lt;ref name="packtix" /&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambeaufield.com/stadium_info/history/lambeau_expansions/ |title=LambeauField.com &amp;#0187; Stadium Info &amp;#0187; History &amp;#0187; Lambeau Expansions |date=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Green Bay Packers |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090428020438/http://www.lambeaufield.com/stadium_info/history/lambeau_expansions/ |archivedate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The Packers played part of their home slate in Milwaukee starting in 1933, including two to three home games each year in [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Milwaukee County Stadium|County Stadium]] from 1953 to 1994. Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, threat of an [[American Football League]] franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a [[NFL playoffs, 1967#Conference championships|Western Conference Playoff]] in 1967.

County Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the [[warning track]]. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|new stadium]] prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the "Gold Package" plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/tickets/season-tickets.html|title=Green &amp; Gold Package Scheduling|publisher=Packers.com|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field: the [[Don Hutson Center]], an indoor facility; [[Ray Nitschke Field]], an outdoor field with artificial [[FieldTurf]]; and [[Clarke Hinkle Field]], an outdoor field with natural grass.

The Packers have been league champions a record 13 times,&lt;ref name=championships/&gt; topping their nearest rival, the Chicago Bears, by four. The first three were decided by league standing, the next six by the [[History of National Football League Championship|NFL Title Game]], and the last four by [[Super Bowl]] victories. The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive NFL titles, having accomplished this twice – from 1929 to 1931 under Lambeau, and from 1965 to 1967 under Lombardi.

====NFL Championship by standings====
From 1920 to 1932, the NFL championship was awarded based on standings, with no championship game taking place. The Packers won three such championships.

==Media==
The Packers are unique in having their market area cover two media markets, both Green Bay and Milwaukee. [[NFL blackout]] restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since [[1972 NFL season|1972]] (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game—preseason, regular season and playoffs—has been sold out since 1960.

===Radio===
The [[flagship station]] of the [[Packers Radio Network]] is [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps Radio]]'s [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the [[Journal Media Group|Journal Broadcast Group]] before its merger with Scripps in April 2015. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on [[WTAQ]] (1360/97.5) and [[WIXX-FM]] (101.1), and [[WAPL]] (105.7) and [[WHBY]] (1150) in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and the [[Fox Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/gameday/packers_radio_network/station_listing/ |title=Packers Radio Station Listing |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Larrivee]] is the play-by-play announcer and [[Larry McCarren]] is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/radio-shows/packers-radio-network.html |title=Packers Radio Network |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Irwin (sportscaster)|Jim Irwin]] and [[Max McGee]] were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of "And there is your dagger!" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station [[WKTI]] (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts.

===Television===
The TV rights for pre-season games, not nationally broadcast are held by Scripps television stations [[WGBA-TV]] (Channel 26) in Green Bay and [[WTMJ-TV]] (Channel 4) in Milwaukee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/141227143.html|title=Packers and Journal Broadcast Group announce partnership deal|last=Wolfley|first=Bob|date=March 2, 2012|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Quincy Media]]'s six [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stations in the central, northern and western parts of the state, [[KQDS-TV]] (Channel 21) in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], and in [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]]/[[Marquette, Michigan]], [[WLUC-TV]] (Channel 6), along with their [[WLUC-DT2|Fox subchannel]]. As such, these stations are authorized to use the tagline ''Your official Packers station'' in their market area by the team, and also carry two weeknight programs; ''Packers Live'' on Tuesday evening, and the weekly coach's show, ''The Mike McCarthy Show'' on Wednesday evenings at 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm throughout the football season. Until the end of the 2011 season, the team's partner in Green Bay was [[WFRV-TV]] (Channel 5), and sister satellite [[WJMN-TV]] in Escanaba. As part of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as [[sports director]] of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013, as his [[non-compete clause]] to appear as a sports anchor in Green Bay expired, though he retired as sports director in March 2015 to focus full-time on his duties for the Packer radio and television networks. WFRV/WJMN still airs any Packers regular season home games against an AFC team.

The 2012 TV rights deal expanded the team's preseason network further across the Midwest. Additional stations include the [[Quad Cities]] region of Iowa/Illinois where game coverage is carried by [[KLJB]] (Channel 18) in [[Davenport, Iowa]] and [[KGCW]] (Channel 26) in [[Burlington, Iowa]], both owned by [[Grant Broadcasting System II]], [[KCWI-TV]] (Channel 23) in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[KWWL (TV)|KWWL]] (Channel 7) in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], and in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[KMTV-TV]] (Channel 3), a sister Scripps station to WTMJ and WGBA. As part of a large package of preseason football from various team networks, [[KFVE]] (Channel 9) in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] also carried Packers state network games in the 2016 preseason. The network also added its first affiliate with [[Spanish language]] play-by-play, Milwaukee's [[WYTU-LD]] (Channel 63/49.4), a [[Telemundo]] affiliate, which airs statewide on [[Charter Communications|Spectrum]] systems. The Spanish broadcast is also simulcast by Scripps' [[WACY-TV]] (Channel 32) in the Green Bay/Appleton market (WACY is an otherwise English-language [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate).

Pre-season coverage is produced by [[CBS Sports|CBS]], formerly using the ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' graphics package until the last contract ended as a remnant of WFRV's former ownership by the CBS Corporation itself until 2007. In 2012, the pre-season coverage began to use the [[NBC Sports]] ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' graphics package due to WTMJ/WGBA's NBC affiliation. The TV play-by-play announcer, [[Kevin Harlan]] (also on loan from CBS), is the son of former Packers president [[Bob Harlan]], with [[Rich Gannon]] joining him as color commentator. Since the 2008 pre-season all Packers preseason games on the statewide network are produced and aired in [[high definition television|high definition]], with WTMJ-TV subcontracting the games to minor network affiliates in Milwaukee during [[Summer Olympics]] years due to mandatory non-preemption policies by their network, [[NBC]] (this was not done in 2012 as the pre-season opener was a national ESPN game). In Green Bay, WACY carries preseason games in English if WGBA is unable to during Olympics years.

[[ESPN]] ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games, both pre-season and season, are broadcast over the air on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WLUK-TV]] in Green Bay and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) in Milwaukee (ABC affiliate [[WBAY-TV]] in Green Bay carried those games from 2006 until 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2016 season was first where that station has not carried a Packer game in its history), while the stations airing Packers games in the [[NFL Network]] ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package have varied over the years depending on arrangements for syndication or co-network productions and simulcasts with CBS or NBC. WBAY's evening [[news anchor]] Bill Jartz also serves as the [[public address]] system announcer for Lambeau Field.

The team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as ''Packers Family Night'', was broadcast for over a decade by [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] (Channel 6) in Milwaukee, and produced by WLUK-TV in Green Bay, both Fox affiliates which broadcast the bulk of the team's regular-season games, along with the state's other Fox affiliates until the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packers.com/media-center/tv-shows.html |title=Green Bay Packers TV Broadcast Partners |publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.

==In popular culture==
On ''[[That '70s Show]]'', in season 7 episode 14, [[Donna Pinciotti]] gave away the gang including [[Red Forman]], a long-time Packer fan, and six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears.  In the [[That '70s Show (season 8)|season 8]] finale, Red declined moved to Florida after [[Steven Hyde]] bought him season tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carseywerner.net/inflight/that70sshow/70s_822.htm|title=That '70s Show Episode Synopses|website=www.carseywerner.net|access-date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, six members of the Packers—[[David Bakhtiari]]; [[Don Barclay (American football)|Don Barclay]]; [[T.J. Lang]]; [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]]; [[Jordan Rodgers]] and [[Josh Sitton]]—made an appearance as an a cappella group in the musical comedy ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/pitch-perfect-2-kay-cannon|title=How the Green Bay Packers Cameo in Pitch Perfect 2 Happened|last=Rich|first=Katey|work=HWD|access-date=March 3, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hannover Scorpions''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team, which plays in the [[Oberliga (ice hockey)|Oberliga]], Germany's third tier ice hockey league. They previously played in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]] from 1996 to 2013.

==History==
Founded in 1975 as ESC Wedemark, the team was renamed Wedemark Scorpions in their first DEL season in 1996 after the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], who also call [[Hannover]], [[Lower Saxony]] their home. The next season, the Scorpions relocated to Hannover proper and began playing their home games at [[TUI Arena]] in 2000.

Despite playing in the region's top venue, as well as enjoying sizeable corporate and political support, the team has struggled to generate sustained interest in Hannover.

Before relocating there in 1997, the Scorpions played their home games in Mellendorf, a small town located 20&amp;nbsp;km north in [[Wedemark|Wedemark township]]. They were actually considered rivals of Hannover. Thus, many local fans resented their longtime foe taking over the Hannover market at the expense of the city's historic hockey team, the less-favored [[Hannover Indians|Indians]], and refused to support the Scorpions. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the club stricken by financial problems at the conclusion of the [[2012–13 DEL season|2012–13]] season, the Scorpions were forced to sell their DEL license to [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]] club the [[Schwenningen Wild Wings]] on June 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb| url = http://www.hannoverscorpions.de/scorpions-aktuell.php?nid=1115 | title = DEL club allow Scorpions license move to Schwenningen | publisher = ''Hannover Scorpions'' | date = 2013-06-14 | accessdate = 2013-06-14 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scorpions were then placed in the Oberliga, Germany's third tier league, due to the hiatus of the 2nd Bundesliga for the 2013–14 season.

'''Ministry of Youth and Sports of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Мiнiстерство молоді та спорту України}}) is a [[government of Ukraine]] body established on 28 February 2013 by merging departments of the dissolved [[Ministry of Education and Science, Youth and Sports of Ukraine (dissolved)|Ministry of Education &amp; Science, Youth &amp; Sport (2010-2013)]] and State Service of Youth and Sport.

==History==
In 1997–2005 the organ was a state committee, in 2010-2013 - a state service. The ministry of youth and sports was first created in 1991 when two state committees of physical culture and sports and another of juvenile affairs were merged. In 1996 the organ was split again until 2000. In 2000 the two agencies were merged again along with the state committee of tourism for less than a year. In 2005 the ministry of youth and sports was reestablished again and later was joined with another agency the ministry of family affairs and children. In 2010 the consolidated ministry was merged again with the ministry of education and science for the next three years, while agency for sports was degraded to the state service of youth and sports. Finally in 2013 the state service again was given the ministerial portfolio.

The agency in charge of tourism was oscillated and renamed in 2001 as the State Tourism Administration and later was transferred to the [[Ministry of Culture (Ukraine)|Ministry of Culture]] in 2004.

The '''mountains classification in the Vuelta a España''' is a secondary classification in the [[Vuelta a España]]. For this classification, points are given to the cyclists who cross the mountain peaks first. The classification was established in 1935, when it was won by Italian [[Edoardo Molinar]], and until 2005 the leader in the mountain classification wore a green jersey. In 2006, it became an orange jersey, and in 2010 it became white with blue dots.

Spaniard [[José Luis Laguía]] has won this classification a record five times, including three consecutive. Other cyclists who have won this ranking for three consecutive times were [[Antonio Suárez]], [[Antonio Karmany]], [[Julio Jiménez]], [[José María Jiménez]], all Spaniards. Overall, the Spaniards have dominated this classification by 47 out of 68 times.

In 2010, [[David Moncoutié]] considered retirement, but remained a professional cyclist to try to win his third consecutive mountains classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/moncoutie-prepares-for-historic-challenge|title=Moncoutié prepares for historic challenge|first=Hedwig|last=Kröner|date=15 January 2010|work=Cyclingnews.com|publisher=Future Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he became the first rider ever to win this award in four consecutive years.

==Jersey==
As of 2010, the leader of the mountains classification is awarded a white jersey with blue dots.&lt;ref name="rules2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavuelta.com/10/en/resultados/docs/reglamento.pdf|type=PDF|title=Specific Regulations 65 Edition Vuelta Spain|publisher=Unipublic|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mountains jersey is third in the rankings of jerseys, behind the jersey for the [[general classification in the Vuelta a España|general classification]] and [[points classification in the Vuelta a España]] but before the [[combination classification in the Vuelta a España|combination classification]]; this means that if a cyclists leads both the general classification and the mountains classification, he wears the jersey for the general classification, and the mountains jersey is passed on to the second cyclist in that ranking.

==Rules==
The organisation of the Vuelta designates which climbs are given points, and in which category they fall. As of 2010, there are 5 categories: most points are scored on the Top [[Alberto Fernández (cyclist)|Alberto Fernandez]], the highest point of the Vuelta.&lt;ref name="rules2010" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Points distribution
|-
! Class !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6
|-
! Top [[Alberto Fernández (cyclist)|Alberto Fernandez]]
| 20 || 15 || 10 || 6 || 4 || 2
|-
! High climb finish
| 15 || 10 || 6 || 4 || 2
|-
! First category
| 10 || 6 || 4 || 2 || 1
|-
! Second category
| 5 || 3 || 1
|-
! Third category
| 3 || 2 || 1
|}
If two or more cyclists have the same number of points, the cyclist who was first on the 'Top Alberto Fernandez' gets the higher ranking. If that does not solve the problem, the cyclists with the most high climb finishes wins gets the higher ranking. If that does not solve it, the cyclists with the most first category wins, and so on. If after the third category there is still a tie, the order in the general classification is used.

==International match hosting problem==
The venue hosted its last international match in 2006. Transportion problems, player's accommodation problems, are a few of problems for which [[Bangladesh Cricket Board]] which preclude matches being hosted at the venue. In the city there is no International/Domestic Airport which made it difficult to host international matches. Moreover, there are not many hotels of 4/5 stars as required by the ICC.&lt;ref name="espncricinfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/56670.html |title=Shaheed Chandu Stadium - Bangladesh - Cricket Grounds |work=ESPN Cricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bangladesh Cricket Board]] and the [[Government of Bangladesh]] are trying to solve problems related to hosting so that the venue can come back to host international matches as soon as possible.

The '''Stadium Municipal d'Albi''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Albi]], [[France]].  It is currently used for [[rugby league]] as the home ground of [[Racing Club Albi XIII]] and [[rugby union]] as the home of [[SC Albi]]. After an expansion project completed in 2007, the stadium holds 13,000 with 8,000 seated.

== History ==

Built and opened in 1964 the ground immediately became the home of the towns two rugby clubs '''Racing Club Albi XIII''' and '''Sporting Club Albi'''. The ground is also used for athletic meetings. The ground originally had a main cantilever stand which held 1,800 seated spectators and a smaller unseated stand for 1,200, at either end there were semi-circular standing terraces. Initially called '''Le Stadium''', in 1977 the ground hosted the [[French rugby league championship]] Final despite the fact that [[Racing Club Albi XIII]] were in the final against [[AS Carcassonne]] the 'home' side won 19-10 in front of 18,325 fans, which was and still is the record attendance.  It hosted its first international rugby league match in 1979 when the [[France national rugby league team]] beat the [[Papua New Guinea rugby league team]] 16-9. In 1987 the end terracing's were flattened to make way for an Olympic standard eight lane athletic track. At the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]] the ground played host to two group 3 matches [[France national rugby league team|France]] beat [[South Africa national rugby league team|South Africa]] 56-6 in front of a crowd of 7,696 and [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] beat [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]] 30-22 in front of a crowd of 3,666. The ground was renovated in 2006 and expanded in 2007 giving it its current capacity of 13,058.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delaney|first1=Trevor|title=The International Grounds of Rugby League|date=1995|publisher=Trevor Delaney|isbn=0950998249|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14718">'''Stoolball''' is a sport that dates back to at least the 15th century, originating in [[Sussex]], southern England. It may be an ancestor of [[cricket]] (a game it resembles), [[baseball]], and [[rounders]], in fact stoolball is sometimes called "cricket in the air". There is a tradition that it was played by [[milkmaid]]s who used their milking [[Stool (seat)|stool]]s as a "[[wicket]]" and the bittle, or milk bowl as a bat. Hence its archaic name of ''bittle-battle.''&lt;ref&gt;History And Antiquities Of Horsham, Doreathea E. Hurst, Farncombe &amp; Co, Lewes, Sussex 2nd Ed (1889) page 257&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport of stoolball is strongly associated with Sussex; it has been referred to as Sussex's [[national sport|'national' sport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Coates |2010 | p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Sussex game&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gomme|1894| p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pastime.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011| p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Stoolball Association was formed in 1979 to promote and expand stoolball.&lt;ref name="SEng-Hist"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stoolball.org.uk/about/history-of-stoolball-england/ | title = History of Stoolball England | publisher = Stoolball England | location = United Kingdom | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503062033/http://www.stoolball.org.uk/about/history-of-stoolball-england/ | archivedate = 2012-05-03 | deadurl = no | accessdate = 2013-03-20 | quote = Stoolball England was formed as the National Stoolball Association on 3 October 1979. ... The aims laid down in the inaugural meeting of the National Stoolball Association in 1979 [included]: The promotion and expansion of stoolball; To seek to link together existing associations and to encourage the formation of others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was officially recognised as a sport by the [[Sports Council]] in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7322486.stm|title=Medieval game gets sport status|date=31 March 2008|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stoolball Association changed its name to Stoolball England in 2010 on the advice of the Sports Council and was recognised as the national governing body for stoolball in England in 2011. 

The game's popularity has faded since the 1960s, but continues to be played at a local league level in [[Sussex]], [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Some variants are played in some schools.  Teams can be ladies only or mixed.  There are ladies' leagues in Sussex, Surrey and Kent and mixed leagues in Sussex.

==History==
===Medieval and Tudor references===
[[File:ALPP - Stool-Ball.png|thumb|1767 Illustration of Stoolball in the children's book ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'']]
Stoolball is attested by name as early as 1450. Nearly all medieval references describe it as a game played during [[Easter]] celebrations, typically as a [[courtship]] pastime rather than a competitive game. The game's associations with romance remained strong into the modern period.  Written by [[William Shakespeare]] and the Sussex-born playwright [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], the comedy, ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' used the phrase "playing stool ball" as a euphemism for sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game |last=Block |first=David |year=2006 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-6255-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of traditional British Rural Sports |editors=Tony Collins, John Martin &amp; Wray Vamplew |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge Sports Reference |isbn=978-0-415-35224-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early competitions and establishment of codes===
Stoolball makes an appearance in the dictionary of [[Samuel Johnson]], where it is defined as a game played by driving a ball from stool to stool.  

Stoolball seems to have been one of the earliest [[women's sports|sports in which women participated]].  Activities for women before about 1870 were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were typically non-competitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasised physical activity rather than competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |website=The Sport Journal |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, stoolball allowed women to participate in competitive sport.

A “fine match of stoolball” is recorded as having been played in June 1747 by a total of 28 women at [[Warbleton]].&lt;ref name="SxEx-MLSS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/lifestyle/the-much-loved-sussex-sport-of-stoolball-1-6849306|title=The much-loved Sussex sport of stoolball|date=17 July 2015|publisher=Sussex Express|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first inter-county stoolball match took place between the women of Sussex and Kent in 1797 at Tunbridge Wells Common on the historic border between the two counties.&lt;ref name="SB-MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoolball.org.uk/2008/07/matterface-cup-and-veterans-cup|title=Matterface Cup and Veterans Cup 2008|date=28 July 2009|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sussex women wore blue ribbons to represent the county while the women of Kent wore pink ribbons.&lt;ref name="SB-MC"/&gt;  

Andrew Lusted argues that between 1866 and 1887 the Glynde Butterflies stoolball team were the first women in England to be considered sports stars.&lt;ref name="SxEx-MLSS"/&gt;  In 1866 the first recorded stoolball match took place between teams of named women representing villages as the Glynde Butterflies took on the Firle Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoolball.org.uk/history/story/glynde-butterflies/|title=The Glynde Butterflies 1866-1887|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other teams included the [[Chailey]] Grasshoppers, [[Selmeston]] [[Harvest bug|Harvest Bug]]s, [[Heathfield and Waldron|Waldron]] Bees, [[Eastbourne]] Seagulls, [[Danny House|Danny]] Daisies and [[Westmeston]].&lt;ref name="SxEx-MLSS"/&gt;

The sport's modern rules were codified at [[Glynde]] in 1881 where the two slightly different sets of rules in the east and the west of Sussex were brought together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2005| p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867 the rules in the east of the county were compiled by the Rev William de St Croix, the vicar of Glynde, and were the first rules to be established.&lt;ref name="SxEx-MLSS"/&gt;

===20th century revival===
A Sussex Stoolball League was established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011| p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially played by women only, men joined in shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011| p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern stoolball is centred on Sussex where the game was revived in the early 20th century by Major William Grantham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011 |p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nauright|2012| p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grantham wore a traditional Sussex [[Smock-frock|round frock]] and [[beaver hat]] to stoolball games.&lt;ref name="SEng-Hist"/&gt;  In 1917, [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|Sussex County Cricket Ground]] in Hove hosted a match between young men who had lost one arm in [[First World War]] action at a temporary hospital in Brighton's [[Royal Pavilion]], “damaged by wounds”, and a team of older lawyers, “damaged by age”.&lt;ref name="SEng-Hist"/&gt;  The soldiers won and were deemed to be 'heroes'.&lt;ref name="SEng-Hist"/&gt;  In 1919 a demonstration match was held at [[Lord's]] and the game was also played near the trenches of the battlefields of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2005| p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011| p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First played in 1923, the League Championship Challenge Cup is open to the winning teams of the five leagues of the Sussex County Stoolball Association - North, East, West, Mid and Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoolball.org.uk/sussexchampionship/2014|title=Sussex County Stoolball Association League Championship, 2014 Season|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1930s stoolball was being played in the Midlands and the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Locke|2011| p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1938 Sussex and Kent have competed annually for the Rose Bowl, which was presented to Sussex by Major William Grantham.  This is sometimes a team representing Sussex and sometimes one of Sussex's five leagues may represent the county against Kent.&lt;ref name="SB-MC"/&gt;  Grantham founded the Stoolball Association of Great Britain at Lord's in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2005| p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1927 over 1,000 clubs were playing stoolball across England, however in 1942 the Stoolball Association of Great Britain ceased to function.   The National Stoolball Association was founded on 3 October 1979 at Clair Hall in [[Haywards Heath]] attended by 23 people from nine different leagues.  On the advice of the Sports Council the governing body was renamed Stoolball England in 2010.&lt;ref name="SEng-Hist"/&gt;

In the early 20th century stoolball was also played outside England, including in [[France]], [[Japan]] and [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka).&lt;ref name="SEng-MSR-G"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stoolball.org.uk/history/story/stoolball-in-sussex-by-russell-goggs/|title=Stoolball in Sussex, by M S Russell-Goggs|first=M.S.|last=Russell=Goggs|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and rules==
Stoolball is played on grass with a {{convert|90|yards|adj=on|abbr=off}} diameter boundary, and the pitch is {{convert|16|yards|abbr=off}} long. Each team consists of 11 players, with one team fielding and the other batting. Bowling is underarm from a bowling "crease" {{convert|10|yards|abbr=off}} from the batsman's wicket, with the ball reaching the batsman on the full as in rounders or baseball rather than bouncing from the pitch as in cricket. Each over consists of 8 balls. The "wicket" itself is a square piece of wood at head or shoulder height fastened to a post. Traditionally this was the seat of a stool hung from a post or tree; some versions used a tall stool placed upright on the ground.

As it is played today, a bowler attempts to hit the wicket with the ball, and a batsman defends it using a bat shaped like a frying pan. The batsman scores "runs" by running between the wickets or hitting the ball beyond the boundary in a similar way to cricket. A ball hit over the boundary counts for 4 runs if it has hit the ground before reaching the boundary, or 6 runs if it landed beyond the boundary upon first contact with the ground.  Fielders attempt to catch the ball or run out the batsman by hitting the wicket with the ball before the batsman returns from his run.

Originally the batsman simply had to defend his stool from each ball with his hand and would score a point for each delivery until the stool was hit. The game later evolved to include runs and bats.

==Confusion with the game of Stoball==
According to [[Alice Gomme]], the earliest references show that the game was called Stobball or Stoball,&lt;ref&gt;Gomme, Alice Bertha (1894). ''The traditional games of England, Scotland, and Ireland: with tunes, singing-rhymes, and methods of playing according to the variants extant and recorded in different parts of the Kingdom.'' David Nutt (publisher), London. Archived by archive.org on June 26, 2007 and viewable [https://archive.org/details/traditionalgames00gomm here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a game peculiar to North Wiltshire, North Gloucestershire, and a little part of Somerset, near Bath: but although 17th century antiquarian [[John Aubrey]] describes a game called "stobball", played in this area, his description of it does not sound like stoolball,&lt;ref&gt;"Stobball-play is peculiar to North Wilts, North Gloucestershire, and a little part of Somerset near Bath. They smite a ball, stuffed very hard with quills and covered with soale leather, with a staffe, commonly made of withy, about 3 [feet] and a halfe long... A stobball-ball is of about four inches diameter, and as hard as a stone."&lt;/ref&gt; and another contemporary text from the same region characterises "stoball" as a game played mainly by men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;From a Berkeley manuscript of c.1641:"The large and levell playnes..in the vale of this hundred..doe witnes the inbred delight, that both gentry, yeomanry, rascallity, boyes and children, doe take in a game called Stoball... And not a sonne of mine, but at 7. was furnished with his double stoball staves, and a gamster therafter." John Smyth, ''The Berkeley manuscripts: the lives of the Berkeleys, lords of the honour, castle and manor of Berkeley in the county of Gloucester from 1066 to 1618...'': printed for subscribers by [[John Bellows]], Gloucester, 1883–1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary considers it unlikely that "stool ball" could have been corrupted into "stobball".&lt;ref&gt;It suggests instead an etymology of the latter word from "stob" + ball, where "stob" means a stump or stub of wood, and refers to the club used to play the game."† stow-ball, n.".

The '''United Kingdom Strength Council''' was founded by [[Glenn Ross]], the famed strongman and also founder and promotor of the Irish Strength Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uglyextras.com/aboutus/index.asp www.uglyextras.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The UKSC, as it is commonly termed, was promoted by Bob Daglish's Elite Strongman Promotions until March 2010.

==Beginnings==
Part of the reason for the foundation was that Glenn Ross is a champion of the idea that strongman is about lifting and moving heavy objects. He has been quoted as saying that strongmen should be more akin to strongman of old, "fighting for every step, not running."

Ross's philosophy is represented in the contests the UKSC organise. There is little running with weights or like events, but rather lifting heavier weights as the main test and then struggling forward with them. Ross has said that, in relation to competing with other recognised events, such as [[Britain's Strongest Man]], "when there is competition, it is good for everyone: competition in strongman creates an opportunity for the athletes, the fans and the sponsors to end up with a better product, and the reality is a free-market situation anyway."&lt;ref name="Polish"&gt;[http://www.sfd.pl/News-t228809.html Polish Strength Forum - Sportowe Forum Dyskusyjne]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Big, strong men are like bears. As long as you keep feeding them honey, they will stay in their caves and stick with certain organizations, but when the honey pot runs out, they must go into the forest to look for more honey." - Glenn Ross&lt;ref name="Polish"/&gt;

Bob Daglish's Elite strongman promotions was inextricably associated with the UKSC until it was announced in March 2010 that "In view of recent events and also some personal differences, Elite Strongman Promotions are hereby separating all affiliations with Big G promotions, the UK Strength Council and the UK strongest man competition." Elite Strongman promotions continued to run a version of the England’s strongest man final, whilst a separate competition run by UKSC was also run in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukstrongman.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1836 Elite strongman promotions statement released on ukstrongman.proboards.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscletalk.co.uk/tm.aspx?m=3855160&amp;mpage= Elite strongman promotions statement released on muscletalk.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;
