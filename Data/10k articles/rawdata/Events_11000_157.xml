On 26 September 1983, the nuclear [[Early warning radar|early-warning system]] of the [[Soviet Union]] reported the launch of multiple [[U.S. Air Force|USAF]] [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s from bases in the [[United States]]. These missile attack warnings were correctly identified as a [[false alarm]] by [[Stanislav Petrov|Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov]], an officer of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]]. This decision is seen as having prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack based on erroneous data on the United States and its [[NATO]] allies, which would have probably resulted in immediate escalation of the [[cold-war]] [[mutually assured destruction|stalemate]] to a full-scale [[nuclear war]]. Investigation of the satellite warning system later confirmed that the system had malfunctioned.

==Background==
The incident occurred at a time of severely strained relations between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Soviet officer who averted nuclear war dies"&gt;{{cite news | title=Soviet officer who averted nuclear war dies | date=20 September 2017 | agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responding to the Soviet Union's deployment of [[SS-20 Saber#Deployment|14]] [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20/RSD-10]] theatre nuclear missiles, the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] was taken in December 1979 by the military commander of NATO to deploy 108 [[Pershing II]] nuclear missiles in Western Europe with the ability to hit targets in eastern [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarus]] or [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] within 10 minutes and the longer range, but slower [[BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile]] (GLCM) to strike potential targets farther to the east. In mid-February 1981, and continuing until 1983, [[Able Archer 83#PSYOP|psychological operations]] by the United States began.  These were designed to test Soviet radar vulnerability and to demonstrate US nuclear capabilities.  They included clandestine naval operations, in the Barents, Norwegian, Black, and Baltic seas and near the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, as well as flights by American bombers, occasionally several times per week, directly to Soviet airspace that turned away only at the last moment.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum PSYOP"&gt;Peter Schweizer, ''Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy That Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union'' (New York: The Atlantic Monthly Press, 1994), p. 8, as quoted at Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum" (CIA Centre for the Study of Intelligence, 2007)[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-07]. Retrieved on 18 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It really got to them," recalls Dr. [[William Schneider, Jr.|William Schneider]], [former] [[United States Department of State#Organization|undersecretary of state]] for military assistance and technology, who saw classified "after-action reports" that indicated U.S. flight activity. "They didn't know what it all meant. A squadron would fly straight at Soviet airspace, and other radars would light up and units would go on alert. Then at the last minute the squadron would peel off and return home."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schweizer, ''Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy That Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union'' (New York: The Atlantic Monthly Press, 1994), p. 8, as quoted at Fischer, "A Cold War Conundrum" (CIA Centre for the Study of Intelligence, 2007)[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-07].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

obsessed with historical parallels with 1941 and [[Evil Empire speech|Reaganite rhetoric]], and with no defensive capability against the Pershing IIs, 
Soviet leaders believed the United States was preparing a secret nuclear attack on the USSR and initiated [[Operation RYaN]]. Under this, agents abroad monitored service and technical personnel who would implement a nuclear attack so as to be able either to preempt it or have [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]].

On 1 September 1983, the Soviet military shot down a South Korean passenger jet, [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], that had strayed into Soviet [[airspace]]. All 269 people aboard the aircraft were killed,&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/spotlight/ |title= War Games: Soviets, Fearing Western Attack, Prepared for Worst in '83 |publisher= [[CNN]] |first= Bruce |last= Kennedy |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081219114101/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/22/spotlight/ |archivedate= 19 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]] [[Larry McDonald]] and many other Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oberg |first= James |title= KAL 007: The Real Story |journal= American Spectator |volume= 26 |issue= 10 |year= 1993 |page= 37|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmSpectator-1993oct-00037 |via=[[UNZ.org]]|access-date= 22 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Pershing II missiles were reportedly deployed in late November 1983.

Bruce Blair, an expert on [[Cold War]] nuclear strategies and former president of the [[World Security Institute]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], says the American–Soviet relationship at that time 
&lt;blockquote&gt;had deteriorated to the point where the Soviet Union as a system—not just the Kremlin, not just Soviet leader [[Yuri Andropov]], not just the KGB—but as a system, was geared to expect an attack and to retaliate very quickly to it. It was on hair-trigger alert. It was very nervous and prone to mistakes and accidents. The false alarm that happened on Petrov's watch could not have come at a more dangerous, intense phase in U.S.–Soviet relations.&lt;ref name="red"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.logtv.com/films/redbutton/video.htm |title= The Red Button &amp; the Man Who Saved the World |publisher= logtv.com |accessdate= 27 September 2006 |format= Flash |first= Ewa |last= Pieta |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061016184311/http://www.logtv.com/films/redbutton/video.htm |archivedate= 16 October 2006 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In an interview aired on American television, Blair said, "The Russians (Soviets) saw a U.S. government preparing for a first strike, headed by a President [[Ronald Reagan]] capable of ordering a first strike." Regarding the incident involving Petrov, he said, "I think that this is the closest our country has come to accidental nuclear war."&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite news |title= War Games |publisher= Burrelle's Information Services |work= Dateline NBC |date= 12 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident ==
On 26 September 1983, [[Stanislav Petrov]], a lieutenant colonel in the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces|Soviet Air Defense Forces]], was the officer on duty at the [[Serpukhov-15]] bunker near [[Moscow]] which housed the command center of the Soviet [[early warning]] satellites, code-named [[Oko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flb.ru/info/27637.html Дайджест : Тот, который не нажал]&lt;/ref&gt; Petrov's responsibilities included observing the satellite early warning network and notifying his superiors of any impending nuclear missile attack against the Soviet Union. If notification was received from the early warning systems that inbound missiles had been detected, the Soviet Union's strategy was an immediate and compulsory nuclear counter-attack against the [[United States]] ([[launch on warning]]), specified in the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]].&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt;

Shortly after midnight, the bunker's computers reported that one [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] was heading toward the Soviet Union from the United States. Petrov considered the detection a computer error, since a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. Furthermore, the satellite system's reliability had been questioned in the past.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm |title= I Had A Funny Feeling in My Gut |first= David |last= Hoffman |work= Washington Post |date= 10 February 1999 |accessdate= 18 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrov dismissed the warning as a [[false alarm]], though accounts of the event differ as to whether he notified his superiors&lt;ref name="AWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org/petrov2.html|title=The Man Who Saved the World Finally Recognized|publisher=Association of World Citizens|accessdate=7 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000030/http://www.worldcitizens.org/petrov2.html|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;!-- Times out as of 2011-10-31 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or not&lt;ref name="red" /&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} after he concluded that the computer detections were false and that no missile had been launched.  Petrov's suspicion that the warning system was malfunctioning was confirmed when no missile in fact arrived.  Later, the computers identified four additional missiles in the air, all directed towards the Soviet Union. Petrov suspected that the computer system was malfunctioning again, despite having no direct means to confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |title=Able Archer 1983 The Brink of Apocalypse |publisher=Channel 4 |time=29:06 mins |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ciy5R-tLiE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union's land [[radar]] was incapable of detecting missiles beyond the horizon.&lt;ref name="wash"/&gt;

It was subsequently determined that the false alarms were caused by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds and the satellites' [[Molniya orbit]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/18/stanislav-petrov-the-man-who-quietly-saved-the-world-has-died-aged-77-6937015/|title=Stanislav Petrov - the man who quietly saved the world - has died aged 77|date=18 September 2017|work=Metro|access-date=19 September 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Molniya%20orbit Molniya orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;

In explaining the factors leading to his decision, Petrov cited his belief and training that any U.S. first strike would be massive, so five missiles seemed an illogical start.&lt;ref name="AWC"/&gt; In addition, the launch detection system was new and in his view not yet wholly trustworthy, while ground radar had failed to pick up corroborative evidence even after several minutes of the false alarm.&lt;ref name="wash"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Petrov underwent intense questioning by his superiors about his actions. Initially, he was praised for his decision.&lt;ref name="AWC"/&gt; General [[Yury Votintsev]], then commander of the Soviet Air Defense's Missile Defense Units, who was the first to hear Petrov's report of the incident (and the first to reveal it to the public in the 1990s), stated that Petrov's "correct actions" were "duly noted."&lt;ref name="AWC"/&gt; Petrov himself stated he was initially praised by Votintsev and was promised a reward,&lt;ref name="AWC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moskovskiye"&gt;[http://www.flb.ru/info/27637.html Тот, который не нажал]. [[Moskovskiye Novosti]] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; but recalled that he was also reprimanded for improper filing of paperwork with the pretext that he had not described the incident in the military diary.&lt;ref name="moskovskiye"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;BBC TV Interview, BBC Moscow correspondent Allan Little, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

He received no reward. According to Petrov, this was because the incident and other bugs found in the missile detection system embarrassed his superiors and the influential scientists who were responsible for it, so that if he had been officially rewarded, they would have had to be punished.&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moskovskiye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lenta"&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/01/20/petrov/ В Нью-Йорке россиянина наградили за спасение мира]. Lenta.ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; He was reassigned to a less sensitive post,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; took early retirement (although he emphasized that he was not "forced out" of the army, as is sometimes claimed by Western sources),&lt;ref name="moskovskiye" /&gt; and suffered a [[nervous breakdown]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

[[Oleg Kalugin]], a former KGB chief of foreign counter-intelligence who knew Soviet chairman Andropov well, says that Andropov's distrust of American leaders was profound. It is conceivable that if Petrov had declared the satellite warnings valid, such an erroneous report could have provoked the Soviet leadership into becoming bellicose. Kalugin said, "The danger was in the Soviet leadership thinking, 'The Americans may attack, so we better attack first.'"&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cold War's Riskiest Moment

The incident became known publicly in the 1990s upon the publication of Votintsev's memoirs. Widespread media reports since then have increased public awareness of Petrov's actions.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''''Bolinao 52''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] by [[Vietnamese American]] director [[Duc Nguyen]] about the Vietnamese [[boat people]] ship that was originally stranded in the Pacific Ocean in 1988.  During their 37 days at sea, the group encountered violent storms and engine failures.  They fought their thirst and hunger and a US Navy ship reportedly refused to rescue them, forcing the boat people to starve despite resorting to [[cannibalism]]. Only 52 out of the 110 boat people survived the tragedy and were rescued by Filipino fishermen who brought them to [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao Island, Philippines]].

==Release Date==
''Bolinao 52'' premiered on March 19, 2007, in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and on March 24, 2007, in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] at the [[San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival]].

==History==
[[Image:Butterball plant, Longmont, CO IMG 5214.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Butterball plant in downtown [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], [[Colorado]]]]

The name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of [[Wyoming, Ohio|Wyoming]], [[Ohio]]. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to [[JBS USA|Swift and Co.]] for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name "Butterball" to Swift, which was acquired by [[ConAgra]] in 1990.

Leo Peters retained rights to use the name '''Butterball Farms''' for his butter products&lt;ref name="retained"&gt;{{cite web

In October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to [[North Carolina]]-based '''Carolina Turkeys,''' making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States.&lt;ref name="largest"&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in [[Garner, North Carolina]]. The headquarters has a "customer experience center" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations.&lt;ref name="major deal"&gt;{{cite news

Smithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp.&lt;ref name=Smithfield&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/10/673672/smithfield-to-sell-its-stake-in.html|title=Smithfield to sell its stake in Butterball|last=Felberbaum|first=Michael|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2010-09-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate==
Walter “Gator” Pelletier, past chairman of the [[National Turkey Federation]], is Butterball LLC's corporate secretary &amp;mdash; managing all operating activities from turkey production and directing Maxwell Farms, the managing partner of Butterball. Pelletier is also president of Maxwell Farms, Inc., vice president of Goldsboro Milling Company, and secretary-treasurer of Maxwell Foods, Inc.

==Turkey Talk-Line==
Beginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk-Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/butterballs-turkey-hotline-has-been-preventing-thanksgiving-disasters-35-years-174358/ |publisher=Ad Week |title=Butterball’s Turkey Hotline Has Been Preventing Thanksgiving Disasters for 35 Years |date=November 1, 2016 |author=Robert Klara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost.

In ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode "[[The Indians in the Lobby]]", President [[Josiah Bartlet]] calls the number (referred to as the "Butterball Hotline" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey.

==Criticism==
Animal welfare activists such as [[Mercy for Animals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Free Animal Video|title=Butterball Turkey Animal Cruelty Undercover Video MFA|date=2014-04-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhi-Gg2b46A|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and [[PETA]] have accused Butterball of animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="butterballabuse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://butterballabuse.com/ |title=Butterball Abuse |date=December 28, 2011 |publisher=Mercy for Animals |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/features/butterball-peta-investigation.aspx|title=Butterball's House of Horrors: A PETA Undercover Investigation |date=2010-10-21|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2009/12/shareholder_resolution_urges.html |title=Shareholder Resolution Urges Smithfield to Help Decrease Suffering of Butterball Turkeys |date=December 22, 2009 |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention.

In October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse: Undercover Investigation Exposes Shocking Cruelty...Again!|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal [[cruelty to animals]]. Mercy for Animals’ 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Cindy|title=Butterball Turkey Raided Amid Animal Abuse Allegations|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/butterball-turkey-raided-amid-animal-abuse-allegations/story?id=15249456#.Tvyp6lb4WSo|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals—marking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Making History: Butterball Case Marks First-Ever Felony Conviction for Cruelty to Factory-Farmed Birds|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/making-history-butterball-conviction-marks-first-ever-felony-conviction-for-cruelty-to-factory-farme.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Michael|title=Ex-N.C. turkey farm worker pleads guilty to animal cruelty|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/08/nc-turkey-farm-worker-pleads-guilty-to-animal-cruelty/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: Another Butterball Worker Pleads Guilty to Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/breaking-news-another-butterball-worker-pleads-guilty-to-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Breaking News: Two More Butterball Workers Convicted of Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2013/02/breaking-news-two-more-butterball-workers-convicted-of-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA’s investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More animal cruelty arrests at Butterball facility in Hoke County|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127152549/http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 January 2013|publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CMLL Día de Muertos (2018)''' (Spanish for "Day of the Dead") is a [[professional wrestling]] [[Supercard|supercard event]], scripted and produced by the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'' [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL). The show took place on November 2, 2018 in CMLL's main venue, [[Arena México]], in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] and celebrated the Mexican [[Day of the Dead]] celebration. Many of the wrestlers working the show wore the traditional Día de Muertos face and body paint for the Día de Muerto event. From the fourth match on the losing wrestlers were be dragged to ''El Inframundo'' ("The Underworld"), a side entrance in the arena, by a group of wrestlers dressed up as minions of the ruler of the underworld.&lt;ref name=ReydelInframundo&gt;{{cite web | url=https://superluchas.com/cmll-una-mirada-semanal-al-cmll-del-2-al-8-noviembre-2017/ | title=CMLL: Una mirada semanal al CMLL (del 2 al 8 de noviembre de 2017) | date=November 10, 2017 | accessdate=August 8, 2018 | author=Dark Angelita | work=SuperLuchas | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medio&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/lucha-libre/2017/11/04/sanson-se-proclamo-el-primer-rey-del-inframundo-en-el-cmll | title=Sansón se proclamó el primer Rey del Inframundo en el CMLL | date=November 4, 2017 | accessdate=October 3, 2018 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish | first=Apolo |last=Valdés}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the show [[Sansón (wrestler)|Sansón]] successfully defended the ''Rey del Inframundo'' ("King of the Underworld") championship that he won at the [[CMLL Día de Muertos (2017)|2017 Día de Muertos show]] against challenger [[Templario]]. The main event was a ''[[Relevos increíbles]]'' (Miss-matched team match) where the ''technico'' (those that portray the "good guys") [[Fénix (wrestler)|King Phoenix]] teamed with his brother [[Penta 0M]] and [[Último Guerrero]], who are both ''rudos'' ("the bad guys"), losing to the team of [[Diamante Azul]], [[L.A. Park]], and [[Michael Elgin]]. The show featured four additional matches.

==Storylines==
The 2018 Dia de Muertos show features six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. Wrestlers portray either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that play the part of the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they perform.&lt;ref name="Mondo"&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = "Okay... what is Lucha Libre?" | page = 31 | quote=featuring clearly distinguished good guys and bad guys, or técnicos and rudos | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''C''''' is a 2010 novel written by [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]]. ''C'' is McCarthy's third novel and sixth book. The novel was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]].&lt;ref name=carey&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/7913342/Peter-Carey-could-be-three-time-Booker-winner.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen | last=Adams | title=Peter Carey could be three-time Booker winner | date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics were polarized by the work.&lt;ref name=carey/&gt;

==Plot==
The novel revolves around Serge Carrefax, born in the late 19th century in England. The plot follows his life before and after World War I.

==Themes==
A major theme in the novel is communication, and the way technology influences the way individuals and societies communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Egan-t.html|title=Code World|last=Egan|first=Jennifer|date=8 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/31/c-tom-mccarthy-novel-review|title=C by Tom McCarthy|last=Tayler|first=Christopher|date=30 July 2010|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jennifer Egan, writing for the New York Times, referred to the novel as fusing "Pynchonesque revelry in signs and codes with the lush psychedelics of William Burroughs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/books/review/Egan-t.html|title=Code World|last=Egan|first=Jennifer|date=8 September 2010|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Robson, in a review for the New Statesman, describes the book as "full of familiar delights and familiar tedium". It continues "After a certain point, most sentences go something like this (not a parody): "Everything seems connected: disparate locations twitch and burst into activity like limbs reacting to impulses sent from elsewhere in the body, booms and jibs obeying levers at the far end of a complex set of ropes and cogs and relays."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/08/mccarthy-novel-serge-smith ''New Statesman'' article]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Peruvian War of Independence}}

The '''Callao affair''' occurred in November 1820, during the [[Peruvian War of Independence]]. It began when a [[Spain|Spanish]] fort opened fire on the [[United States]] warship [[USS Macedonian (1810)|USS ''Macedonian'']]. Though the ship was damaged, the Americans did not violate their neutrality by counterattacking. On the following day, a boat filled with [[United States Navy]] sailors was attacked, resulting in the deaths of two seamen and the wounding of eight others. Two days after that, an American merchant ship was attacked and her crew had to abandon ship. Ultimately, there was no significant response by the United States to the attacks on their shipping and their citizens, though the Spanish government vowed to punish the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;De Kay, pp. 167–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affair==
[[File:Peru.Lima.1889.Detalle.Stieler.png|200px|right|thumb|''A 19th century map of Peru showing the location of Fortaleza del Real Felipe and the batteries which fired on USS Macedonian''.]]
Inspired by the French revolution in 1789, and the Peruvian revolution, the people of [[Chile]] joined forces with the rebel Peruvians and revolted against Spanish authority in 1820. As result, a rebel [[First Chilean Navy Squadron]] under [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] attacked the Spanish fleet anchored off [[Callao]] on the night of November 5, during which the rebels captured the 44 gun frigate [[Esmeralda (1791)|''Esmeralda'']] with heavy loss of life to the Spanish defenders. The capture of the ship crippled Spain's operational capabilities in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and infuriated the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] inhabitants of Callao. During the battle, the [[frigate]] USS ''Macedonian'', under Captain [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], was also at port with the mission of protecting six American merchant [[schooner]]s which were being harassed by both the Chilean fleet and the Spanish on shore. Because the ''Macedonian'' was so close to the battle area, the Spanish military in Callao assumed that she had supported Cochrane's fleet in the attack. So instead of aiming for the Chilean ships, the [[garrison]] opened fire on the frigate and one of the American merchantmen with [[heated shot|hot shot]] from [[Fortaleza del Real Felipe]].&lt;ref name="Glenn108"&gt;Glenn, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rounds ripped through the ships' rigging though the damage was repairable and no Americans were harmed.&lt;ref name="Glenn108" /&gt;

The ''Macedonian''{{'}}s [[carpenter]], [[Samuel Holbrook]], later described the incident; "''Their shot flew round us like hail, cutting away our cross-jack yard, and much of our rigging. Many of the red hot shot struck near us.''" Captain Downes was in [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] at the time and a [[first lieutenant]] was in command and he ordered the sails hoisted to bring the vessel out of the fort's range. On the following day, the lieutenant sent the [[Destroyer tender|tender]] ''Buckskin'' filled with sailors into port for provisions. However, while the sailors were still heading to shore, Spanish troops at the docks opened fire, killing two men and wounding six others. Holbrook described the scene; "''blood and brain scattered round the inside as though a bullock had been killed in her.''" There was no landing as some sources claim and the survivors went back to their ship without obtaining the fresh food they were looking for.&lt;ref name="Glenn109"&gt;Glenn, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the ''Macedonian'' sailors were attacked, American and British merchantmen were being looted in the port and two days later, on November 8, the American schooner ''Rampart'' was attacked by the fort and heavily damaged while trying to offload her cargo, forcing her crew to abandon ship.&lt;ref name="Glenn109" /&gt; The ''Macedonian'' also took on board that day several American and British refugees who were in fear of being killed by the natives. Captain Downes was still not interested in exacting redress for the three incidents but he did send the Spanish [[Viceroy]] [[Joaquin de la Pezuela]] a letter of protest.&lt;ref name="Glenn109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/b/23924-blackwoods-edinburgh-magazine-volume-60-no-369-july-1846?start=3|title=Dr Tschudi arrived in the bay of Callao|magazine=[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]|volume=60|issue=369|date=July 1846|page=4|accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Pezuela said he would punish those responsible but whether he actually did so or not remains unknown. Due to the blockade, Captain Downes was afraid his ship would be seized as it was illegally carrying over a million dollars in Spanish gold, something Cochrane's [[espionage|spies]] had informed him of some time prior. So, when the Americans were leaving Callao, they expected to have to fight their way past the Chilean fleet, but Cochrane ignored the frigate and let it go without any opposition. Captain Downes remained off the [[South America]]n coast until March 1821 to protect American merchant sailors, many of whom were either imprisoned by the viceroy, or murdered by the Spanish military and their Peruvian subjects. The murder and imprisonment of United States citizens at Lima and Callao was attributed to the fact that some of the victims were captured from ships of Cochrane's fleet and were legally [[prisoners of war]], though many of the American victims were not involved in the conflict and were killed along with other innocent foreigners. In the end, there was no retaliation by the United States in response to the attacks on their vessels or their citizens, other than the feeble letter of protest from Downes.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Kay, pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corrida de Houilles''', officially ''Corrida pédestre internationale de Houilles'' (Houilles International Footrace), is an annual [[10K run]] that takes place at the end of December in [[Houilles]], France. 

The competition was created in 1972 by [[Alexandre Joly]], a French politician who would later become Mayor of Houilles. He was inspired by the [[Saint Silvester Road Race]] in [[São Paulo]] and decided to set up his own local race in his hometown with the same format – hosting the race on [[New Year's Eve]]. Initially a men's event only on a course of around {{convert|9|km|mi}}, the race attracted high level competition from the beginning, with Poland's [[Bronisław Malinowski (athlete)|Bronisław Malinowski]] winning the 1974 race the same year as his gold medal win at the [[1974 European Athletics Championships]]. Due to the race's growing popularity, the competition was divided into two segments: an elite-level race and a public race.&lt;ref name=Hist&gt;[http://www.corrida-houilles.fr/fr/un-peu-dhistoire  Un peu d'histoire].

[[Annick Loir]] was the first known women's winner in 1975, but a separate women's division (over around {{convert|6|km|mi}}) was not formally established until 1983. The race distances were set at {{convert|10|km|mi}} for both men and women from 1996 onwards, allowing the race to serve as a qualifier for the French 10&amp;nbsp;km championships. The date of the race has not always been 31 December due to organisational restrictions, but it is usually held within the final days of the year. No race was held in 1999 due to [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin]]. The races for 2000 and 2005 were held on [[New Year's Day]] instead.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARRS/&gt; The competition gained [[IAAF Bronze Label Road Race]] status in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Mulkeen, Jon (2013-12-29).

Top level athletes from both France and abroad have competed in Houilles. [[Jacky Boxberger]] had much success in the early days of the race, amassing four wins in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Morocco's [[Khalid Skah]] had a record eight wins from 1988 to 1997. Ethiopia's [[Ayelech Worku]] is the most successful woman at the race, having won four times consecutively from 1995 to 1998. Anpther Ethiopian woman had three straight wins from 2003 to 2006 [[Merima Denboba]] and Kenya's [[Micah Kogo]] achieved the same feat on the men's side from 2006 to 2008. The course records are 27:47 minutes for men (set by [[Imane Merga]] in 2010) and 31:29 minutes for women (set by [[Margaret Wangari Muriuki]] in 2011).&lt;ref name=ARRS/&gt;

'''''Die Dafne''''' (1627) to a libretto by [[Martin Opitz]] (which survives), and music by [[Heinrich Schütz]] (which is lost), has traditionally been regarded as the first [[German opera]],{{clarify|reason=What does that imply? That everything was sung?|date=January 2014}} though it has also been proposed more recently that it was in fact a spoken [[drama]] with inserted song and [[ballet]] numbers.

==History of the work==
Opitz was already a friend of Schütz and in all wrote twelve German [[madrigal]] texts for him. In 1625 and 1626 Opitz visited the [[Dresden court]], to work with Schütz on a ''Sing-Comoedie'' based on the model of [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Dafne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Isabella Van Elferen -Mystical Love in the German Baroque: Theology, Poetry, Music -  2009 -Page 31 "The Dresden Kapellmeister Heinrich Schütz was a friend of Martin Opitz, who wrote twelve German madrigal texts for him.26 In 1625 and 1626 Opitz visited Dresden, where he worked with Schütz on a “Sing-Comoedie” entitled Dafne (first ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Opitz rewrote the libretto after [[Rinuccini]], translating it into [[Alexandrine verse]], and his libretto was so highly regarded that it was later adapted back into Italian by later Italian librettists.&lt;ref&gt;A Alms Adapting an adaptation: Martin Opitz's Dafne among the Italians 2012 em.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/02/23/em.car119.full 23 Feb 2012 "The 1627 Opitz–Schütz Dafne was in a sense a paradigmatic work: it presented a case that German opera could develop a lasting presence by ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Opitz and Schütz'  were probably attracted by religious content of the work, rather than the purely pagan mythology of Dafne or Euridice.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Popovich Aikin -A language for German opera: the development for forms and ... 2002  "Schutz's enthusiasm (and Opitz's) can be ascribed, according to Mayer, to the religious content of the work, which he thought should be much more attractive to both Germans than the pagan mythology of Dafne or Euridice."&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral secretary to the Saxon Court, Johann Seusse also exerted influence on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Schütz-Jahrbuch: Volume 30; Volume 30 Internationale Heinrich Schütz-Gesellschaft,  2008 "Eine erste Begegnung Seusses mit Opitz könnte im August 1626 in Dresden erfolgt sein, als Schütz und Opitz das gemeinsame Dafne-Projekt besprachen. Opitz weilte in jenem Sommer in diplomatischer Mission des Burggrafen von Dohna in ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern scholarly reevaluation==
Although long unquestioned as "the first German opera"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} the performance started no notable tradition in Germany, and [[:de:Wolfram Steude|Wolfram Steude]] (1991) made the controversial proposal that Dafne was in fact a spoken drama with inserted song and [[ballet]] numbers. Consequently recent publications such as the latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Opera are more cautious in attribution of the "first German opera" claim.
&lt;ref&gt;Bettina Varwig Histories of Heinrich Schütz - Page 94 2011 "In 1991, Wolfram Steude published his controversial proposal that Dafne amounted to nothing more than a piece of 'spoken theatre with inserted song and ballet numbers'.2 The latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Opera ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dramatic works by Schütz==
Two other large scale sung dramas by Schütz are also lost:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">'''Embracery''' is the attempt to influence a [[juror]] [[Political corruption|corruptly]] to give his or her [[verdict]] in favour of one side or the other in a [[trial (law)|trial]], by promise, persuasions, entreaties, money, entertainments and the like.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Embracery |volume=9 |page=309 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English law]], it was an offence both at [[common law]] and by [[statute]], punishable by [[fine (penalty)|fine]] and [[imprisonment]]. As a statutory offence it dates back to 1360. The offence is complete, whether any verdict has been given or not, and whether the verdict is in accordance with the weight of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or otherwise. The person making the attempt, and any member of the jury who consents, are equally punishable.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The legal term "embracery" comes from the [[Old French|Old Fr.]] ''embraseour'', an embracer, i.e., one who excites or instigates, literally one who sets on fire, from ''embraser'', to kindle a fire.  This is unrelated to the common word "embrace", i.e., to hold or clasp in the arms, which is from [[French Language|French]] ''embracer'',  from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''bracchia'', arms.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The false verdict of a jury, whether occasioned by embracery or otherwise, was formerly considered criminal, and jurors were severely punished, being proceeded against by [[writ of attaint]]. The [[Juries Act 1825]], in abolishing writs of attaint, made a special exemption as regards jurors guilty of embracery (s.61). [[Prosecution]] for the offence has been so extremely rare that when a case occurred in 1891&lt;ref&gt;''R v Baker'' 113, Cent. Crim. Ct. Sess. Pap. 374&lt;/ref&gt; it was stated that no precedent could be found for the [[indictment]]. The defendant was fined £200, afterwards reduced to £100.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

By 2010 the offence was regarded as obsolete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Richardson, P.J. (ed.) | title=Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice | year=2006 | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | location=London | isbn=0-421-90920-X }}, 28-47, 28-151&lt;/ref&gt; and such misconduct more likely to be [[criminal charge|charge]]d as [[perverting the course of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney-General v. Judd'' [1995] COD 15, DC&lt;/ref&gt; The last conviction for embracery in the UK was at Caernarvon [[Crown Court]] in November 1975 but it was quashed by the Court of Appeal the following year on the initiative of [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Lord Justice Lawton]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Queen -v- Owen'' (1976)3 All ER 229&lt;/ref&gt; who said that the offence was obsolete. 

The offence was abolished by section 17 of the [[Bribery Act 2010]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents Bribery Act 2010] on legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; as from 1 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1418/made Bribery Act 2010 (Commencement) Order 2011, SI 2011 No. 1418]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, embracery prosecutions have occurred as recently as 1989, when a county commissioner in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was sentenced to a fine and probation.&lt;ref&gt;''Calhoun Times''.

'''International Race of Champions''' ('''IROC''') was a North American [[auto racing]] competition, created by Les Richter,  Roger Penske and Mike Phelps, promoted as an equivalent of an American [[All-Star Game]] or [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. Despite its name, the IROC was primarily associated with North American [[Oval track racing|oval-racing]] culture.

Drivers raced identically-prepared [[stock cars]] set up by a single team of mechanics in an effort to make the race purely a test of driver ability. It was run with a small field of invited drivers (6–12). It was created and developed in 1972 by [[David Lockton]], the developer of the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]], launched in 1973, with [[Mark Donohue]] being the first driver to win the championship in [[IROC I|1974]]. The cars used that year were [[Porsche 911|Porsche Carrera RSRs]]. Donohue's win in the fourth and last race of that season was his last win, as he died in a [[Formula One]] crash at the [[Österreichring]] in practice for the [[1975 Austrian Grand Prix]]. The series was not run in [[1981 in sports|1981]], [[1982 in sports|1982]], or [[1983 in sports|1983]].

In 2007, IROC could not find a sponsor and postponed the first two races at Daytona and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irocracing.com/2007season/pr/070109_delay.html IROC SERIES DELAYS START OF 2007 SEASON : Series Seeking Title Sponsorship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309174637/http://www.irocracing.com/2007season/pr/070109_delay.html |date=2007-03-09 }}, Retrieved March 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; IROC went on hiatus in 2007 hoping to return with a sponsor in 2008, which did not happen. In March 2008, IROC auctioned off its tools, equipment, cars, and memorabilia, and went out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.race2win.net/iroc/auction.html Race2Win] IROC Goes to Auction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[Image:IROC.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sam Hornish, Jr.]] competing in a 2006 IROC race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]]]]
The drivers invited were from a broad range of racing disciplines: [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy cars]], [[NASCAR]], [[sports car racing]], and on occasion, [[World of Outlaws|WoO]], and [[drag racing]]. Criteria for invitation was very loose, but typically consisted of recent season champions of the respective series, and individual winners of big events ([[Indianapolis 500|Indy]], [[Daytona 500|Daytona]], etc.)

Due to its fundamental [[Stock car racing|stock car formula]], and the majority of racing being contested on [[oval track racing|ovals]], the series was often dominated by NASCAR participants (which was the major criticism of the series). Also, in the small field of about a dozen cars, the share of NASCAR invitees grew over time; from just three drivers in the first season to seven in the final season. The last non-NASCAR based champion of the series was [[Al Unser, Jr.]] in [[1988 in sports|1988]]. Although [[open wheel]] drivers had numerous successes, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, drivers from [[road racing]] series had only won two races&lt;!-- I don't have time to check, but this seems low. May depend on how the author defines "road racing."--&gt; in the history of IROC. In some years, no sports car drivers were even invited.

==Car identification==
[[File:Matt Kenseth 2004 IROC Championship Car.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matt Kenseth]]'s 2004 championship car]]
Through 2003, IROC was also known for its rainbow of car colors being easily recognized from all other closed wheel racing series. Car numbers were utilized for scoring purposes, but were not the primary means of identification. Instead, the drivers' [[surname]] would appear on the door of the car. Exceptions were made when [[Mario Andretti|Mario]] and [[Michael Andretti]] raced in the same events. In those cases, their first name was used. The numbers would change from race to race, with the number 1 would be given to the driver starting first, and so on. The colors would correspond to the numbers. Before the races, drivers were assigned via blind drawing, and was how the starting grid for the first race was determined. The finishing order of the race would be inverted for the second race's starting grid, while the reverse of the points standings determined races three and four's grids. Numbers were assigned by the starting position. After the first race, the numbers would be assigned based on points standings.&lt;ref name="Gordonline IROC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordonline.com/iroc.html|title=Jeff's IROC Statistics|work=Gordon Online|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would make it very confusing for fans, as one week their favorite driver could be driving the blue #1 car, and the next week he could be in the #5 orange car.

In 2004, the alcoholics beverage company, [[Diageo]] became the series' title [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], utilising their  [[Crown Royal]] brand whiskey, replacing [[True Value]], and the procedure changed, as well. Cars would be identically painted in white, with trim which could be changed to represent the driver's colors in his regular racing series. Also, a driver's number in IROC would be his regular number. Thus, Steve Kinser would use green trim with the #11, and Matt Kenseth's car featured yellow trim with a #17.

The only exception to the numbering scheme involves the number 3. Following the [[death of Dale Earnhardt]] in the [[2001 Daytona 500]], IROC retired the use of #3. Any driver with that regular number would use #03 instead. [[Hélio Castroneves]] raced with #03, but the car kept red trim, in reflection of his IRL car being red.

If there was a numbering conflict, another number would be substituted. In most cases, for one-digit numbers, a zero would be added in front. Otherwise a historically notable number would be run. (Penske drivers, for one instance, could use #66, owing to Mark Donohue.)

==Road racing==
From 1992–2005, the IROC season was exclusively run on ovals. In 2006, road courses were reintroduced to the IROC series with the cars competing on the road course at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. Also, in 2006, two drivers shared one car in an IROC first. [[Grand American Road Racing]] drivers [[Max Angelelli]] and [[Wayne Taylor]] each drove two races in 2006, trying to win the IROC title as a team, reflecting sportscar racing as a two-man team.  However, in 2007, that may not have been used, as 2006 Grand American Road Racing champion [[Jörg Bergmeister]] was a solo champion.  Bergmeister had to split driving duties with various drivers because his regular co-driver was forced to sit out three races because they were raced with the Indy Racing League; [[Colin Braun]], who was 17, could not race in those three races under [[Master Settlement Agreement|MSA]] rulings.

==Notes==
[[Image:IROCPorsche.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Richard Petty]]'s IROC [[Porsche 911]] from 1974]]
*IROC historically employed former NASCAR drivers [[Dave Marcis]], [[Dick Trickle]] and [[Jim Sauter (NASCAR)|Jim Sauter]] to prepare the setups for their cars.
*The most recent model of car used in IROC was the [[Pontiac Firebird|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]], which began competition in 1996.  There were no manufacturer designations on the cars, however, because Pontiac pulled their support from the series. The program was still allowed to use a car that resembled the Trans Am.
* Previous to the [[Pontiac Trans Am|Trans Am]], car bodies used were the [[Dodge Avenger]] (1994–1995), [[Dodge Daytona]] (1990–1993), [[Chevrolet Camaro]] (1975–1980, 1984–1989), and [[Porsche Carrera]] (1974).
*Certain drivers could not participate under the Crown Royal sponsorship because of contracts or age. For example, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] could not race because of a contractual agreement with his sponsor at the time, [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]]. [[Kyle Busch]] could not participate until May 2006 because he was under 21.
*IROC events were broadcast in a [[broadcast delay|tape-delay]] format by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1974 and 1980, and by [[CBS]] between 1984 and 1986. Afterward, ABC and [[ESPN]] split broadcast rights, with  tape-delay and live events respectively. [[Speed Channel]] broadcast IROC races live from 2004 to 2006.
*Mark Martin is one of only two drivers to win more than two IROC championships during their career, winning five. Dale Earnhardt, Sr. won four, including the 2000 championship, before his death in February 2001.

*'''1985''': Three races only as the third scheduled race was cancelled due to rain.
*'''1990''': Three races only because of new sponsor Dodge and the late start to the season (Talladega, Cleveland, Michigan). After [[Darrell Waltrip]] was injured in a crash at Daytona in practice for the NASCAR [[Pepsi 400]] the day before the Cleveland IROC race, he was not replaced for the final two races.
*'''1993''': Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter crash after three races had been completed, and only the final race, at [[Michigan International Speedway]], was remaining. Terry Labonte was asked to drive the final race, and Allison's and Labonte's points combined were enough for the IROC championship. Labonte's winnings went to a trust fund for Allison's two children, Krista and Robbie. [[Alan Kulwicki]] had been killed in a plane crash earlier in the year after two races had been run, and [[Dale Earnhardt]] was chosen to replace him to complete a 12-driver field, with all winnings going to charities chosen by the Kulwicki family.
*'''2001''': After [[Dale Earnhardt]] was killed in the [[Daytona 500]], IROC went to only eleven cars for the remaining three races. Following a 2004 rule change in IROC where drivers would be using their personal numbers, IROC added one exception – the number 3 could not be used. Any driver whose number in a series is 3 must use 03 in IROC.
*'''2005''': With the 2005 IROC title, Martin now is the all-time leader in IROC Championship titles with five. Also during the 2005 season, Martin took over the all-time record for IROC wins, with thirteen.

Regarded by some as a [[conceptual art]]ist,&lt;ref name="disobey"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forgotten Web Celebrities: Jennicam.org's Jennifer Ringley |url=http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/2004_05_19_archive.html |accessdate=March 27, 2014 |date=May 19, 2004 |first=Steve |last=Baldwin |publisher=Disobey.com: Content for the discontented (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ringley viewed her site as a straightforward document of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/naturism/wnl-0101.htm#commentary |title=Commentary: JenniCam |work=The Weekly Nudesletter |first=Charles |last=Daney |date=September 29, 1997 |volume=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not wish to filter the events that were shown on her camera, so sometimes she was shown [[Nudity|nude]] or engaging in sexual behavior, including [[Coitus|sexual intercourse]] and [[masturbation]]. This was a new use of Internet technology in 1996 and some viewers were interested in its sociological implications while others watched it for sexual arousal.  The JenniCam website coincided with a rise in surveillance as a feature of popular culture, exemplified by the 1998 film ''[[The Truman Show]]'' and reality television programs such as ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', and as a feature of contemporary art and new media art. From a sociological point of view, JenniCam was an important early example of how the internet could create a cyborg subject by integrating human images with the internet. As such, JenniCam set the stage for conversations regarding the relationship of technology and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jimroglou |first=Krissi M. |title=A camera with a view: JenniCAM, visual representation, and cyborg subjectivity |journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=439 |doi=10.1080/136911899359493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringley's desire to maintain the purity of the cam-eye view of her life eventually created the need to establish that she was within her rights as an adult to broadcast such information, in the legal sense, and that it was not harmful to other adults. Unlike later for-profit webcam services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Webcam Models |url=http://www.pandoramodeling.com/the-pay-scale |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |year=2014 |publisher=Pandora Modelling |first=Jordan |last=Keith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109231404/http://www.pandoramodeling.com/the-pay-scale |archive-date=January 9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ringley did not spend her day displaying her naked body and she spent much more time discussing her romantic life than she did her sex life.&lt;ref name="salon08042000"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/log/2000/08/04/jennicam/index.html |title=Jenni's in love |date=August 8, 2000 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |first=Alice |last=Lipowicz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031026141953/http://archive.salon.com/tech/log/2000/08/04/jennicam/index.html |archive-date=October 26, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/01/cov_08feature.html |title=21st: Live!

Sources stated that JenniCam received over 100 million visitors weekly. Nate Lanxon of ''[[CNET]]'' said "remember this is 1996 and the Web as we know it now had barely lost its virginity, let alone given birth to the God-child we know as the modern Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lanxon |first=Nate |title=The greatest defunct Web sites and dotcom disasters. |work=[[CNET]] |date=June 5, 2008 |url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters-49296926/2/ |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
On April 3, 1996, during her junior year at [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], the 19-year-old Ringley installed a webcam in her college [[dorm]] room and provided images from that cam on a [[webpage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazing.com/jennifer/ |title=Jennifer Ringley doesn't live here anymore ... |first=David H |last=Dennis |work=Amazing (blog) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605013816/http://www.amazing.com/jennifer/ |archive-date=June 5, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The webpage would automatically refresh every three minutes with the most recent picture from the camera. Initially, anyone with Internet access could observe the often mundane events of Ringley's life; however, a few months after its start, Ringley started charging viewers for full entry to her site.&lt;ref name="Banet-Weider" /&gt; JenniCam was one of the first web sites that continuously and voluntarily surveyed a private life. Her first webcam contained only black-and-white images of her in the dorm room. JenniCam attracted up to four million views a day at its peak.&lt;ref name="Banet-Weider" /&gt;

At times during the first couple of years of JenniCam, Ringley performed stripteases for the webcam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/story-eye |title=The Story of the Eye |date=September 9, 1997 |first=Hari |last=Kunzru |work=[[Mute (magazine)|Mute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until an incident occurred wherein she was discovered by a group of hackers on Efnet who teased her for their own amusement. After she reacted humorously to their taunts, JenniCam was [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]], and Ringley received death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usd.edu/~rbirgen/Joe/JKR.html |title=Jennifer Kaye Ringley |first=Joseph John James |last=Birgen |work=Gremlin (blog) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611190704/http://www.usd.edu/~rbirgen/Joe/JKR.html |archive-date=June 11, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers turned out to be approximately 100 people including a handful of teen pranksters,&lt;ref name=Ed&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9903/26/jennicam/ |title='Ed' of the Internet: JenniCAM going strong after three years |date=March 26, 1999 |work=[[CNN]] |first=Jamie |last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ringley did no more stripteases after that.

Initially, the camera tended to be turned off during especially private moments, but eventually this custom was abandoned, and images were captured of Ringley engaging in sex.

In May 1997, Ringley graduated from Dickinson with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

===Washington D.C.===
When Ringley moved to Washington, D.C. in 1998, she added webcams to cover the additional living space (four webcams captured images of her life). She began charging for access to her site, allowing both paid and free access with the paid access updating the images more frequently than the free access. She added more pages to her website that included pictures of her cats and ferrets. Her site was doing well as she stayed home and claimed her profession to be a "[[web designer]]" for her site.&lt;ref name=Ed/&gt;

As Ringley attracted a following both on and off the Internet, more than 100 media outlets from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' to ''Modern Ferret'' ran features. Ringley owned several [[ferret]]s and ''Modern Ferret'' featured Jenni and one of her pets on the front cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.modernferret.com/mfm028/index.html |magazine=Modern Ferret |number=28 |title=Chatting with Jennicam |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217120712/http://modernferret.com/mfm028/index.html |archive-date=December 17, 2003 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an actress, she was cast in "[[Rear Windows '98]]," a 1998 episode of the TV series ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', portraying Joannecam, a fictionalized version of herself. She also hosted her own Internet talk show titled &lt;i&gt;The Jennishow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1999/02/16/the-moving-pixel-show/dd3308e0-892e-4f07-99a6-d27fd92de931/?utm_term=.239664884fb6 |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=The Moving Pixel Show |date=16 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[The Sync]], an early webcasting network based in [[Laurel, Maryland]].

Ringley's standard of living improved with a new larger apartment, expensive furniture and several business trips to [[Amsterdam]] with her accountant. She claimed that the experience improved her self-image and self body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jspace.org/jennireuters |title=Jennifer Ringley is her own paparazzi |date=September 22, 1997 |work=j-space (blog) |first=Jake |last=Savin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ringley began to take trips to visit other cam girls, including [[Ana Voog]] of Anacam.com.

At the height of her popularity, an estimated three to four million people watched JenniCam.org daily. She eventually purchased the domain jennicam.com as well. She appeared July 31, 1998 as a guest on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. At the end of the interview, and even after having been corrected once, Letterman plugged the site as Jennicam.net instead of the correct Jennicam.com (Ringley owned both Jennicam.com and Jennicam.org). People visiting the previously non-existent Jennicam.net found a pornographic site with the greeting, "Thanks Dave".

She also appeared on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[World News Tonight With Peter Jennings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesync.com/wcfs/ |title=Harmful to Minors Law Going to Court in New Mexico |work=Webcasters Coalition for Free Speech |date=September 21, 1999 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621002402/http://thesync.com/wcfs/ |archive-date=June 21, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, clips from &lt;i&gt;The Jennishow&lt;/i&gt; were included in the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "Fame After Photography." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_press-release_386987.pdf |title=PROVOCATIVE EXHIBITION AT MOMA TRACES THE COMPLEX CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHY AND FAME |date=June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacramento===
When Ringley moved to [[Sacramento, California]], she documented the boxing of her possessions with free live streaming and full audio. Ringley received some criticism from fans when she became involved with Dex, a man who was the fiancé of a fellow webcammer and friend who helped her move to California.&lt;ref name="salon08042000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/758 |title=Little Jenni Homewrecker: Web vixen gets shot by her own cam |date=July 27, 2000 |first=Lou |last=Cabron |work=GettingIt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623031455/http://www.gettingit.com/article/758 |archive-date=June 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She shut down her site on December 31, 2003, citing [[PayPal]]'s new anti-nudity policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/12/BUG3U3LP7J1.DTL |title=Curtains in the bedroom – JenniCam switches off |date=December 12, 2003 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Todd |last=Wallack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3360063.stm |title=R.I.P.

==After JenniCam==
Since the end of 2003, Ringley has avoided having a presence on the Internet and on [[social media]] and tries to stay out of public spotlight.&lt;ref name="replyall" /&gt;

Ringley worked for a web developer after a brief stint as a case worker for a social services agency in Sacramento. Out of the public eye, she stated, "I really am enjoying my privacy now.  I don't have a web page; I don't have a MySpace page. It's a completely different feeling, and I think I'm enjoying it."&lt;ref&gt;"Behind the Scenes with Jennifer Ringley", segment of "Webjunk" on [[VH1]], posted to IFILM on March 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Ringley spoke to the podcast [[Reply All (podcast)|Reply All]] about her experiences with Jennicam; the podcast noted that Jenny "is almost entirely absent from the Internet ... just the way she likes it."&lt;ref name="replyall"&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://gimletmedia.com/episode/5-the-jennicam/ |title=#5 Jennicam |series=[[Reply All (podcast)|Reply All]] |number=5 |date=December 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Gimlet Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rare 2016 interview with the [[BBC]], Ringley described herself as a programmer in California and married to a man with the very common surname of [[Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37681006 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Jennicam: The first woman to stream her life on the internet |date=October 18, 2016 |first=Aleks |last=Krotoski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z414z |title=Jennifer |series=The Digital Human |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4]] |season=10 |airdate=17 October 2016 |first=Aleks |last=Krotoski}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlprraumInfamy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alptraum |first1=Lux |title=There Is Life After Campus Infamy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/style/campus-sex-women-exposure.html |accessdate=22 July 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Kochouseph Chittilappilly was born to C. O. Thomas in [[Parappur]], a suburb of [[Thrissur]] in the south Indian state of Kerala in 1950.&lt;ref name="Leaders of Kerala profile"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.leadersofkerala.com/documents/Biography/43_43.pdf | title=Leaders of Kerala profile | publisher=Leaders of Kerala | date=2015 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early schooling was at the local church school after which he graduated from [[Christ College, Irinjalakuda]] and followed it with a master's degree in Physics from [[St. Thomas College, Thrissur]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Leaders of Kerala profile" /&gt; His career kick started in 1973 at Telics, a [[Thiruvananthapuram]] based electronics company manufacturing voltage stabilizers and emergency lamps, in the capacity of a supervisor where he worked for three years.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt;

In 1977, he founded [[V-Guard Industries Ltd|V-Guard Industries]], a small electronics manufacturing unit for the production of voltage stabilizers with a capital of {{INR}}100,000.&lt;ref name="Kochouseph Chittilappilly: Founder of V-Guard Industries does 'unconventional' things" /&gt; The company which had 2 employees at its modest manufacturing facility in [[Thrissur]] at inception, grew over the years to become the largest selling stabilizer brand in India.&lt;ref name="Stabilising Effect"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.valueresearchonline.com/story/h2_storyView.asp?str=26062 | title=Stabilising Effect | publisher=Value Research Online | date=2015 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims to have 500 distributors, 3000 dealers, 20,000 retailers and a network of service centres across India&lt;ref name="V-Guard Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vguard.in/about-us/story | title=V-Guard Story | publisher=V-Guard | date=2015 | accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting a product range composed of Pumps and Motors, Electric and Solar Water Heaters, Wiring Cables, UPS, and Ceiling Fans.&lt;ref name="Leaders of Kerala profile" /&gt; The company has an Indian market share of 20 percent in UPS segment, 15 percent in pumps, 12 percent in water heaters and 7 percent in wiring cables segments.&lt;ref name="Stabilising Effect" /&gt;

==Philanthropic and humanitarian activities==
[[File:ORGAN DONATION APPRECIATION FUNCTION.jpg|thumb]]
K. Chittilapilly Foundation, founded by Kochouseph Chittilapilly, is a non profit organization and serves as the conduit for his philanthropic activities.&lt;ref name="Chittilappilly Foundation declares organ donation awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Chittilappilly-Foundation-declares-organ-donation-awards/articleshow/18455431.cms | title=Chittilappilly Foundation declares organ donation awards | publisher=Times of India | date=12 February 2013 | accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation, based in Kakkanadu, Kochi, also oversees the activities of Thomas Chittilapilly Trust, another charitable venture of Chittilapilly which is named after his father and runs two institutions, an old age home where elderly people are housed and provided with sustenance and medical care, and ''Shantimandiram'', a home for destitute children where they are provided with shelter, education and food. The institutions are managed by the Sisters of Nirmala Province, a provincialate of catholic nuns located at [[Kolazhy]] in [[Thrissur]]. It has also instituted an organ donation award for recognising people who come forward for organ donation and to promote organ donation among people. The foundation offers awards for those who voluntarily donate their own organs or to families who donate the organs of their [[brain death|brain-dead]] relatives; the awards carry cash components ranging from {{INR}}100,000 to {{INR}}500,000, totaling {{INR}}3.7 million every year.&lt;ref name="Chittilappilly Foundation declares organ donation awards" /&gt;

In 2011, Chittilapilly donated one of his kidneys to a stranger, a truck driver, and started an organ donor chain - where one of the family members of the recipient had to donate an organ thereby forming a donor chain.&lt;ref name="Kochouseph Chittilappilly: Founder of V-Guard Industries does 'unconventional' things" /&gt; As a part of the programme, Chittilapilly donated one of his kidneys to a truck driver, becoming the first depositor with the [[Kidney Federation of India]] (KFI) and is now closely associated with the movement.&lt;ref name="Businessman donates kidney to truck driver, sets off chain reaction" /&gt;

Chittilappilly is the chairman of the Stray Dog Free movement, which advocates action against the risks allegedly posed by [[stray dog]]s in Kerala, including the amendment of legislation forbidding the killing of these dogs.&lt;ref name="NDTV.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kerala's Leading Businessman Goes on Hunger Strike Against Street Dogs | website=NDTV.com | date=2015-10-26 | url=http://www.ndtv.com/kerala-news/keralas-leading-businessman-goes-on-hunger-strike-against-street-dogs-1236253 | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has pointed to the danger of [[rabies]] and referred to stray dogs as a "menace".&lt;ref name="Express"/&gt; Chittilappilly has staged hunger strikes to protest this legislation, and what he claims is governmental failure to address this issue.&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite web | title=A day’s strike to tackle stray menace | website=The Hindu | date=2015-10-20 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-days-strike-to-tackle-stray-menace/article7782645.ece | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chittilappilly to stage hunger strike in T'puram | website=The Times of India | date=2016-02-07 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/Chittilappilly-to-stage-hunger-strike-in-Tpuram/articleshow/50886686.cms | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has stated that the government's actions amount to valuing stray dogs over human lives and property.&lt;ref name="Basheer"&gt;{{cite web | last=Basheer | first=KPM | title=A dogged drive against stray dogs | website=The Hindu Business Line | date=2015-10-20 | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/a-dogged-drive-against-stray-dogs/article7784837.ece | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has encouraged citizens to pressure the government to amend these laws, and to kill stray dogs themselves despite the accompanying 50-[[rupee]] fine.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite web| title=Chittilappilly Stages Fast Against Stray Dog Menace | website=The New Indian Express | date=2016-03-05 | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Chittilappilly-Stages-Fast-Against-Stray-Dog-Menace/2016/02/21/article3288358.ece | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathrubhumi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chittilappilly launches hunger strike over stray dog menace | website=Mathrubhumi | date=2016-02-21 | url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/chittilappilly-launches-hunger-strike-over-stray-dog-menace-english-news-1.879873 | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chittilappilly has been arrested under statutes preventing cruelty to animals after tying four stray dogs in front of a police station.&lt;ref name="Times Booked"&gt;{{cite web | title=Chittilappilly booked for cruelty against strays | website=The Times of India | date=2015-10-20 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/Chittilappilly-booked-for-cruelty-against-strays/articleshow/49462105.cms | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is related to governmental plans to cull stray dogs which have prompted an international campaign to "Boycott Kerala Tourism".&lt;ref name="NDTV.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohan 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mohan | first=Neethu | title=Stray dogs culling: Boycott Kerala campaign gains momentum | website=www.oneindia.com | date=2015-07-14 | url=http://www.oneindia.com/india/stray-dogs-culling-boycott-kerala-campaign-gains-momentum-1806273.html | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=How far will India's dog-lovers go to save strays? | website=BBC News | date=2015-08-10 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-33822511 | accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Stray Dog Free movement have argued that [[Rabies vaccine#Other animals|vaccination]] and [[spay/neuter]] campaigns are a more effective and humane method of controlling the stray dog population. Members of the Stray Dog Free movement have alleged that opposition is being funded by [[rabies vaccine]] manufacturers.&lt;ref name="Ajeesh"&gt;{{cite news |work=Prokerala | last=Ajeesh | first=A. | title=NGOs opposing culling of stray dogs financed by anti-rabies vaccine lobby: Collector Biju Prabhakar |date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of campaigns of [[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]].

== Campaigns against Song China ==
{{see also|Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty}}
[[File:Mongol warrior of Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|left|Mongol warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot.]]

The campaign for [[Kublai Khan]] to conquer China under the [[Song dynasty]] were specified under the years between 1266-1276. This included the declaration of Kublai Khan as the new emperor of China in the year 1271&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kallie|first1=Szczepanski|title=Mongol Invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/japan/a/Mongolinvasion.htm|website=abouteducation|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the start of the [[Yuan dynasty]] that was a rule incorporated with elements of both Mongul and Chinese influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kublai Khan|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Kublai_Khan.aspx|website=Encyclopedia.com|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After successfully eliminating all resistance to the new Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan wanted to expand his empire by attacking Japan and built around 300-600 vessels in preparation for the assault on Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Campaigns against Japan ==
{{see also|Mongol invasions of Japan}}
Kublai Khan's armada in 1274 made a tactical mistake by sailing into open seas that became targets for the Japanese cannons. Suffering heavy losses, the remaining fleet retreated and prepared for next assault again on 1281. Again on 1281, the Japanese samurais were more than prepared to hold off an invasion attempt by the Kublai Khan's fleet, and which they did so with great success.&lt;ref name="Elements, p. 14"&gt;Winters, Harold ''et al.'' (2001). {{Google books|ZgUvVb0XXG8C|''Battling the Elements,'' p. 14.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even though the campaign failed in the end due to stiff Japanese resistance, Kublai Khan's campaigns saw the development of gunpowder as a form of weaponry.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=The Mongol Invasions of Japan 1274 and 1281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qo4amAg_ygIC&amp;pg=PT41|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0045-9|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns against Burma, Java and Vietnam ==
{{Seealso|First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasion of Java|Mongol invasions of Vietnam}}
Besides Song China and Japan, Kublai Khan also launched campaigns against [[Burma]], [[Java]] and [[Vietnam]]. A series of military conflicts between the Yuan dynasty and the [[Pagan Empire]] took place between 1277 and 1287, collectively known as the [[First Mongol invasion of Burma]]. The invasion toppled the 250-year-old Pagan Empire and the Mongols occupied [[Upper Burma]]. However, Mongol invasions of both Java and Vietnam resulted in failure. Nevertheless, both the [[Trần dynasty]] ([[Đại Việt]]) and [[Champa]] decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty in order to avoid further conflicts.

'''Lakefest''' is a fairly new festival, which began as a music and cider festival, yet in its second year has booked big UK bands propelling it to the status of a full blown music festival.

Bands including The Stages of Dan, The Roving Crows and [[Wurzels|The Wurzels]] starred. Classic West Country games like Welly Wanging and skittles were available to play with a prizes up for grabs. The feedback was so positive that planning went immediately into "Lakefest".

==Background==
{{see also|Assassins|Nizari Ismaili state}}

ُThe Assassins were a group of [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]] that, by capturing or building impregnable forts, established [[Nizari Ismaili state|a "state" of their own]] inside the hostile territories of the [[Seljuq Empire]] of Persia, a [[Sunni Muslim]] government, and later in the Levant. Lacking a conventional army, in order to survive, they started using unconventional tactics such as [[assassination]] of prominent enemy figures and [[psychological warfare]].

The '''Lone Pine''' was a solitary tree on the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]] in [[Turkey]], which marked the site of the [[Battle of Lone Pine]] in 1915. It was a "Turkish Pine" of species ''[[Pinus brutia]]''.

[[Pinus|Pines]] which are planted as a memorial to the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Australian and New Zealand soldiers]] who fought in Gallipoli are also known as "Lone Pines" or "Gallipoli Pines". However, there are at least two species of pine in that locality&amp;mdash;in addition to "Turkish Pine" ''Pinus brutia'', the "Aleppo Pine" ''Pinus halepensis'' is also common. Branches from "Allepo" pines were also used by the Turks to protect their trenches, and cones and seeds from "Allepo" pines are common at "Lone Pine" memorials in Australia, in particular, the tree at the [[Australian War Memorial]].

The tree at the [[Lone Pine Cemetery]] at Gallipoli is of a third species&amp;mdash;[[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea''.

==The original "Lone Pine"==
The "original" Lone Pine, a "Turkish Pine" of species ''Pinus brutia'', was the sole survivor of a group of trees that had been cut down by Turkish soldiers who had used the timber and branches to cover their trenches during the battle.&lt;ref name="champion trees"/&gt; They has also cut down other trees to do this, most particularly "Aleppo Pines" ''Pinus halepensis''. The tree was obliterated during the battle; however, pine cones that had remained attached to the cut branches over the trenches were retrieved by various Australian soldiers and brought home to Australia.&lt;ref name=Legacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; The resultant seedlings sent home by one soldier were found to be [[Turkish pine]]s, but those sent home by a pair of soldiers were found to be ''Pinus halepensis'' ([[Aleppo pine]]). Initially, Turkish pines were regarded as a subspecies of ''Pinus halepensis'' ([[Aleppo pine]]), but now they are usually classified as a distinct species, ''[[Pinus brutia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, R.D. (1995) ''Horticultural Flora of South-eastern Australia'' 1: 248-249 (University of NSW Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree at Lone Pine Cemetery, Gallipoli==
At the [[Lone Pine Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery|Lone Pine Cemetery]] on the Gallipoli peninsula, a solitary pine was planted in the 1920s to symbolise the original Lone Pine. This tree was inspected in 1987 by an Australian botanist and confirmed to be a [[stone pine]] (''Pinus pinea'').&lt;ref name="champion trees"&gt;{{cite web |title= Champion Trees in Commonwealth War Cemeteries |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |url=http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/CHAMPIONTREES.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721100247/http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/CHAMPIONTREES.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith McDowell, an Australian soldier of the [[23rd Battalion (Australia)|23rd Battalion]] who fought at Gallipoli, brought a pine cone from the battle site home to Australia.&lt;ref name ="Shrine"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.shrine.org.au/getattachment/c074a957-26b4-44b8-9358-a7bb18a93150/The-Shrine--Background.aspx |format=PDF| chapter = The Shrine Reserve | title = Shrine of Remembrance Education Program: Background Information | publisher = Shrine of Remembrance  | accessdate = 29 March 2012| pages = 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later seeds from the cone were planted by his wife's aunt Emma Gray of Grassmere, near [[Warrnambool|Warrnambool, Victoria]] and five seedlings emerged, with four surviving. These seedlings were planted in four different locations in Victoria: [[Wattle Park, Melbourne]] (8 May 1933), the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] (11 June 1933), the Soldiers Memorial Hall at [[The Sisters, Victoria|The Sisters]] near Terang (18 June 1933) and [[Warrnambool]] Botanic Gardens (23 January 1934).&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web |title=Gallipoli "Lone Pine" lives on |publisher=Legacy |url=http://www.balmoralcemetery.com/00_pdfs/gallipoli_lone_pine.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree at the Shrine Reserve was planted near the north-east corner of the building by [[Stanley Savige|Lieutenant-General Sir Stanley Savige]], founder of Melbourne Legacy, at a formal ceremony.&lt;ref name="City of Melbourne"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lone Pine – Shrine Reserve |publisher=City of Melbourne |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=26&amp;pg=1749 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916220445/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=26&amp;pg=1749 |archivedate=16 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the tree required cable bracing following the loss of a major limb and in August 2012, despite measures taken to try to save the tree from the effects of disease caused by the fungus ''[[Diplodia pinea]]'', it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smethurst |first=Annika |author-link=Annika Smethurst |title= Melbourne's Lone Pine tree, planted with seeds from Gallipoli Peninsula, has been cut down |date=24 August 2012 |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/melbournes-lone-pine-tree-planted-with-seeds-from-gallipoli-peninsula-has-been-cut-down/story-e6frf7kx-1226457038292 |accessdate=28 September 2012 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher=News Corp Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; A "grandchild tree" was planted nearby in 2006.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news |author=Smith, Bridie |title=Shrine's Lone Pine facing battle to death with attacking fungus |work = The Age |date=22 June 2012 |url= http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/shrines-lone-pine-facing-battle-to-death-with-attacking-fungus-20120621-20qzt.html |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Middle Park, Victoria|Middle Park]] man, Andrew Lees, collected cones from the broken limb in 2005 and by 2015 had managed to germinate about 20 seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theweeklyreviewbayside.com.au/story/1831805/anzac-day-no-need-to-pine-for-a-chip-off-the-old-block/ |title=No need to pine for a chip off the old block |publisher=The Weekly Review Bayside |date=9 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120022/http://www.theweeklyreviewbayside.com.au/story/1831805/anzac-day-no-need-to-pine-for-a-chip-off-the-old-block/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another soldier, Lance Corporal Benjamin Smith from the [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd Battalion]], also retrieved a cone from the battle site and sent it back to his mother in Australia, (Mrs McMullen), who had lost another son at the battle. Seeds from the cone were planted by her in 1928, from which two seedlings were raised.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; One was presented to her home town of [[Inverell, New South Wales]] and the other was forwarded to [[Canberra]] where it was planted by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] at the [[Australian War Memorial]] (AWM) in October 1934.&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lone Pine Tree |publisher=Australian War Memorial |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/lone.asp|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWM lone pine lost two of its large lower limbs by strong winds preceding a thunderstorm on 27 December 2008.  However, tree surgeons were able to save the historic tree.&lt;ref name="AWMPine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd |first=Mark |title=Living war memorial at risk |work=News Limited |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=2008-12-29 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24850359-31477,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231155352/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C24850359-31477%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2009-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCAM"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lane | first = Sabra | title = Australian War Memorial's Lone Pine will survive | work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | publisher = AM  | date = 2008-12-30 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s2456478.htm | accessdate = 2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Melbourne Legacy and the Yarralumla Nursery in Canberra have raised and grown seedlings over a number of years, sourced from the tree at the Shrine of Remembrance and the Australian War Memorial respectively, which they have presented to schools as well as ex-service and other organisations throughout Australia.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilcox, Mike |author2=Spencer David |title=Stand up for the real Anzac Lone Pine of Gallipoli |journal=New Zealand Journal of Forestry |volume=52 |number=1 |year= 2007 |pages=3–9 |url=http://nzjf.org.nz/free_issues/NZJF52_1_2007/ABC34FDA-39BA-438B-B1B1-7A236CAE712B.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other "Lone Pines" include:
*Plaques at the base of the pine tree at the Oatley Park Avenue entrance to [[Oatley Park, New South Wales|Oatley Park]], NSW, state it was planted in 1920 by Owen Jones Davies from pine cones obtained from Lone Pine, Gallipoli.
*The two Lone Pine seedlings at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in [[Canberra]] were presented by the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] on [[Remembrance Day]], 11 November 1987.
*The pine at the Battle of Lone Pine memorial at Adelaide's [[National War Memorial (South Australia)#Adjacent memorials|National War Memorial]] is accompanied by a plaque stating "This pine is a seedling related to the original Lone Pine on Gallipoli"
*A seedling of ''[[Pinus brutia]]'', propagated from the original tree at Lone Pine was planted in the grounds of the [[Victorian School of Forestry]] at [[Creswick, Victoria|Creswick]] on 23 March 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://omeka.cloud.unimelb.edu.au/cchc/items/show/6808|title=Pinus brutia (lone pine). ,” Creswick Campus Historical Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque was also unveiled by [[Legacy Australia|Legacy]].

==Trees in New Zealand==
In [[Auckland]], two trees identified as "Lone Pines" have been planted. One is a ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' planted at [[Waikumete Cemetery|Waikumete cemetery]] in 1961 and another is  a ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' at [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], planted on [[Anzac Day]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;   A tree identified as "The Anzac Pine" stands on [[Te Mata Peak]] at Havelock North in Hawkes Bay. Although a specimen of ''Pinus brutia'' was originally planted, the current tree is identified as the species ''Pinus radiata''.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;  Two  specimens of ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'', planted in 1951,  are located at the Lone Pine Memorial at the cemetery in [[Taradale, New Zealand|Taradale]], and further specimens are located at King Edward Park in [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] and Queens Park in [[Wanganui]].&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;
There is a "Lone Pine" at the Paeroa golf course, at the ladies tee, on the second hole. This tree appears to be New Zealand's only authentic ''Pinus brutia'' that can be traced back to the original pines, according to "Excerpts from NZ Journal of Forestry, May 2007".
Also, in [[Victoria Park, Christchurch]], there is a plaque which claims that the nearby pine tree was grown from a seedling of the Gallipoli Lone Pine.

The '''M1 Singapore Fringe Festival''' is an annual [[fringe theatre]] festival in [[Singapore]]. In additional to theatrical performances, it hosts art installations, live music, and a forum. It is organised by [[The Necessary Stage]], a non-profit theatre company. The festival occurs each January with a different theme, such as "Art and the People" (2014), "Art &amp; Loss" (2015), and "Art &amp; the Animal" (2016).

The tenth M1 Singapore Fringe Festival took place in 2014. It had a higher attendance than any previous M1 festival. It was after this festival that The Necessary Stage instituted a policy of appointing a new [[artistic director]] every two years. The company intends the two-year tenure to give each director time to realise a vision for the festival, while building relationships with artists and curators.

It is in the collection of [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]], [[Pinakothek der Moderne|Pinakother der Moderne]] in [[Munich]] and [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMa]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-roman-ondak-measuring-universe|title = TateShots: Roman Ondak, Measuring the Universe|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The only items required for the installation were a white room and a few black markers. What began as  a clean white space has been filled with letters and lines and numbers as people pass through the gallery. Each tiny line represents a different person. The thousands and thousands of lines show just how many people pass through the museum each day, how many people were, affected by this installation.

The 1969 '''murder of Diane Maxwell''' involved the death of Diane Maxwell, a 25-year-old phone operator for [[Southwestern Bell]], who was found raped and killed in a shack in December 1969 in [[Houston, Texas]].

==Crime==
On December 14, 1969, 25-year-old Diane Maxwell (b. 1944) was walking to her job as a phone operator for Southwestern Bell, but never made it to the building. Later that day, a man by the name of William Bell noticed a man walking away from a shack. When Bell came to look in the shack, he found the raped, dead body of Maxwell, and immediately notified police.

However, the case remained unsolved due to the lack of computer technology. In 1986, seventeen years after the incident, they reopened the case, but could not solve it again, and the case remained closed until July 2003, 34 years after the murder was committed. A batch of forensics they had performed in 1969 was found by Houston police, who located James Ray Davis, a lifetime criminal, last convicted of kidnapping a young girl, who was considered the perpetrator of the Maxwell rape and murder, which was confirmed by DNA evidence, which established that he did rape her. Davis was convicted of first degree murder (the robbery, rape, and kidnapping statute of limitations had expired) shortly afterward, and was sentenced to life without parole.

In 2008, the case was featured in the ''[[Forensic Files]]'' episode "Brotherly Love."

'''Operation Moses''' ({{lang-he-n|מִבְצָע מֹשֶׁה}}, ''Mivtza Moshe'') refers to the covert evacuation of [[Ethiopian Jew|Ethiopian Jews]] (known as the "[[Beta Israel]]" community or "Falashas")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_moses.html |title=Operation Moses |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Sudan]] during a civil war that caused a famine in 1984. Originally called ''Gur Aryeh Yehuda''  (“Cub of the Lion of Judah”) by Israelis, the [[United Jewish Appeal]] changed the name to “Operation Moses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenhoff|first=Howard|title=Black Jews, Jews, and Other Heroes: How Grassroots Activism Led to the Rescue of the Ethiopian Jews|year=2007|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=978-9652293657|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The operation, named after the [[Bible|biblical]] figure [[Moses]], was a cooperative effort between the [[Israel Defense Forces]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the United States embassy in [[Khartoum]], [[mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Sudan]]ese state security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaej.co.il/newsite/content.asp?pageid=449&amp;lang=en Aliyah through Sudan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206203622/http://www.iaej.co.il/newsite/content.asp?pageid=449&amp;lang=en |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Years after the operation completed, it was revealed that Sudanese Muslims and secret police of Sudan also played a role in facilitating the mass migration of Ethiopian Jews out of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenhoff|first=Howard|title=Black Jews, Jews, and Other Heroes: How Grassroots Activism Led to the Rescue of the Ethiopian Jews|year=2007|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=978-9652293657|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Moses was the brainchild of then Associate U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs, Richard Krieger. After receiving accounts of the persecution of Ethiopian Jews in the refugee camps, Krieger came up with the idea of an airlift and met with Mossad and Sudanese representatives to facilitate the Operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bard|first1=Mitchell|last2=Lenhoff|first2=Howard|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ejus.html|title=Ethiopian Jewry: America's Role in the Rescue of Ethiopian Jewry|work= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b79tAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=richard+krieger|title=Redemption Song|work=google.com|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a secret Israeli cabinet meeting in November 1984, the decision was made to go forward with Operation Moses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today in History: Operation Moses|url=http://www.idfblog.com/2011/11/21/today-in-history-the-moshe-operation-bringing-thousand-of-jews-to-israel/|publisher=IDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning November 21, 1984, it involved the air transport by [[Trans European Airways]] of some 8,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan via [[Brussels]] to [[Israel]], ending January 5, 1985.

Over those seven weeks, over 30 flights brought about 200 Ethiopian Jews at a time to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omer-Man|first=Michael|title=This week in History: Operation Moses begins|url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=195989|publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trans European Airways]] had flown out of Sudan previously with Muslims making the pilgrimage to Mecca, so using TEA was a logical solution for this semi-covert operation because it would not provoke questions from the airport authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenhoff|first=Howard|title=Black Jews, Jews, and Other Heroes: How Grassroots Activism Led to the Rescue of the Ethiopian Jews|year=2007|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=978-9652293657|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this operation, there were approximately as few as 250 Ethiopian immigrants in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kaplan, Steven  |author2=Salamon, Hagar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Jews in Israel: Contemporary Social and Cultural Patterns|year=2004|publisher=Brandeis|isbn=978-1584653271|page=Chapter Five: Ethiopian Jews in Israel: A Part of the People or Apart from the People?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of Beta Israel had fled Ethiopia on foot for refugee camps in Sudan, a journey which usually took anywhere from two weeks to a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Immigrant Absorption|title=Operation Moses – Aliyah of Ethiopian Jewry (1984)|url=http://www.moia.gov.il/English/FeelingIsrael/AboutIsrael/Pages/mivtzaMoshe.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated as many as 4,000 died during the trek, due to violence and illness along the way. Sudan secretly allowed Israel to evacuate the refugees. Two days after the airlifts began, Jewish journalists wrote about “the mass rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenhoff|first=Howard|title=Black Jews, Jews, and Other Heroes: How Grassroots Activism Led to the Rescue of the Ethiopian Jews|year=2007|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=978-9652293657|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Moses ended on Friday, January 5, 1985, after Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] held a press conference confirming the airlift while asking people not to talk about it. Sudan killed the airlift moments after Peres stopped speaking, ending it prematurely as the news began to reach their Arab allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Over White: Info on Ethiopian Jews|url=http://cjebaltimore.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the story broke in the media, Arab countries pressured Sudan to stop the airlift. Although thousands made it successfully to Israel, many children died in the camps or during the flight to Israel, and it was reported that their parents brought their bodies down from the aircraft with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jewish Chronicle|title=Operation Moses Suspended: January 5 1985: The world learns of the rescue of Ethiopian Jews|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/on-day/43249/on-day-operation-moses-suspended}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1,000 Ethiopian Jews were left behind, approximately 500 of whom were evacuated later in the U.S.-led [[Operation Joshua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kaplan, Steven  |author2=Salamon, Hagar |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Jews in Israel: Contemporary Social and Cultural Patterns (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)|year=2004|publisher=Brandeis|isbn=978-1584653271|page=Chapter Five}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 so-called "orphans of circumstance" existed in Israel, children separated from their families still in Africa, until five years later [[Operation Solomon]] took 14,324 more Jews to Israel in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ejhist.html#operation1 |title=The History of Ethiopian Jews |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Solomon in 1991 cost Israel $26 million to pay off the dictator-led government, while Operation Moses had been the least expensive of all rescue operations undertaken by Israel to aid Jews in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenhoff|first=Howard|title=Black Jews, Jews, and Other Heroes:|year=2007|publisher=Gefen Publishing House|isbn=978-9652293657|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
This operation was the subject of an Israeli-French film titled ''[[Live and Become]]'', directed by Romanian-born [[Radu Mihăileanu]]. The film centers on an Ethiopian child whose Christian mother passes him as a Jew so he can immigrate to Israel along with the Jews in order to escape the famine that is looming in Ethiopia. The film went on to win the 2005 award for Best Film at the [[Copenhagen International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388505/|title=Live and Become (2005)|date=1 February 2008|work=IMDb|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[World War Z]]'' by Max Brooks, the evacuation of African Jews to Israel in response to the outbreak of the titular epidemic is referred to as Operation Moses II.

== 2010 shooting ==
During the 2010 Pink Saturday, on June 26, 19-year-old Stephen Powell was killed after being shot four times in the chest. Two others were injured after being shot in the leg. A 20-year-old man named Ed Perkins was arrested in connection with the shooting. Perkins knew Powell, but did not know the two others. The shooting was not a [[hate crime]], occurred outside the actual Pink Saturday event area, and was reported as gang-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Suspect-in-Pink-Saturday-shooting-identified-97329604.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/06/29/BATC1E686J.DTL&amp;type=gaylesbian |title=Police identify suspected Castro shooter |publisher=SFGate |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_15391289 |title=Teen killed at street party - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rey de Reyes 2003''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "King of Kings") was the seventh annual [[Rey de Reyes]] [[professional wrestling]] tournament and show, produced by the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The event took place on March 16, 2003 in [[Zapopan]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. In a break from tradition that year's Rey de Reyes tournament featured six former Rey de Reyes winners wrestling each other to determine 2003's Rey de Reyes. The final match saw [[La Parka, Jr.]] compete against [[Abismo Negro]].

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt;  The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 show was the seventh Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured at least four [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portray either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portrayed the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Records for four of matches have been found for the 2003 Rey de Reyes show, but it is possible more took place.

'''Richard James Sheirer''' (October 12, 1946 – January 19, 2012) was a [[public servant]] and [[New York City]] official. Sheirer served as the Director of the [[New York City Office of Emergency Management]] (O.E.M.) from February 2000 to March 2002.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Weber|title=Richard J.

==Life==
Sheirer was born in Brooklyn on October 12, 1946, and raised in the borough's [[Canarsie]], [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He graduated from [[St. Francis College]] in [[Brooklyn Heights]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Sheirer had begun his career as a [[dispatcher]] for the New York City Fire Department (NYFD) in 1967.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was promoted to deputy commissioner under NYC Fire Commissioner [[Howard Safir]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Safir, who became the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] in 1996, named Sheirer as his deputy commissioner for [[administration (government)|administration]] and [[chief of staff]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In February 2000, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appointed Sheirer as Director of the OEM  (Giuliani had created the department in 1996).&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Sheirer was thrust into the public eye in September 2001, when, as director of the OEM during the [[September 11th attacks]], he became responsible for New York City's [[rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks|rescue and recovery effort]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Sheirer coordinated the rescue and clean-up efforts at the former [[World Trade Center site]], involving numerous federal, state, and local emergency agencies.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He stepped down as Director of the OEM in March 2002 when Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] took office.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

The '''Rocket Racing League''' was&lt;ref name="twit"&gt;{{Triangulation|195|Peter Diamandis}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[racing]] league that planned to use [[rocket]]-powered [[aircraft]] to race a closed-circuit air racetrack.  Founded in 2005, the league made its first public flights in 2010 and was working to begin regular racing seasons. The "Rocket Racers" were slated to compete in the air and on a virtual racetrack easily viewed by a live audience as well as projected on large screen and handheld electronic displays.

Three prototype [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]-style ''Rocket Racer'' aircraft were built between 2006 and 2010.

The league had planned to hold its inaugural race season in 2008 with four races, but encountered financial difficulties that delayed fielding of ''Rocket Racers'' by the six teams that had been previously announced.  With the addition of [[venture capital]] funding in mid-2009, technology development continued and one exhibition occurred in 2010, with another round of plans for an inaugural season of races in 2011.  The 2011 races were, in the end, never scheduled, and by 2014, the league was defunct.&lt;ref name=sn20141221/&gt;

==Background==

Projected to be an hour and one half in length, the races were intended to be between Rocket Racer planes that used [[liquid oxygen]] and either [[kerosene]] or [[ethanol]] fuel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketracingleague.com/about-rocket-racer.html Rocket Racer fact sheet from League website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810103131/http://www.rocketracingleague.com/about-rocket-racer.html |date=August 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a burn time of four minutes. The rocketplanes were expected to cost less than US$1 million each. The planes were based on the fixed-gear [[Velocity SE]] modified by [[XCOR Aerospace]] and the retractible gear [[Velocity XL]] modified by [[Armadillo Aerospace]] for the purpose of rocket racing.  The Velocity airframe was derived from a commercially available kit plane that traced its design heritage to the [[Rutan Long-EZ]], which had been modified to accept rocket power and custom avionics. In order to provide the airframes, RRL purchased the aircraft's manufacturer, [[Velocity Aircraft]], in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketracingleague.com/media/press_releases/2008_4_14_oshkosh.html RRL press release announcing acquisition of Velocity.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527004334/http://www.rocketracingleague.com/media/press_releases/2008_4_14_oshkosh.html |date=May 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Xcor-rocketracer-N216MR-071029-37cr-16.jpg|thumb|left|The Rocket Racer on landing roll-out at Mojave.]]

The RRL had been called "[[NASCAR]] with rockets", XCOR Aerospace flew the Rocket Racer for a public audience at the 2008 [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|EAA AirVenture Airshow]] at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/07/29/1232296.aspx | title = Rocket racer goes public | date = Posted: Tuesday, July 29, 2008 6:07 PM | author = Alan Boyle | work = Cosmic Log | publisher = MSNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20080801&gt;{{cite news | title = Rocket Racing League Wants to be NASCAR in the Air | author = Ken Denmead | date = August 1, 2008 | publisher = Wired | url = http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/08/rocket-racing-l.html  | accessdate = 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; If league competition were to begin, Whitelaw indicated tournament semifinals would be held each September in Nevada, with finals each October in New Mexico at the [[X Prize Cup]] competing for a $2 million championship purse.

Races were to have taken place on a [[Course (navigation)|race course]] two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long, one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide, and {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in the air. A typical race would take about one hour, and fans would be able to see multiple camera views, including cockpit, "on-track," "side-by-side" and wing-angle views.

Additionally, a computer game had been planned which was to have interfaced with racer positional data in real time over the internet, allowing players to virtually compete with the rocket pilots.

===The Track===

The proposed "track" for a typical Rocket Race was to have begun with a staggered start. Pilots were to take off in pairs a few minutes apart, they would be competing against the clock but would maneuver around each other much like NASCAR. The pilots would be guided by a virtual three-dimensional "track" projected in their [[head-up display]]. Each racer was to have a separate track to follow but the courses were planned to be close together to build excitement.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Teams===

{{As of|2008}}, there were six teams registered to compete in the inaugural 2008 race season, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing, Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing and Thunderhawk Rocket Racing.&lt;ref name=wired20080801/&gt;  

{{as of|2012}}, RRL claimed that "official team recruitment will commence as the production-level Rocket Racers near completion." listing five "candidate teams of the RRL franchise": Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, and [[Canada]]-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketracingleague.com/under-the-hood/x-racers/ Rocket Racing League Teams], Rocket Racing League website, 2012, accessed 2012-12-15.  "''Official team recruitment will commence as the production-level Rocket Racers near completion. Early candidate teams of the RRL franchise include Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing, Rocket Star Racing,, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, and Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The formation of the league was announced by [[Granger Whitelaw]], and [[Peter Diamandis]], founder of the [[Ansari X-Prize]], in October 2005&lt;ref name=msnbc20051003&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9572408/ ‘Rocket racing league’ gets its start], Alan Boyle, ''[[msnbc.com]]'', 2005-10-03, accessed 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with the [[Reno Air Races]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  According to Diamandis, the purpose of the league was to "inspire people of all ages to once again look up into the sky and find inspiration and excitement."{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Initial plans called for a four-team league finals in 2006, to be followed by 10 teams competing in 2007, with video games based on the competition also out in 2007.&lt;ref name=msnbc20051003/&gt;
In 2006, analysts identified doubts about the economics of the venture, and especially of the ability of RRL to attract a large fanbase similar to [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] and [[NASCAR]]&lt;ref name=ps20060215&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2006-02/x-racers-start-your-rockets  X-Racers, Start Your Rockets! : The creators of the X prize offer a sensational vision of rocket-powered airplanes speeding through the sky. But can their new racing league steal a bit of Nascar's thunder?], Michael Belfiore, ''[[Popular Science]]'' (feature cover story), 2006-02-15, accessed 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the event, no races occurred in either 2006 or 2007.

In April 2008, the league stated that it was "ready for competition [announcing] four exhibition races will be held later [in the] year, one in Las Cruces."&lt;ref name=lcsn20080415&gt;
{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2008, the Racing Rocket Racing Composite Corporation, a subsidiary of the Rocket Racing League, acquired Velocity Aircraft.  The RRL announced their goal was to "produce an airframe that will be consistent for all competing Rocket Racers."&lt;ref name=pa20080414&gt;
[http://www.parabolicarc.com/2008/04/14/rocket-racing-composite-corp-acquires-velocity-aircraft/ Rocket Racing Composite Corp. Acquires Velocity Aircraft], ''Parabolic Arc'', 2008-04-14, accessed 2011-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2010, a Velocity employee posted to the builder's email-list a note from Scott and Duane Swing that stated that they had bought back full ownership of Velocity Inc from Rocket Racing League. The RRL now owns no share of Velocity Inc.&lt;ref name=tvbf20100526&gt;[[Talk:Velocity, Inc.#Source for the claim that the Swing family has purchased the company back from RRL|Swing Family Repurchase of Velocity Inc. from Rocket Racing League]], Velocity Aircraft Listserve, text copy from tvbf.org archives, 2010-05-26. ''"For those of you wondering just what influence Rocket Racing has with Velocity, let me assure you that they have none. As I write this, the sole ownership of Velocity Inc. is now totally and completely in the hands of Scott Swing and myself. Through a stock exchange, Scott and I returned our Rocket Racing stock for 100% return of the stock they held in Velocity Inc. Rocket Racing now has 0% ownership in this company. ... Scott and Duane Swing"''&lt;/ref&gt;

===League financial difficulties ===
None of the four planned 2008 races were actually run.  The Rocket Racing League had difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient financial backing, from both investors and sponsors, in order to get an initial racing season firmly scheduled in 2008, 2009, or 2010.  Some progress with the rocket and aircraft technology continued however, but by 2014, the league had gone defunct.&lt;ref name=sn20141221/&gt;

The league twice failed to complete construction of six hangars contracted to be built on land adjacent to [[Spaceport America]] near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], [[New Mexico]].  As of January 2009, the league was at risk of having their leases with the City of Las Cruces terminated.&lt;ref name=lcsn20090106&gt;

In July 2009, the league announced the closing of a [[venture capital financing]] round of US$5.5 million.  The funds were to be used for ongoing operations and for the development of a next-generation Rocket Racer.&lt;ref name=sf20090704&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:rocketplane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rocket Racer at Tulsa International Airport, April 2010]]
{{as of|February 2010}}, [[Peter Diamandis]] suggested that 2010 could be the year that we see "more than one racer in the air and possibly in exhibition races."  Non-exhibition "live" races were to occur as early as 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?contentBlockId=a7228862-97ce-4bc4-801b-04b18a772aed Aero-TV: Rocket Racing League -- Diamandis Plans 2010 Exhibition Racing], ''Aero-News Network'', 2010-02-15, retrieved 2010-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in February, the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum#Planetarium|Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium]] (TASM) announced that it would partner with the Rocket Racing League to host an exhibition flight of a Rocket Racer at the QuikTrip Air and Rocket Show at [[Tulsa International Airport]] in April 2010.&lt;ref name=tasm20100216&gt;

The Rocket Racing League announced a "2010 World Exhibition Tour" on April 24, 2010, when they unveiled their ''[[Mark-III X-racer]]'' rocket plane at the QuikTrip Air &amp; Rocket Racing Show in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].  The RRL exhibition flights at Tulsa were the first simultaneous flights of two rocket-powered airplanes in the history of peacetime aviation. RRL duplicated this historic feat later that day. The league's intent in such exhibitions was to "build up the league's fan base, in addition to perfecting operations and technologies, before the league's official launch in 2012."&lt;ref name=sdc20100426&gt;

The league's financial difficulties continued in 2011 and no races were organized.&lt;ref name=ft20111118&gt;
{{cite news |last=Neale|first=Rick |title=Rocket Racing League backs off Melbourne plan : group won't relocate, thanks to cash crunch |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20111118/NEWS01/311180024/Rocket-Racing-League-backs-off-Melbourne-plan?odyssey=nav%7Chead |accessdate=2011-11-19 |newspaper=Florida Today |date=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, persons formerly involved with the league had made public statements that the league had failed and was now defunct.&lt;ref name=sn20141221&gt;
{{cite news |last=Leone|first=Dan |url=http://spacenews.com/qa-with-rep-james-bridenstine-r-okla/ |title=Q&amp;A With Rep.

'It was before its time,' [Bridenstine] lamented'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rocket Racers==
The Rocket Racing League had been developing prototype ''Rocket Racers'' since 2006, working with one airframe manufacturer and two rocket engine producers on three prototype aircraft to date.  All three of the airframes have been of the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] configuration to more easily accommodate the [[Bipropellant rocket|rocket]] [[Rocket propulsion|propulsion]] technology.

A fifth model was proposed, but not built, in 2011:  the Mark-V X-Racer.&lt;ref name=ft20111118/&gt;

===Predecessor aircraft===

[[XCOR Aerospace]] developed the [[XCOR EZ-Rocket]], later flown under Rocket Racing League sponsorship as an X-Racer prototype rocketplane. First flight was July 21, 2001 at Mojave Airport in [[Mojave, California]].&lt;ref name=mtm&gt;
[http://www.mojave.ca.us/museum/photos-cftc-1stflights-xcor.htm First Flights - XCOR Aerospace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110075147/http://www.mojave.ca.us/museum/photos-cftc-1stflights-xcor.htm |date=2006-11-10 }}, Mojave Transportation Museum, accessdate=2006-11-13&lt;/ref&gt;
This XCOR trchnology demonstrator was a converted [[Rutan Long-EZ]] and, in its final version, utilized two 400&amp;nbsp;lbf (1.8&amp;nbsp;kN) thrust XCOR Aerospace [[isopropyl alcohol|isopropyl-alcohol]]-powered [[rocket engine]]s&lt;ref name=ps20060215/&gt; of engine type XR-4A3.&lt;ref name=xa20101227/&gt;
XCOR flew the EZ-Rocket for several years in development and demonstration flights, including, in collaboration with the RRL, at the 2005 [[X-Prize Cup]] in New Mexico.&lt;ref name=ps20060215/&gt;

By 2006, the design-point for the RRL racer had become a single rocket engine utilizing [[RP-1|kerosene]] as the rocket fuel, carrying {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} of [[liquid oxygen]] in its flight oxidizer tank.&lt;ref name=ps20060215/&gt;

The first RRL prototype built, known as the Mark-I X-Racer, was built on a [[Velocity SE]] airframe and was also powered by XCOR Aerospace rocket technology, a regeneratively-cooled and [[Pump-fed engine|pump-fed]] XR-4K14 rocket engine.&lt;ref name=xa20101227&gt;
[http://www.xcor.com/products/index.html Products Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125130731/http://www.xcor.com/products/index.html |date=2010-11-25 }}, ''[[XCOR Aerospace]]'', undated, accessed 2010-12-27. ''"Twin 400 lb-thrust XR-4A3 engines aboard the EZ-Rocket"'' (with in-flight photograph) ... ''"Another engine that we have developed in parallel is the XR-4K14, ... a 1,500 lb thrust regeneratively cooled LOX and pump-fed kerosene system ... used as the Rocket Racer aircraft's main engine."''&lt;/ref&gt;  This rocket-powered aircraft flew several demonstration flights at the 2008 [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] [[air show]].&lt;ref name=ut20090806&gt;

The total thrust for the single-engine Mark-I X-Racer was {{convert|1500|lbf|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ps20060215/&gt; approximately twice that of the EZ-Rocket.

===Mark-II and Mark-III X-Racers===
{{as of|2010}}, the Rocket Racing League was utilizing a highly modified [[Velocity XL#Rocket Racers|Velocity XL]] fixed-gear airframe and an [[Armadillo Aerospace]] 2,500 pound thrust [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) and [[ethanol]] [[rocket engine]] in both its Mark-II X-Racer and Mark-III X-Racer demonstration vehicles.&lt;ref name=rrl20100310&gt;

Plume-seeding technology allowed the plume color to vary from red to green to yellow to better facilitate race spectators in keeping track of specific racers while in the air.&lt;ref name=at201006/&gt;

The Mark-II (N205MB) racer utilized a standard fixed-gear XL airframe, modified for the addition of the Armadillo rocket propulsion.  The Mark-III (N133XP) airframe was modified during manufacturing at [[Velocity Aircraft]] explicitly for use as a Rocket Racer, with canopy top, center seat and control stick, and other enhancements.&lt;ref name=rrl20100310/&gt;

===Mark V X-Racer===
The Mark-V proposed design resembles "a sleek, rocket-powered sailplane" and may be built at [[Velocity Aircraft]], although no firm contracts are in place to do so {{asof|2011|11|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=ft20111118/&gt;

{{Big Five Hawaii}}

'''Samuel Mills Damon''' (March 13, 1845 – July 1, 1924) was a businessman and politician in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], through the [[Republic of Hawaii]] and into the [[Territory of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Samuel Mills Damon was born  in [[Honolulu]] on March 13, 1845.
His father was early missionary [[Samuel Chenery Damon]] (1815–1885) and his mother was Julia Sherman Mills (1817–1890). They arrived in Honolulu in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Portraits of American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii |author= Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |url= https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00hawarich |year=1901 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Hawaiian gazette company  |page= 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His maternal great-uncle was minister [[Samuel John Mills]]  (1783–1818), who took part in the [[Haystack Prayer Meeting]] which led to the formation of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], the group that sent the first American [[list of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries to Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="fam"&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Samuel Chenery Damon]] |title= Damon memorial: or, Notices of three Damon families who came from old England to New England in the XVIIth century |year=1882 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aVBGAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |page= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Punahou School]] from 1856 to 1863.
On September 5, 1872 he married  Harriet Melinda Baldwin (1846–1932), daughter of missionary [[Dwight Baldwin (missionary)|Dwight Baldwin]]  (1798–1886).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Baldwin genealogy from 1500 to 1881 |author= Charles Candee Baldwin |year= 1881 |page= 562 |publisher= O. Cleveland |url= https://archive.org/details/baldwingenealogy00bald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and business===
The Damons had four children: Samuel Edward Damon (born June 1, 1873), Mary Mills Damon (born November 23, 1877), Henry Fowler Damon (born January 16, 1883) and Douglas Wilfred Damon.
His wife's brother [[Henry Perrine Baldwin]] (1842–1911) founded [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]]. This was one of the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]" corporations that dominated the economy of territorial Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alexander &amp; Baldwin, Ltd. and the predecessor partnerships  |author= Arthur Lyman Dean |publisher= Alexander &amp; Baldwin |year= 1950 |url= https://books.google.com/books?cd=0&amp;id=NCfRAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon started work as a clerk in the W. N. Ladd store in Honolulu, run by the son of the founder of ill-fated [[Ladd &amp; Co.]]
In 1871 he went to work for the bank of [[Charles Reed Bishop]], the only one in the Hawaiian Islands at the time. By 1881 he became a full partner in Bishop's bank.&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;
He invested in and served on the board of directors of [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s and the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]],  and was vice president of his brother-in-law's Hawaiian Sugar Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Notice |date= January 23, 1894 |page= 2 |newspaper= The Hawaiian gazette |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1894-01-23/ed-1/seq-2/;words=Damon+sugar+Sugar |accessdate= August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, he inherited over {{convert|9000|acre}} of the area known as [[Moanalua]] from [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Moanalua |dic=pp |accessdate= October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the wife of his business partner, and a Hawaiian princess who inherited the land from King [[Kamehameha I]].&lt;ref name="garden"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Moanalua Horticultural Gardens |title=All about Hawaii: The recognized book of authentic information on Hawaii |editor= Thomas George Thrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NagsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=1913 |publisher=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |pages=75–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Damon was executor of Princess Pauahi's will, and trustee of the estate through 1916. Most of her land went to fund the [[Kamehameha Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= First Trustees Appointed to Care for the Princess's Trust |work= Kamehameha Schools web site |url= http://www.ksbe.edu/pauahi/trustees.php |accessdate= August 8, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527101143/http://www.ksbe.edu/pauahi/trustees.php |archivedate= May 27, 2010 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He successfully appealed a lawsuit to the supreme court to demand exclusive fishing rights to the area offshore of Moanalua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/194/154/case.html|title=Damon v.

In an even more unusual case, Charles Brenig, who had come to Hawaii under the name Simeon Weibert, died and left much of his estate to Damon. The will was contested by Brenig's widow and son, but appeals were denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Appeals to President:Relative of Testator Trys to Interest Roosevelt in Case of Hawaiian Estate of Late Charles Brenig of This City—Wants case Reopened  |date= December 19, 1901 |newspaper= The Honolulu republican |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-12-19/ed-1/seq-9/ |accessdate= August 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bishop moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1893 Damon acquired all shares of the Bishop bank.&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;{{cite book |title=  The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/damon19bs.txt |chapter= Damon, Samuel Mills }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bank later became the [[First Hawaiian Bank]], and Damon's share was sold to [[BNP Paribas]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Daysog04&gt;{{cite news|title= Damon Estate trustees gain millions from land sales |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/04/11/news/story2.html |author= Rick Daysog |date=April 11, 2004 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |accessdate= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
On August 12, 1884 King [[Kalākaua]] made Damon a member of the [[Privy Council]], where he served until March 7, 1891.
He became a member of the board of education on July 7, 1887 and board of Health December 28, 1887.
He was appointed minister of finance on July 22, 1889, replacing amateur [[geologist]] and businessman [[William Lowthian Green]].
He served until being replaced by [[Godfrey Brown (Hawaii)|Godfrey Brown]] on June 17, 1890.&lt;ref name="mof"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5cb6.dir/doc.pdf |title= Finance, Minister of, office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 6, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120403155718/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5cb6.dir/doc.pdf |archivedate= April 3, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He kept on good terms with [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] (his father had performed her wedding ceremony).&lt;ref name="queen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaii's story by Hawaii's queen, Liliuokalani |author= [[Liliuokalani|Liliʻuokalani]] (Queen of Hawaii) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrTCvcy0sE4C  |publisher=Lee and Shepard, reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=July 25, 2007 |origyear=1898 |isbn=978-0-548-22265-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} He was out of town when the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] deposed her. Since he knew people on both sides, he helped negotiate a peaceful outcome, where Lili{{okina}}uokalani surrendered under protest to the US Government.&lt;ref name="queen"/&gt;{{rp|387}}

After the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], he was vice president of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] from February 4, 1893 to May 29, 1893 when he again became minister of finance. He was also on the executive council of [[Sanford B. Dole]] (which replaced the privy council of the monarchy) until May 22, 1895.
When it was apparent that the [[United States]] was not going to annex the islands immediately, he continued in the [[Republic of Hawaii]] government to September 12, 1896.&lt;ref name="off"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHfb0c/5b5e98f2.dir/Damon,%20Samuel%20Mills.jpg |title= Damon, Samuel Mills office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James A. King]] replaced him temporarily in June 1896. He was made a special envoy to attend the [[diamond jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in [[London]]. On August 11, 1897 he held the post for a third time, until November 13, 1899.
He was Hawaii's last minister of finance, serving once more from December 21, 1899 until June 14, 1900 after the [[Hawaiian Organic Act]] established the government of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] and the cabinet was abolished.&lt;ref name="mof"/&gt;

[[File:Samuel Edward Damon.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=young man in bow tie|"Ned" Damon died in 1904]]
His son Samuel Edward "Ned" Damon graduated from Punahou and then [[Yale]]. He studied accounting in [[Glasgow, Scotland]] where he married Gertrude MacKinnon on January 17, 1899. They had four children, although one died young. He returned to work in the family bank, but was stabbed to death on September 27, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowdoin College. Brunswick. Me. Class of 1894 |title=Decennial record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4IDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA300|year=1904 |pages=300–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After S. M. Damon died July 1, 1924, his estate (then estimated worth over US$250 million) was left in trust to his grandchildren. At one time it was the fourth largest private landowner in Hawaii.
Son Henry Fowler Damon graduated from Yale, had children Harriet Damon "Haku" Baldwin (1913–2003), Frances (Damon) Holt, Joan (Damon) Haig, and Henry E. Damon, and died December 19, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Obituary record of graduates of Yale University |page= 190 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aA3AAAAMAAJ |year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Wilfred Damon died September 21, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |title=Annual report of the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2EJAQAAIAAJ |year=1937  |publisher=Government Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The property became very valuable as Honolulu was developed in the 20th century. Parts of Moanalua became [[Fort Kamehameha]], [[Honolulu International Airport]], [[Tripler Army Medical Center]], [[Moanalua High School]], the [[Salt Lake, Hawaii]] development, and [[Moanalua Gardens]]. 
In 2003, the office buildings alone were sold to the [[Real estate investment trust]] HRPT for over $480 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Company News; HRPT agrees to buy land in Hawaii for $480.5 million |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= November 27, 2003 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/business/company-news-hrpt-agrees-to-buy-land-in-hawaii-for-480.5-million.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trustees of the estate included retired General [[Frederick C. Weyand]], great-grandson David M. Haig, former bank president Walter Dods, and local attorney Paul Mullin Ganley.
His last surviving grandchild, Joan Damon Haig, died on November 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Damon heir signals the end of trust |url= http://kapalama.ksbe.edu/archives/FirstYears/trusteesbio/damon.htm |author= Andrew Gomes |date= June 19, 2005 |publisher= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |accessdate= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estate had about 20 beneficiaries with annual total income of over $34 million, as plans were made for its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Damon heiresses ready to cash in |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Jun/19/bz/bz01p.html |author= Rick Daysog |date= June 19, 2005 |publisher= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |accessdate= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, only one grandchild, (Samuel Renny Damon) survived from his son Samuel, while four descended from son Henry. A lawsuit was filed (appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]]) to determine how to divide the shares: equal shares for each great-grandchild, five shares for each grandchild, or half for each set of descendants by his two children. The 1914 will had almost no punctuation in its ten pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Probate No. 6664: In the Matter of the Estate of Samuel M. Damon, Deceased |publisher= Supreme Court of the state of Hawaii |url= http://hawaii.gov/jud/opinions/sct/2006/25216.htm |date= February 16, 2006 |accessdate= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[US Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case, so the estate, estimated worth $900 million in 2006, was distributed with half to descendants of each son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Supreme Court won't hear Damon case |author= Audrey McAvoy |newspaper= Associated Press |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Oct/03/bz/FP610040316.html |accessdate= August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estate had bought Kahuku ranch on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]] for $1.3 million in 1958 from James W. Glover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John R. K. Clark |title=Hawai'i place names: shores, beaches, and surf sites |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6ChFt5o-qUC&amp;pg=PA80|year=2002 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2451-8 |page=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is located on the southeast rift zone of [[Mauna Loa]] volcano, with headquarters at {{coord |19|3|17|N| 155|41|29|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI |display=inline| name=Kahuku Ranch}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|359837|Kahuku Ranch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The estate sold about {{convert|116000|acre}} of the ranch in 2003 to the US Government (with financing from the [[Nature Conservancy]]) to expand [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]]  for $22 million. It was the largest conservation land deal in Hawaii's history, enlarging the park by more than 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Conservation Area to Expand In a $22 Million Hawaii Deal |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= July 4, 2003 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/04/us/conservation-area-to-expand-in-a-22-million-hawaii-deal.html |accessdate= August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some was sold for residences, and some remains as a tourist accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kahuku Ranch |work= official web site |url= http://kahukuranch.com/  |accessdate= August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 Damon's [[coin collection]] alone was auctioned off for $3,884,000 by [[Doyle New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Damon Estate's currency collection fetches $3.8M |url= http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Mar/24/ln/FP603240354.html |author= Rick Daysog |date= March 24, 2006  |publisher= [[Honolulu Advertiser]] |accessdate= August 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included an 1876 [[Proof coinage|proof set]] from the US centennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Doyle New York 's auction of coins, medals and bank notes from the Estate of Samuel Mills Damon totals $3,884,000 |work= Doyle New York web site |url= http://www.doylenewyork.com/damoncoins/ |accessdate= August 6, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120303062016/http://www.doylenewyork.com/damoncoins/ |archivedate= March 3, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, the estate donated a collection of artifacts to the [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]]. Damon was a founding trustee of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= S. M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4401">The '''sawing-off of [[Manhattan Island]]''' is an old [[New York City]] story that is largely unverified. It describes a [[practical joke]] allegedly perpetrated in 1824, by a retired ship carpenter named Lozier. According to the story, in the 1820s a rumor began circulating among city merchants that the weight of the urban district was causing southern [[Manhattan Island]] to sink, near the [[Battery Park City|Battery]]. It was believed that by cutting the island, towing it out, rotating it 180 degrees, and putting it back in place that Manhattan would be stabilized, and that the thin part of the island could be condemned. Surprisingly, the main concern was not the futility of the idea but of [[Long Island]]'s being in the way. Lozier finally assembled a large workforce and logistical support. At a massive groundbreaking ceremony, Lozier did not show up, but hid in [[Brooklyn]] and did not return for months.&lt;ref name="1955newsarticle"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LI0jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eJkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6923,234788 |title=Sawing Off Of Manhattan|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|location=Montreal|date= April 3, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story did not appear in any known [[newspaper]]s (although the press supposedly did not report on such pranks in that era) and no records have been found to confirm the existence of the individuals involved. This has led to speculation that the incident never occurred and the original report of the hoax was itself a hoax, which is the conclusion [[Joel Rose]] suggests in his book, ''New York Sawed in Half: An Urban Historical'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rose, Joel|date=May 4, 2001 |publisher= Bloomsbury USA |title=New York Sawed in Half: An Urban Historical |isbn=9781582340982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hoax was first documented in [[Thomas F. De Voe]]'s (1811-1892) &lt;ref name="market book"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Voe, Thomas F. De Voe |date=1862|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uow9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA462#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Market Book|edition=full text online|pages= 462-64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devoe1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_devoe.html |author=De Voe, Thomas Farrington|title=Feeding America|accessdate= October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; volume ''The Market Book'' (1862), as conveyed by his uncle who was Lozier's supposed associate, and was told again in [[Herbert Asbury]]'s work ''[[Herbert_Asbury#Bibliography|All Around The Town]]: Murder, Scandal, Riot and Mayhem in Old New York'' (1934, reissued as a Sequel to ''Gangs of New York''). Another condensed retelling occurs in the 1960s [[Reader's Digest]] book, ''[[Scoundrels and Scallywags]]: 51 Stories of the Most Fascinating Characters of Hoax and Fraud'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scoundrels and Scallawags: 51 Stories of the Most Fascinating Characters of Hoax and Fraud|date=1968|publisher= The Reader's Digest Association |asin=B000H35TCY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|website=Snopes |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/hoaxes/sawingny.asp |date=February 10, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2009|title=

'''''Shakespeare's Will''''' is a play by Canadian writer [[Vern Thiessen]]. It was commissioned by Geoffrey Brumlik, then Artistic Director of the [[River City Shakespeare Festival]] in Edmonton as a performance vehicle for Jan Alexandra Smith and premiered at the [[Citadel Theatre]] in February 2005. It has been regularly revived and was performed at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=11172&amp;prodid=36321 Stratford Shakespeare Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912150137/http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=11172&amp;prodid=36321 |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shakespeare's Will'' was published in 2002 by [[Playwrights Canada Press]].

The American premiere of ''Shakespeare's Will'' was produced at Theatre 40 in [[Beverly Hills]], California. The production starred [[Jeanmarie Simpson]], was produced by [[Leonard Nimoy]] and directed by [[Susan Bay]]. Nimoy said he agreed to produce the show because 'It’s a very beautiful piece, very beautifully written, very moving, and funny." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardnimoy.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1445:exclusive-interview-with-leonard-nimoy-&amp;catid=23:articles-and-quotes&amp;Itemid=11&lt;/ref&gt; The production led to a long-term creative collaboration between Nimoy and Thiessen which later included a specially commissioned play.&lt;ref&gt;https://uofa.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2015/february/the-nimoy-i-knew&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shakespeare's Will'' is a one-woman [[monodrama]] that focuses on [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] on the day of her husband [[William Shakespeare]]'s funeral. Its form has been described as a "poetic monologue that is fragmentary, and richly allusive."&lt;ref name="anne"&gt;[http://www.borrowers.uga.edu/cocoon/borrowers/pdf?id=781623 Anne Wilson, "Waves and Wills: Van Thiessen's Shakespeare's Will", ''Borrowers and Lenders: the Journal of Shakespeare and Appropriation'', Winter, 2007.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611181628/http://www.borrowers.uga.edu/cocoon/borrowers/pdf?id=781623 |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience shares details of her historically-unknown personal life, a mixture of general information about the lives of women in Elizabethan England, fictional dramatic twists, and twenty-first century interpretations. 

==Synopsis==
The drama focuses on the will handed to William Shakespeare’s widow Anne as she leaves his funeral. She is surprised by its existence and that his sister Joan should give it to her with a noticeably odd smile.  Joan promises to visit in an hour.

Anne resists reading the will, remembering instead the passion and the vows she shared with her husband, Catholic in public but 'their own kind of marriage' in private. These unusual vows accommodated their desires as individuals, but left Anne alone in Stratford to raise their three children. She relives the decision points where Bill’s London life became a separate existence. When plague sweeps the country, she must find a way to protect the children without news or support from William and relates her decision to take them to the seashore, far from disease and death. Her flight repeats her own childhood journey, when her father brought her and her siblings to the sea and away from the plague which killed her mother.  

An hour later, Anne must read the will. She appreciates Bill’s intention to secure the honours he has earned through his daughter’s possible sons. She understands his bequests until she reads his provision for the house. Her loathed sister-in-law will inherit her prized house, while she is deeded the second best bed. The order of William's estate can only be punishment for their son’s death from drowning. He has broken their pact. Anne’s rage at his post-mortem betrayal, after she honourably maintained her side of their vows, gives her the strength to break free from the constraints of her situation as well. She decides to return to the sea to make a life for herself.

The play shows us William’s success in London through a domestic lens, where Anne’s children, garden, bees and marketing are our focus.  Anne’s own childhood journey to the sea supplies a pattern of water-based imagery which resolves in the final sequence of the play; it is a mirror and cyclic resolution to Bill’s love affair with words.

==Interpretation==
Scholar Anne Wilson interprets the play as an exploration of recent debate in Canada about non-traditional marriages and relationships, writing that 'the play's politics and key adaptive gestures coincide with transformations in Canada around orthodoxies associated with gender roles and families'. Wilson also notes Thiessen's exploration of the relationship between sexual freedom and patriarchal norms of male succession. She draws attention to the repeated emphasis on imagery of the sea, flow, and voyages to express the fluid nature of desire and human intimacies.&lt;ref name ="anne"/&gt;

Reviewer James Wenley praised the show as 'catnip for Shakespeare fans', writing that Anne emerges from the play a vivid and humanized character. He found Theissen's speculation of the Shakespeare marriage fascinating, believable, and delivering 'a very palpable sense of the time and place'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theatrescenes.co.nz/review-shakespeares-will-auckland-fringe/&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, reviewer John Coulbourn believed that "not much of it rings true, either to the heart or to the period of the piece", considering that Anne's musings were too generic to convince.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Theatre/Reviews/S/Shakespeares_Will/2007/08/15/4419256-sun.html Canoe Media, review.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

J. Kelly Nestruck objected to the "anachronistic proto-feminist" portrayal of Hathaway, arguing that "there's no getting away from the fact that Shakespeare's Will is ultimately a drama once removed. Hathaway is of interest only because of whom she married."&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Will: In bed with the Shakespeares, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Friday, Jul. 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Katherine Scheil says that the play 'recasts the poet's domestic life into a familiar narrative for a twenty-first-century audience, a sort of inspirational '[[Chicken Soup for the Soul|Chicken Soup for the Lonely Married Woman]]' based on the Shakespeare marriage', setting up Shakespeare as a 'vengeful husband' who fails to appreciate the sacrifices his wife made. However, she notes in conclusion that audiences seem receptive to a play about a stay-at-home mother's inspirational struggle and triumph, despite its unflattering rendition of the man himself. &lt;ref&gt;Katherine Scheil, "Filling the Wife-Shaped Void: The Contemporary Afterlife of Anne Hathaway", Peter Holland (ed), ''Shakespeare Survey: Volume 63'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has been produced across Canada, &lt;ref&gt;England&lt;/ref&gt;,in Wales, England, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.

The '''Siege of Edessa''' took place from November 28 to December 24, 1144, resulting in the fall of the capital of the [[Crusades|crusader]] [[County of Edessa]] to [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] and [[Halab|Aleppo]]. This event was the catalyst for the [[Second Crusade]].

== Background ==

The County of Edessa was the first of the [[crusader state]]s to be established during and after the [[First Crusade]]. It dates from 1098 when [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] left the main army of the [[First Crusade]] and founded his own principality.

Edessa was the most northerly, the weakest, and the least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]], and [[Seljuk Turks]]. Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Joscelin was captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. John II was succeeded by his son [[Manuel I Comnenus]], who had to deal with consolidating power at home against his elder brothers, while Fulk was succeeded by his wife [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] and his son [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. Joscelin had also quarreled with [[Raymond II of Tripoli]] and [[Raymond of Antioch]], leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.

== The siege of Edessa==

In 1144, Joscelin was able to make an alliance with [[Kara Arslan]], the Ortoqid ruler of [[Diyarbakır]], against the growing power and influence of Zengi. Joscelin marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support Kara Aslan against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to besiege Edessa, arriving on November 28. The city had been warned of his arrival and was prepared for a siege, but there was little they could do while Joscelin and the army were elsewhere.

The defense of the city was led by the Latin Archbishop [[Hugh (archbishop of Edessa)|Hugh]], the Armenian Bishop John, and the Jacobite Bishop Basil. John and Basil ensured that none of the native Christians would desert to Zengi. When Joscelin heard of the siege he took the army to [[Turbessel]], knowing that he could never dislodge Zengi without help from the other crusader states. In Jerusalem, Queen Melisende responded to Joscelin's appeal by sending an army led by [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]], and Elinand of Bures. Raymond of Antioch ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Cilicia]].

Zengi surrounded the entire city, realizing that there was no army defending it. He built [[siege engine]]s and began to [[Mining (military)|mine the walls]], while his forces were joined by [[Kurds|Kurdish]] and [[Oghuz Turks|Turcoman]] reinforcements. The inhabitants of Edessa resisted as much as they could, but had no experience in siege warfare; the city’s numerous towers remained unmanned. They also had no knowledge of counter-mining, and part of the wall near the Gate of the Hours collapsed on December 24. Zengi's troops rushed into the city, killing all those who were unable to flee to the Citadel of [[George Maniaces|Maniaces]]. Thousands more were suffocated or trampled to death in the panic, including Archbishop Hugh. Zengi ordered his men to stop the massacre, although all the Latin prisoners that he had taken were executed; the native Christians were allowed to live freely. The [[citadel]] was handed over on December 26. One of Zengi’s commanders, Zayn ad-Din Ali Kutchuk, was appointed governor, while Bishop Basil, apparently willing to give his loyalty to whoever ruled the city, was recognized as leader of the Christian population.

== Aftermath ==


In January 1145 Zengi captured [[Saruj]] and besieged [[Birejik]], but the army of Jerusalem had finally arrived and joined with Joscelin. Zengi also heard of trouble in Mosul, and rushed back to take control. There, he was praised throughout Islam as "defender of the faith" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', the victorious king. He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county to the west of the [[Euphrates]] from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by the Muslims or sold to the Byzantines.

Zengi was [[assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 while besieging Qalat Jabar, and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. Joscelin attempted to take back Edessa following Zengi's murder, and recaptured all but the citadel in October 1146. However, he had no help from the other crusader states, and his poorly planned expedition was driven out of Edessa by Nur ad-Din in November. Joscelin, fearing for the safety of the city's Christian Armenians, attempted to break a hole in Nur ad-Din's forces through which the natives could flee to safety.  However, Joscelin's attempt failed and his fears came true when Nur al-Din's troops massacred the fleeing Armenians and forced the survivors into slavery.  

By this time, news of the fall of Edessa reached Europe, and Raymond of Antioch had already sent a delegation including [[Hugh of Jabala|Hugh]], Bishop of [[Jabala]], to seek aid from [[Pope Eugene III]]. On December 1, 1145 Eugene issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' calling for the [[Second Crusade]]. This crusade was led by [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], but by 1148 it had ended in disaster, and Edessa was never recovered.

'''The Julian Meetings''' is a loose umbrella organisation for local Christian [[contemplative prayer]] groups which meet in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silenceinthecity.org.uk/links.html retrieved 21 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The 1960s and 1970s saw a revival of interest in the United Kingdom, North America and elsewhere in mysticism and meditation, including the Christian tradition of contemplative prayer. The Julian Meetings is one of several organisations set up to meet this interest and to foster Christian meditation. Others include [http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org Contemplative Outreach], which encourages [[centering prayer]], the [[World Community for Christian Meditation]] and the [http://www.fellowshipofmeditation.org Fellowship of Meditation].

The Julian Meetings were founded in 1973, when Hilary Wakeman (an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] who in 1994 became one of the first female priests in the [[Church of England]]) wrote a letter published in Christian newspapers in the United Kingdom asking if some readers might like to meet together for Christian meditation. This led to the formation of 11 local groups. About a year later the name "The Julian Meetings" was adopted, after [[Julian of Norwich]], although the organisation is not specifically linked to Julian of Norwich's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Hilary-Wakeman/57392045 Retrieved 27 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://llandudno-parish.org.uk/wordpress/oldsite/Letter_June_13.html Retrieved 27 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings may include a reading, music, pictures or objects, to aid contemplation, but the focus is on silent contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalofprayer.co.uk/workshops/into-the-silence-experiencing-a-julian-meeting/ retrieved 21 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 there were some 300 local groups, in the United Kingdom and other anglophone countries, as well as a number of individual members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejulianmeetings.net/history/4587240678&lt;/ref&gt; Individual Julian Meetings are small, welcoming people of all denominations or none. They take place in peoples’ homes, in churches or chapels, meeting rooms and other places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalofprayer.co.uk/workshops/into-the-silence-experiencing-a-julian-meeting/ retrieved 21 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

At the United Kingdom national gathering of the Julian Meetings, on 20 May 2017 in [[Derby]], the keynote speaker was the poet, singer and academic [[Malcolm Guite]], who spoke on poetry and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;https://malcolmguite.wordpress.com/events-gigs/ retrieved 21 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Formal organisation is kept to a minimum, there are no paid staff, and the umbrella organisation is not a charity. Each local meeting is autonomous and responsible for its own finances and pattern of meditation. A National Council, and a smaller Core Group, provide resources and advice to local meetings and perform functions like the production of a magazine, running a website, and organising the occasional national gathering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejulianmeetings.net/history/4587240678&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership is not tied to any particular denominational allegiance: both the umbrella organisation and local meetings are [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]].

'''The Theatre Royal''' in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, was built in 1805. A Grade II* [[listed building]], it has been described by the [[Theatres Trust]] as "One of the most important surviving examples of Georgian theatre architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal (ii) (Bath)|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/544-theatre-royal-ii-bath|publisher=Theatres Trust|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a capacity for an audience of around 900.

The Theatre Royal was built to replace the [[Old Orchard Street Theatre]], funded by a [[Tontine]] and elaborately decorated. The architect was [[George Dance the Younger]], with [[John Palmer (Bath architect)|John Palmer]] carrying out much of the work. It opened with a performance of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]] and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including [[Dorothea Jordan]], [[William Macready]] and [[Edmund Kean]]. A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by [[Charles J. Phipps]], which included the construction of the current entrance. Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892; more extensive building work, including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting, followed in 1902. Despite performances by casts including [[Sarah Bernhardt]], the [[Ballet dancer|ballerina]] [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]], the theatre was rarely very profitable. During [[World War II]] [[Donald Wolfit]], [[Irene Vanbrugh]], [[John Gielgud]] and [[Sybil Thorndike]] appeared, with shows including [[Noël Coward]]'s ''Private Lives'' and ''Blyth Spirit'', a performance by [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] and light entertainment such as ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', but audiences declined.

In 1979 the theatre was bought by a trust and, following public donations, it underwent refurbishment, with the rebuilding of the stage and the installation of a new taller [[Fly system|fly tower]] for scenery and lighting. In 1997 a new 150 seat theatre, known as the [[Ustinov Studio]], was opened. Further restoration work to the main [[auditorium]] was needed in 2010. In 2005 a children's theatre known as [[The Egg (theatre)|The Egg]] was opened. The complex also includes bars and restaurants. The Theatre Royal is host to several annual events, including the Family Theatre Festival and the Shakespeare Unplugged Festival.

==History==
[[File:Theatre Royal, Beauford Square, Bath (geograph 3825999).jpg|thumb|left|The original entrance from Beauford Square. The [[Fly system|fly tower]] which was added in 1980 can be seen above the [[façade]].]]

===Construction===
The theatre was erected in 1805, replacing the [[Old Orchard Street Theatre]] which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling the use of the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London.&lt;ref name="trhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/history/ | title=History | publisher=Theatre Royal | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|p=22}} The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=33–34}} The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a [[Tontine]], an investment plan named after the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] banker [[Lorenzo de Tonti]], who is credited with inventing it in [[France]] in 1653. It combined features of a group [[Life annuity|annuity]] and a [[lottery]]. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an annuity. As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent who later became [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and his brother [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick]] among the subscribers.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|p=35}} A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the [[Bath Assembly Rooms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles|first=Rachel|title=The Upper Assembly Rooms, Bath|url=http://www.regencyhistory.net/2012/03/upper-assembly-rooms-bath.html|publisher=Regency History|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior of the building, with arches, [[pilaster]]s, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by [[George Dance the Younger]] who also designed the decorative sections of the interior.

The opening night was on 12 October 1805 was a production of [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], with an unknown actor in the lead. Though not a success, the theatre soon established a good reputation and thrived under the management of [[William Wyatt Dimond]]. Early performances included appearances by the child actors [[Master Betty]] and [[Clara Fisher]], with adult leads from prominent actors on the London stage including [[Dorothea Jordan]], [[William Macready]] and [[Edmund Kean]]. In addition to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other serious drama, the productions included opera and comedy with [[Joseph Grimaldi]] playing the clown in a [[pantomime]] of [[Mother Goose]] in November 1815.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=37–43}}

Between the 1810s and 1850s there were a series of changes in ownership and management. These coincided with a [[Puritans|Puritan]] revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when [[James Henry Chute]], who was the manager of the [[Bath Assembly Rooms]] and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready,{{sfn|Swindells|Taylor|2014|p=579}} took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=44–49}}

===Fire and rebuilding===
On 18 April 1862 a major fire destroyed the interior of the building including the stage, scenery, wardrobe and library, leaving just the exterior walls still standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destruction of Bath Theatre|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000187/18620424/001/0003|accessdate=18 October 2015|work=Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette|date=24 April 1862| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new company was formed to rebuild the theatre and a competition held for designs. The winner was [[Charles J. Phipps|C.J. Phipps]] and rebuilding, which included the new entrance on Sawclose, quickly followed.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=50–54}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1805–2012|url=http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page/3146/1805--2012|publisher=Theatre Royal|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present main entrance to the Theatre Royal, in Sawclose, was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was previously at [[Beau Nash]]'s house.{{sfn|Haddon|1982|p=62}}&lt;ref name=nhle&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal and former Garrick's Head Public House|url=http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1394864|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal|url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=204579|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] criticizes the mouldings of window-frames, frieze and volutes of the door-hood brackets as "characteristically overdone", and mentions [[John Wood the Elder|Wood]] citing its "profuse ornament" which was typical of a mason rather than an architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath&amp;nbsp;— Beau Nash's Houses|url=http://www.astoft.co.uk/bath/beaunash.htm|publisher=Astoft|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chute remained as manager and employed [[Charles Kean]] and [[Ellen Terry]] to play in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' on the opening night, 3 March 1863.{{sfn|Marshall|2012|p=180}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Terry (1847–1928)|url=http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/terry/terry-e2.html|publisher=Stage Beauty|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the reopened theatre struggled to become profitable despite appearances by [[Henry Irving]] among others. In 1885 William Lewis took over as the lessee and was followed, in 1892, by his son Egbert Lewis. They redecorated the theatre in 1892 and attracted larger regular audiences to performances of melodrama and comedy while starting to put on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas and other attractions.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=55–62}}

===20th century===
In 1902 the theatre closed for nine months to enable extensive building work to be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new fire curtain and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed by the company of actors led by [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Benson]].{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=62–65}}

In 1914 the theatre impresario Arthur Carlton, from [[Worcester]], took over the lease. As he was responsible for 14 theatres around the country at the time, he appointed Mrs D. Valantine Munro as the local manager. Performances were maintained during [[World War I]], and in 1916 [[Sarah Bernhardt]] portrayed a wounded male French soldier in ''Du Théâtre au Champ d'Honneur''. In the 1920s there were appearances by the Russian [[Ballet dancer|ballerina]] [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]].{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=66–68}} During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s the theatre was not profitable and closed completely for six months. In 1938 the lease was taken over by Reg Maddox, whose family were involved with the theatre for the next 40 years. During [[World War II]] the theatre fared better, with appearances by prominent actors including [[Donald Wolfit]], [[Irene Vanbrugh]], [[John Gielgud]] and [[Sybil Thorndike]]. In the Post-War years, receipts suffered as audiences dwindled in the face of competition from cinema and television.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=69–73}} Unsuccessful proposals were made for a trust to run the theatre in 1968, and in the 1970s, shares in the owning company were bought by the property developer Charles Ware, who sold to Charles Clarke, a solicitor from Bristol. Clarke was responsible for a redecoration of the building, but as profits were still small, in 1976 he sold it to Louis I. Michaels, who ran the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=74–75}}

In March 1979, the dilapidated theatre was purchased by a trust headed by [[Jeremy Fry]] for £155,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Fry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1494382/Jeremy-Fry.html|accessdate=26 October 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=20 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jeremy Fry: Obituary |work=The Independent |date=27 July 2005 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jeremy-fry-500318.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711082416/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jeremy-fry-500318.html |archivedate=11 July 2010 }} In 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, an appeal was launched to raise money for renovations, including the complete rebuilding of the stage, installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher [[fly system]], to allow major touring companies, including the [[Royal National Theatre]] under [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]], to be booked to perform. The total projected cost was £3.5 million, of which £1.8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre. Money and donations in kind were received from the city council, [[Arts Council England]], [[Bath Preservation Trust]], Leche Trust, [[Historic buildings council]], [[Manifold Trust]], South-West Stonecleaning and Restoration Company and many individuals. Work on the building started to designs by Dowton and Hurst.&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt; However, as insufficient funds had been raised by 1982 to complete the work, loans were negotiated with the [[Bristol &amp; West]] and [[Lombard (company)|Lombard North Central]] with guarantees from local councils. The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', featuring a cast from the National Theatre led by [[Paul Scofield]]. The event was attended by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]].{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=76–82}}

===2010 refurbishment===
[[File:Bath, New Theatre Royal (geograph 4377489).jpg|thumb|left|The theatre in 2015]]
In October 2009, the '2010 Refurbishment Appeal' was launched by [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], Royal Patron of the Theatre Royal Bath, to raise money for a programme of work to preserve the 200-year-old building, while ensuring that it remained suitable for 21st-century audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal launch for theatre appeal|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Royal-launch-theatre-appeal/article-1447901-detail/article.html|work=Bath Chronicle|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The £3million refurbishment by Fry, the most extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal Bath to be revamped|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/25431/theatre-royal-bath-to-be-revamped|publisher=The Stage|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; complete refurbishment of the bars and the creation of The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of [[The Garrick's Head]] pub, and redecoration of the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bath Theatre Royal to reopen following £3&amp;nbsp;m upgrade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8975000/8975663.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%.&lt;ref name="refurb"/&gt; The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Midas wins refurbishment £2&amp;nbsp;m contract for Bath's historic theatre|url=http://www.midasgroup.co.uk/Midas-wins-refurbishment-%C2%A32m-contract-for-Bath%E2%80%99s-historic-theatre-News.htm|publisher=Midas|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful campaign, led by writer and novelist [[Bel Mooney]], who had been instrumental in previous fund-raising campaigns for the Theatre Royal Bath, saw almost a third of the money raised through donations and sponsorship,&lt;ref name="refurb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page_attachments/0000/5428/Refurbishment.doc |title= Refurbishment plans move a step closer as Midas is contracted to work on Bath's historic theatre |publisher=Theatre Royal |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling work to begin away from public areas in March 2010. The theatre's Main House was closed in July 2010, to allow the work on the foyer, bars and auditorium to be completed.

The official re-opening took place on Wednesday, 8 September 2010, just ten and a half months after the original campaign was launched, with the building work being completed on schedule. The ceremonial re-opening was performed on-stage by actors [[Penelope Keith]] and [[Peter Bowles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal main house shuts for £3&amp;nbsp;m facelift|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/Theatre-Royal-main-house-shuts-163-3&amp;nbsp;m-facelift/article-2379152-detail/article.html|work=Bath Chronicle|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were starring in the Theatre Royal's own production of ''[[The Rivals]]'', [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s classic Restoration comedy, set in and around 18th-century Bath. In 2011, the theatre won a [[British Construction Industry Awards|British Construction Industry Award]] Conservation Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.bciawards.org.uk/365666 |title =Winners 2011 |website =bciawards.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre itself is said to be haunted by several ghosts including the Grey Lady, who was an actress centuries ago. She has been seen watching productions in the Grey Lady Box, and she leaves the distinctive scent of jasmine. She has purportedly been seen and scented in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grey Lady|url=http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page/3040/The+Grey+Lady|publisher=Theatre Royal|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lowndes|1982|pp=83–84}}

==Architecture and features==
[[File:Bath, Somerset 2010 PD 020.JPG|thumb|The Garrick's Head on St John's Close]]
The theatre, along with the neighbouring Garrick's Head public house, is a [[Grade II* listed building]]&lt;ref name="IoE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=443496 |title=Garrick's Head Public House &amp; Theatre Royal |work=Images of England |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012015638/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=443496 |archivedate=12 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a prime example of [[Georgian architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Srivastava|first=Swapnil|title=Georgian Architecture|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/georgian-architecture.html|publisher=Buzzle|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] building, with a basement, has a [[Hip roof|hipped roof]] with a part-[[balustrade]]d [[parapet]]. Above the door is a bust of [[David Garrick]], which was made in 1831 by [[Lucius Gahagan]]. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by [[George Dance the Younger]], is of five bays with [[pilaster]]s carrying a [[frieze]] of comic and tragic muses.&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt; The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries.{{sfn|Forsyth|2003|pp=257–258}} The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a [[trompe-l'œil]] ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.&lt;ref name=nhle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Addis|first1=Bill|last2=Walker|first2=Derek|title=Happold: The Confidence to Build|date=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781135806132|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TdJ5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Theatre+Royal,+Bath+900+seats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the Sawclose area between the current Theatre Royal main entrance and the former [[Bluecoat School, Bath|Bluecoat School]] is to be made into a pedestrian-friendly [[shared space]] area for pedestrians, cyclists and cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crawley |first1=James |title=£2 million Saw Close development will last nine months and bring road closures |url=https://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/2-million-saw-close-development-68013 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Bath Chronicle |date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ustinov Studio===
[[File:Frontage of Ustinov Studio, Sawclose - geograph.org.uk - 1763238.jpg|thumb|left|Frontage of the Ustinov Studio]]
In 1997, a studio theatre was built at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street, called the [[Ustinov Studio]], named after the actor [[Peter Ustinov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/544-theatre-royal-ii-bath|title=Theatre Royal (ii) (Bath)|publisher=The Theatres Trust|accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled ''Hopefully''.{{sfn|Forsyth|2003|pp=257–258}} The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as [[Bill Bailey]], [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Lucy Porter]]) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage &amp; technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of ''[[Breakfast With Mugabe]]'', starring [[Joseph Marcell]], [[Miles Anderson]] and [[Nicholas Bailey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mugabe Heads to Bath|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/mugabebath.htm|publisher=British Theatre Guide|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the studio is led by the Artistic Director Laurence Boswell. In the 2012 American Season at the Ustinov Studio, [[Sarah Ruhl]]'s [[In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)|''In the Next Room'' (or ''The Vibrator Play'')]] was the winner of the Best New Play&amp;nbsp;— Theatre Awards UK 2012 and nominated for three [[Tony Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Next Room or The Vibrator Play|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/buy-tickets/special-offers/article/item203098/win-tickets-to-the-press-night-of-in-the-next-room-or-the-vibrator-play/|publisher=London Theatre|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Champion|first1=Lindsay|title=Sarah Ruhl's In the Next Room (or the Vibrator Play) Slated For West End Transfer|url=http://london.broadway.com/buzz/171615/sarah-ruhls-in-the-next-room-or-the-vibrator-play-slated-for-west-end-transfer/|publisher=Theatre.com|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustinov Studio was also nominated for the prestigious Empty Space&amp;nbsp;... Peter Brook Award 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finborough wins 2012 Peter Brook Empty Space Award|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/west-end-theatre/news/11-2012/finborough-wins-2012-peter-brook-empty-space-award_2137.html|publisher=Whats On Stage|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'''s Dominic Cavendish praised the venue as a "constantly bubbling fount of marvels" at the awards ceremony. The Ustinov also received a second consecutive nomination for the 2013 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Double award nomination for the Ustinov Studio|url=http://theatrebath.co.uk/blog/double-award-nomination-for-the-ustinov-studio/|publisher=Theatre Bath|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 2013, the Ustinov presented ''The Spanish Golden Age Season'', three new translations of rarely seen plays. These included the tragedy ''[[Punishment without Revenge]]'', and the romantic comedies ''[[Don Gil of the Green Breeches]]'' and ''[[A Lady of Little Sense]]'', which ran in repertory with a cast of ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013. It was later transferred to the [[Arcola Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/spanish-golden-age-season|title=Spanish Golden Age Season|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109221608/http://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/spanish-golden-age-season|archivedate=9 November 2013|accessdate=26 October 2015|publisher=Arcola Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Summer 2014, the Ustinov Studio presented a new comedy, '[[Bad Jews]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Jews|url=http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/page/3009/Bad-Jews/1091|publisher=Theatre Royal|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November of the same year, a black comedy by [[Florian Zeller]], '[[Le Père|The Father]]' starring [[Kenneth Cranham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Dominic|title=The Father, Theatre Royal Bath, review: 'losing the plot is the point'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/11203810/The-Father-Theatre-Royal-Bath-review-losing-the-plot-is-the-point.html|accessdate=18 May 2016|work=Telegraph|date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these plays have gone on to huge national and international success in following two years, running almost continuously on several tours and West End transfers, culminating in Kenneth Cranham winning the [[Olivier Awards|Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Play at the 2016 Awards Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Charlotte|title=Kenneth Cranham Wins Best Actor Olivier|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/news/latest-news/article/item358567/kenneth-cranham-wins-best-actor-olivier/|publisher=Official London Theatre|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Egg===
[[File:Eggtheatre.JPG|thumb|The front doors of The Egg]]
In 2005 another new theatre was opened behind the Theatre Royal, [[The Egg, Bath|The Egg]], which provides professional theatre productions for children and their families, alongside workshops and youth theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathfestivals.org.uk/theatreroyal|title=Theatre Royal Bath|publisher=Bath Festival|accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a cafe, which is also the venue for children's and family events, and occasional teenage arts events.

===Restaurants===
The theatre's Vaults Restaurant provides pre-show dinners and matinée lunches, and a suite of rooms (''The 1805 Rooms'') are available for functions. The Theatre Royal is also licensed to host weddings and civil partnership ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatre Royal Bath Awards Lindley Heritage £4&amp;nbsp;m Catering Contract|url=http://www.centerplate.co.uk/news/news/theatre-royal-bath-awards-lindley-heritage-4&amp;nbsp;m-catering-contract|publisher=Centerplate|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
Alongside the weekly touring productions which make up most of its programme, the Theatre Royal is host to several annual events, including the Family Theatre Festival and the Shakespeare Unplugged Festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14170">'''Tina Resch''' (born October 23, 1969) was a central figure in a series of incidents that came to be called the '''Columbus poltergeist''' case. In 1984, alleged [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] events at her [[Columbus, Ohio]] home drew significant [[news media]] interest. A series of [[Color photography|color photographs]] taken by [[photojournalist]] Fred Shannon, and published by ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'', were purported to show Resch sitting in an armchair with a [[telephone handset]] and [[phone cord]] flying in front of her, from left to right. Resch's story, and Shannon's photography, were featured on a 1993 episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Skeptics]] and [[debunkers]] pointed out that much of the proclaimed evidence was anecdotal and thin and declared the case to be a [[hoax]].&lt;ref name="Hines2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Henry, ''Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFOs'', [[Macmillan of Canada]] (1988). p. 107. {{ISBN|978-0771595394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erich, ''Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction''. Waveland Pr Inc. (2000). p. 193. {{ISBN|978-1577660767}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kurtz]] wrote that Resch was "a disturbed teenager" who faked [[poltergeist]] phenomena because she "craved attention".&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]], ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. [[Prometheus Books]] (1985). p. 220. {{ISBN|978-0879753009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resch was married and divorced twice, and had a child named Amber Boyer. In 1994, facing a potential death penalty if she agreed to go to trial before jury, Resch instead accepted a plea bargain with prosecutors to being responsible for the death of her three-year-old daughter that had occurred while the daughter was being looked after by her boyfriend, and she was [[sentenced]] to [[Life sentence|life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name = "horn"&gt;

==Alleged poltergeist case==
Tina Resch is the [[adopted]] daughter of Joan and John Resch.&lt;ref name="Couttie1988"&gt;Couttie, Bob, ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press (1988). pp. 60–61. {{ISBN|978-0718826864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Resches were well known in Columbus, as they were foster parents who had helped care for 250 children prior to 1984.&lt;ref name="Skeptoid448"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id= 4448|number= 448|title=The Columbus Poltergeist }}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 14, Tina watched the movie ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', and shortly afterward the family reported seeing objects fly around their house.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Charles M. and Arthur W. Wiggins, ''Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins'', Joseph Henry Press (2001). p. 99. {{ISBN|978-0309073097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter Mike Harden of ''The Columbus Dispatch'' was asked to assist the family, and involved photographer Fred Shannon.&lt;ref name="Skeptoid448" /&gt; ''The Columbus Dispatch'' interviewed Tina, and later published several photos purporting to show a [[telephone]] flying through the air.&lt;ref name="Hines2003"&gt;[[Terence Hines|Hines, Terrence]], ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', [[Prometheus Books]] (2003). pp. 98–100. {{ISBN|978-1573929790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parapsychologist]] [[William G. Roll|William Roll]] stayed in the Resch house to investigate the case, and claimed that there had been genuine "spontaneous psychokinesis".&lt;ref name="Frazier" /&gt; Roll, however, never observed any object move by itself. In one incident, a picture fell from a wall in an upstairs room where Tina had been alone half an hour before; Roll was facing away from the picture when it fell.&lt;ref name="Couttie1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazier" /&gt; [[James Randi]], an investigator for the [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] was refused access to the household,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]], ''The Outer Edge: Classic Investigations of the Paranormal'', [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (1996). p. 118. {{ISBN|978-1117887708}}&lt;/ref&gt; but investigated the case and suspected Tina had faked the alleged poltergeist occurrences.&lt;ref name="Randi-SI-Spring85"&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]], ''The Columbus Poltergeist Case: Part I''. ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' 9: 221–35. (1984–85).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Resch poltergeist turned out to be so elusive that no one ever actually saw a single object even start to move of its own accord. This included the newspaper photographer, who found that if he watched an object, it stubbornly refused to budge. So he would hold up his camera and look away... One of the photos obtained in this way was distributed by the Associated Press and touted widely as proof of the reality of the phenomenon. Examined closely, the photographic evidence in this case strongly suggested that Tina was faking the occurrences by simply throwing the phone and other "flying" objects when no one was looking. Randi's careful analysis of the other photos, many unpublished, of Tina and her flying phone strengthen the conclusion that she was faking. The editor of ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Luke Feck, embarrassed by the revelation that he and his paper were taken in by so obvious a fake, refused Randi permission to print the photos he had given him earlier, in an apparent attempt to suppress the evidence of Tina's trickery and the newspaper's credulity."&lt;ref name="Hines2003"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later incident, a visiting television crew inadvertently left a [[video camera]] on, which caught footage of Tina deliberately knocking over a table lamp, then screaming as if in fright, an event that had previously been ascribed to the [[poltergeist]]. When confronted with the videotape, Tina claimed she had done it to get the reporters to leave.&lt;ref name="Frazier"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendrick Frazier|title=Science Confronts the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i2Nm8OyXpyQC&amp;pg=PA152|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61592-619-0|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurtz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kurtz|title=The Transcendental Temptation: A Critique of Religion and the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQh6AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT403|date=10 September 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-828-7|pages=403–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi characterized the situation as a hoax by an [[adolescent]] girl seeking attention, saying, "examination of available material indicates that fraudulent means or perfectly explainable methods have been employed to provide the media with sensational details about an otherwise trivial matter."&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=Magician believes Tina Resch created house monster|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19840315&amp;id=SlsuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZNoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2927,2954879|newspaper=(Associated Press) Beaver County Times|date=Mar 15, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi examined a roll of photos taken by press photographers and said that they showed the girl's foot hooked beneath a sofa that had purportedly moved by itself, and that the glass in a picture frame that allegedly shattered on its own while in her hands was already broken before she ever picked it up.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Paranormal events can't withstand close scrutiny, researcher says|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iWoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5107,8350635&amp;dq=tina+resch+james+randi&amp;hl=en|accessdate=14 November 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=May 31, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conclusion of the case, as he reported in ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Spring 1985, was as follows:

==Conviction and imprisonment==

Tina was charged with aggravated battery, and in October 1994, rather than face trial and the possibility of a [[death sentence]], Boyer agreed to a [[plea bargain]] negotiated by her attorney and [[District Attorney]] [[Peter Skandalakis]].&lt;ref name = "horn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dcor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcor.state.ga.us/GDC/OffenderQuery/jsp/OffQryRedirector.jsp |title= Georgia Department of Corrections |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entered an [[Alford plea]], in which she pleaded guilty while maintaining her innocence.&lt;ref name=TKM/&gt; Tina received a life sentence plus 20 years, with the possibility of [[parole]]. David Herrin was convicted of cruelty to children, and sentenced to 20 years. He was released from [[Dooly State Prison]] on November 16, 2011.&lt;ref name=dcor /&gt;

The ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to Boyer as the "Telekinetic Mom" in some of its reporting on the legal issues in 1994.&lt;ref name=TKM&gt;{{cite news

In 2004, William Roll collaborated with writer Valerie Storey on a book entitled ''Unleashed – Of Poltergeists and Murder: The Curious Story of Tina Resch''. The book claims Tina possessed telekinetic powers and was innocent in the death of Amber.&lt;ref name=Roll&gt;[[William G.

Since 2008, Boyer has been incarcerated at [[Pulaski State Prison]] in [[Hawkinsville, Georgia]].&lt;ref name = "horn"/&gt;  As of July 2017, the ''Unsolved Mysteries'' segment about her had not been made available for streaming via Amazon Video even though numerous other ''Unsolved Mysteries'' segments had.

'''Vahan Mamikonian''' ({{lang-hy|Վահան Մամիկոնյան}}) (440/445{{spaced ndash}}503/510) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] nobleman from the [[Mamikonian|Mamikonian family]]. In 481 he rebelled against the [[Sasanian Empire]] that controlled the eastern part of Armenia known as [[Persian Armenia]]. He was appointed as ''[[marzban]]'' (governor) of Persian Armenia in 485 and remained in that post until his death around 503-510.

==Background==
Since 387, the kingdom of Armenia was divided into two zones of influence, [[Byzantine Armenia]] and [[Persian Armenia]]. In addition, in 428, the last Arsacid monarch, [[Artaxias IV]], was deposed by his overlord [[Bahram V]] at the request of the Armenian ''[[nakharar]]s'', thus starting the [[Marzpanate Armenia|Marzpanate period]] in Persian Armenia. Very quickly, the Armenians were disillusioned: in 449, [[Yazdegerd II]] ordered the nobility to convert to [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="Dédéyan 187"&gt;{{Harvsp|Dédéyan|2007|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenians revolted under the leadership of [[Vardan Mamikonian]], but were defeated on 2 June 451 (or May 26) at the [[battle of Avarayr]]; most ''nakharars'' who participated in the revolt were deported to [[Ctesiphon]].&lt;ref name="Dédéyan 190"&gt;{{Harvsp|Dédéyan|2007|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Vahan was born around 440 - 445.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvsp|Settipani|2006|pp=309–310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of Hmayeak Mamikonian and Dzoyk, he had 3 younger siblings named Vard, Vasak, and Artaxias. His father was killed by guerrillas at [[Tayk]] in the aftermath of the battle of Avarayr. Vahan, along with Vasak and Artaxias, was captured by the ''marzban'' of Armenia and was deported to Ctesiphon; sentenced to apostasy, and was "weakened in their faith," according to his childhood friend and contemporary historian [[Ghazar Parpetsi]].&lt;ref name="Grousset 215"&gt;{{Harvsp|Grousset|1947|p=215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three brothers were sentenced to death, however, were released with the help of [[Mihranids|Mihranid]] prince [[Arshusha II]]. Vahan then regained his possessions, however, he was accused of misappropriation of income of gold mines, and had to pay a large sum of money to the [[Sasanians]].&lt;ref name="Dédéyan 192"&gt;{{Harvsp|Dédéyan|2007|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolt==
[[File:Persian Armenia.gif|thumb|300px|Map of [[Persian Armenia]]]]
[[File:The return to the homeland.jpg|thumb|250px|Vahan's arrival to [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]]]
In the aftermath of [[battle of Avarayr]], the Armenians were constantly ordered by the Sasanians to go to distant military expeditions, mostly in Eastern Persia. They were also required to accept the growing power of the apostasy, which resulted in the revolt of [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]] (r. 447/449 - 502/522), and was positively received by the Armenians. Vahan hesitated to join the rebellion in 481,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|name=Grous217|Grousset|1947|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; making [[Adhur Gushnasp]], the ''marzban'' of Armenia, abandon [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] and take refugee in [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artashat]].

Vahan then asked the other rebels to take an oath on the cross of the Gospel to remain faithful to the covenant he would proclaim as the new ''marzban'' of Armenia, and proclaimed [[Sahak II Bagratuni]] as the new ''marzban''. However, Adhur Gushnasp returned from refugee with a force of 7000 horsemen against the insurgents, he was, however, defeated and killed by Vahan and his army at the battle at Akori (northern slope of Ararat),&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grousset|1947|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vahan hitherto remained in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] to protect the capital, in early 483, Sasanian reinforcements came, however, Vahan managed to defeat them at the battle of Nersehapat in Artaz (region of [[Maku, Iran|Maku]].)

Vahan then received a letter from [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang]], who was with his troops near the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] searching after the Sasanian army under Shapur Mihran.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|name=Dedey193|Dédéyan|2007|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crazed by the lack of promised reinforcements, the Armenians were defeated in 483 at the battle of Akesga&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grousset|1947|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; that among other consequences, caused the death of Isaac and Vasak Mamikonian Bagratuni II. Vahan then went to Tao while Shapur Mihran was returning to [[Ctesiphon]], allowing the Armenians regain control of the [[Arax river]] during winter. In the spring of 484, Shapur Mihran returned as the head of a new army and forced Vahan to flee to refuge near the Byzantine frontier, at [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Grousset|1947|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marzban of Armenia==
However, an unexpected event changed the course of events: the death of the Sasanian king [[Peroz I]] in 484 in war against the [[Hephthalites]], causing the withdrawal of the Persians in Armenia and recovery of Dvin and [[Vagharshapat]]. Struggling to suppress the revolt of his brother [[Zarir]], Peroz's successor, [[Balash]] (r. 484-488), needed the help of the Armenians: in exchange for military support, he agreed to sign the [[Nvarsak Treaty]], which granted religious freedom to the [[Christian]]s and the prohibition of [[Zoroastrianism]] in Armenia, including much greater autonomy for the ''nakharar''. Vahan was also recognized as ''[[sparapet]]'' and the property of the Mamikonian family and its allies were returned.

During the same period, Vahan was appointed as ''marzban'' in 485, and appointed his brother Vard as ''sparapet''. According to John I Mandacuni and Babgeno, [[Christianity]] flourished during his reign;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|name=Dedey194|Dédéyan|2007|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; churches were restored, and the church of St. Gregory was enlarged. The Cathedral Vagharshapat was also rebuilt. The country enjoyed relative peace, despite the failed attempt of the successor [[Balash]], [[Kavadh I]] (r. 488-496, 499-531), to impose on the propositions Nevarsak. In 489, Vahan along with [[Vachagan III]], King of [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dédéyan|2007|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; repelled an [[Hephthalites|Hephthalite]] invasion of [[Transcaucasia]]. Vahan later died between 503 and 510 and was succeeded by his brother [[Vard Mamikonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dédéyan|2007|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cyril Toumanoff]], Vahan Mamikonian hypothetically would have been the father of Artavasdes, the father of Samuel I, who was a ''sparapet'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toumanoff|1990|p=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William H. Crook''' (October 15, 1839 &amp;ndash; March 13, 1915&lt;ref name=Arlington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/whcook.htm |title=William H. Crook |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was one of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[bodyguard]]s in 1865.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/whitehouse/popups/crooks.html |title=William Crook |publisher=PBS |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]] (while Crook was off duty), he continued to work in the [[White House]] for a total of over 50 years, serving 12 presidents.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Col. W. H. Crook Dead. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 13, 1915 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/03/14/105460739.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even during the height of the [[American Civil War]], presidential security was lax. Throngs of people entered the [[White House]] every day. "The entrance doors and all the doors on the Pennsylvania side of the mansion were open at all hours of the day and, often, very late into the evening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rietveld |first1=Ronald D. |date=Summer 1999 |title=The Lincoln White House Community |journal=Journal of the [[Abraham Lincoln Association]] |publisher= |volume=20 |issue=2 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0020.204/--lincoln-white-house-community?rgn=main;view=fulltext |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln finally gave in to concerns for his safety in November 1864, and was assigned four around-the-clock bodyguards.&lt;ref name=Reck&gt;{{cite book |title=A.

On April 14, 1865, Crook began his shift at 8 a.m. He was to have been relieved by [[John Frederick Parker]] at 4 p.m., but Parker was several hours late. Lincoln had told Crook that he had been having dreams of himself being assassinated  for three straight nights. Crook tried to persuade the President not to attend a performance of the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theater]] that night, or at least allow him to go along as an extra bodyguard, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife they would go. As Lincoln left for the theater, he turned to Crook and said "Goodbye, Crook." Before, Lincoln had always said, "Good night, Crook." Crook later recalled: "It was the first time that he neglected to say ‘Good Night’ to me and it was the only time that he ever said ‘Good-bye’. I thought of it at that moment and, a few hours later, when the news flashed over Washington that he had been shot, his last words were so burned into my being that they can never be forgotten."&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Assassination of Lincoln: History and Myth|author=Lloyd Lewis|page=297|isbn=9780803279490|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6HB7q8M9TIC&amp;pg=PA297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crook blamed Parker,&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; who had left his post at the theater without permission.

Crook also served as a bodyguard for Lincoln's successor, [[Andrew Johnson]]. It was he who brought the news to the embattled President that he had been acquitted in his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]] in May 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Presidential Wives: An Anecdotal History |last=Boller |first=Paul F.

When good friend [[Ulysses S. Grant]] became President, he appointed Crook "[[White House Office of the Executive Clerk|Executive Clerk of the President of the United States]]" in 1870, and dispersing agent in 1877, the latter the position he would hold for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/fall99/html/saunders.html&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 1915, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the members of the White House staff celebrated his 50 years of service and presented him with a cane.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;

[[File:Through Five Administrations.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Through Five Administrations'']]
Crook set his memoirs down on paper in the book ''Through Five Administrations: Reminiscences of Colonel William H. Crook, Body-Guard to President Lincoln'', compiled and edited by Margarita Spalding Gerry. There are actually six covered, from Lincoln to [[Chester A. Arthur]], though [[James A. Garfield]] and Arthur are dealt with in a single chapter.

William H. Crook died at his boarding house after being sick with [[pneumonia]] for more than a week.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt; He was predeceased by his wife, Jane Catherine Rodbird (1846-1895).&lt;ref name=Findagrave&gt;{{findagrave|24489889}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; President Wilson attended the funeral.&lt;ref name=Arlington/&gt;

'''Workplace violence''' (WPV) or '''occupational violence''' refers to [[violence]], usually in the form of [[physical abuse]] or [[threat]], that creates a risk to the health and [[safety]] of an [[employee]] or multiple employees.&lt;ref name = Worksafe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/health-and-safety-topics/occupational-violence |title=Occupational Violence | publisher= WorkSafe| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
According to data from the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], in 2011 violence and other injuries caused by persons or animals contributed to 17% of all US occupational fatalities, with homicides contributing to 10% of the total.&lt;ref name = BLS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0010.pdf |title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2011| publisher= US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2010, there were 13,827 reported workplace homicide victims, averaging over 700 victims per year, in the United States.&lt;ref name = OccViolence&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/violence/ |title=CDC - Occupational Violence - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic| publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the 2011 data shows that while a majority of workplace fatalities occurred to males, workplace violence disproportionately affects females. Homicides contributed to 21% of all occupational fatalities for women, compared to 9% for men.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt; Of these homicides, relatives or domestic partners contributed to 39% of female homicide cases; male homicide cases were most likely to be perpetrated by robbers, contributing to 36% of male homicide cases.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] ("OSHA") a department of the United States Department of Labor defines workplace violence as "any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site.  It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide." &lt;ref name="SLTC"&gt;Source: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/&lt;/ref&gt;

2,000,000 US workers per year report workplace violence&lt;ref name="SLTC"/&gt;

Most cases of workplace violence are non-fatal. From 1993 to 1999, an average of about 1.7 million people reported occupational violence.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt; About 75% of these cases are considered simple assault, while 19% of cases are considered aggravated assault.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt;

Workplace violence is at epidemic proportions. "There used to be a time when an employee shooting someone in the workplace would be a shock. Now it’s becoming common.” states [[Kathleen M. Bonczyk]], Esq. a researcher and expert on workplace violence prevention.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/work-grave-danger-article-1.3279671&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a June 2017 shooting spree when a former employee returned to his Orlando, Florida workplace to murder five co-workers before committing suicide Kathleen M. Bonczyk, Esq. stated “You hear it again and again. People always say ‘We didn’t think it (workplace violence) would happen here,’ but it can happen anywhere and anytime. It shouldn’t be a question of if; employers should operate under the question of when.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orlando-workplace-shooting/os-orlando-workplace-shooting-violence-uptick-20170605-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Patrick Henry Sherrill, a 44-year-old [[mail carrier]] from [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], was reprimanded after a heated argument with two supervisors on August 19, 1986. At approximately 7:00 the following morning, Sherrill showed up at the post office in his uniform. Over the course of the next 15 minutes, Sherrill went on [[Edmond post office shooting|a murderous rampage]], gunning down any employee who crossed his path. After sealing off the exits, Sherrill ended up murdering fourteen coworkers and wounding six others. When police arrived at the post office, Sherrill turned the gun on himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,144859,00.html | work=Time | first=Jacob V. | last=Lamar Jr | title="Crazy Pat's" Revenge | date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 5, 2009, [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], who was serving in the [[United States Army]] as a [[psychiatrist]], fatally shot 13 people and injured more than 30 others at [[Fort Hood]], near [[Killeen, Texas]].  [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|The shooting]] produced more casualties than any other on an American military base.  The United States Department of Defense and federal law enforcement agencies have classified the shootings as an act of workplace violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://tucson.com/news/national/terror-act-or-workplace-violence-hasan-trial-raises-sensitive-issue/article_be513c51-a35d-5b4f-b3a0-13654f019ea6.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2015, the Army "determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude Hasan “was in communication with [a] foreign terrorist organization before the attack,” and that his radicalization and subsequent acts could reasonably be considered to have been “inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=17135&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Burke was employed by [[USAir]] as a ticket agent until his supervisor, Raymond Thompson, fired him for theft. After Thompson refused to reinstate him, Burke showed up at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on December 7, 1987, and purchased a ticket for [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]]. Burke smuggled a [[.44 Magnum]] onto the aircraft. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft's [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recorder]] picked up the sound of gunshots. Then came the sound of David Burke’s voice. The pilots were shot and the aircraft crashed into a hillside in [[San Luis Obispo County]], killing all 43 people on board, including Burke and Thompson. At the crash site, an airsickness bag was found containing a message which Burke had written for his former supervisor. It read: “I asked for some leniency for my family, remember. Well, I got none. And you’ll get none.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,145653,00.html | work=Time | first=Ed | last=Magnuson | title=David Burke's Deadly Revenge | date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At 6:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 26, 2015, 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, a disgruntled ex-reporter for [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] station [[WDBJ-TV]], shot and killed two former colleagues live on television in [[Moneta, Virginia]]. At the time, 24-year-old WDBJ reporter Alison Parker was conducting an interview of local chamber of commerce executive Vicki Gardener as 27-year-old videographer Adam Ward filmed the interview on a live feed. Flanagan, who had been previously terminated from his position at WDBJ, captured the three via a body cam and appeared to wait until the piece was airing before he began shooting and emptied his Glock handgun of all bullets. Gardener who was also shot survived the attack. After the shootings, Flanagan fled the scene and later boasted about the attack on social media before he was killed by police.&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2016/04/22/three-keys-to-reducing-workplace-violence-risks|title=Three keys to reducing workplace violence risks|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* On December 2, 2015, county health inspector Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, burst into a banquet room in San Bernardino, California where approximately 80 of Farook's co-workers were gathered to attend a holiday party as well as a company training session.  Farook and Malik, who were dressed in military-style attire and armed with rifles, killed 14 people and injured 22 others.  The couple also attempted to bomb the facility. Later, they were killed in a shoot-out with police.&lt;ref name="ohsonline.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ohsonline.com/blogs/the-ohs-wire/2016/03/the-growing-epidemic-of-deadly-workplace-violence-and-three-ways-to-prevent-it.aspx|title=The Growing Epidemic of Deadly Workplace Violence and Three Ways to Prevent It -- Occupational Health &amp; Safety|website=ohsonline.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/us/san-bernardino-shooting/index.html|title=14 killed in San Bernardino shooting; suspect ID'd|last=CNN|first=Steve Almasy, Kyung Lah and Alberto Moya|website=CNN|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* On February 26, 2016, 38-year old Cedric Ford who was employed as a painter at Excel Industries in Hesston, Kansas shot and killed three people and injured 14 other people.  A co-worker reported that approximately two hours after the two men had clocked in for their shift at work that day, he saw Ford strapped up with his weapon and shooting at people in the factory's parking lot.&lt;ref name="ohsonline.com"/&gt;  
* On March 20, 2016, a 55-year-old retired state trooper with the Pennsylvania Turnpike system named Clarence Briggs of Newville, Pennsylvania returned to the roads he used to patrol prior to his retirement and attempted an armed robbery at a toll booth.  Briggs shot and killed toll booth worker Danny Crouse, 55, and Ron Heist, 72, a security guard before he was shot and killed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="ohsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-turnpike-idUSKCN0WM0XI|title=Retired state trooper kills two in Pennsylvania toll plaza shooting|date=2016-03-21|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* On April 8, 2016, workplace violence erupted at Lackland Airforce Base in San Antonio, Texas.  At that time, the squadron's commanding officer was shot and killed by an airman who then killed himself.  Thereafter, the facility went into lockdown mode.  Soon after the shootings, it was reported that the incident was not a case involving terrorism but was workplace violence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooter-idUSKCN0X51OW&lt;/ref&gt; The shooter was being escorted to a disciplinary hearing when he committed the murder-suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/crime/article/Bexar-County-Sheriff-s-deputies-responding-to-7236358.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 4, 2016, a man who had been involuntarily terminated two weeks earlier from his position at Knight Transportation in Katy, Texas approximately 20 miles west of Houston returned to his former workplace armed with a shotgun and a pistol.  Marion Guy Williams, 65, was reported to have said words to the effect of "You all ruined my life." Williams then shot and killed a 34-year-old supervisor Michael Dawid, injured two other employees and then killed himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://abc13.com/news/two-dead-2-injured-in-katy-area-workplace-shooting/1322943/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-man-killed-coworker-huge-cardinals-fan-article-1.2626416&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 8, 2017 a grocery story employee named Randy Stair age 24 blocked all entrance/exits to the Weis Market in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania where he was employed and opened fire.  Stair killed three co-workers before turning his gun on himself and committing suicide.  Dating back to July 2016, Stair left behind a cache of disturbing and violent images, cartoons, videos, and messages on-line for the world to view on his social media accounts. Amongst other things, Stair posted numerous images of himself with his shotguns.  He went so far as to name them "the twins" and is even seen caressing and kissing one.  In one of his videos Stair proclaims “All souls are fair game.” Stair who idolized the Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

* On April 3, 2018, Nasim Najafi Aghdam opened fire on her co-workers at Youtube headquarters in San Bruno, California, killing herself and sending 3 others to the hospital. Police describe it as workplace violence.

==Aggression==
Dr. [[Arnold H. Buss]], of the University of Texas at Austin (1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=AH |year=1961 |title=The Psychology of Aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified eight types of [[workplace aggression]]:
*Verbal-passive-indirect (failure to deny false rumors about target, failure to provide information needed by target)&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"/&gt;
*Verbal-passive-direct ("[[silent treatment]]", failure to return communication, i.e. phone calls, e-mails)
*Verbal-active-indirect (spreading [[False accusation|false rumors]], belittling ideas or work)
*Verbal-active-direct (insulting, acting condescendingly, yelling)
*Physical-passive-indirect (causing others to create a delay for the target)
*Physical-passive-direct (reducing target's ability to contribute, e.g. scheduling them to present at the end of the day where fewer people will be attending)
*Physical-active-indirect (theft, destruction of property, unnecessary consumption of resources needed by the target)
*Physical-active-direct (physical attack, nonverbal, vulgar gestures directed at the target)

In a study performed by Baron and Neuman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=RA|last2=Neuman|first2=HA|title=Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence on their relative frequency and potential causes|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=22|pages=161–173|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers found pay cuts and pay freezes, use of part-time employees, change in management, increased diversity, computer monitoring of employee performance, reengineering, and budget cuts were all significantly linked to increased workplace aggression.  The study also showed a substantial amount of evidence linking unpleasant physical conditions (high temperature, poor lighting) and high negative affect, which facilitates workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Risk assessments===
{{globalize|date=September 2009}}
In the United Kingdom there is a legal obligation to complete risk assessments for both physical and psychosocial workplace hazards. Other countries have similar occupational health and safety legislation in place relating to identifying and either eliminating or controlling for hazards in the workplace. Workplace violence is considered to be a significant hazard in its own right. Regulation 3 of the ''Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations'' 1999 states that, “every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment of:
* The risks to the health and safety of his (or her) employees to which they are exposed whilst they are at work; and
* The risks to the health and safety of persons not in his employment arising out of or in connection with the conduct of him or his undertaking".

==Occupational groups at higher risk==
The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety lists the following higher risk occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

* Healthcare workers
* Correctional officers
* Social Services workers
* Teachers
* Municipal housing inspectors
* Public Works Employees
* Retail Workers
* Police Officers

Health care workers are at high risk for experiencing violence in the workplace. Examples of violence include threats, physical assaults, and muggings. According to estimates of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the rate of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work was 15.1 per 10,000 full-time workers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfatal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Requiring Days Away from Work, 2012. Retrieved March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is much higher than the rate for total private industries, which is 4.0 per 10,000 full-time workers.

Monitoring workplace violence trends is essential to identifying targeted prevention strategies. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/ Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)] is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.
