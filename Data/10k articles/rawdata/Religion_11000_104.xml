The '''Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji''' (Arya Representative Society) is the national body for all the Arya Samajs in [[Fiji]].  It was formed in 1918 and registered as a religious body through the efforts of [[Manilal Doctor]], who was in Fiji from 1912 to 1920 at the behest of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] to provide legal assistance to the [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indians]]. Its first President was Swami Manoharanand Saraswati who had arrived  in Fiji, from [[India]], in 1913. The Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji is affiliated to Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (World Council of Arya Samaj) based in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vedalankar|first=Nardev |authorlink= |author2=Manohar Somera |title=Arya Samaj and Indians abroad |year= 1975|publisher= Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|location=New Delhi, India |isbn= |pages= 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after its formation the Sabha went about establishing schools in Fiji,with the first one, Gyrykul Primary School, established in 1918 in Saweni, [[Lautoka]]. The ''Sabha'' owns and manages 14 pre-schools, 18 primary schools, 7 secondary schools, a commercial school, a religious training centre, a youth development centre and has provided the facilities and resources for the establishment of the [[University of Fiji]].

'''Bahá'í orthography''' refers to the standardized system of [[Romanization]] of the [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words and names contained in the literature of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The set of guidelines uses certain [[Diacritic|accents]] and dots when [[Transliteration|transliterating]] the Arabic script that allows for a near-accurate representation of the original nouns.

Bahá'ís use a particular and fairly precise system standardized by [[Shoghi Effendi]], which he initiated in a general letter on March 20, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1974 |title = Bahá'í Administration |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-166-3 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/BA/ba-33.html |page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bahá'í transliteration scheme was based on a standard adopted by the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists which took place in [[Geneva]] in September 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, G. T. (1894). ''[http://bahai-library.com/plunkett_transliteration_congress_orientalists Report of the Transliteration Committee].'' Tenth International Congress of Orientalists. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Geneva. pp. 879-892.&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi changed some details of the Congress's system, most notably in the use of [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in certain cases (e.g. ''&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;'' instead of [[š]]), and in incorporating the [[solar letters]] when writing the definite article ''al-'' ({{lang-ar|ال}}) according to pronunciation (e.g. ''ar-Raḥím'', ''aṣ-Ṣaddíq'', instead of ''al-Raḥím'', ''al-Ṣaddíq'').

Since the Bahá'ís adopted their system in 1927, Middle Eastern scholars have modified the standard academic system adopted in 1894 in various ways, and have created a separate, related system for writing Persian (a principal change being use of e and o to write certain vowels, which have a different sound in Persian than in Arabic). The Bahá'í system, however, has now been used to print thousands of books and thousands of pamphlets and booklets in dozens of languages, hence modifying it would create confusion and force authors to use two different spelling systems (one in passages being quoted exactly, the other in the rest of the text). For this reason, many academics{{Who|date=December 2011}} have come to accept and use the Bahá'í system.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

According to Bahá'í transliteration standards, the correct forms used in the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] referring to its name and central figures are "Bahá'í," "Bahá'ís," "[[Báb]]," "[[Bahá'u'lláh]]," and "[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'." Because of typographic limitations, the forms "Bahai," "Bahais," "Bab," and "Bahaullah" are often used as a common spelling and are satisfactory for certain electronic uses.

The [[Acute_accent#Length|acute accent]] on a vowel letter indicates that the vowel is long in its original Persian (or Arabic) form, and is perhaps the most obvious trait that distinguishes it from other Romanizations, which usually use a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] instead.  This may or may not have any bearing on its [[Anglicisation|anglicised pronunciation]].

==Comparison to standard romanizations==

The Bahá'í transliteration can often differ markedly from more common standard transliterations that are now in use.

While the accent and phonemic diacritic marks in the word "Bahá'í" indicate a three syllable pronunciation as {{IPA-fa|bæhɒːˈʔiː|}}, the official pronunciation guide of the Bahá'í World News Service gives a two syllable pronunciation of "Ba-High," {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bahai.org/media-information/style-guide&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In English, "Bahá'í" {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}} is pronounced with two syllables according to the [http://news.bahai.org/media-information/style-guide/ pronunciation guide] on the Bahá'í World News Service Website (Bahá'í: ''Ba-HIGH''). In Persian, {{lang-fa |بهائی}} {{IPA-fa|bæhɒːˈʔiː|}} is pronounced with three syllables. The exact realization of the English pronunciation varies. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|æ|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|ba|HAH|ee}}, [[Merriam-Webster]] has {{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|bah|HAH|ee}}, and the [[Random House Dictionary]] has {{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|iː}} {{respell|bə|HAH|ee}}, all with three syllables.

The majority reside in [[Gujarat]] and some parts of [[Maharashtra]] in India.

==History==
The Bhanushali are chiefly farmers and traders. Although they claim to be of [[Kshatriya]] descent, but are recognized as [[Vaishya]].&lt;ref name=jain/&gt; Jyotindra Jain theorized that the Bhanushalis migrated to Gujarat from [[Sindh]], based on their worship of [[Hinglaj Mata]]. He also believed that the [[Lohana]]s and Bhansalis shared a common home in Sindh before their migration to Gujarat.&lt;ref name=jain/&gt;

== Communities ==
Bhanushalis are at present divided in to two subgroups, according to where they live. The Cutchhi Bhanushali Community (have ancestry in [[Kutch district|Kutch]] region) and Halai Bhanushali Community (have ancestry in Halar ([[Jamnagar]]) region).&lt;ref&gt;Bhanushalis Samaj (2018).

==Lohanas==
Bhanushalis shared their early home in [[Sind]] with Lohanas and seem to share history.&lt;ref name="jain" /&gt; Like [[Lohana]]s, Bhanushalis are involved in trading and gained visibility in business. Like Lohanas they worship [[Rana Jashraj|Dada Jashraj]] as their [[kuladevata]] and [[Harkor]], as [[Kuldevi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3394">The '''Blavatsky Lodge''' was an English Theosophical Society. The complete name is ''The Blavatsky Lodge of the Theosophical Society''.

== History ==

The Blavatsky Lodge was founded in May (July?) 1887 in [[London]] by 14 members of the [[London Lodge]]. It was the second official theosophical lodge in England after the London Lodge, and the third in Europe (after the Loge Germania in Germany). Before its foundation, several members of the London Lodge invited [[Madame Blavatsky]] to London, where she arrived on May 1, 1887 from [[Oostende]]. She stayed in London until her death on May 8, 1891.

[[Archibald Keightley|Archibald]] and [[Bertram Keightley]] were considering forming an independent theosophical lodge, which would be focussed on the works of Blavatsky. Other members of the London Lodge gave their approval, and the Blavatsky Lodge was founded. It is unclear if the deed of foundation was signed by Olcott, the president of the society, or by Blavatsky.

The distinguishing factor in the Blavatsky Lodge was that Madame Blavatsky herself was present at the Lodge every Thursday. After a few months, the Blavatsky Lodge had grown substantially. When Blavatsky died, no other theosophical lodge in Great Britain had more members than the Blavatsky Lodge. The discussions with Blavatsky at the Blavatsky Lodge were collected in the ''Transactions of the Blavatsky Lodge'' and contain many commentaries on the ''Secret Doctrine''. The members of the Blavatsky Lodge were also involved in the publication of the ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]]'' magazine.

After 1890, Annie Besant became president of the Blavatsky Lodge.

In November 1889 [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited the Lodge and met with Blavatsky and [[Annie Besant]]. Two members of the society also recommended that Gandhi read the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Freer Andrews (Hrsg.): ''Mahatma Gandhi, Mein Leben''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.M. 1983, {{ISBN|3-518-37453-2}}. Seite 48f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lodge is still in existence, and is part of the English section of the Theosophical Society Adyar.

== Modern times ==
There are places around the world where there are Blavatsky Lodge of Theosophical Societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Canon law''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'', a 'straight measuring rod, [[ruler]]') is a set of ordinances and regulations made by [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction|ecclesiastical authority]] (Church leadership), for the government of a Christian organization or church and its members. It is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law, or operational policy, governing the [[Catholic Church]] (both the [[Latin Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]), the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches, and the individual national churches within the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;Boudinhon, Auguste. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09056a.htm "Canon Law." ] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a [[Canon (canon law)|canon]] was originally&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|last=Wiesner-Hanks|first=Merry|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rule adopted by a [[church council]]; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

==Etymology==
{{main|Canon (canon law)}}
[[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / {{lang-grc|κανών}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Qaanoon / قانون, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, "straight"; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is "reed" (''cf.'' the Romance-language ancestors of the English word ''[[wikt:cane|cane]]'').

==Canons of the Apostles==
{{main|Canons of the Apostles}}
{{see also|Ancient Church Orders|Apostolic Constitutions|Didache}}
The ''Apostolic Canons''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Shahan|first=Thomas|title=Apostolic Canons|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia|volume= 3|location= New York|publisher= Robert Appleton Company|year=1908|accessdate= 9 August 2013|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03279a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/007/0070471.htm|title=The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles|publisher=Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol VII|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]], fifty in the [[Latin Church|Western]] Church) concerning the government and discipline of the [[Early Christian]] Church, incorporated with the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] which are part of the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]].
In the Fourth century the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) calls canons the disciplinary measures of the Church: the term canon, κανὠν, means in Greek, a rule. There is a very early distinction between the rules enacted by the Church and the legislative measures taken by the State called ''leges'', Latin for laws.&lt;ref name= Metz&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| first=René |last=Metz |title= What Is Canon Law?|volume= 80 |encyclopedia= The Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Catholicism, Section VIII: The Organization of the Church. |year= 1960 |publisher= Hawthorn Books Inc|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
{{main|Canon law of the Catholic Church|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
[[File:Extract from Burchard of Worms' Decretum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Image of pages from the ''Decretum of Burchard of Worms'', the 11th-century book of canon law.]]
In the [[Catholic Church]], [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|Church's hierarchical authorities]] to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church.&lt;ref name=Ramstein&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual of Canon Law|first=Fr. Matthew |last=Ramstein|publisher=Terminal Printing &amp; Pub. Co|year=1948}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the power of the church and its insistence on creating a specific format for the way its members would live their lives, it was often not followed. Powerful and wealthy individuals often simply did not abide by the rules and were allowed to approach family life and marriage how they saw fit. A prime instance of this was shown through annulments granted by the church. The church strongly disregarded and disallowed divorce. However, powerful men could often annul their marriages. This was noteworthy due to the fact that an annulment was very distorting to marriage law and contradicting to the disallowance of divorce. An annulment would not only cease a marriage but rather end the marriage and rule that the marriage was never valid, nor did it ever formally exist. Another potent example of Canon Law not being enforced is in regards to polygyny. Men having multiple wives was outright banned by the Catholic church. However, as seen previously in the example of wealthy and powerful individuals it was allowed. Men (even priests) who were powerful enough were allowed to have multiple wives, concubines, mistresses and could have sex prior to marriage. Despite the aforementioned blatant nonobservance to Canon Law, the codes set in place did shape and provide a code that the majority of the members of the catholic church directly abode and lived their lives according to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the [[Latin Church]], positive ecclesiastical laws, based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or [[natural law]], derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from the supreme legislator (i.e., the [[Supreme Pontiff]]), who possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P16.HTM Canon 331], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while particular laws derive formal authority from a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vatican Archive |title=Code of Canon Law |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220062727/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM |archivedate=20 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] also includes the main five rites (groups) of churches which are in full union with the [[Holy See]] and the Latin Church:
# [[Alexandrian Rite]] Churches which include the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]].
# [[West Syriac Rite]] which includes the [[Maronite Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]] and the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church]].
# [[Armenian Rite]] Church which includes the [[Armenian Catholic Church]].
# [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches which include the [[Albanian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Bulgarian Church]], [[Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia]], [[Greek Church]], [[Hungarian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Italo-Albanian Church]], [[Macedonian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Melkite Church]], [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Church]], [[Ruthenian Church]], [[Slovak Greek Catholic Church]] and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]].
# [[East Syriac Rite]] Churches which includes the [[Chaldean Church]] and [[Syro-Malabar Church]]. 
All of these church groups are in full communion with the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]] and are subject to the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]''.

===History, sources of law, and codifications===
{{main|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}

The [[Catholic Church]] has what is claimed to be the oldest continuously functioning internal legal system in [[Western world|Western Europe]],&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters |first= Dr. Edward, , JD, JCD, Ref. Sig. Ap. |url=http://canonlaw.info |publisher=CannonLaw.info|title=Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; much later than [[Roman law]] but predating the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. What began with{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} rules ("canons") adopted by the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in the first century has developed into a highly complex legal system encapsulating not just norms of the [[New Testament]], but some elements of the [[Halakha|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]), [[Roman law|Roman]], [[Visigoths#Law|Visigothic]], [[Anglo-Saxon law|Saxon]], and [[Celtic law|Celtic legal traditions]].

The history of Latin canon law can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual113&gt;Ramstein, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual113/&gt;

The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] promulgated in 1990 by [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blessed John Paul II, Ap. Const.|url=https://archive.org/stream/ApostolicConstitutionSacriCanonesJohnPaulIi1990/Sacri_Canones_Apostolic_Constitution_John_Paul_II_1990#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Apostolic Constitution Sacri Canones John Paul II 1990|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic canon law as legal system===
Roman canon law is a fully developed legal system, with all the necessary elements: courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code&lt;ref&gt;Ramstein, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; principles of legal interpretation, and coercive penalties, though it lacks civilly-binding force in most secular jurisdictions. One example where it did not previously apply was in the English legal system, as well as systems, such as the U.S., that [[Common_law|derived from it]]. Here criminals could apply for the [[Benefit of clergy]]. Being in holy orders, or fraudulently claiming to be, meant that criminals could opt to be tried by [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical]] rather than secular courts. The ecclesiastical courts were generally more lenient. Under the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]], the scope of clerical benefit was steadily reduced by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The Vatican disputed secular authority over priests' criminal offences, and this in turn contributed to the [[English Reformation]]. The benefit of clergy was systematically removed from English legal systems over the next 200 years, although it still occurred in South Carolina in [[Henry Shultz|1827]].

The structure that the fully developed Roman Law provides is a contribution to the Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodes|first1=Robert E.|title=The Canon Law as a Legal System-Function, Obligation, and Sanction|date=1964|page=47|url=https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://search.yahoo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1081&amp;context=nd_naturallaw_forum|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic degrees in canon law are the J.C.B. (''Juris Canonici Baccalaureatus'', Bachelor of Canon Law, normally taken as a graduate degree), J.C.L. (''Juris Canonici Licentiatus'', [[Licentiate of Canon Law]]) and the J.C.D. (''Juris Canonici Doctor'', [[Doctor of Canon Law]]). Because of its specialized nature, advanced degrees in civil law or theology are normal prerequisites for the study of canon law.

Much of the legislative style was adapted from the Roman Law [[Codex iuris civilis|Code of Justinian]]. As a result, Roman ecclesiastical courts tend to follow the [[Roman Law]] style of continental Europe with some variation, featuring collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding, called "[[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]", from the Latin "inquirere", to enquire. This is in contrast to the [[Adversarial system|adversarial]] form of proceeding found in the common law system of English and U.S. law, which features such things as juries and single judges.

The institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[common law (legal system)]] bear the influences of canon law. Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92870/canon-law "canon law."] Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 9 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]-[[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt; While the term "law" is never explicitly defined in the Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jgray.org/comps/book1.html |publisher=JGray.org |first=Msgr. Jason |last=Gray |accessdate= 8 June 2013|title=Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] cites [[Treatise on Law|Aquinas in defining law]] as "...an ordinance of reason for the common good, promulgated by the one who is in charge of the community"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6X.HTM |work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|title= In Brief §1976|quote=''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I-II, 90, 4|publisher=USCCB Publishing|isbn=9781574557251}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reformulates it as "...a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good."&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', The Moral Law§1951&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Code for the Eastern Churches===
{{main|Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches}}
{{see also|Oriental canon law}}
The law of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern-rite Churches]] in full communion with the Roman papacy was in much the same state as that of the Latin or Western Church before 1917; much more diversity in legislation existed in the various Eastern Catholic Churches. Each had its own special law, in which custom still played an important part. One major difference in Eastern Europe however, specifically in the Orthodox Christian churches was in regards to divorce. Divorce started to slowly be allowed in specific instances such as adultery being committed, abuse, abandonment, impotence and barrenness being the primary justifications for divorce. Eventually, the church began to allow remarriage to occur (for both spouses) post-divorce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1929 Pius XI informed the Eastern Churches of his intention to work out a Code for the whole of the Eastern Church. The [[eastern canonical reforms of Pius XII|publication of these Codes]] for the Eastern Churches regarding the law of persons was made between 1949 through 1958&lt;ref&gt;"In 1959, John XXIII, announced for the first time his decision to reform the existing corpus of canonical legislation"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; but finalized nearly 30 years later.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

The first [[1917 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law (1917)]] was almost exclusively for the [[Latin Church]], with extremely limited application to the Eastern Churches.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 1, [[1917 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second Vatican Council]], (1962 - 1965), another edition was published specifically for the Roman Rite in 1983. Most recently, 1990, the Vatican produced the ''Code of Canons'' of the Eastern Churches which became the 1st code of ''Eastern Catholic Canon Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Canon_Law.html|first=Don|last=Ford|title=Canon Law Research Guide|work=[[GlobaLex]]|date=June 2007|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox Church==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[New Testament]] --&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], principally through the work of 18th-century [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monastic scholar [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]], has compiled canons and commentaries upon them in a work known as the ''Pēdálion'' (Greek: Πηδάλιον, "Rudder"), so named because it is meant to "steer" the Church in her discipline. The dogmatic determinations of the Councils are to be applied rigorously, since they are considered to be essential for the Church's unity and the faithful preservation of the Gospel.&lt;ref name=Pastavos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7071 |title=The Canonical Tradition of the Orthodox Church |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-08-09 |first=Dr. Lewis J., Ph.D. |last=Patsavos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglican Communion==
{{main|Canon law (Anglican Communion)}}

In the [[Church of England]], the [[ecclesiastical court]]s that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g. discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards). Their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the [[Normans]] split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other courts of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, not [[common law]], although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes. Since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts. The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; thereafter practitioners in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] were trained in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], receiving a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], or a Doctor of Laws ([[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]]) degree from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Such lawyers (called "doctors" and "civilians") were centered at "[[Doctors' Commons|Doctors Commons]]", a few streets south of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London, where they monopolized [[probate]], matrimonial, and [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the [[common law]] courts in the mid-19th century.

Other churches in the [[Anglican Communion]] around the world (e.g., the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]) still function under their own private systems of canon law.

Currently, (2004), there are principles of canon law common to the churches within the Anglican Communion; their existence can be factually established; each province or church contributes through its own legal system to the principles of canon law common within the Communion; these principles have a strong persuasive authority and are fundamental to the self-understanding of each of the churches of the Communion; these principles have a living force, and contain in themselves the possibility of further development; and the existence of these principles both demonstrates unity and promotes unity within the Anglican Communion.

==Presbyterian and Reformed churches==
{{See also|Presbyterian polity}}
In Presbyterian and Reformed churches, canon law is known as "practice and procedure" or  "church order", and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.

Roman canon law had been criticized by the Presbyterians as early as 1572 in the [[Admonition to Parliament]]. The protest centered on the standard defense that canon law could be retained so long as it did not contradict the civil law. According to Polly Ha, the Reformed Church Government refuted this claiming that the bishops had been enforcing canon law for 1500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWDMb0sW-hoC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=English Presbyterianism, 1590-1640 |isbn=9780804759878 |accessdate=2013-08-09 |last=Ha |first=Polly |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheranism==
The [[Book of Concord]] is the historic [[doctrinal statement]] of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], consisting of ten [[creed|credal]] documents recognized as authoritative in [[Lutheranism]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bente, Friedrich., ed. and trans., ''Concordia Triglotta'', (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), p. i&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law. Each Lutheran national church establishes its own system of church order and discipline, though these are referred to as "canons."

==United Methodist Church==
{{main|Book of Discipline (United Methodist)}}
The Book of Discipline contains the laws, rules, policies and guidelines for The United Methodist Church. Its last edition was published in 2016.

The '''Church of Cognizance''' ('''COC''') was founded in 1991 by Danuel &amp; Mary Quaintance&lt;ref&gt;[http://danmary.org dan&amp;mary's Monastery-HEMPorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530103628/http://danmary.org/ |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Graham County (Pima) [[Arizona]], [[United States]].

==Beginnings==
In 1994, the Quaintances recorded a 16-page "Declaration of Religious Sentiment" concretizing the establishment of their church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc-recording.pdf ''Coc-declaration'']&lt;/ref&gt; The COC Founders recording announced their intent to unite the world's ethnic minorities that utilize and rely upon the [[cannabis]] hemp plant as an ethno-socio-religious institution following Neo-Zoroastrian tenets.

While COC members are encouraged to study all of the world's religions, the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]] is held by them to be the least convoluted and most ancient source supporting their practices and beliefs. Numerous references to [[Haoma]] may be found in the Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/y9to11s.PDF ''Translated Avesta Yasna 9-11'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the COC with 40 to 50 members in Arizona, nationwide had 72 registered Individual Orthodox Member Monasteries (IOMMs), which are located inside members' homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216222414/http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/137087.php ''(Archived) Arizona Daily Star - Pot church takes a hit '']&lt;/ref&gt;

==COC Membership==
To become a "registered member" of the COC, a candidate must read a pamphlet titled "The Church Of Cognizance Introduced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/pledge.pdf ''The Church Of Cognizance Introduced'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet includes the below stated beliefs, description of organization, and the membership pledge of the church. If the candidate is in agreement with the beliefs, organization, and pledge, they then must then fill out, and sign their PLEDGE and return it to the designated address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iomm.info ''(Official) COC Membership page''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605230913/http://iomm.info/ |date=2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Members of the COC claim to believe:

1. That [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as [[Haoma]], when raised and used properly, aids the mind, body, and soul.

2. That Haoma is the ancient teacher of wisdom, compassion, and the way to the kingdom of glory in heaven on earth, while humans let ego block their own, and others, path to this kingdom of glory.

3. That Haoma is the capable provider of all substance required to accommodate a comfortable, healthy, productive, full-bearing life.

4. That Haoma is the righteous Protector of their health, and longevity; by way of receptors in the human body that believe Haoma connects with to heal.

Based on their beliefs, they declare Marijuana/Cannabis/Haoma to be "the teacher, the protector, the provider". And further, that the proper religious use promotes "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds, none of which is harmful to the health, safety, welfare, or morals of society in general".

===Organization===
The COC is composed of "Family Oriented Monastic Orders" wherein members are dedicated to promoting the health, safety, welfare, culture, and tradition of the family thru their belief:

1. That the physically able, retired adults, of the family should care for the sick, the eldest, and the youngest of the family.

:      a. The eldest of the family whom have provided in the past should not be forgotten and tossed aside for strangers to care for.

:      b. The children of the family need to learn the family’s culture and traditions from a member of the family with that wisdom.

:      c. It allows the able bodied of the family to work and provide for the entire family without the worry of who's caring for their offspring, and whose customs and traditions they are taught.

:      d. It keeps family together, helping family, and the family as a whole may become Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise.

Each Family Oriented Monastic Order of the Church Of Cognizance is designated an "Individual Orthodox Member Monastery" (IOMM).

===Members Pledge===
By submitting their application, prospective members pledge their allegiance, and support, to the Church Of Cognizance and the IOMMs of which it is composed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc_pledge.pdf ''Members Pledge'']&lt;/ref&gt; Their pledge requires:

:       a. That they will do their best to live an honorable life; in a family oriented mode; as described in The Church Of Cognizance Belief’s Introduced.

:       b. That they will not allow any Marijuana raised for religious use to enter into commerce, nor will they provide marijuana to anyone outside of the Church Of Cognizance; other than in providing for the religious use by a potential member; and, that use must be under their direct supervision.

:       c. They agree that until such time as the governments end their war against the sacrament of the COC, they will keep any cultivation, or use, confined to a secluded, secure area, in order to mitigate government fears regarding child endangerment.

:       d. They understand that it is a duty of theirs to share the bounty of any harvest with the sick, and dying free of charge; when requested, if they are aware, or made aware, of it being beneficial in such situations.

:       e. And last, that they will respect other family’s lifestyles by agreeing not to introduce any minors into the Marijuana Religion.

==Founders' arrest, prosecution and sentencing==

On February 22, 2006, the founders of the Church of Cognizance, Danuel and Mary Quaintance, were arrested with 172 pounds of marijuana. They asserted that the marijuana was for religious use, an argument which US District court judge Judith C. Herrera rejected outright. The federal judge stated that the evidence shows the two created the church and beliefs as a way of justifying their lifestyle choice to use marijuana and their belief that marijuana should be legalized.  She further stated they cannot avoid prosecution for illegal conduct by simply calling their conduct a religion.  Also it was noted that the monasteries were all located in members' homes.  The church states a "declaration of religious sentiment" on behalf of the Church of Cognizance was filed with the Graham County Recorder's Office 12 years prior this arrest in 1994. Further noted was that the Quaintances had not faced any prior criminal charges related to their church and that they do not grow marijuana but pick it up from church "couriers", which is what they were doing when they were arrested.  Both founders stepped down as leaders of the church following their arrests. But the couple hope to one day resume what they view as their worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/court-overrules-church-s-use-of-pot-as-sacrament/article_55458b9c-880d-5aaf-a4cf-5c424612aa3e.html ''Arizona Daily Star - Court overrules church's use of pot as sacrament '']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2008, they both pleaded guilty to two counts. One count of conspiracy with intent to distribute 200 pounds or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 100 pounds or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana, as well as aiding and abetting.  They faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Danuel Quaintance is serving{{When|date=November 2017}} a five-year sentence at a facility at the Federal Correctional Institute in Terminal Island, California, near Long Beach. Mary Quaintance is serving two years at the Victorville Federal Correctional Complex in Adelanto, Calif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html "Pot Church Copes With Jailed Leaders"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614055400/http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they both were confident that an appeal based on their claimed religious use would keep them out of prison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/faith/256138 "Arizona Daily Star - Pot-deifying duo guilty, confident they'll avoid prison"]&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 19, 2010, affirmed the denial of the couple’s RFRA defense in ''United States v. Quaintance''. The panel agreed that evidence in the case established that the Quaintances had failed to establish that their beliefs about marijuana as a sacred substance were sincerely held, further concluding that “the record contains … overwhelming evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front — particularly in this transaction aimed at securing bail money for Ms. Quaintance’s brother.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100713031740/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=22979 ''Church founders can't escape drug charges  '']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Davidic line'''{{efn|also referred to as the '''House of David''') (known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as '''''Malkhut Beit David''''' ({{Hebrew|מלכות בית דוד}}) – '''"Kingdom of the House of David"'''}} refers to the tracing of lineage to [[David|King David]] through the texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[New Testament]], and through the following centuries.

==History==
===Judean monarchy===
{{Kings of Judah}}
According to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head. In David's case, this was done by the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].

[[File:David and Goliath by Caravaggio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''David and Goliath'' by [[Caravaggio]]]]
[[File:Piero della Francesca- Legend of the True Cross - the Queen of Sheba Meeting with Solomon; detail.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]]]]

Initially, David was king over the [[Tribe of Judah]] only and ruled from [[Hebron]], but after seven and a half years, the other [[Israelite]] tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], chose him to be their king as well&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Jewish Bible'', David Mandel, Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85&lt;/ref&gt;

All subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.

After the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by [[Assyria]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.

[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|center]]

===The Exilarchate===
{{main|Exilarchate}}
Following the conquest of Judah by Babylon and the [[Babylonian exile|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], "Head of the Diaspora"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in Achaeminid Persia during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].

===During the Hasmonean and Herodian periods===
The [[Hasmoneans]], also known as the [[Maccabees]], were a priestly group ([[Kohen|kohanim]]) from the [[Tribe of Levi]]. They established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their revolt against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The Levites had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as client king over the Roman province of Judea; and the subsequent destruction of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].

During the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members have risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Great Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach, ''Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)'', Jewish Encyclopedia [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i]. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of "his grandfather Hillel", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Exilarchate}}
The Exilarchate institution in Sasanian Persia was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] (the 30th Exilarch) in the late 5th century, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied of the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]] - then within the Byzantine Empire. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.

The Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the Arab conquest in the 7th century and continued to function during the early Caliphates. Haninai's posthumous son Bostanai was the first of the Exilarchs under Arabic rule. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. Natronai ben Habibai for instance was a rival Exilarch candidate of Judah Zakkai, but was defeated and sent to the West in banishment; this Natronai was a great scholar and according to tradition while in [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] compiled the entire Talmud of his memory. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exlarch family in the 11th century - according to one version Hezekiah, who was the last Exilarch and also the last Gaon, was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Islamic Spain, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of Samuel ha-Nagid. However, Jewish Quarterly Review mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter "J. Q. R.", xv. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in Fatimid Egypt failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.

Descendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. A descendant of Hezekiah, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], Gaon of Andalucia, died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to Abraham ibn Daud. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of David ben Zakkai who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&amp;nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.

A number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in later Middle Ages, including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Benveniste]], Hajj Yachya and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which is however disputed.

==Jewish interpretations==
In [[Jewish eschatology]], the term ''mashiach'', or "Messiah", came to refer to a future Jewish [[monarch|King]] from the Davidic line, who is expected to be anointed with [[holy anointing oil]] and rule the Jewish people during the [[Messianic Age]].&lt;ref name="schochet moshiah ben yossef"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL messiah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL The Messiah"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/messiah.html | title=The Messiah | publisher=William Morrow and Co | date=1991 | accessdate=2 December 2012 | last=Telushkin | first=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Messiah is often referred to as "King Messiah", or, in Hebrew, {{lang|he|מלך משיח}} (''melekh mashiach''), and, in Aramaic, ''malka meshiḥa''.&lt;ref name="JVL Flusser"&gt;{{cite web|last=Flusser|first=David|title=Second Temple Period|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=Messiah|publisher=Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] views have generally held that the Messiah will be descended from his father through the line of [[David|King David]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Aryeh Kaplan|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |title="The Real Messiah  A Jewish Response to Missionaries" |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529164304/http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/RealMessiahBookPages_v4ab.pdf |archivedate=May 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will gather the Jews back into the [[Land of Israel]], usher in an era of peace, build the [[Third Temple]], father a male heir, re-institute the [[Sanhedrin]], and so on. Jewish tradition alludes to two redeemers, both of whom are called ''mashiach'' and are involved in ushering in the [[Messianic Age#Judaism|Messianic age]]: ''Mashiach ben David''; and ''[[Mashiach ben Joseph|Mashiach ben Yosef]]''. In general, the term ''Messiah'' unqualified refers to ''Mashiach ben David'' (Messiah, son of David).&lt;ref name="schochet moshiah ben yossef"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.moshiach.com/discover/tutorials/moshiach_ben_yossef.php | title=Moshiach ben Yossef | publisher=Moshiach.com | work=Tutorial | accessdate=2 December 2012 | last=Schochet | first=Jacob Immanuel | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220182918/http://www.moshiach.com/discover/tutorials/moshiach_ben_yossef.php | archivedate=20 December 2002 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL messiah"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blidstein|first=Prof. Dr. Gerald J.|title=Messiah in Rabbinic Thought|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_13744.html|work=MESSIAH|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library and Encyclopaedia Judaica 2008 The Gale Group|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian interpretations==
In Christian interpretation the "[[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|Davidic covenant]]" of a Davidic line in [[2 Samuel]] 7 is understood in various ways, traditionally referring to the [[genealogies of Christ]] in the [[New Testament]]. One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus of Nazareth]] via adoption of [[Joseph of Nazareth]], according to the family tree of the [[kings of Judah]] in [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapter 1:1-16 (the later part of which is not recorded in the Hebrew Bible), and also in [[Gospel of Luke]] 3:23-38.

Also Saint Mary, the [[Perpetual virginity of Mary|Virgin]] (Matthew 2:11 and 1:23, Luke 1:27 and then Lc 1:34-38,&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish expression ''I don't know any men'', referred to the virginity of a woman, and translated with the Greek verb ''ginōskō'', is also present with the same meaning in: Matthew 1:25; Genesis 4:1, 17; 19:8; 1 Samuel 1:19; Giudici 11:39; 21:12).&lt;/ref&gt; Acts 1:14) [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mother of Jesus Christ God]], was in other case connected to the Davidic line (Psalm 132:11 and Gospel of Luke 1:32; and by [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], descendant of [[Aaron]] in Luke 1:5, and relative of Mary in Luke 1:36).

Another Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in Gospel of Luke chapter 3 (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of "[Je]Coniah" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel (Jer. 22:30).&lt;ref&gt;H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 "And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile. Because of Jeremiah's curse on Jehoiachin (Coniah) in the early 500s BC (Jer. 22:30), the high priests of Israel, while serving as the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This same "curse" is also considered by some Christian commentators as the reason that [[Zerubbabel]], the rightful Solomonic king during the time of [[Nehemiah]], was not given a kingship under the [[Persian empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren W. Wiersbe -The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete Old Testament - 2007 p1497 "Zerubbabel was the grandson of King Jehoiachin (Jeconiah, Matt. 1:12; Coniah, Jer. 22:24, 28), and therefore of the royal line of David. But instead of wearing a crown and sitting on a throne, Zerubbabel was the humble governor of a ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===David the Prince===

In Mormon eschatology, Latter-Day Saints express in the belief of a Davidic prophet by the name of David who would come in the last days to prepare for the [[Second Coming]] of the Lord including the building of the [[Third Temple|Third Jewish Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/David,_Prophetic_Figure_of_Last_Days 'David, Prophetic Figure of Last Days']&lt;/ref&gt;

==House of David in Islam==
The Quran mentioned the house of David once: "Work, O family of David, in gratitude. And few of My servants are grateful."&lt;ref&gt;Quran 34:13&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned David 16 times.

According to some Islamic sources, some of Jewish settlers in Arabia were from the Davidic line, Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi recorded: "A Jewish man from the Davidic line entered Medina and found the people in deep sorrow. He enquired the people, 'What is wrong?' Some of the people replied: Prophet Mohamed passed away".&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi, Bihār al-Anwār, Dar Al-Rida Publication, Beirut, (1983), volume 30 page 99&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divine apathy''' is the doctrine that the divine nature is incapable of suffering, passivity or modification. This doctrine is a common feature of [[Platonism|Platonist]], [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]], and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophical theology]] and seems to have heavily influenced post-Biblical Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thought.  On the other hand, the Bible depicts YHWH as capable of grieving, for example:

"And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart." (Genesis 6:6 King James Version)

"And then יהוה sighed as He has effectuated the ʔǟḏǟ̖m in the land, and then He travailed (Himself) to His heart." (Genesis 6:6 Scriptures of the Faith Once Delivered)

'''Doliche''' ({{lang-el|Δολίχη}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ptolemy|3.13.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient Greek city and [[polis]] (city-state) in [[Perrhaebia]] in [[Thessaly]], situated at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]].&lt;ref name=Poleis&gt;{{cite book|author= Mogens Herman Hansen &amp; Thomas Heine Nielsen |title= An inventory of archaic and classical poleis|year= 2004|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-19-814099-1|chapter= Thessaly and Adjacent Regions|pages= 722-723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doliche, with the two neighbouring towns of [[Azorus]] and [[Pythion]] (Pythium), formed a [[Tripolis (region of Thessaly)|Tripolis]].

During the [[Roman–Seleucid War]], the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of the [[Aetolian League]] in the year 191&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|36.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Third Macedonian War]] the three towns surrendered to the army of [[Perseus of Macedon]] in the year 171&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that same year the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] reconquered the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|42.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 169&amp;nbsp;BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul [[Quintus Marcius Philippus (consul 186 BC)|Quintus Marcius Philippus]] who camped between Azorus and Doliche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Polybius|28.11, 28.13.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|44.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three cities minted a common coin with the inscription "ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Mogens Herman Hansen &amp; Thomas Heine Nielsen |title= An inventory of archaic and classical poleis|year= 2004|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 0-19-814099-1|chapter= Thessaly and Adjacent Regions|pages= 721-722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dubla''' are a Hindu [[caste]] found mainly in the [[Gujarat]] state of India. Minor populations are also found in surrounding states and union territories. They are also known as Talvia or Talvi Rathode.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India Maharshtra Volume XXX  Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 571-577&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

They get their name from the [[Hindi]] word dubla, which means a thin person. The Dubla claim that they were [[Rathore]] [[Rajput]]s, who acquired this nickname on account of their taking to cultivation. They are also known as Halpati, which in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] means a cultivator. The Dubla are found in the districts of [[Surat]], [[Valsad]], [[Bharuch]] and [[Vadodara]]. &lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Maharashtra]] the Dubla also claim descent from the [[Rathore]] community. The name dubla is also derived from the word durbala, which means a weakling. They are found mainly in [[Thane District]], and speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. &lt;ref&gt;People of India Maharshtra Volume XXX  Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 571-577&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==
They are classified as scheduled tribes in 4 states and 2 union territories: [[Goa]], [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Daman and Diu]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Gujarat ===

The community consist of twenty sub-divisions, the main ones being the Talavia, Rathoria, Vohariya, Damaria, Valsadia, Olpadia, Mandavia, Umberia, Ghanghodia, Khodia, Choria, Ukharia, Baramia, Baria, Narda, Haevia, Thakura, Karcha, Watal, Parsi Dubla and Laldatwala Dubla. These clans are of equal status, and intermarry, except the Talavia, who consider themselves superior to the other clans on account of their [[Rajput]] ancestry. The Dubla speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. &lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dubla are marginal cultivators and landless agricultural labourers. They also possess buffaloes, cows and goats and are often involved in selling milk, which is a subsidiary occupation. A small number are petty traders, and are often village shopkeepers. Many Dubla have also moved to [[Surat]] and [[Ahmedabad|Ahmadabad]], where they are employed in the diamond cutting industries.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  One edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Maharashtra ===

Dubla society consists of several endogamous sub-divisions which do not marry. Some of their sub-divisions include the Bhahmaniya, Garasia, Karcha, Mandvia, Ratjod, Rajput, and Taravia. Their primary occupation is agriculture. The community is divided between small landowners and landless agricultural labourers. They are [[Hindu]], and customs similar to neighbouring tribal communities such as the [[Dhodia]] and [[Warli]]. &lt;ref&gt;People of India Maharshtra Volume XXX  Part One edited by B.V Bhanu, B.R Bhatnagar, D.K Bose, V.S Kulkarni and J Sreenath pages 571-577&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ésagila''' ({{lang-sux|{{cuneiform|𒂍𒊕𒅍𒆷}}}} {{transl|Xsux|&lt;small&gt;[[É (temple)|É]]-SAǦ-ÍL.LA&lt;/small&gt;}}, ''"[[É (temple)|temple]] whose top is lofty"'')&lt;ref&gt;W. F. Albright, reviewing Friedrich Wetzel and F. H. Weissbach, ''Das Hauptheiligtum des Marduk in Babylon: Esagila und Etemenanki'' in ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 48.3 (July, 1944), p. 305f.&lt;/ref&gt; was a temple dedicated to [[Marduk]], the protector god of [[Babylon]]. It lay south of the [[ziggurat]] [[Etemenanki]].

==Description==
In this temple was the [[cult image]] inhabited by Marduk, surrounded by cult images of the cities that had fallen under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Babylonian Empire]] from the 18th century BC; there was also a little lake which was named ''[[Abzu]]'' by the Babylonian priests. This ''Abzu'' was a representation of Marduk's father, [[Enki]], who was god of the waters and lived in the ''Abzu'' that was the source of all the fresh waters.

[[Esarhaddon]], king of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (681 – 669 BC), claimed he built the temple from the foundation to the battlements, a claim corroborated by dedicatory inscriptions found on the stones of the temple's walls on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara N. Porter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6toY--R430C&amp;pg=PA53 Images, Power, and Politics: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's ..., Volume 208], ''Books.google.com'', p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

The Esagila complex, completed in its final form by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (604–562 BC) encasing earlier cores, was the center of Babylon. It comprised a large court (ca. 40×70 meters), containing a smaller court (ca. 25×40 meters), and finally the central shrine, consisting of an anteroom and the inner sanctum which contained the statues of Marduk and his consort [[Sarpanit]].

According to [[Herodotus]], [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had a statue removed from the Esagila when he flooded Babylon in 482 BC, desecrated the Esagila and sacked the city. [[Alexander the Great]] ordered restorations, and the temple continued to be maintained throughout the 2nd century BC, as one of the last strongholds of Babylonian culture, such as literacy in the [[cuneiform script]], but as Babylon was gradually abandoned under the [[Parthian Empire]], the temple fell into decay in the 1st century BC.

Under the enormous heap of debris that lay over it, Esagila was rediscovered by [[Robert Koldewey]] in November 1900, but it did not begin to be seriously examined until 1910. The rising water table has obliterated much of the [[sun-dried brick]] and other oldest material. Most of the finds at Babylon reflect the [[Neo-Babylonian]] period and later.

Data from the Esagila tablet,&lt;ref&gt;Schmid calls it the ''Anubelshunu Tablet'' (Hansjörg Schmid, ''Der Tempelturm Etemenanki in Babylon'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  which was copied from older texts in 229 BC and describes Esagila in lines 1–15 before passing on to the ziggurat of Etemenanki, have aided in the temple's reconstruction. The tablet, described by [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] in 1872, disappeared for some time into private hands before it resurfaced and began to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;The tablet has been republished in emended form by A.R. George, ''Babylonian Topographical Texts'' (Louvain) 1992:418.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Esagila tablet hold Babylonian calculting methods considered to be sacred as they read in the back ""let the initiate show the initiate, the non-initiate must not see this". On the front, the tablet explains the history and engineering of the 7-floor high Etemenanki temple (the equivalent of the [[Tower of Babel]] in the Bible).&lt;ref name="louvre tablet"/&gt;

[[File:FFM logo words black.png|thumb|logo of FFM (Fellowship of Faith for Muslims)]]
'''Fellowship of Faith for the Muslims''' (FFM) is an international fellowship of [[Christians]] who have a concern for the [[Muslim world]].

== FFM origins ==
It was founded by Annie van Sommer, her niece, and John Martin Cleaver through the [[Keswick Convention]], England after a talk by [[Samuel Zwemer]] in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Frontier Missions, Vol.13:4 Oct-Dec 1996, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has maintained its emphasis on praying for Muslims worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Paul: 'Taking Hold of God, the Story of a Prayer Movement', Kitab Interserve Resources, UK 2015, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this [[prayer]], resources listing topics to pray for are mailed out around the world, to encourage more Christians to pray, in the hope that Muslims will be blessed and to come to know the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to increase this interest and vision.

== FFM Today ==
The Fellowship is organised by [[committees]] of unpaid volunteers, some of whom are missionaries, but FFM itself is not a mission agency. 
FFM in the UK and in North America compiles and sends out prayer requests, sourced from various mission agencies, relating to the topic of Muslim-majority [[people groups]] across the world, [[Christians]] living among them, and opportunities they may have to share their faith, eg. [[Bible translation]], radio or TV programmes, and [[Christian Church|church]] activities. The members who receive the monthly bulletins (by post or email) pay a [[subscription]], and are invited to gather for FFM prayer meetings and [[conferences]]. 
FFM currently has [[branches]] in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffm.org.uk/ministry.php|title=FFM - Christian Prayer for the Muslim World|website=www.ffm.org.uk|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in North America &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffmna.org/site/about.php?id=mission|title=FFM - Fellowship of Faith for Muslims - Mission &amp; History|website=www.ffmna.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which publishes prayer items 3 times a year), and in New Zealand.

'''Gender and Judaism''' is a radical, emerging subfield at the intersection of [[gender studies]] and [[Jewish studies]]. Gender studies centers on interdisciplinary research on the phenomenon of gender. It focuses on cultural representations of gender and people's lived experience. Jewish studies is a field that looks at Jews and Judaism, through such disciplines as history, anthropology, literary studies, linguistics, and sociology.

==History==
Jewish law, or [[halacha]], recognises gender ambiguity, and has done throughout Jewish history &lt;ref&gt;"More than Just Male and Female: The Six Genders in Ancient Jewish Thought." Freidson, Sarah. Sefaria, 10 June 2016. [https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/37225]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, unlike the modern concept of gender fluidity, this ambiguity is defined according to physical presentation (or lack thereof) and primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The concept of a [[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] being a person of ambiguous gender and/or sex is dealt with, as is the concept of the [[androgynos]], being a person characterised with elements of both genders. These concepts have precedent dating back to the beginning of Jewish thought.

Gender and Judaism has drawn scholarly interest due to the rapid growth of its intersecting fields during the late 20th century, fueled as well by popular and academic attention to [[Jewish feminism]]. As universities established [[women's studies]] programs, they have linked to Jewish studies as well. For instance, in 1997, [[Brandeis University]] established the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, which aims to "develop fresh ways of thinking about Jews and gender worldwide by producing and promoting scholarly research and artistic projects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/hirjw/about/about.html -Brandeis Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, controversies over the role of women in Jewish denominations and the [[Gender separation in Judaism|gender separation in orthodox judaism]] has drawn attention to [[gender roles]], as constructed and regulated by religious institutions. For this reason, besides the academic attention, the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Jewish movements turn to gender and Judaism to reinforce their own mission and identity. Notably, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] has established the Gottesman Chair in Gender and Judaism and operates Kolot — the Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies ",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolot.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the first such center established at a rabbinical seminary (1996).

With the U.S.-based [[Association of Jewish Studies]], a women's caucus works "to advance the study of gender within the Association for Jewish Studies and within the wider academic community." AJS holds at  least one panel on gender every annual meeting, provide funding for presentations on gender and Judaism and published a collection of syllabi pertaining to gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajsnet.org/ajswomen's_caucus.htm AJS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
* Zachar (זָכָר): This term is derived from the word for memory and refers to the belief that the man carried the name and identity of the family. It is usually translated as "male" in English.
* Nekevah (נְקֵבָה): This term is derived from the word for a crevice and probably refers to a vaginal opening. It is usually translated as "female" in English.
* [[Androgynos]] (אנדרוגינוס): A person who has both "male" and "female" physical sexual characteristics. 149 references in [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]] (1st – 8th centuries CE); 350 in classical [[midrash]] and Jewish law codes (2nd – 16th centuries CE).
* [[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] (טומטום): A person whose sexual characteristics are indeterminate or obscured. 181 references in Mishna and Talmud; 335 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.
* Ay’lonit (איילונית): A female who does not develop at puberty and is infertile. 80 references in Mishna and Talmud; 40 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.
* Saris (סָרִיס): A male who does not develop at puberty and/or subsequently has their sexual organs removed. A saris can be “naturally” a saris (saris hamah), or become one through human intervention (saris adam). 156 references in mishna and Talmud; 379 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf |title=Terms for Gender Diversity in Classical Jewish Texts |publisher=Transtorah.org |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Gender and Jewish studies intersect primarily through research on Jewish women and the [[role of women in Judaism]] and Jewish culture.

Nonetheless, gender and Jewish studies also investigate the gender phenomena pertaining to men and masculinity. In addition, the subfield encompasses research on [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexuality]] and [[queer theory]] as these pertain to Jews and Judaism.

In historical terms, gender and Jewish studies span a broad range, from Biblical exegesis, research on [[rabbinic literature]], [[Medieval Jewish]] culture, the importance of gender in Jewish responses to modernity, and gender [[identity politics]] in the contemporary period.

There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism, which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought.&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Miriam, ''Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism,'' Menucha Publishers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Steven F. Friedell, “The ‘Different Voice’ in Jewish Law: Some Parallels to a Feminist Jurisprudence,” Indiana Law Journal, October 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob,   ''''Androgynous Judaism: Masculine and Feminine in the Dual Torah,'''' Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
While the male/female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation, the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles: "Everything that God created, He created as male and female...."(Baba Batra 74b)  

This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book, Song of Songs, which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel, where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God, who is represented in the story by the male lover. 
 
Other examples of topics in which the male/female dynamic is used metaphorically include: the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Miriam, Men are From Weekday, Women are from Shabbat, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, the relationship between the Oral and Written Law, the relationship between This World and the Next, the interplay between the legal and extra-legal aspects of Talmud (Halacha and Aggada)&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob,  How the Rabbis Liberated Women, University of South Florida, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt;, and the Jewish calendar, which makes use of both the sun (traditionally symbolic of the male force) and the moon (traditionally symbolic of the female force)&lt;ref&gt;Heshelis, Devorah, ''The Moon's Lost Light'', Targum Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Gender polarity is robustly maintained in both the Bible and in the Oral Law, (Deuteronomy, 22:5, even forbids cross-dressing)  and upholding this polarity is seen as critical in achieving synthesis between the masculine and feminine.
  
This exploration of gender-constructs in primary sources reveals surprising valuation of the feminine prototype in Kabbala-based sources which invites inquiry into the social, ethical, ecological, moral and philosophical ramifications of a feminine perspective within Jewish thought.&lt;ref&gt;Rinder Sarah, "A New, Sophisticated, Haredi View on Gender" The Forward, November, 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=April 2012}}
'''Glorification''' may have several meanings in the [[Christian]] religion.  From the Catholic [[canonization]] to the similar [[saint]]hood of the Eastern Orthodox Church to [[salvation in Christianity]] in Protestant beliefs, the glorification of the human condition can be a long and arduous process.

==Catholicism==
{{Main|Canonization#Catholic Church}}
In the [[Catholic Church]], both [[Latin Church|Latin]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Churches]], the act of canonization is reserved to the [[Apostolic See]] and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he is worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in [[Heaven]] and that he may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the [[liturgy]] of the Church, including in the ''[[Litany of the Saints]]''. 

In the Catholic Church, canonization is a decree that allows universal [[veneration]] of the saint in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Rite]]. For permission to venerate merely locally, only [[beatification]] is needed.&lt;ref&gt;"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Beccari, Camillo. "Beatification and Canonization".] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Accessed 27 May 2009.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;!--linked from 'Canonization'--&gt;==

[[Image:RelicsStJohnShanghai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The incorrupt Relics of [[John of Shanghai and San Francisco|St. John (Maximovitch)]] at the time of his glorification in [[San Francisco]] in 1994]]
{{also|Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Church}}
The [[Orthodox Church in America]] uses the term "glorification" to refer to the official recognition of a person as a [[saint]] of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roca.org/OA/14/14x.htm|title="What does "Glorification" Mean?" by Fr. Alexy Young|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca.org/FS.NA-Document.asp?ID=83 "The Glorification of Saints in the Orthodox Church"] by Fr. Joseph Frawley&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] uses both канонизация "canonization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.ru/pochemu-byl-kanonizirovan-nikolaj-vtoroj/|title=Почему был канонизирован Николай Второй?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and прославление&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.ru/proslavlenie-svyatyx-eto-ne-delo-uzkogo-kruga-specialistov-eto-delo-vsej-cerkvi/|title=Прославление святых – это не дело узкого круга специалистов, это дело всей Церкви.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Glorification#Eastern Orthodox Church|glorification]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/glorification_saints.htm|title=The Glorification of Saints|website=www.fatheralexander.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oriental Orthodox Church==
The [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] also hold a doctrinal tradition similar to the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] whereby [[martyr]]s are not in need of any formal glorification. With time, the greatness of their sanctity which is venerated by the faithful is recognized by the Church. In the words of Armenian Patriarch H. H. [[Karekin II]], ''"The Armenian Church doesn't sanctify. It recognizes the sanctity of saints or of those people that is already common among people or has been shown with evidence"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenpress.am/eng/news/792552/armenian-apostolic-church-to-canonize-armenian-genocide-victims-on-april-23-after-long-interval.html|title=Armenian Apostolic Church to canonize Armenian Genocide victims on April 23 after long interval|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in conformity with the tradition of other Churches in the Oriental Orthodox family such as [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Indian Orthodox Church]]. The instances of glorification of the 21 Coptic martyrs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3718470/isis-copts-egypt/|title=Christians Mourn Their Relatives Beheaded by ISIS|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/02/23/coptic-church-recognises-martyrdom-of-21-egyptians-killed-by-isis/|title=Coptic Church recognises martyrdom of 21 Christians killed by ISIS - CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=23 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 or the victims of Armenian genocide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/turchia-turkeyturquia-28409/|title=Armenian Church irritates Turkey with plans to canonize genocide victims|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1915 simply serve as official recognition given by the hierarchs to the steadfast faith of those who laid down their lives in defense of their Christian identity.

==Protestantism==

The [[Anglicanism|Anglican churches]] practice [[canonization]] of saints, somewhat similar to the Catholic concept.
There are two events that occur during glorification, these are "the receiving of perfection by the elect before entering into the kingdom of heaven," and  "the receiving of the resurrection bodies by the elect".

Glorification is the third stage of Christian development.  The first being [[Justification (theology)|justification]], then [[sanctification]], and finally glorification. (Rom. 8:28-30) Glorification is the completion, the consummation, the perfection, and the full realization of [[salvation]].

Glorification as a term is modified by its target, i.e. who is being glorified: God or the Christian? The third stage of Christian development is to glorify God through one's life, to decrease so that He may increase so that as others encounter a living breathing Christian who is walking in Glorification, they encounter Christ and perceive His Glory and His presence. This is attainable while living,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} just as justification and sanctification are attainable while living.

===Receiving of perfection===
Glorification is the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] alternative to [[Purgatory]], as it is "the means by which the elect receive perfection before entering into the kingdom of Heaven." According to the theologies of most major Protestant groups, Purgatory is a doctrine of the Catholic Church, a holding place for those whose lives were dominated by [[venial sin]]s but not guilty of [[mortal sin]]s. On the other hand, to Protestants, glorification is a continuous, flowing process, whereby believers in Jesus the Christ, who have either died or who are raptured alive (called up into heaven), receive glorified, perfect bodies and souls, sinless and Christlike. Those still living on earth have no effect on the outcome of those believers who have died or are raptured, nor do they have an effect on those who die without Christ.

While purgatory deals with the means by which the elect become perfect, Glorification deals with believers in Jesus being given perfection. The majority of Protestant denominations believe in this concept of glorification or something analogous to it, although some have alternative names for it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Receiving of the resurrection bodies===
After the final judgement, all the righteous dead shall arise and their bodies will be perfected and will become a glorified body. Only then can they enter [[heaven]]. To paraphrase [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''Weight of Glory'': "If we were to see them in their glorified forms we would be tempted to bow down and worship them."

'''Greater Grace World Outreach''' ('''GGWO''') is an [[Religious affiliation|affiliation]] of [[nondenominational]]. [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian churches that emphasize [[divine grace|grace]], the [[finished work]], and [[Mission (Christian)|missions]]. The headquarters of Greater Grace World Outreach is currently located at its [[megachurch]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. GGWO was founded by [[Carl H. Stevens Jr.]] who was succeeded by Pastor Thomas Schaller as Presiding Elder and Overseeing Pastor of Greater Grace World Outreach in Baltimore in April 2005.&lt;ref name=whoseniorpastor&gt;[http://www.ggwo.org/index.php?module=main&amp;action=whoweare&amp;show=2 GGWO Who We Are: Our Senior Pastor]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 567 Greater Grace churches in 70 countries.&lt;ref name=whocommitted&gt;[http://www.ggwo.org/index.php?module=main&amp;action=whoweare&amp;show=6 GGWO Who We Are: Committed to World Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these churches are located in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], with larger congregations in [[Hungary]], [[Azerbaijan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB86943381833191500?mod=googlewsj |title=Religion Is Spread to Ex-Soviets, But Local Clerics Are Inflamed|accessdate=2008-05-27 |last=Pope |first=Hugh |date=2007-07-21 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ghana]]. Most of the pastors attended affiliated [[Maryland Bible College &amp; Seminary]] in Baltimore, however there are many other affiliated Bible colleges around the world. The ministries of Greater Grace also include the radio program ''Grace Hour'', Greater Grace Christian Academy, Christian Sports Clubs, along with other internal ministries.

==Beliefs and practices==

The beliefs of Greater Grace are outlined in its [[doctrinal statement]] and detailed in booklets written by Carl H. Stevens. Worship is [[Christian liturgy|non-liturgical]] but generally includes prayer, singing, offerings, and sermons. Songs are usually [[contemporary worship music|contemporary]], but services may also include [[Classical music|classical]] [[hymn]]s. [[Evangelism]], ''raps'' (devotionals, or informal Q&amp;A meetings, usually following sermons), and informal [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] are also considered important acts of worship.

The organization has a 10-point Doctrinal Statement available on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ggwo.org/index.php?module=main&amp;action=docstatement |title=Doctrinal Statement |accessdate=2008-06-07 |year=2007 |publisher=Greater Grace Outreach}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization limits the pastorate and/or homiletic role to men due to a literal interpretation of I Tim. 2:12, but allows women to lead in just about any other capacity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The church leadership is strongly heterosexual and [[pro life]].


==History==

===Origins===
In the early 1960s, Carl H. Stevens Jr., a bakery truck driver, was praying at Wortheley Pond near [[Peru, Maine]], and developed a vision for a worldwide Christian ministry. Stevens was later ordained by a council of independent ministers at the Montsweag Baptist Church on March 7, 1963. From there Stevens went on to build the Woolwich-Wiscasset Baptist Church, and establish the Northeast School of the Bible in 1972. He also began to experiment with radio evangelism, with a program called "Telephone Time."

In 1973, following an arson attack on their church building and a controversial church split, Stevens and his closest followers moved the center of their operations to a former Catholic school facility in [[South Berwick, Maine]]. There "The Bible Speaks" became the name of the church, and "the Northeast School of the Bible" was renamed as "Stevens School of the Bible". Expanded radio and television outreaches continued to draw in new followers and—both through church planting operations by the organization's Bible school students and graduates, and existing churches affiliating themselves with Stevens' organization—a network of "branch ministries" began to develop.

In 1976, the school grew beyond its capacity. As a result, Carl Stevens moved the "home base" of his organization to a former private boarding school facility which they were able to purchase in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlstevens.org/subpage1.html |title= Report on "The Bible Speaks"|accessdate=2008-05-27 |last= |date=1981-03-28 |publisher=Gospel Truth Ministries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former organization===
The cornerstone of Stevens' career in Christian broadcasting was the call-in radio show he hosted, originally known as "Telephone Time", now called "Grace Hour". In 2006, this program won an Angel award for Excellence in Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelawards.com/2006_radio.html |title=Winners |accessdate=2008-05-27 |year=2006 |publisher=Excellence in Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both South Berwick and Lenox, the Bible Speaks developed a considerable local presence, not only through drawing large numbers of young adults into these small communities as Bible school students, but also through operating extensive Sunday School operations, with a private fleet of retired school buses for bringing in children from the surrounding area.

They also established a network of private K-12 schools, beginning with Southern Maine Christian Schools in South Berwick (later moved to [[Scarborough, Maine]]), and then Stevens Christian Schools in Lenox. Church planting missionary teams were also sent out first to [[El Salvador]] and then to [[Finland]] and other European countries {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. In the 1980s this expanded to include church planting operations in South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Thomas Schaller, the current leader of GGWO, began his pastoral career as the head of their original missionary team to Finland.

In the 1983, the Bible Speaks purchased a Norwegian ferry boat which they renovated to use as a missionary relief vessel in the Caribbean. This boat was named La Gracia, with Baltimore, Maryland as its official home port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warsailors.com/homefleet/shipst2.html |title=Norwegian Homefleet–WW II|accessdate=2008-05-27 |year=2008 |publisher=Warsailors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:GGWO Auditorium2.JPG|thumb|180px|Close up of seats.]]

===Present organization===
In Baltimore, Greater Grace World Outreach quickly grew and established ministries including the Grace Hour, Greater Grace Christian Academy, Maryland Bible College and Seminary, the Christian Athletics Program, as well as international outreach ministries.  [[Image:GGWO Auditorium1.JPG|thumb|300px|A section of GGWO'S 1,200 seat church [[auditorium]].]]

In 2003, Carl Stevens became too ill to continue his leadership of GGWO. In 2005, the elders elected Rodger Stenger to become the new chief elder of the church. However, Rodger Stenger chose not to accept the position. In his place the elders elected Thomas Schaller as senior pastor, after a congregational vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlstevens.org/subpage30.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=2008-05-27 |year=2007|publisher=Carlstevens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the elders and senior pastors were dissatisfied with the choice, citing Schaller's views on the role of the senior pastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-15/news/0405150015_1_greater-grace-church-members-church-leaders |title=Church dispute spills onto Internet; Web site airs accusations of impropriety by pastor |accessdate=2008-05-27 |last=Langfitt |first=Frank |date=2004-05-15 |publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, many church leaders, associated ministry leaders, and affiliate churches elected to disaffiliate.  A group of pastors who disaffiliated formed a new organization known as The International Association of Grace Ministries. The church is thriving and have over 600 hundred churches throughout the world.

==Organization==
GGWO is an affiliation of pastors ordained by the GGWO of Baltimore who agree to abide by the standards of the church. In return, the affiliation allows pastors to have fellowship and communication with other pastors and churches. Technically, it is an affiliation of pastors and not individual congregations as the GGWO recognizes local congregations as fully autonomous and independent. However, if a congregation’s pastor is a member of the GGWO then that congregation is considered within the GGWO as well. The GGWO cannot interfere within an individual church’s affairs unless assistance is requested.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Van Doren| first = Arnold| title = [[Media:GGWO Affiliation Handbook 2008.pdf|GGWO Affiliation Handbook 2008]]| place = Baltimore, MD| publisher = Greater Grace World Outreach| year = 2007| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
&lt;!-- BEFORE EDITING OR BLANKING, SEE TALK PAGE --&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a very controversial section, and must be discussed on the talk page before changes are made --&gt;
&lt;!-- Thank you for your consideration of this -- December 2015 --&gt;
On several occasions, Greater Grace World Outreach has been accused of cult-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/637903861.html?dids=637903861:637903861&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+15%2C+2004&amp;author=Frank+Langfitt&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Church+dispute+spills+onto+Internet+%3B+Web+site+airs+accusations+of+impropriety+by+pastor |title=Church dispute spills onto Internet; Web site airs accusations of impropriety by pastor |accessdate=2008-05-27 |last=Langfitt |first=Frank |date=2004-05-15 |publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Hassan, a licensed mental health practitioner, and founder of Freedom of Mind centre, claims that the organization operates as a personality cult alleging that Pastor Carl Stevens twisted passages from the Bible to further his own ends, that of controlling the lives of the members of his congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/g/greater/ |title=Greater Grace World Outreach |accessdate=2008-05-27 |date=2008 |publisher=Steven Allan Hassan's Freedom of Mind Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter was written by the [[Christian Research Institute]], which offers a list of suggestions for the church, attempting to correct any of the false teachings that might exist. The main teaching which was considered a concern was that of delegated authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlstevens.org/subpage.html |title=Christian Research Institute |accessdate=2008-05-27 |date=2007 |publisher=Carlstevens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in this document, Miller concedes that "TBS has, up to the time of this writing, also maintained an orthodox, biblical position on those doctrines most essential to the Christian faith. Thus, we do not consider TBS a non-Christian cult, but rather a Christian ministry."

{{History of Turkey}}

The '''Ilkhanate''', also spelled '''Il-khanate''' ({{lang-fa|ایلخانان}}, ''Ilxānān''; {{lang-mn|Хүлэгийн улс}}, ''Hu’legīn Uls''), was established as a [[khanate]] that formed the southwestern sector of the [[Mongol Empire]], ruled by the [[Mongol]] '''House of Hulagu'''. It was founded in the 13th century and was based primarily in [[Iran]] as well as neighboring territories, such as present-day [[Azerbaijan]] and the central and eastern parts of present-day [[Turkey]]. The Ilkhanate was originally based on the campaigns of [[Genghis Khan]] in the [[Khwarazmian Empire]] in 1219–24 and was founded by [[Hulagu Khan]], son of [[Tolui]] and grandson of Genghis Khan. With the [[Division of the Mongol Empire|fragmentation of the Mongol Empire]] after 1259 it became a functionally separate khanate. At its greatest extent, the state expanded into territories that today comprise most of [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], western [[Afghanistan]], and the Northwestern edge of the [[Indian sub-continent]]. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with [[Ghazan]] in 1295, converted to [[Islam]].

==Definition==
According to the historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], [[Kublai Khan]] granted Hulagu (Hülegü) the title of Ilkhan after his defeat of [[Ariq Böke]]. The term ''il-Khan'' means "subordinate [[Khan (title)|khan]]" and refers to their initial deference to [[Möngke Khan]] and his successor Great Khans of the [[Mongol empire]]. The title "Ilkhan", borne by the descendants of Hulagu and later other Borjigin princes in Persia, does not materialize in the sources until after 1260.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson ''The Mongols and the West'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Mongol rule in Persia==
When [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm]] executed a contingent of merchants dispatched by the Mongols, [[Genghis Khan]] declared war on the [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty]] in 1219. [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|The Mongols overran the empire]], occupying the major cities and population centers between 1219 and 1221. Persian Iran was ravaged by the Mongol detachment under [[Jebe]] and [[Subedei]], who left the area in ruin. [[Transoxiana]] also came under Mongol control after the invasion. The undivided area west of the Transoxiana was the inheritance of Genghis Khan's [[Borjigin]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Curtin ''The Mongols: A history'', p.184&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the families of the latter's four sons appointed their officials under the Great Khan's governors, Chin-Temür, Nussal, and [[Korguz]], in that region.

Muhammad's son [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] returned to Iran in c. 1224 after his exile in India. The rival Turkic states, which were all that remained of his father's empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol attempt to take Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by [[Chormaqan]]'s army sent by the Great Khan [[Ögedei]] in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, [[Azerbaijan]] and the southern Persian dynasties in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]] voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy May ''Chormaqan'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt; To the west, [[Hamadan]] and the rest of Persia was secured by Chormaqan. The Mongols [[Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia|invaded Armenia and Georgia]] in 1234 or 1236, completing the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] in 1238. They began to attack the western parts of [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]], which was under the [[Seljuks]], the following year.

In 1236 Ögedei was commanded to raise up [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]] and proceeded to populate [[Herat]]. The Mongol military governors mostly made camp in the [[Mughan plain]] in what is now Azerbaijan. Realizing the danger posed by the Mongols, the rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Cilician Armenia]] submitted to the Great Khan. Chormaqan divided the [[Transcaucasia]] region into three districts based on the Mongol military hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigor of Akanc ''The history of the nation of archers'', (tr. R.P.Blake) 303&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, the population was temporarily divided into eight [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalistriat Salia ''History of the Georgian Nation'', p.210&lt;/ref&gt; By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia (including modern-day Azerbaijan), Armenia, Georgia (excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Ismaili]] strongholds), as well as all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p.84&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, the Mongols under [[Baiju]] occupied [[Anatolia]], while the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] became vassals of the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;George Finlay ''The history of Greece from its conquest by the Crusaders to its conquest by the Ottomans'', p.384&lt;/ref&gt; [[Güyük Khan]] abolished decrees issued by the Mongol princes that had ordered the raising of revenue from districts in Persia as well as offering tax exemptions to others in c. 1244.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, see:Monqe Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with a complaint by the governor [[Arghun Agha|Arghun the Elder]] (Arghun agha), [[Möngke Khan]] prohibited ortog-merchants and nobles from abusing [[yam (route)|relay stations]] and civilians in 1251.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936'', Volume 1, p.729&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered a new census and decreed that each man in the Mongol-ruled Middle East must pay in proportion to his property. Persia was divided between four districts under Arghun.  Möngke Khan granted the [[Kartids]] authority over Herat, Jam, [[Pushang]] (Fushanj), [[Ghor]], Khaysar, Firuz-Kuh, Gharjistan, Farah, [[Sistan]], Kabul, Tirah, and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Ehsan Yar-Shater ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Ilkhan==
{{see also|Timeline of the Ilkhanate}}

The founder of the Ilkhanate dynasty was [[Hulagu Khan]], grandson of Genghis Khan and brother of both Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan. Möngke dispatched Hulagu to establish a firm [[Tolui]]d control over the Middle East and ordered him return to Mongolia when his task was accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;P.Jackson ''Dissolution of the Mongol Empire'', pp.222&lt;/ref&gt; Taking over from Baiju in 1255 or 1256, Hulagu had been charged with subduing the Muslim kingdoms to the west "as far as the borders of Egypt". This occupation led the Turkmens to move west into Anatolia to escape from the Mongolian rule. He established his dynasty over the southwestern part of the Mongol Empire that stretched from Transoxiana to [[Syria]]. He destroyed the Ismaili [[Nizari]] [[Hashshashin]]s and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1256 and 1258 respectively. After that he advanced as far as Gaza, briefly conquering [[Ayyubids|Ayyubid Syria]].

[[File:HulaguAndDokuzKathun.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hulagu Khan]], founder of the Ilkhanate, with his Christian queen [[Doquz Khatun]]]]
[[File:IlkhanidHorseArcher.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Mongol]] [[horse archer]] in the 13th century.]]

The death of Möngke forced Hulagu to return from the Persian heartland for the preparation of Khurultai (the selection of a new leader). He left a small force behind to continue the Mongol advance, but it was halted in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1260 by a major defeat at the [[battle of Ain Jalut]] at the hands of the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]]. Due to geo-political and religious issues and deaths of three [[Jochi]]d princes in Hulagu's service, [[Berke]] declared open war on Hulagu in 1262 and possibly called his troops back to Iran. According to Mamluk historians, Hulagu might have massacred Berke's troops and refused to share his war booty with Berke.

Hulagu's descendants ruled Persia for the next eighty years, tolerating multiple religions, including Shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, and ultimately adopting Islam as a state religion in 1295. However, despite this conversion, the Ilkhans remained opposed to the Mamluks, who had defeated both Mongol invaders and [[Crusaders]]. The Ilkhans launched several invasions of Syria, but were never able to gain and keep significant ground against the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], eventually being forced to give up their plans to conquer Syria, along with their stranglehold over their vassals the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian kingdom in Cilicia]]. This was in large part due to civil war in the Mongol Empire and the hostility of the khanates to the north and east. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] in [[Moghulistan]] and the [[Golden Horde]] threatened the Ilkhanate in the [[Caucasus]] and Transoxiana, preventing expansion westward.  Even under Hulagu's reign, the Ilkhanate was engaged in open warfare in the Caucasus with the Mongols in the Russian steppes. On the other hand, the China-based [[Yuan Dynasty]] was an ally of the Ikhanate and also held nominal suzerainty over the latter (the Emperor being also Great Khan) for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher P. Atwood ''Ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulagu took with him many Chinese scholars and astronomers, and the famous Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] learned about the mode of the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese calculating tables]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Howorth ''History of the Mongols'', vol.IV, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; The observatory was built on a hill of Maragheh.

The dragon clothing of Imperial China was used by the Ilkhanids, the Chinese Huangdi (Emperor) title was used by the Ilkhanids due to heavy clout upon the Mongols of the Chinese system of politics. Seals with Chinese characters were created by the Ilkhanids themselves besides the seals they received from the Yuan dynasty which contain references to a Chinese government organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Central Asiatic Journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/3725455/An_Initial_Study_for_Mongolian_Factors_inside_the_Rasulid_Hexaglot|year=2008|publisher=O. Harrassowitz|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franco-Mongol alliance==
{{main|Franco-Mongol alliance}}
The courts of [[Western Europe]] made many attempts to form an alliance with the Mongols, primarily with the Ilkhanate, in the 13th and 14th centuries, starting from around the time of the [[Seventh Crusade]] (West Europeans were collectively called Franks by Muslims and Asians in the era of the Crusades). United in their opposition to the [[Muslim]]s (primarily the Mamluks), the Ilkhanate and the Europeans were nevertheless unable to satisfactorily combine their forces against their common enemy.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam". Atwood, ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire'', p. 583, "Western Europe and the Mongol Empire"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Islam==
In the immediate period following Hulagu, the Ilkhan elite increasingly adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], in contrast to the [[Golden Horde]] and [[Chagatai Khanate]] which had already been drifting towards Islam before the Ilkhanate's conquests, leading to the khans [[Berke]] and [[Mubarak Shah (Chagatai Khan)|Mubarak Shah]], respectively. Christian powers were encouraged by what appeared to be an inclination towards [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]] by Ilkhanate rulers, but this was probably nothing more than the Mongols' traditional even-handedness towards competing religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubgBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|title=Medieval Persia 1040–1797|author=[[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilkhans were thus markedly out of step with the Muslims they ruled. [[Ghazan]], shortly before he overthrew [[Baydu]], converted to [[Islam]] under influence of [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawrūz]], and his official favoring of Islam as a state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status and again had to pay the ''[[jizya]]'' protection tax. Ghazan gave Buddhists the starker choice of conversion or expulsion and ordered their temples to be destroyed; though he later relaxed this severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubgBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|title=Medieval Persia 1040–1797|author=[[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tekuder]] was the first Ilkhanid ruler to embrace Islam. Although he didn't declare Islam as the state religion, he attempted to replace Mongol political traditions with Islamic ones, resulting in a loss of support from the army and being overthrown. Ghazan on the other hand attempted to syntheize both political thoughts. He had been assisted in the seizure of the throne by Nowruz. After his installation, he reportedly endorsed religious persecution of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and Buddhists. Nowruz was however deposed and killed in 1297. This resulted in a marked shift of Ghazan's policies, with punishment for religious intolerance and attempts to restore relations with non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gB9DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149|publisher= ABC-CLIO|title=The Mongol Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia - Volume I|author=Timothy May|year=2016|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlgRqLA0EHsC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=oljeitu+buddhists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPz4uFrKjaAhVBM48KHcpXBuUQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks: War and Diplomacy During the Reigns of Het'um II (1289-1307)|author=Angus Donal Stewart|publisher=Brill|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler, [[Ghazan]], studying the [[Qur'an]].]]

In foreign relations, the Ilkhanate's conversion to Islam had little to no effect on its hostility towards other Muslim states, and Ghazan continued to fight the Mamluks for control of Syria. The [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]], the only major victory by the Mongols over the Mamluks, ended the latter's control over Syria, though this lasted only a few months. For the most part, Ghazan's policies continued under his brother [[Öljeitü]] despite suggestions that he might begin to favor the [[Shi'a]] brand of Islam after he came under the influence of Shi'a theologians [[Al-Hilli]] and [[Maitham Al Bahrani]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali Al Oraibi, "Rationalism in the school of Bahrain: a historical perspective", in ''Shīʻite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions'' by Lynda Clarke, Global Academic Publishing 2001 p336&lt;/ref&gt;

Öljeitü who had been [[baptism|baptised]] as an infant, had flirted with Buddhism, became a [[Hanafi|Hanafi Sunni]], though there seems to have been some residual shamanism seems to have. In 1309-10, he became a Shi'ite Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlgRqLA0EHsC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=oljeitu+buddhists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPz4uFrKjaAhVBM48KHcpXBuUQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks: War and Diplomacy During the Reigns of Het'um II (1289-1307)|author=Angus Donal Stewart|publisher=Brill|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian scribe in 1304 noted the death of "benevolent and just" Ghazan, who was succeeded by Khar-Banda Öljeitü "who too, exhibits good will to everyone." A colophon from 1306 reports conversion of Mongols to Islam and "they coerce everyone into converting to their vain and false hope. They persecute, they molest, and torment," including "insulting the cross and the church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlgRqLA0EHsC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=oljeitu+buddhists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPz4uFrKjaAhVBM48KHcpXBuUQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks: War and Diplomacy During the Reigns of Het'um II (1289-1307)|author=Angus Donal Stewart|publisher=Brill|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Buddhists who survived Ghazan's assaults, made an unsuccessful attempt to bring Öljeitü back into [[Dharma]], showing they were active in the realm for more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA141|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of Mongols was initially a fairly superficial affair. The process of establishment of Islam did not happen suddenly. Öljeitü's historian Qāshāni records that [[Qutlugh-Shah]] after losing patience with a dispute between [[Hanafi]]s and [[Shafi'i]]s, expressed his view that Islam should be abandoned and Mongols should return to the ways of Genghis Khan. Qāshani also stated that Öljeitü had in fact reverted for a brief period. As Muslims, Mongols showed a marked preference for [[Sufism]] with masters like [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] often treated with respect and favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubgBCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73|title=Medieval Persia 1040–1797|author=[[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disintegration==
In the 1330s, outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] ravaged the Ilkhanate empire. The last il-khan Abu Sa'id and his sons were killed by the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Continuity and Change in Medieval Persia By Ann K. S. Lambton&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1330, the annexation of [[Abkhazia]] resulted in the reunification of the Kingdom of Georgia. However, tribute received by the Il-Khans from Georgia sank by about three-quarters between 1336 and 1350 because of wars and famines.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Lang, Georgia in the Reign of Giorgi the Brilliant (1314-1346). Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 17, No. 1 (1955), pp. 74-91&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Anatolian Beyliks]] were freed from Ilkhanate suzerenaity.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

After [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]]'s death in 1335, the Ilkhanate began to disintegrate rapidly and split up into several rival successor states, most prominently the [[Jalayirid]]s. [[Hasar]]'s descendant [[Togha Temür]], who was the last of the obscure Ilkhan pretenders, was assassinated by Sarbadars in 1353. [[Timur]] later carved a state from the Jalayirids, ostensibly to restore the old khanate. Historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] wrote a [[Jami' al-tawarikh|universal history]] of the khans around 1315 that provides much material about them. In 1357, the Golden Horde conquered the Chobanid-held Tabriz for a year, putting an end to the last hope for the return of the Ilkhanate. After the demise of the Ilkhanate, the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] lost Mongol protection against the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] and was destroyed by them in 1375.

==Legacy==
[[File:IranaftertheIlkhanate.png|thumb|Southwest Asia in 1345, ten years after the death of Abu Sa'id. The Jalayirids, Chobanids, Muzaffarids, Injuids, Sarbadars, and Kartids took the Ilkhanate's place as the major powers in Iran.]]

The emergence of the Ilkhanate had an important historical impact in the Middle Eastern region. The establishment of the unified Mongol Empire had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The communications between the Ilkhanate and the [[Yuan Dynasty]] headquartered in China encouraged this development.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory G.Guzman - Were the barbarians a negative or positive factor in ancient and medieval history?, The historian 50 (1988), 568-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T.Allsen - Culture and conquest in Mongol Eurasia, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ilkhanate also helped to pave the way for the later [[Safavid]] dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulagu's conquests had also opened Iran to Chinese influence from the east. This, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran's distinctive excellence in architecture. Under the Ilkhans, Iranian historians also moved from writing in Arabic to writing in their native Persian tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Robinson, The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran and Central Asia, Pages 19 and 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of [[double-entry accounting]] were practiced in the Ilkhanate; [[merdiban]] was then adopted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. These developments were independent from the accounting practices used in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cigdem Solas, ACCOUNTING SYSTEM PRACTICED IN THE NEAR EAST DURING THE PERIOD 1220-1350, based ON THE BOOK RISALE-I FELEKIYYE, ''The Accounting Historians Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 117-135&lt;/ref&gt; This accounting system was adopted primarily as the result of socio-economic necessities created by the agricultural and fiscal reforms of Ghazan Khan in 1295-1304.

==Ilkhan as a tribal title in 19th/20th century Iran==
The title Ilkhan resurfaced among the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] nomads of Southern Iran in the 19th century. Jan Mohammad Khan started using it from 1818/19 and this was continued by all the following Qashqai leaders. The last Ilkhan was [[Naser Khan]], who in 1954 was pushed into exile after his support of [[Mossadeq]]. When he returned during the Islamic Revolution in 1979, he could not regain his previous position and died in 1984 as the last Ilkhan of the Qashqai.

Nearly all people in [[Somalia]] are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s. For more than 1400 years, [[Islam]] made a great part of [[Somali culture|Somali society]].&lt;ref name="Sct"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; Practicing Islam reinforces distinctions that further set Somalis apart from their immediate neighbors, many of whom are either [[Christians]] or adherents of [[Traditional African religion|indigenous faiths]]. 

For generations, '''Islam in Somalia''' followed the [[Ash'ari|Ash'ariyah]] theology, [[Shafi'i|Shafi’i]] jurisprudence, and [[Sufism]], until recent decades when Salafism has made inroads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarannews.com/?p=15410 The Roots of the Islamic Conflict in Somalia (2)]| Aaran news| 28 September 2010| accessed 20 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Influence of Islamic religious leaders has varied by region, being greater in the north than among some groups in the settled regions of the south. Among nomads, the exigencies of pastoral life gave greater weight to the warrior's role, and religious leaders were expected to remain aloof from political matters.

The role of religious functionaries began to shrink in the 1950s and 1960s as some of their legal and educational powers and responsibilities were transferred to secular authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Nina J. Fitzgerald, Somalia: Issues, History, and Bibliography-page 48&lt;/ref&gt; The position of religious leaders changed substantially after the 1969 revolution and the introduction of scientific socialism. [[Siad Barre]] insisted that his version of socialism was compatible with [[Qur'an]]ic principles, and he condemned [[atheism]]. Religious leaders, however, were warned not to meddle in politics.

The new government instituted legal changes that some religious figures saw as contrary to Islamic precepts. The regime reacted sharply to criticism, executing some of the protesters. Subsequently, religious leaders seemed to accommodate themselves to the government.

===Birth of Islam and Middle Ages===
[[File:Zeila ruins.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of the Muslim [[Adal Sultanate]] in [[Zeila]].]]
[[Islam]] was introduced to the northern Somali coast early on from the [[Arabian peninsula]], shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]. [[Zeila]]'s two-[[mihrab]] [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn (Somalia)|Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest [[mosque]] in the city.&lt;ref name="Btgpb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Phillip|title=Somaliland|year=2012|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=1841623717|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=M6NI2FejIuwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 9th century, [[Al-Yaqubi]] wrote that [[Muslim]]s were living along the northern Somali seaboard.&lt;ref name="Encyamer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 25|year=1965|publisher=Americana Corporation|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP5LAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city,&lt;ref name="Encyamer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho|year=1955|publisher=International African Institute|pages=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd0mAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local [[dynasty|dynasties]], who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the littoral [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].&lt;ref name="Lewispohoa"/&gt;

In 1332, the Zeila-based King of Adal was slain in a military campaign aimed at halting the Abyssinian [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Amda Seyon I]]'s march toward the city.&lt;ref name="Houtsma"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houtsma|first=M.

Adal's headquarters were again relocated the following century, this time to [[Harar]]. From this new capital, Adal organised an effective army led by [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (Ahmad "Gurey" or "Gran") that invaded the Abyssinian empire.&lt;ref name="Lewispd"/&gt; This 16th century campaign is historically known as the [[Abyssinian–Adal war|Conquest of Abyssinia]] (''Futuh al-Habash''). During the war, Imam Ahmad pioneered the use of [[cannon]]s supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire]], which he imported through Zeila and deployed against Abyssinian forces and their [[Portugal|Portuguese]] allies led by [[Cristóvão da Gama]].&lt;ref name="Lewisapd"&gt;I.M.

During the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Age of the Ajuran]], the sultanates and republics of [[Merca]], [[Mogadishu]], [[Barawa]], [[Hobyo]] and their respective ports flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce, with ships sailing to and coming from [[Arabia]], [[India]], [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver|journal=Journal of African History|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persia]], [[Egypt]], [[Portugal]] and as far away as [[China]]. [[Vasco da Gama]], who passed by Mogadishu in the 15th century, noted that it was a large city with houses several storeys high and large palaces in its centre, in addition to many mosques with cylindrical [[minaret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

===Modern era===
{{Culture of Somalia}}
Because Muslims believe that their faith was revealed in its complete form to [[Muhammad]], it has been difficult to adapt Islam to the social, economic, and political changes that began with the expansion of colonial rule in the late 19th century. Some modifications have occurred, however. One response was to stress a return to orthodox Muslim traditions and to oppose [[Westernization]] totally. The Sufi brotherhoods were at the forefront of this movement, personified in Somalia by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] in the early 20th century. Generally, the leaders of Islamic orders opposed the spread of Western education.&lt;ref&gt;Mary-Jane Fox, Political culture in Somalia: tracing paths to peace and conflict-page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Another response was to reform Islam by reinterpreting it. From this perspective, early Islam was seen as a protest against abuse, corruption, and inequality; reformers therefore attempted to prove that Muslim scriptures contained all elements needed to deal with modernization. To this school of thought belongs [[Islamic socialism]], identified particularly with Egyptian nationalist [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]]. His ideas appealed to a number of Somalis, especially those who had studied in [[Cairo]] in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Research Division, Somalia a Country Study- Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mosislsol2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The [[Mosque of Islamic Solidarity]] in Mogadishu is the largest masjid in the Horn region.]]
The 1961 constitution guaranteed freedom of religion but also declared the newly independent republic an [[Islamic state]]. The first two post-independence governments paid lip service to the principles of Islamic socialism but made relatively few changes. The coup of October 21, 1969, installed a radical regime committed to profound change. Shortly afterward, [[Stella d'Ottobre]], the official newspaper of the Supreme Revolutionary Council ([[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|SRC]]), published an editorial about relations between Islam and socialism and the differences between scientific and Islamic socialism. Islamic socialism was said to have become a servant of [[capitalism]] and [[neocolonialism]] and a tool manipulated by a privileged, rich, and powerful class. In contrast, scientific socialism was based on the altruistic values that inspired genuine Islam. Religious leaders should therefore leave secular affairs to the new leaders who were striving for goals that conformed with Islamic principles. Soon after, the government arrested several protesting religious leaders and accused them of counterrevolutionary propaganda and of conniving with reactionary elements in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The authorities also dismissed several members of religious tribunals for corruption and incompetence.
[[File:Somwmnhjbhd3.png|thumb|left|Young Somali women wearing the [[hijab]].]]
When the Three-Year Plan, 1971–1973, was launched in January 1971, SRC leaders felt compelled to win the support of religious leaders so as to transform the existing social structure. On September 4, 1971, [[Siad Barre]] exhorted more than 100 religious teachers to participate in building a new socialist society. He criticized their method of teaching in [[Qur'an]]ic schools and charged some with using religion for personal profit.

The campaign for scientific socialism intensified in 1972. On the occasion of [[Eid al-Adha]], the major Muslim festival associated with the pilgrimage, the president defined scientific socialism as half practical work and half ideological belief. He declared that work and belief were compatible with Islam because the Qur'an condemned exploitation and money lending and urged compassion, unity, and cooperation among Muslims. But he stressed the distinction between religion as an ideological instrument for the manipulation of power and as a moral force. He condemned the antireligious attitude of [[Marxist]]s. Religion, Siad Barre said, was an integral part of the Somali worldview, but it belonged in the private sphere, whereas scientific socialism dealt with material concerns such as poverty. Religious leaders should exercise their moral influence but refrain from interfering in political or economic matters.

[[File:EIDUL FITRI IN BAIDOA Eidul Fitr in -1-9.jpg (14587452130).jpg|thumb|[[Eid al-Fitr]] prayers in [[Baidoa]], Somalia, 2014]]
In early January 1975, evoking the message of equality, justice, and social progress contained in the Qur'an, Siad Barre announced a new family law that gave women the right to inheritance on an equal basis with men. Some Somalis believe the law was proof that the SRC wanted to undermine the basic structure of Islamic society. In Mogadishu twenty-three religious leaders protested inside their mosques. They were arrested and charged with acting at the instigation of a foreign power and with violating state security; ten were executed. Sheikh Ahmed Sheikh Mohamed Walaaleeye and Sheikh Hassan Absiye Derie were among them. Most religious leaders, however, kept silent. The government continued to organize training courses for shaykhs in scientific socialism.

==General==
Religious orders always have played a significant role in Somali Islam. The rise of these orders ([[tariqah|Tarika]], "way" or "path") was connected with the development of [[Sufism]], a mystical sect within Islam that began during the 9th and 10th centuries and reached its height during the 12th and 13th. In Somalia Sufi orders appeared in towns during the 15th century and rapidly became a revitalizing force. Followers of Sufism seek a closer personal relationship to God through special spiritual disciplines. Escape from self is facilitated by poverty, seclusion, and other forms of self-denial. Members of Sufi orders are commonly called [[dervish]]es, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''daraawish'' (singular darwish, "one who gave up worldly concerns to dedicate himself to the service of [[God]] and community"). Leaders of branches or congregations of these orders are given the Arabic title ''shaykh'', a term usually reserved for those learned in Islam and rarely applied to ordinary ''wadaads'' (holy men).
[[File:Fakr Ud Din Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|13th century [[Fakr ad-Din mosque]], built by Fakr ad-Din, the first Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]].]]
Dervishes wandered from place to place teaching. They are best known for their ceremonies, called dhikr, in which states of visionary ecstasy are induced by group- chanting of religious texts and by rhythmic gestures, dancing, and deep breathing. The object is to free oneself from the body and to be lifted into the presence of God. Dervishes have been important as founders of agricultural religious communities called ''jamaat'' (singular jamaa). A few of these were home to celibate men only, but usually the jamaat were inhabited by families. Most Somalis were nominal members of Sufi orders but few underwent the rigors of devotion to the religious life, even for a short time.

The Qadiriyah, the oldest Sufi order, was founded in [[Baghdad]] by [[Abdul Qadir al-Jilani]] in 1166 and introduced to the Somali [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] in the 15th century. During the 18th century, it was spread among the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and the [[Afar people|Afar]] of Ethiopia, often under the leadership of Somali shaykhs. Its earliest known advocate in northern Somalia was Shaykh [[Abd ar Rahman az Zeilawi]], who died in 1883. At that time, Qadiriyah adherents were merchants in the ports and elsewhere. In a separate development, the Qadiriyah order also spread into the southern Somali port cities of [[Baraawe]] and Mogadishu at an uncertain date. In 1819, Shaykh [[Ibrahim Hassan Jebro]] acquired land on the [[Jubba River]] and established a religious center in the form of a farming community, the first Somali jama'ah (congregation).

Outstanding figures of the Qadiriyah in Somalia included Shaykh [[Awes Mahammad Baraawi]] (d. 1909), who spread the teaching of the Sufi order in the southern interior. He wrote much devotional poetry in Arabic and attempted to translate traditional hymns from Arabic into Somali, working out his own phonetic system. Another was Shaykh [[Abdirrahman Abdullah]] of Mogadishu, who stressed deep mysticism. Because of his reputation for sanctity, his tomb at Mogadishu became a pilgrimage center for the [[Shebelle valley]] and his writings continued to be circulated by his followers as late as  the early 1990s.
[[File:Taleh Castle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]]'s [[Dervish State|Dervish]] fort in [[Taleh]].]]
The Idrisiyah order was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Idris]] (1760–1837) of [[Mecca]]. It was brought to Somalia by Shaykh [[Ali Maye Durogba]] of [[Merca]] in Somalia, a distinguished poet who joined the order during a pilgrimage to Mecca. His supposed "visions" and "miracles" attributed to him gained him a reputation for sanctity, and his tomb became a popular destination for pilgrims. The Idrisiyah, the smallest of the three Sufi orders, has few ritual requirements beyond some simple prayers and hymns. During its ceremonies, however, participants often go into trances.

A conflict over the leadership of the Idrisiyah among its Arab founders led to the establishment of the Salihiyah in 1887 by [[Muhammad ibn Salih]]. The order spread first among the Somalis Galbeed area of Ethiopia, who entered Somalia about 1880. The Salihiyah's most active proselytizer was Shaykh [[Mahammad Guled ar Rashidi]], who became a regional leader. He settled among the [[Shidle people]] ([[Somali Bantu|Bantus]] occupying the middle reaches of the [[Shebelle River]]), where he obtained land and established a jama'ah. Later he founded another jama'ah among the [[Ajuran (clan)|Ajuran]] (a section of the Hawiye clanfamily ) and then returned to establish still another community among the Shidle before his death in 1918. Perhaps the best known Somali Salihiyah figure was [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], leader of a lengthy resistance to the [[United Kingdom|British]] until 1920.

Generally, the Salihiyah and the Idrisiyah leaders were more interested in the establishment of a jama'ah along the Shabeelle and [[Jubba river]]s and the fertile land between them than in teaching because few were learned in Islam. Their early efforts to establish farming communities resulted in cooperative cultivation and harvesting and some effective agricultural methods. In Somalia's riverine region, for example, only jama'ah members thought of stripping the brush from areas around their fields to reduce the breeding places of tsetse flies.
[[File:Shmadarahd1.png|thumb|right|[[Somali people|Somali]] Sheikh Muhammad Dahir Roble reading a Muslim sermon.]]
Local leaders of brotherhoods customarily asked lineage heads in the areas where they wished to settle for permission to build their mosques and communities. A piece of land was usually freely given; often it was an area between two clans or one in which nomads had access to a river. The presence of a jama'ah not only provided a buffer zone between two hostile groups, but also caused the giver to acquire a blessing since the land was considered given to God. Tenure was a matter of charity only, however, and sometimes became precarious in case of disagreements. No statistics were available in 1990 on the number of such settlements, but in the 1950s there were more than ninety in the south, with a total of about 35,000 members. Most were in the [[Bakool]], [[Gedo]], and Bay regions or along the middle and lower Shabele River. There were few jamaat in other regions because the climate and soil did not encourage agricultural settlements.

Membership in a brotherhood is theoretically a voluntary matter unrelated to kinship. However, lineages are often affiliated with a specific brotherhood and a man usually joins his father's order. Initiation is followed by a ceremony during which the order's dhikr is celebrated. Novices swear to accept the branch head as their spiritual guide.

Each order has its own hierarchy that is supposedly a substitute for the kin group from which the members have separated themselves. Veneration is given to previous heads of the order, known as the Chain of Blessing, rather than to ancestors. This practice is especially followed in the south, where place of residence tends to have more significance than lineage.

Because of the saint's spiritual presence at his tomb, Sufi pilgrims journey there to seek aid (such as a cure for illness or infertility). Members of the saint's order also visit the tomb, particularly on the anniversaries of his birth and death.

The traditional learning of a wadaad includes a form of folk astronomy based on stellar movements and related to seasonal changes. Its primary objective is to signal the times for migration, but it may also be used to set the dates of rituals that are specifically Somali. This folk knowledge is also used in ritual methods of healing and averting misfortune, as well as for divination.
[[File:Hafun, Somalia.jpg|thumb|right|17th century mosque in [[Hafun]].]]
Wadaddo help avert misfortune by making protective amulets and charms that transmit some of their baraka to others, or by adding the Qur'an's baraka to the amulet through a written passage. The baraka of a saint may be obtained in the form of an object that has touched or been placed near his tomb.

Although wadaddo may use their power to curse as a sanction, misfortune generally is not attributed to curses or witchcraft. Somalis have accepted the orthodox Muslim view that a man's conduct will be judged in an afterlife. However, a person who commits an antisocial act, such as [[patricide]], is thought possessed of supernatural evil powers.

Like other Muslims, Somalis believe in [[Genie|jinn]]. Certain kinds of illness, including [[tuberculosis]] and [[pneumonia]], or symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and loss of consciousness, are believed by some Somalis to result from spirit possession, namely, the Ifrit of the spirit world. The condition is treated by a shaykh, who reads portions of the Qur'an over the patient repeatedly.

[[Yibir|Yibir clan]] members are popularly held to be descendants of [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Israelites|Hebrew]] forebears. The etymology of the word "Yibir" is also believed by some to have come from the word for "Hebrew".&lt;ref&gt;Bader, Christian (2000), ''Les Yibro: Mages somali. Les juifs oubliés de la corne de l'Afrique'', Paris, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, spokespersons for the Yibir have generally not tried to make their presence known to Jewish/Israeli authorities. Despite their putative Jewish origins, the overwhelming majority of the Yibir, like the Somali population in general, adhere to Islam and know practically nothing of Judaism.&lt;ref name="Fisher2000"&gt;Fisher, Ian. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/15/world/djibouti-journal-somalia-s-hebrews-see-a-better-day.html?src=pm ''Djibouti Journal''; Somalia's 'Hebrews' See a Better Day"], '' The New York Times''. August 15th, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sioyasy"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,4860acd02,3ae6ac6660,0.html Somalia: Information on Yahhar also spelled Yibir]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===
Three Sufi orders were prominent in Somalia. In order of their introduction into the country, they were the [[Qadiriyah]], the [[Idrisiyah]], and the Salihiyah. The [[Rifaiyah]], an offshoot of the Qadiriyah, was represented mainly among Arabs resident in [[Mogadishu]].

Leaders of Sufi orders and their branches and of specific congregations are said to have ''baraka'', a state of blessedness implying an inner spiritual power that is inherent in the religious office, and may cling to the tomb of a revered leader, who, upon death, is considered a saint. However, some saints are venerated by Sufis because of their religious reputations, whether or not they were associated with an order or one of its communities. Sainthood also has been ascribed to other Sufis because of their status as founders of clans or large lineages. Northern pastoral nomads are likely to honor lineage founders as saints; sedentary Somalis revere saints for their piety and baraka.

===Salafism===
{{Islamism sidebar}}
Following the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s, Islamism appeared to be largely confined to the radical [[Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya]] group. In 1992, Colonel [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] marshalled forces to successfully expel an Islamist extremist group linked to the outfit, which had laid siege to [[Bosaso]], a prominent port city and the commercial capital of the northeastern part of the country.&lt;ref name="Prunier"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gérard Prunier | title=Somalia: Civil War, intervention and withdrawal 1990&amp;ndash;1995 (July 1995), p.6 | work=WRITENET Country Papers, UK | url=http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/somalia/country_conditions/Prunier.pdf | accessdate=1 January 2006 | format=PDF | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107144921/http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/somalia/country_conditions/Prunier.pdf | archivedate=7 January 2006 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The turn of the 21st century  saw an increasing prevalence of puritanical Sunnism, including in the form of [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salim|first1=Delmus|title=The Transnational and the Local in the Politics of Islam|date=2015|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ostebo|first1=Terje|title=Localising Salafism: Religious Change Among Oromo Muslims in Bale, Ethiopia|date=2011|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam in Vanuatu is a  minority religion. Roughly 1,000 Muslims according to online estimates &lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1313695.htm | title = Vanuatu - Island Dress | date = 2005-02-15 | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest known [[Muslims]] in Vanuatu was [[Hussein Nabanga]], who converted in 1978. Hussein Nabanga was a member of the [[Mele people]] and other Mele people (who originated from the tiny island of Imere Tenuku) were the earliest to follow. Now there are Muslims throughout many other islands in Vanuatu. Currently there is registered Islamic society looking after religious matters, [[Muhammad Sadiq Sambo]] from Mele Village is the current president of the society,The first [[mosque]] in Vanuatu was established in 1992, in [[Mele Village]] in the outskirts of [[Port Vila]]. There is also another mosque on the island of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] in Middle bush Area. There is a prayer place{{clarify|date=October 2013}} on the island of [[Erromango ]] near [[Dillons Bay]]. Most Vanuatuan Muslims are [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] but there is also an [[Ahmadiyya]] community, the Ahmadiyyas are fairly recent in the country with the first convert of [[Ni-Vanuatu]] origin converting in 2005.&lt;ref name="Melanesia"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Australian Journal of International Affairs | title=Muslims in Melanesia: putting security issues in perspective | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=62 | issue=3 | date=September 2008 | page=408-429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, it was reported that there were about 200 converts in the country and mosques are springing up in the outer islands of the archipelago.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/heeding-the-call-to-prayer-in-a-region-that-reveres-the-pig/2007/09/07/1188783496490.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1| title = Heeding the call to prayer in a region that reveres the pig | date = 8 September 2007| accessdate = 2 February 2017 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiefs are often the target of proselytising Muslims, on the often correct assumption that if they convert then their extended families, clans and other islanders are likely to follow suit.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Istinja'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salaat101.org/istinja.html istinja (salaat101.org)]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|{{large|استنجاء}}}})&lt;ref&gt;[[:ar:استنجاء|arabic wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the Arabic term for cleaning away whatever has been passed from the [[urethra]] or [[anus]] with water, [[toilet paper]], or both.

In some cases, where people live in remote, isolated, or impoverished areas with [[water scarcity]], they can use ''istijmar'' as type of ''istinja''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D8%A7%D9%90%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%8E%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8E%D8%B1%D9%8E/ lexicon almaany look num 2:اسْتَجْمَرَ الرجلُ : اسْتَنْجَى بالجِمارِ ]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mojtamai.com/book/almaktabah/book25/home/11/89-c17/37213---134 Mediator lexicon Page 134 word of ( استجمر )]&lt;/ref&gt; using a stone or any clean pieces from nature, or anything else that is pure and can clean the impurity ([[najis]]) such as tissue paper, apart from bones and dung.

The necessity is to completely remove impurity (''najasa''). This is to be done when something impure is emitted, i.e. stools or urine; but if nothing has come out apart from passing wind, then it is not obligatory to do instinja.

A Muslim must not only do istinja with [[lota (vessel)]] for prayer, istinja' with water&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/59928 Quetion and answer]&lt;/ref&gt; is obligatory every time something is discharged from the anus and urinary tract,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/4984 islamhelpline]
&lt;/ref&gt; such as urine or feces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind (fart) to perform istinja, because it is prescribed only for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.

== Ritual Purity ==
The istinja is part of Islamic hygienical jurisprudence and general ritual purity of body and soul in Islam.

The [[Quran]] says: {{cite quran|9|108|quote=...wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers.}}

'''James W. Fowler III''' (October 12, 1940 – October 16, 2015) was an American theologian who was Professor of Theology and Human Development at [[Emory University]]. He was director of both the Center for Research on Faith and Moral Development and the Center for Ethics until he retired in 2005. He was a minister in the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local-obituaries/james-w-fowler-75-theologian-author-embodied-the-f/nn7P7/&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=196}}

==Stages of Faith==
He is best known for his book ''Stages of Faith'', published in 1981, in which he sought to develop the idea of a [[Developmental psychology|developmental]] process in "human faith". {{sfn|Evans|2010|p=196}}

These [[stages of faith development]] were along the lines of [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].{{sfn|Evans|2010|pp=196-197}}

* '''Stage 0''' – ''"Primal or Undifferentiated"'' faith (birth to 2 years), is characterized by an early learning of the safety of their environment (i.e. warm, safe and secure vs. hurt, neglect and abuse). If consistent nurture is experienced, one will develop a sense of trust and safety about the universe and the divine. Conversely, negative experiences will cause one to develop distrust with the universe and the divine. Transition to the next stage begins with integration of thought and language which facilitates the use of symbols in speech and play.
* '''Stage 1''' – ''"Intuitive-Projective"'' faith (ages of three to seven), is characterized by the psyche's unprotected exposure to the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]], and marked by a relative fluidity of thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Joann Wolski Conn (ed.), Women’s Spirituality: Resources for Christian Development. (Paulist, 1986), pp. 226-232&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is learned mainly through experiences, stories, images, and the people that one comes in contact with.
* '''Stage 2''' – ''"Mythic-Literal"'' faith (mostly in school children), stage two persons have a strong belief in the [[justice]] and reciprocity of the universe, and their [[deity|deities]] are almost always [[anthropomorphic]]. During this time metaphors and symbolic language are often misunderstood and are taken literally.
* '''Stage 3''' – ''"Synthetic-Conventional"'' faith (arising in adolescence; aged 12 to adulthood) characterized by [[conformity]] to authority and the religious development of a personal identity. Any conflicts with one's beliefs are ignored at this stage due to the fear of threat from inconsistencies.
* '''Stage 4''' – ''"Individuative-Reflective"'' faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties) a stage of [[angst]] and struggle. The individual takes personal responsibility for his or her [[belief]]s and [[feeling]]s. As one is able to reflect on one's own beliefs, there is an openness to a new complexity of faith, but this also increases the awareness of conflicts in one's belief.
* '''Stage 5''' – ''"Conjunctive"'' faith (mid-life crisis) acknowledges paradox and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] relating reality behind the symbols of inherited systems. The individual resolves conflicts from previous stages by a complex understanding of a multidimensional, interdependent "truth" that cannot be explained by any particular statement.
* '''Stage 6''' – ''"Universalizing"'' faith, or what some might call "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]". The individual would treat any person with compassion as he or she views people as from a universal community, and should be treated with universal principles of love and justice.

==Empirical research==
Fowler's model has inspired a considerable body of empirical research into faith development, although little of such research has been conducted by Fowler himself.  A useful tool here has been Gary Leak's Faith Development Scale, or FDS, which has been subject to [[factor analysis]] by Leak (Leak, 2008).

He grew up in the [[Llandysul]] area, and attended the local Board School and County School, before gaining a place at the University College of Wales, [[Aberystwyth]], from where he graduated in 1902, with a B.A. (Hons.) in Semitic Languages. In 1902 he began studies at Manchester College, [[Oxford]], and in 1904 was awarded the Russell Martineau [[Hebrew]] prize, followed by the (university) Hall-Houghton [[Syriac language|Syriac]] prize in 1905. He subsequently commenced studies at [[Harvard]] University, from where he graduated in 1907. In 1908 he took up the position of Unitarian minister of [[Pontypridd]], relocating in 1913 to take charge of the Old [[Presbyterian]] Chapel, [[Nantwich]], and to Gateacre Chapel, [[Liverpool]], in 1924.

In 1926 he was appointed Principal of the [[Presbyterian]] College, [[Carmarthen]], and minister of Parc-y-Felfed Chapel.

He died in May 1937, and was buried at Capel Pant-y-Defaid, [[Ceredigion]].

[[File:Ein sof.png|thumb|170px|right|Kabbalistic scheme of [[Five Worlds|spiritual worlds]], also implying descent of revealed wisdom and ascent of human wisdom, multiple layers of deeper meaning capable of being uncovered, and the ultimate unity of all disciplines]]
The concepts and structures of Jewish [[Kabbalah]] have been used by a small number of followers in the contemporary world to open systematic comparative dialogue, and cross-fertilization, with the modern secular disciplines of the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]]. This has been an uncommon phenomenon, since it requires wide internal understanding of both traditionalist Kabbalah and modern secular thought, and for social reasons Jewish modernity has seen isolation and entrenchment between the two. Among the first to express unity was [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1865–1935), innovative mystical thinker and first Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. However, his consideration was intuitive, and a component of his wider theological approach. In the contemporary world, systematic investigations in the issue have been carried out through the different approaches of [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]] (traditionalist-Sciences) and Sanford Drob (universalist-Humanities). The recent flourishing of historian [[List of Jewish mysticism scholars|Jewish mysticism studies in academia]], while not a part of the issue, has opened up and offered new perspectives on Kabbalah for wide dissemination, influencing the [[Neo-Hasidism|Neo-Kabbalistic]]-universalist approach of Drob, as well as bridging the former schism between [[Jewish denominations|Non-Orthodox Judaism]] and Kabbalah.

==Kabbalistic views==
{{Kabbalah}}

===Harmonisation or opposition===
Traditionalist [[Kabbalah]] and its development in [[Hasidic Judaism]] generally took negative views of secular wisdoms. While some historical Kabbalists were learned in the canon of medieval [[Jewish philosophy]], and occasionally some later mathematics and sciences, its relationship to medieval Jewish philosophy (built on medieval science and cosmology) was ambiguous. Kabbalistic dissemination began in the 12th century in order to stem the rationalist influence of [[Maimonides]], in the context of the controversies in Jewish society that arose over his teachings. While the Kabbalistic dictum that they "stood on the shoulders of the philosophers" expressed their claim to superior knowledge, it also indicated that they systemised their doctrines in the context of the profound questions of philosophy, offering a mythological answer to the philosophical questions.

Subsequent Kabbalistic views on secular studies were shaped by both mystical-theological views and Jewish social context:

{{quote|"Occupying oneself with the sciences of the nations of the world is… included in the category of engaging in inconsequential matters insofar as the sin of neglecting the Torah is concerned… Moreover, the impurity of science is greater than the impurity of idle speech… Thus this is forbidden unless one employs [this knowledge] as a useful instrument, viz., as a means of [earning a livelihood] with which to be able to serve God… or unless he knows how to apply them in the service of God or to his better understanding of His Torah [i.e., in the manner of] Maimonides and Nachmanides…"|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], ''[[Tanya]]'': ''Likutei Amarim, 8''&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=7887 |title=Chapter 8 - Likutei Amarim |publisher=chabad.org|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Khnumhotep II''' (''ẖnmw-ḥtp, "[[Khnum]] is pleased"'') was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian ''[[nomarch|Great Chief]] of the [[Oryx nome]]'' (the 16th nome of [[Upper Egypt]]) during the reign of pharaohs [[Amenemhat II]] and [[Senusret II]] of the [[12th Dynasty]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (20th century BCE). He is well known for his tomb at [[Beni Hasan]] and its decorations.

==Biography and family==
{{hiero|Khnumhotep|&lt;hiero&gt;E10-W9-Htp:t*p&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=mk}}
He was a member of a powerful family of [[nomarchs]] and officials which was likely founded by his grandfather [[Khnumhotep I]] and housed in [[Men'at Khufu]]. Khnumhotep II held many titles such as ''hereditary prince and count, foremost of actions, royal sealer, sole friend, member of the elite, overlord of [[Nekheb]]'', and also ''overseer of the [[Eastern Desert]]'', a position which he held from Year 19 of Amenemhat II until at least Year 6 of Senusret II i.e. the date which appears in Khnumhotep's tomb. Like most nomarchs of the time he also held some priestly charges.&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, pp.&amp;nbsp;110-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;1; 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

His predecessor as nomarch was probably his relative [[Netjernakht]], and Khnumhotep honored him by building his tomb. His mother was Baqet while his father was an official named Neheri. Khnumhotep had two wives, the main of them was Khety, herself a daughter of the unnamed nomarch of the neighbouring 17th nome with [[Cynopolis|Hardai]] as capital. Like her husband, Khety held a remarkable number of titles such as ''daughter of a governor, king's acquaintance, foremost of actions, lady of the house'', and was also a priestess of [[Hathor]] and [[Pakhet]]. Khnumhotep's secondary wife was Tjat who held few, modest titles such as ''sealer, lady of the house'' and ''one who knows her lord''; she is the only known female sealer at the court of a local governor. Those peculiarities and the fact that both consorts appears several times in Khnumhotep's tomb suggests that the one between him and Khety was likely a [[Marriage of state|politically arranged marriage]] while Tjat could have been his true love who was appointed ''sealer'' by him in order to have her closer.&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, pp.&amp;nbsp;136-38; 160-61&lt;/ref&gt;

From his two consorts, Khnumhotep II had several children:&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, pp.&amp;nbsp;136-38&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nakht inherited his maternal grandfather's charge of nomarch at Hardai
*Khnumhotep IV, followed his father as nomarch of the 16th nome, but does not appear in his father's tomb and is only known by his unfinished tomb at Beni Hasan
*[[Khnumhotep III]] entered to the royal court where he managed to become ''[[high steward (Ancient Egypt)|high steward]]'' and later ''[[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]]''
*Neheri was buried in a small tomb at Beni Hasan where a stela of him was found
*another son is known for being a "[[Haty-a|mayor]]" in a contiguous nome.

==The tomb BH3==
[[File:BeniHasanKhnumhotep.jpg|thumb|220px|Exterior of the Tomb BH3]]
Khnumhotep II is buried in Beni Hasan in the rock-cut Tomb 3 (BH3), one of the most notable of the whole necropolis. In ancient times, the tomb would have been approached via a path that was distinguishable by dark brown boulders on either side; the path extended from the open outer court down the hill to the edge of the cultivated land.&lt;ref name=Newberry52&gt;Newberry, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb is fronted by a columned [[portico]] and a small courtyard; the courtyard would have been surrounded by mud-brick walls. The small columned portico is on the west side of the courtyard, directly in front of the tomb entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling of the portico is curved similar to the shape of a segmented barrel. The rock around the doorway leading inside the tomb to the chapel was smoothed and flattened, on which a fourteen line inscription is giving the list of the festal days for the services of funeral offerings, called ''percheru'', along with the name and titles of Khnumhotep II.&lt;ref name=Newberry53&gt;Newberry, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; The floor of the main chamber (also referred to as the chapel) is sunk into the ground below the level of the open outer court and is descended into by three steps.&lt;ref name=Newberry53/&gt; The chapel is the main chamber cut straight back into the cliff almost symmetrical with 4 columns and two large shafts (that lead to burial chambers) are cut into the floor. These four main columns support a ceiling that is divided by three segmented barrel shapes.&lt;ref&gt;An illustration of this by [[George Willoughby Fraser]] is available in Newberry’s book.&lt;/ref&gt; These vaults are painted in a pattern that may be referencing a tent.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;33&lt;/ref&gt; The only light for this chamber would have come from the doorway to the portico and originally a door, between the portico and the chamber, could have been used to close the tomb to the outdoor elements.&lt;ref name=Newberry52/&gt; [[Percy Newberry]] notes that the only remain from the inward swinging door is the pivot-hole. On the doorjambs are prayers to [[Osiris]] and [[Anubis]] above a seated Khnumhotep II who is facing inward.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; At the back of this main room (east wall) is a small rectangular shine approached by a step about {{convert|13|cm|in}} high. Newberry mentions that from his survey of the tomb there was a statue here of a seated Khnumhotep II, but the entire statue had been cut away and only a portion of the seat remains.&lt;ref name=Newberry53/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On the wall are also depicted Khnumhotep's most notable officials and employees at his local court, which somewhat resemble a downscaled version of the royal court with a local [[Treasurer (Ancient Egypt)|treasurer]] and many stewards and overseers.&lt;ref&gt;Grajetzki, p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;/ref&gt;

In the main chamber there is an [[autobiography]] of the deceased; it begins to the left of the entrance to the shrine and runs counterclockwise around the walls of the main chamber, ending to the right of the doorway leading to the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; The main types of information included are about the actions Khnumhotep II performed during his lifetime, his family and their lives, as well as the close relationship of his family to the royal house, Khnumhotep’s excellent character, and his request to visitors that offerings are made to him.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ibscha.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Drawing of the famous depiction of the Aamu group]]
On the west wall of the chamber are scenes showing mainly the preparations for the funeral and the resurrection of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt; This is exemplified by the boat voyages making a connection between Khnumhotep II and the god Osiris. The orientation of the boats within the tomb literally has them travel south to [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (right of the entrance) and north to return (left of the entrance).&lt;ref&gt;Illustration from Newberry&lt;/ref&gt; The wall collectively ensures the tomb owner of rebirth in the afterlife where he will be sustained through cult activities.

On the eastern end of the north wall there is a large-scale standing figure of Khnumhotep II receiving offerings primarily of several types of animals and birds. What makes this tomb stand out among the 39 large rock-cut tombs at Beni Hasan is the well known scene of the ''Aamu'' group, Asiatic nomadic traders who are sometimes considered [[Hyksos]] or at least their forerunners; the group, led by a man called Absha (or Abisha, Abishai), was bringing offerings to the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, ''An Introduction To The Archaeology Of Ancient Egypt''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Blackwell Ltd, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;190&lt;/ref&gt;

The west end of the wall has another large-scale figure of Khnumhotep II only here he is facing right and using a bow to hunt in the desert which is on the edge of the Egyptian world, the boundary between order (''[[maat]]'') and chaos. It has been interpreted that in this scene Khnumhotep II is assuming the role of the king dominating over the chaotic power of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beni-Hassan-KhnoumhotepII2.jpg|thumb|220px|Many of Khnumhotep's relatives. The sitting woman in the top-middle is his wife Khety]]
The east wall houses the entrance to the shrine, as well as two large depictions of Khnumhotep II hunting in the marshes, one on the north side and the other on the south side. To the south he is [[harpoon]]ing two fishes and to the north he is fowling with a [[throwing stick]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;105&lt;/ref&gt; These hunting in the marshes scenes help protect the deceased in the afterlife as well as guarantee his rebirth through connotations of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath him, north of the door, there are pictures of several people fishing and beneath him on the south side are representations of fighting boatmen. Collectively this wall represents the perpetual renewal of Khnumhotep II.

The fourth wall of this tomb, south wall, was dedicated to the celebration of the cult meal of Khnumhotep II and his wife Khety.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt; The east end of the wall  features the deceased seated in front of an offering table covered with offerings holding a [[flail]], traditionally seen as a symbol of royalty or divinity, in his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;123&lt;/ref&gt; At the west end of the wall there is an illustration of Khety sitting in front of a full offering table. She is facing left and participating in her husband’s meal presented by his cult.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;125&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine portrays a smaller version of the offering cult and in many ways can be seen as an expansion from the [[false door]] of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], where a statue inside a niche could have been integrated.&lt;ref&gt;Kamrin, p.&amp;nbsp;137&lt;/ref&gt; The placing of statues in the chapel itself is a new funerary art style that appeared in the Middle Kingdom tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robins, ''The Art Of Ancient Egypt''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life of Guru Nanak through Pictures''''' is a book by [[Shamsher Singh (writer)|Shamsher Singh]], M.A., and [[Narendra Singh Virdi]], M.A., containing a collection of forty-four [[janamsakhi]]s relating events in the life of [[Guru Nanak]]. Each janamasakhi is illustrated with a full-color painting by the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[artist]] [[Phulan Rani]].

Published by the Modern Sahit Academy, [[Amritsar]], in 1969, ''"In commemoration of [[Quincentennial|Quincentenary]] Celebrations of Guru Nanak"'', it is one of the few English books about the life of Guru Nanak, and the only known fully illustrated version. The book is [[out of print]] and not widely available.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The book includes many of the well-known janamsakhis (the story of the sacred-thread ceremony, the festival at Hardawar, his visit to [[Mecca]], etc.) as well as several of the lesser known. Inside the front cover is a map of the travels of Guru Nanak drawn from the places mentioned in the various janamsakhis, including those not mentioned in the book.

In 1970, the book was awarded "Sardar Mohan Singh Book Award" by the then President of India [[V. V. Giri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art &amp; Life of Phulan Rani|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060831/aplus.htm#2|accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=31 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[murder]] of human beings for their body parts is a [[crime]] in all countries. Such practices have been confirmed or suspected to occur within a handful of contexts.

Medicine murder (not to be confused with "medical murder" due to [[medical negligence]]) means the killing of a human being in order to excise body parts to use as medicine or for [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] purposes in [[witchcraft]]. Medicine murder is not viewed as a form of [[human sacrifice]] in a religious sense, because the motivation is not the death of a human or the effecting of magical changes through the death of a human being, but the obtaining of an item or items from their [[corpse]] to be used in [[traditional medicine]]. Its practice in the format described below occurs primarily in sub-equatorial [[Africa]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Medicine murder in [[southern Africa]] has been documented in some small detail in [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]], although it is a difficult subject to investigate because of its controversial standing in customary practices and laws. Very few research and discussion documents have been devoted to this subject. Three concerning Lesotho were published in 1951, 2000 and 2005 regarding the same events in the 1940s and 1950s; one concerning Swaziland was published in 1993 covering the 1970s and 1980s; and a commission of enquiry held in South Africa in 1995 covering medicine murder and witchcraft in the 1980s and 1990s.

The [[illegal organ trade]] has at times led to murder for body parts, because of a worldwide demand of [[organ transplant|organs for transplant]] and [[organ donor]]s. At times, [[criminal organization]]s have engaged in [[kidnap]]ping people, especially children and teens, with the victims being killed and their organs harvested for the illegal organ trade.&lt;ref name="mexico.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2014/03/17/la-policia-detiene-a-manuel-plancarte-sobrino-de-un-lider-templario|title=La policía detiene a Manuel Plancarte, sobrino de un líder 'templario'|date=17 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2583135/Cartel-member-accused-kidnapping-children-harvest-organs-captured-Mexico.html|title=Knights Templar cartel member accused of kidnapping children is captured - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent is unknown, and non-fatal organ theft and removal is more widely reported than murder.

In 2006, [[China]] was [[Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|reported to be using]] its extensive pool of [[Falun Gong]] [[political prisoner]]s as a supply for body parts to be used in transplants. The allegations and supporting testimony were raised in several countries and seen as deeply disturbing. Reports&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;&lt;ref name=BE/&gt;&lt;ref name=SO/&gt;&lt;ref name=TS/&gt; and testimony found that such prisoners were routinely assessed for transplants and apparent [[tissue typing]], in a manner with no relevance to ordinary patient wellbeing, and that many were subsequently executed to meet demand for matching organs. Data on availability and speed of transplants within China (under 2 – 3 weeks in some cases compared to years elsewhere) led several renowned doctors to state that the statistics and transplant rates seen would be impossible without access to a very large pool of pre-existing donors already available on very short notice for hearts and other organs; several governments also established restrictions intended to target such a practice.&lt;ref name=Efforts&gt;David Kilgour [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/4257-international-efforts-to-stop-forced-organ-harvesting-from-falun-gong-in-china International Efforts to Stop Forced Organ Harvesting From Falun Gong in China] Epoch Times 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; China denied such practices.

Historically, [[anatomy murder]]s took place during the earlier parts of modern Western medicine. In the 19th century, the human body was still poorly understood, but fresh [[cadaver]]s for [[dissection]] and anatomical study were sometimes difficult to obtain. Mortuaries remained the most common source, but in some cases, such as the notorious [[Irish people|Irish]] murderers [[Burke and Hare]], victims were killed instead and the killers then sold the bodies for study. The practice has intermittently been reported since that time; in 1992 [[Colombia]]n [[activist]] Juan Pablo Ordoñez, claimed that 14 poor residents of the town of [[Barranquilla]] had been killed for local medical study&lt;ref&gt;Mary Roach (2003).

==Medicine murder==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2015}}

===Purpose and frequency===
The objective of medicine murder is to create traditional medicine based partly on human flesh. Medicine murder is often termed [[ritual murder]] or [[Muti|muthi / muti murder]], although there is evidence to suggest that the degree of [[ritual]] involved in the making of medicine is only a small element of the practice overall. Social anthropological ethnographies have documented anecdotes of medicine murder in southern Africa since the 1800s, and research has shown that incidences of medicine murder increase in times of political and economic stress.

The practice is commonly associated with [[witchcraft]], although ethnographic evidence suggests that this has not always been the case, and that it may have been accorded local-level political sanction. Medicine murder is difficult to describe concisely, as it has changed over time, involving an ever-greater variety of perpetrator, victim, method and motive. Most detailed information about the minutiae of medicine murder is derived from state witnesses in trials, court records and third-party anecdote.

The phenomenon is widely acknowledged to occur in southern Africa, although no country has issued an accurate and up to date record of the frequency with which it takes place. This is not only because of the secrecy of the practice, given its controversial status, but also because of difficulties in classifying subcategories of murder. Medicine murder has been a topic of urban legends in South Africa, but this does not diminish its status as a practice that has resulted in legal trials and convictions of perpetrators.

===Methodology===
The perpetrators are usually men, although women have been convicted as well, most notably in [[Swaziland]] when Phillippa Mdluli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=695&amp;series_number=13 |title=July 2nd Philippa Mdluli – Swaziland 2/7/1983 |work=truecrimelibrary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005195740/http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=695&amp;series_number=13 |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.times.co.sz/News/27315.html |title=Special judge to oversee hanging |work=times.co.sz |year=2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040800/http://www.times.co.sz/News/27315.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was hanged in 1983 for commissioning a medicine murder. Perpetrators vary widely in age and social status.

An individual or group of individuals commissions a traditional healer or ''[[inyanga]] / nanga '' (a herbalist skilled in traditional medicine) to assist them by concocting medicine (or muti). The medicine supposedly strengthens the 'personality' or personal force of the person who commissions the medicine. This increased personal force enables the person to excel in business, politics, or other sphere of influence. A human victim is identified for murder in order to create the medicine.

Victims vary widely in age and social standing. They are often young children or elderly people, and are both male and female. In some instances, the victim is identified and 'purchased' via a transaction involving an often nominal amount of money. The victim is then abducted, often at night, and taken to an isolated place, often in the open countryside if the murder is being committed in a rural area. It is usually intended that the victim be mutilated while conscious, so that the medicine can be made more potent through the noises of the victim in agony. Mutilation does not take place in order to kill the victim, but it is expected that the victim will die of the wounds.

Body parts excised mostly include soft tissue&amp;nbsp;– eyelids, lips, [[Scrotum|scrota]], [[Labium (genitalia)|labia]]&amp;nbsp;– although there have been instances where entire limbs have been severed. These body parts are removed to be mixed with medicinal plants to create a medicine through a cooking process. The resulting medicine is sometimes consumed, but is often made into a paste that is carried on the person of the perpetrator or rubbed onto scarifications.

=== Variances ===
Since the 1970s, the manner in which medicine murder is practiced has become altered to the methods described above, although the continued practice of medicine murder demonstrates that belief in human flesh as a powerful medicinal component remains strong in some communities.   It would appear that medicine murder in the 18th and 19th centuries may have been considered the legitimate domain of traditional chiefs and leaders, in order to improve agriculture and protect against war (see [[Human sacrifice]]).

Following industrialisation and growth of commerce, the range of purposes for which medicine was used to increase influence expanded significantly. In the early 1990s when [[South Africa]] was experiencing internal political strife between several political groupings, it became clear that some mutilations for medicine were opportunistic and incidental to the assassination of political opponents. There have also been occurrences of mutilation of corpses in medical facilities. In not all cases does the employment of a traditional healer seem to have been thought necessary to the process.

===Notable cases===

==== 1994 Segametsi Mogomotsi case====
In 1994, a 14-year-old named [[Murder of Segametsi Mogomotsi|Segametsi Mogomotsi]] was murdered in [[Mochudi]], [[Botswana]] and body parts removed. The killing was widely believed to have been for muti, and the police even recovered some excised organs. However, these were destroyed before being tested to establish them as human, leading to accusations of police complicity with the murder. The killing led to riots as students in Mochudi protested about police inaction, and eventually [[Scotland Yard]] from [[UK|Britain]] were asked to investigate, as neutral outsiders. Their report was given to the Botswana government, which did not release it to the public. These events inspired some of the events in the book ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' by [[Alexander McCall Smith]].

====2001 Thames torso case====
{{main|Adam (murder victim)}}
A little boy whose headless and limbless body was found floating in the [[Thames]] in 2001 was identified by an arrestee in March 2011.
The five-year-old’s identity has remained a mystery after he was smuggled into Britain and murdered in a voodoo-style ritual killing.
He was drugged with a ‘black-magic’ potion and sacrificed before being thrown into the Thames, where his torso washed up next to the Globe Theatre in September 2001.
Detectives used pioneering scientific techniques to trace radioactive isotopes in his bones to his native [[Nigeria]].
They even enlisted Nelson Mandela to appeal for information about the murder.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2002-04-19/world/mandela.muti_1_muti-body-parts-victims?_s=PM:WORLD CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

They struggled to formally identify the boy, whom they called Adam, despite travelling to the West African state to try to trace his family.
Nigerian Joyce Osiagede, the only person to be arrested in Britain as part of the inquiry, has claimed that the victim's real name is Ikpomwosa.
In an interview with ITV’s ''London Tonight'', Mrs Osiagede said she looked after the boy in Germany for a year before travelling to Britain without him in 2001.
She claimed she handed the boy over to a man known as Bawa who later told her that he was dead and threatened to kill her unless she kept silent.

Police have passed numerous files on the case to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] but it has never gone to court.
A second suspect, a Nigerian man, was arrested in Dublin in 2003 but was never charged.
Mrs Osiagede was first questioned by police after they found clothing similar to that worn by ‘Adam’ in her Glasgow tower-block flat in 2002.
The only clothing on his body was a pair of orange shorts, exclusively sold in Woolworths in Germany and Austria.
Dressed in a traditional gold and green dress, Mrs Osiagede denied any involvement with the death of the young boy.

Asked who killed him, she said a ‘group of people’.
She added: "They used him for a ritual in the water."
Claiming the boy was six years old, she said: ‘He was a lively boy. A very nice boy, he was also intelligent.’
Detailed analysis of a substance in the boy’s stomach was identified as a ‘black magic’ potion.
It included tiny clay pellets containing small particles of pure gold, an indication that Adam was the victim of a [[Muti]] ritual killing in which it is believed that the body parts of children are sacred. Bodies are often disposed of in flowing water.

==== 2009 Masego Kgomo case ====
[[Murder of Masego Kgomo|Masego Kgomo]] was a 10-year-old South African girl whose body parts were removed and sold to a [[sangoma]] in [[Soshanguve]], [[South Africa]]. The little girl's body was found in bushes near the Mabopane railway station, north-west of [[Pretoria]]. Thirty-year-old Brian Mangwale was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life sentence for muti killer|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Life-sentence-for-muti-killer-20111128-4|accessdate=8 June 2014|newspaper=News24|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illegal organ trade murders (the 'Red trade')==
{{main|Illegal organ trade}}

According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions.&lt;ref name="Jafar" /&gt; The illegal organ trade is growing, and a recent report by [[Global Financial Integrity]] estimates that globally it generates profits between $0.6 billion and $1.2 billion per year

In some cases, criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping of people, especially children and teens, who are [[murder]]ed and their [[organ harvesting|organs harvested]] for profit.&lt;ref name="mexico.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; In 2014 an alleged member of the Mexican Knights Templar cartel was arrested for the kidnapping and deaths of minors, after children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/03/mexico-cartel-member-held-organ-theft-case-201431821815141191.html|title=Mexico cartel member held in organ theft case|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/17/cartel-mexico-organ-trafficking/6548691/|title=Police nab cartel member in organ trafficking case|author=AP|date=17 March 2014|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] on the state of the international organ trade,{{when|date=August 2014}} 66,000 kidney transplants, 21,000 liver transplants, and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005,&lt;ref name="Shimazono"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shimazono |first=Yosuke |title=The State of the International Organ Trade: A Provisional Picture Based on Integration of Available Information |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=85 |issue=12 |year=2007 |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862007001200017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article reports that 2008 the median waiting time for the U.S. transplant list in 2008 was greater than 3 years and expected to rise, while the [[United Kingdom]] reported a lack of organs for 8000 patients, with the rate increasing at 8%.&lt;ref name="Jafar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jafar |first=Tazeen H. |title=Organ Trafficking: Global Solutions for a Global Problem |journal=[[American Journal of Kidney Diseases]] |volume=54 |issue=6 |year=2009 |doi=10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.08.014 |pmid= |pages=1145–1157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that about 10% of all transplants occur illegally, with the [[Internet]] acting as a facilitator. [[Transplant tourism]] raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction, depleting the regions where organs are bought. This transfer typically occurs from South to North, developing to developed nations, females to males, and from people of color to whites, a trend that experts say "has exacerbated old...divisions".&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheper-Hughes |first=Nancy |title=The Last Commodity: Post-Human Ethics, Global (In)Justice, and the Traffic in Organs |location=Penang |publisher=Multiversity &amp; Citizens International |year=2008 |isbn=9789833302093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some organs such as the [[kidney]] can be transplanted routinely and the single remaining kidney is adequate for normal human needs, other organs are less easy to source. Liver transplants in particular are prominent, but incur an excruciating recovery that deters donations.{{Clarify|reason=what is the relevance to this section?|date=October 2015}}

Most countries have laws which criminalize the buying and selling of organs, or the carrying out of medical procedures for the illegal organ trade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Capital punishment and organ harvesting in China ==
{{see also|Kilgour–Matas report|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}
In March 2006, three individuals alleged that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed at [[Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital]], to supply China's organ transplant industry.&lt;ref name=SCCC&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-10/39083.html "Secret Chinese Concentration Camp Revealed"] 10 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NW&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-17/39405.html "New Witness Confirms Existence of Chinese Concentration Camp, Says Organs Removed from Live Victims"] 17 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=36cc&gt;[http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-3-31/39910.html "Source Reveals Other Chinese Concentration Camps, Sujiatun is merely one of 36 concentration camps for Falun Gong in China"] 31 March 2006 The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt; The third person, a doctor, said the so-called hospitals in Sujiatun are but one of 36 similar concentration camps all over China.&lt;ref name=36cc/&gt;

The allegations were the subject of investigative reports by [[Edward McMillan-Scott]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward McMillan-Scott (7 July 2006) [http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-7-7/43653.html EP Vice-President's Investigative Report on Organ Harvesting in China] The Epoch Times&lt;/ref&gt; Vice-President of the European Parliament, and by former Canadian Secretary of State [[David Kilgour]] and human rights lawyer [[David Matas]].&lt;ref name=orgharv/&gt;

The report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. A significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponded with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. The report includes incriminating material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs.&lt;ref name=orgharv&gt;[[David Kilgour]], [[David Matas]] (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007)  [http://organharvestinvestigation.net An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China] (free in 22 languages)  organharvestinvestigation.net)&lt;/ref&gt; An updated version of their report was published as a book in 2009.&lt;ref name=BHbook&gt;{{cite news|author=David Kilgour, David Matas|title=Bloody Harvest, The killing of Falun Gong for their organs|url=http://www.seraphimeditions.com/bloody-harvest.html|pages=232|publisher=seraphimeditions.com|date=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403113123/http://www.seraphimeditions.com/bloody-harvest.html|archivedate=2010-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese accused of vast trade in organs|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/apr/27/chinese-accused-of-vast-trade-in-organs/print/|newspaper=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of evidence still led to many responses expressing "deep concerns" at the findings, and several countries took action as a result of the concerns and findings.&lt;ref name=Efforts/&gt;

== Murder for dissection and study==
{{main|Anatomy murder}}
An anatomy murder (sometimes called '''burking''' in [[British English]]) is a murder committed in order for all or part of the cadaver to be used for medical research or teaching.  It is not a [[medicine murder]] because the body parts are not believed to have any medicinal use in themselves. The motive for the murder is created by the demand for cadavers for dissection, and the opportunity to learn anatomy and physiology as a result of the dissection.  Rumors concerning the prevalence of anatomy murders are associated with the rise in demand for cadavers in research and teaching produced by the [[Scientific Revolution]].  During the nineteenth century, the sensational [[serial murders]] associated with [[Burke and Hare]] and the [[London Burkers]] led to legislation which provided scientists and medical schools with legal ways of obtaining cadavers.  Rumors persist that anatomy murders are carried out wherever there is a high demand for cadavers.  These rumors are hard to substantiate, and may reflect continued, deep-held fears of the use of cadavers as commodities.

The '''National Rally for Reform and Development''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''RNRD'''; {{lang-ar|التجمع الوطني للإصلاح و التنمية}}), often known by its shortened Arabic name  '''Tewassoul''', is an Islamist [[political party]] in [[Mauritania]]. The party put forward their leader, [[Mohamed Jemil Ould Mansour]], as their candidate for the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|2009 Mauritanian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hC-a7y9_LgRSRDv7eHEnJlE15hKA&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pindaya Caves''' ({{lang-my|ပင်းတယရွှေဥမင်}}, {{IPA-my|pɪ́ɴdəja̰ ʃwè ṵmɪ̀ɴ|pron}}; officially {{my|ပင်းတယရွှေဥမင်သဘာဝလိုဏ်ဂူဘုရား}}), located next to the town of [[Pindaya]], [[Shan State]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar) are a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] pilgrimage site and a tourist attraction located on a limestone ridge in the [[Myelat]] region.  There are three caves on the ridge which runs north-south, but only the southern cave can be entered and explored. It is not known whether the other two penetrate for any extended distance into the hillside.

==Interior==
[[Image:Pindaya Caves interior.jpg|thumb|One of the caverns in the interior]]
[[Image:Pindaya Caves 2010.JPG|left|thumb|400px|Inside the Pindaya Caves]]
The southernmost Pindaya cave can be entered and extends for about 490 feet along a well-worn path. It is known for its interior which contains over 8,000 images of Buddha. Some of the older statues and images in the cave have inscriptions dating to the late 18th century, or early [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung period]], and the earliest one dates from 1773. There may be some images without inscriptions that are older, but based on the style elements, [[Than Tun]] believes that none of them is older than the early 18th century and even suggests 1750 as the earliest possible date. Although most statues are of late 18th and early 19th century, many other statues and images have been placed there on an ongoing basis by different donors throughout the cave's history up until the present time, from lay people to the ruling authorities. The collection as a whole forms an impressive display of Buddhist [[iconography]] and art from early Konbaung era to the modern period. No other place in Burma displays such a range of style, not only in the images, but also in the ornamental thrones and [[reredos]] which surround the images.

Within the cave, there are about seventy unique images of the Bhisakkaguru tradition dating to the late 18th century.  They are unique in that the styling of hair, eyes, nose, ears, robe are different from most other images from Burma.  The salient feature of this type of image is the holding of a seed in the upturned right palm.  Than Tun reports that such images are found nowhere else in Burma, and based on Buddhist iconography, that these images are from the [[Mahayana]] tradition, and the conjecture is that the Pindaya cave at one time served the Mahayana Bhisakkaguru cult.

==Access==
[[Image:Covered stairway, Pindaya Caves.jpg|thumb|left|''Hsaungdan'' (covered stairway) to the caves]]
[[Image:Buddha images, Pindaya Caves.jpg|thumb|Buddha images to the right on entering the caves]]
There is a 15-m (49&amp;nbsp;ft) pagoda named Shwe U Min (Golden Cave) Pagoda  at the entrance to the southernmost cave.  Local legend attributes this pagoda as being built by King [[Asoka]] and repaired by King [[Alaungsithu]] in the 12th century, but this is not corroborated by any other historical source.   In its present form and style, it is immediately apparent that the pagoda is of recent origin.  

There is a large bronze bell at the southern entrance.   The barely readable inscription on the bell states it as being cast in 1842 with a weight of 400 viss (654&amp;nbsp;kg). 

The modern day entrance dates from 1925 when the entrance to the cave was enlarged by explosives, destroying some valuable images and [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s in the process.  A steel structure was erected to accommodate the many pilgrims.  Dedication inscriptions from this renovation indicate a wide  range of donors, not only from the Theravada community, but also from the [[Hindu]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and even [[Muslim]] communities.   During this renovation, some unique images were removed to a nearby monastery.  Unfortunately, these images were destroyed during [[World War II]] in a bombing raid.  An elevator was added in more recent times.

==Legends==
[[Image:Pindaya Panorama blend 3.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Pindaya town, lake and caves]]
[[Image:Multibud.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside Pindaya Caves]]
There are many legends surrounding the Pindaya cave.  One is that a blocked-off path at the end of the cave leads to the ancient city of [[Bagan]].  There is also the legend of the seven princesses bathing in a lake and how they were captured by a giant spider and trapped in the cave to be rescued by Prince Kummabhaya of [[Yawnghwe]]. Sculptures of the spider and the prince aiming with his bow and arrow have been added in recent times at the entrance of the covered stairway to the caves.

[[File:Pir Dastgir.jpg|thumb|right|Pir Dastgir, from the Mughal era]]
'''Pir''' or '''Peer''' ({{lang-fa|{{nq|پیر}}|lit=old [person]', 'elder}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newby|first1=Gordon|title=A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2002|publisher=One World|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-295-3|page=173|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYfrAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a title for a [[Sufi]] master or spiritual guide. They are also referred to as a [[Hazrat]] or [[Shaikh]], which is Arabic for Old Man. The title is often translated into English as "saint" and could be interpreted as "[[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]]". In [[Sufism]] a Pir's role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the Sufi path . This is often done by general lessons (called ''Suhbas'') and individual guidance. Other words that refer to a Pir include, ''[[Murshid]]'' ({{lang-ar|مرشد}}, meaning "guide" or "teacher"), ''[[Sheikh]]'' and ''Sarkar'' (Persian word meaning Master, Lord). In Alevism, Pir's are considered a direct descendant of Ali.

The title ''Peer Baba'' (पीर बाबा) is common in [[Hindustani language|Hindi]] used to give a salutation to Sufi masters or similarly honored persons. After their death people visit their tombs ([[dargah]]) (मक़बरा)  [[maqbara]]).

The path of Sufism starts when a student takes an oath of allegiance with a teacher called ''Bai'ath'' or ''[[Bay'ah]]'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} (Arabic word meaning "transaction") where he swears allegiance at the hands of his Pir and repents from all his previous sins. After that, the student is called a [[Murid]] (Arabic word meaning committed one). From here, his [[batin (Islam)|batin]] (inward) journey starts.

A Pir usually has authorizations to be a teacher for one (or more) [[tariqah]]s (method). A Tariqah may have more than one Pir at a time. A Pir is accorded that status by his Shaikh by way of ''Khilafat'' or ''Khilafah'' (Arabic word meaning succession). ''Khilafat'' is the process in which a Shaikh identifies one of his disciples as his successor (''[[Caliph|khalifah]]''). A Pir can have more than one ''khalifah''. The term Pir is also used by [[Nizari Ismailis]] whose missionaries in the past have used the title Pir.  The current [[Nizari Ismaili]] [[Imam]] [[Agha Khan]] is also the Pir within the [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]] sect.

'''Pohale Caves''', also '''Pohala Caves''' or '''Pawala Caves''', are a group of Buddhist caves located in [[Kolhapur District]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], after 15km northeast of [[Kolhapur]].&lt;ref name=BUR&gt;{{cite book |title=Revised Lists Of Antiquarian Remains In The Bombay Presidency |date=1897 |page=285 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.53162/2015.53162.Revised-Lists-Of-Antiquarian-Remains-In-The-Bombay-Presidency#page/n341/search/pohala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASI&gt;{{cite web |title=ASI Mumbai Circle |url=http://www.asimumbaicircle.com/m_kolhapur.html |website=www.asimumbaicircle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qarsita'''   ({{lang-ar|قرصيتا}})  is a [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipal and ikhtiyariah elections in Northern Lebanon|url=http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf|publisher=The Monthly|accessdate=20 April 2015|page=8|date=March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603040803/http://www.localiban.org/IMG/pdf/iiMonthly-Municip-Mar10-E92.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the highest mountains of [[Miniyeh-Danniyeh District]] in North [[Lebanon]].  The name of this village is derived from the two Arabic words "Qar" and "Sita" which mean famous ("sita") for cold ("Qar"). The village is famous for cultivation of pears, apples, peaches and variety of fruits and is one of the first producers of pears and apples in Lebanon. The very cold village, in comparison with surrounded areas, is characterized by its nature scenery and its unique position overlooking the city of Tripoli, the towns of [[Akkar]] district and the Syrian coast. Qarsita is one of the rich village in fresh water in [[Miniyeh-Danniyeh District]], it contains thousandth of fresh water sources, the biggest one called [[Source of Sugar]] feeds a large number of villages in the area.

The village is located in the extreme north of Lebanon, bordered on the north by [[Sfira]], by [[Beit El Faqs]] on the west, by [[Nemrin]] on the south and bordered on the east by Western Lebanese mountains chain. Qarsita is one of the biggest villages in area in [[Aldaniya]] district, however [[Qarn Jayroun]] area, which is 15&amp;nbsp;km far from Qarsita, belongs administratively to the municipality of Qarsita because its agricultural areas belong too to some Qarsitian families.

In 2012, Qarsita had an unofficial population of 5500, most of them are young. Since the 90th century, a large number of families migrated to the city of Tripoli either for work or to provide better educational opportunities.

==Economy and culture==
As already mentioned, Qarsita is one of the first producers of pears and apples in Lebanese villages. According to the Municipality of Qarsita, about 80% of the population live on agricultural benefits accompanied by conventional breeding of animals. Since 2000, beekeeping started to be an alternative product to agriculture due to weak exportation and the bad management from the successive governments. In Qarsita, some of industrial craft still steadfast. Recently, Qarsitian people started to go toward trading and the establishment of small businesses as alternative to agriculture and young educated people started to emigrate toward [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], Europe and other. After all,90% of the Qarsitian youth are well educated, among them several Ph.D. in medecine, physics, mathematics and others have been achieved.
Qarsita contains three official schools which are considered among the most important schools in [[Miniyeh-Danniyeh District]] in terms of education level.

[[Image:Moldavian orthodox church.jpg|thumb|Moldavian Orthodox church]]

'''Religion in Moldova''' is predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]. The Constitution of the [[Republic of Moldova]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the national government generally respects this right in practice.

Although Eastern Orthodoxy has a numerical preponderance, there is no state religion, and state and church are officially separate.

The generally amicable relationship among religions in Moldovan society contributes to religious freedom; however, disputes among various branches of the Orthodox Church continue.

Other religions practiced in [[Moldova]] include [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.mobi/a/moldovans_rally_against_recognition_of_islam/24179150.html|title=Moldovans Rally To Protest Formal Recognition Of Islam|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==
===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Moldova}}
The primary religion is [[Christianity]], 90.1% of the population nominally being [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] pursuant to [http://www.statistica.md/newsview.php?l=ro&amp;idc=30&amp;id=5582 data of the 2014 census]. Administratively, there are two [[autocephaly|autonomous]] churches belonging to two [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] churches (Russian and Romanian) within the Eastern Orthodox [[full communion|communion]]. The autonomous [[Metropolis of Chişinău and Moldova]] (belonging to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]), according to the State Service on Religious Issues, has 1,194 parishes; the autonomous [[Metropolis of Bessarabia]] (belonging to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]) has 124 parishes. In addition followers of the Old Rite Russian Orthodox Church ([[Old Believers]]) make up approximately 0.09 % of the population.

The religious traditions of Eastern Orthodoxy are entwined with the culture and patrimony of the country. Many self-professed atheists routinely celebrate religious holidays, cross themselves, and even light candles and kiss icons if local tradition and the occasion demand.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

During the [http://www.statistica.md/pageview.php?l=ro&amp;idc=295&amp;id=2234#idc=205&amp; 2004 census], 93.34% of the population declared themselves to be Eastern Orthodox.

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Catholic Church in Moldova}}
Moldova forms a single diocese, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chişinău]]. It is not part of any [[ecclesiastical province]], and therefore depends directly upon the [[Holy See]] for [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] authority. About 0.5% of Moldovans adhere to the Catholic faith.

===Other faiths===
Adherents of other faiths include [[Baptists]], [[Pentecostal]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Unification Church]] members, [[Molokans]] (a Russian group), [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]] (who believe that Jesus was the Messiah), [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s, [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]], and some other charismatic Christian and evangelical Christian groups. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) has 3 congregations in the country, and a combined total of approximately 370 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/moldova|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts - Total Church Membership|author=|date=|website=mormonnewsroom.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the most recently available numbers, the Jewish community has approximately 31,300 members, including approximately 20,000 living in [[Chişinău]], around 3,100 in [[Bălți]] and surrounding areas, approximately 2,200 in [[Tiraspol]], and around 2,000 in [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]].

==Freedom of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Moldova}}
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice; however, the 1992 Law on Religions, which codifies religious freedoms, contains restrictions that inhibit the activities of unregistered religious groups. Although the law was amended in 2002, many of the restrictions remain in place. The law provides for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess his or her religion in any form. It also protects the confidentiality of the confessional, allows denominations to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may not interfere in the religious activities of denominations. The law specifies that "in order to organize and function", religious organizations must be registered with the Government, and unregistered groups may not own property, engage employees, or obtain space in public cemeteries in their own names.

==Attitudes towards religion==
According to a survey conducted in 2014, by the Institute of Public Policy in Moldova, 80% of the respondents show a high degree of trust in the Church as an institution, but 85% consider that the church should remain separate from the political sphere and 76% consider that the church should not become involved with governmental issues.

Also, the survey showed that 58% of the respondents go to church less than once per month and 10% do not go at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/1707.pdf|title=Traditional religion and political power: Examining the role of the church in Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine and Moldova |publisher=[[Foreign Policy Centre]]|author=|date=|website=fpc.org.uk|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church and state==
Although the Constitution declares the separation of church and state, the [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]] (Metropolis of Chișinău and All Moldova under the Russian Orthodox Church) is sometimes active in political debate.

In [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2010|June 2010]] Metropolitan [[Vladimir (Cantarean)|Vladimir]] featured in the campaign advertisements of Valeriu Pasat, apparently endorsing his candidacy.

In October 2015 the same Orthodox Church leveraged its authority in a failed attempt to influence the trial of former prime minister [[Vlad Filat]], who was accused of passive corruption and traffic of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurnal.md/en/justice/2016/1/5/a-new-trial-in-case-filat-former-premier-has-appeared-in-front-of-court/|title=A new trial in case Filat: Former premier has appeared in front of court|work=Jurnal.md - Ca să ştii totul!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitropolia.md/apelul-inaltpreasfintitului-mitropolit-vladimir-adresat-tuturor-institutiilor-statului-implicate-in-cercetarea-cazului-domnului-vlad-filat/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020023214/http://mitropolia.md/apelul-inaltpreasfintitului-mitropolit-vladimir-adresat-tuturor-institutiilor-statului-implicate-in-cercetarea-cazului-domnului-vlad-filat/|title=Apelul ÎPS Mitropolit Vladimir adresat tuturor instituțiilor statului implicate în cercetarea  cazului Domnului Vlad Filat|archivedate=20 October 2015|work=Mitropolia Chişinăului şi a Întregii Moldove}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 the Metropolis of Chișinău and All Moldova challenged the State Tax Service of the Republic of Moldova, refusing to provide revenue reports, despite the fact that religious organizations lost their tax exempt status in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deschide.md/ro/news/social/22260/Mitropolia-Moldovei-este-nemul%C8%9Bumit%C4%83-de-impozitare.htm|title=Mitropolia Moldovei este nemulțumită de impozitare|work=Deschide.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, on the eve of the first round of the [[Moldovan presidential election, 2016|presidential elections]], metropolitan bishop Vladimir called on church members to cast their votes for [[Igor Dodon]], the pro-Russian leader of the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova. A group of Moldovan clergy of the same church, headed by bishop [[Marchel (Mihăescu)|Marchel]], later called on citizens to vote for Igor Dodon in the November election runoff, stating that the Socialist candidate supported the Orthodox Church, while his competitor [[Maia Sandu]] would fight against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.publika.md/moldovan-clerics-get-involved-in-electioneering-make-scandalous-assertions_2630299.html|title=Moldovan clerics get involved in electioneering, make SCANDALOUS assertions|first=PUBLIKA.MD - AICI SUNT|last=ȘTIRILE|date=4 November 2016|website=publika.md|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious censorship''' is a form of [[censorship]] where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the  [[Edict of Compiègne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]].

Religious censorship can also take form in the destruction of monuments and texts that contradict or conflict with the religion practiced by the oppressors, such as attempts to censor the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series.&lt;ref&gt;"Literature suppressed on religious grounds, rev. ed." Reference &amp; Research Book News, Nov. 2006. Academic OneFile, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A153753838/AONE?u=mcc_pv&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=ef24a2a4&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 13 Nov. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Destruction of historic places is another form of religious censorship. One cited incident of religious censorship was the destruction of the Buddhas statue in Afganistan by radical Islamists as part or their religious goal of oppression another religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/toppling-monuments-erasing-history/2017/08/18/1a4a4176-82c3-11e7-9e7a-20fa8d7a0db6_story.html|title=Toppling monuments, erasing history|last=|first=|date=August 18, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Religious censorship is defined as the act of suppressing views that are contrary of those of an [[organized religion]]. It is usually performed on the grounds of [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], [[sacrilege]] or [[impiety]] - the censored work being viewed as [[obscene]], challenging a [[dogma]], or violating a religious [[taboo]]. Defending against these charges is often difficult as some religious traditions permit only the religious authorities ([[clergy]]) to interpret [[doctrine]] and the interpretation is usually [[dogmatic]]. For instance, the [[Catholic Church]] banned hundreds of books on such grounds and maintained the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (''list of prohibited books''), most of which were writings that the Church's [[Holy Office]] had deemed dangerous, until the Index's abolishment in 1965.

==In Christianity==
The invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 changed the nature of book publishing.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962), The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1st ed.), University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-6041-9}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 16th century, in most European countries both the church and governments attempted to regulate and control printing. Governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.&lt;ref name="MacQueen 2007 34"&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |author2=Charlotte Waelde |author3=Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&amp;dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14"&gt;{{Cite book | last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel | title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983 | page = 14 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BzLXGUxV4CkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=36#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1557 the [[English Crown]] aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was restricted to the two universities ([[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]) and the 21 existing printers in the [[City of London]]. In France, the 1551 [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rabelais encyclopedia'' by Elizabeth A. Chesney 2004 {{ISBN|0-313-31034-3}} pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The printing press as an agent of change'' by Elizabeth L. Eisenstein 1980 {{ISBN|0-521-29955-1}} page 328&lt;/ref&gt; The 1557 [[Edict of Compiègne]] applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the [[Death by burning|burning]] of a noblewoman at the stake.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jean Knecht, ''The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France: 1483-1610'' 2001, {{ISBN|0-631-22729-6}} page 241&lt;/ref&gt;

A first version of the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' ("List of Prohibited Books") was promulgated by [[Pope Paul IV]] in 1559, and multiple revisions were made to it over the years.

Some works named in the ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' are the writings of [[Desiderius Erasmus]], a Catholic scholar who argued that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was probably forged and ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', a treatise by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] arguing for a [[Heliocentric theory|heliocentric orbit of the earth]], both works that at the time contradicted the Church's official stance on particular issues.

The final (20th) edition appeared in 1948, and it was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/galbooks.html Cambridge University on Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, the moral obligation of the Index was not abolished, according to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;"Haec S. Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei, facto verbo cum Beatissimo Patre, nuntiat Indicem suum vigorem moralem servare, quatenus Christifidelium conscientiam docet, ut ab illis scriptis, ipso iure naturali exigente, caveant, quae fidem ac bonos mores in discrimen adducere possint; eundem tamen non amplius vim legis ecclesiasticae habere cum adiectis censuris" (''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 58 (1966), p. 445).  Cf. [http://cctld.it/storia/informazione/index/notificatio_14_6_66.pdf  Italian text published, together with the Latin, on ''L'Osservatore Romano'' of 15 June 1966]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] states that bishops have the duty and right to review material concerning faith or morals before it may be published.&lt;ref&gt;"Can. 823 §1. In order to preserve the integrity of the truths of faith and morals, the pastors of the Church have the duty and right to be watchful so that no harm is done to the faith or morals of the Christian faithful through writings or the use of instruments of social communication. They also have the duty and right to demand that writings to be published by the Christian faithful which touch upon faith or morals be submitted to their judgment and have the duty and right to condemn writings which harm correct faith or good morals. §2. Bishops, individually or gathered in particular councils or conferences of bishops, have the duty and right mentioned in §1 with regard to the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the supreme authority of the Church, however, has this duty and right with regard to the entire people of God. Can. 824 §1. Unless it is established otherwise, the local ordinary whose permission or approval to publish books must be sought according to the canons of this title is the proper local ordinary of the author or the ordinary of the place where the books are published. §2. Those things established regarding books in the canons of this title must be applied to any writings whatsoever which are destined for public distribution, unless it is otherwise evident."

In 1992 José Saramago's "The Gospel According to Jesus Christ" entry in the Aristeion European Literary Prize was blocked by the Portuguese Under Secretary of State for Culture due to pressures from the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/books/19saramago.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=mv&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Islamic societies ==
{{Main article|Censorship in Islamic societies}}

{{See also|Islamic religious police}}

{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

Although nothing in the Qur'an explicitly imposes censorship, similar methodology has been carried out under [[Islam]]ic [[theocracy|theocracies]], such as the [[fatwa]] (''religious judgment'') against ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (a novel), ordering that the author be executed for [[blasphemy]].

Some [[Islamic]] societies have religious police, who seize banned consumer products and media regarded as un-Islamic, such as CDs/DVDs of various Western musical groups, television shows and film.&lt;ref name="asianews.it"&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 SAUDI ARABIA Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh - Asia News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323184717/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 |date=23 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saudi Arabia]], religious police actively prevent the practice or proselytizing of non-Islamic religions within Arabia, where they are banned.&lt;ref name="asianews.it"/&gt; This included the ban of the film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

Examples of Muslim censorship:
[[File:Maome.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A page from a 15th-century illustrated copy of a book by [[Al-Biruni|Al-Bīrūnī]], depicting Muhammad at the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]].&lt;ref name=maome&gt;{{cite web |agency= [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] |url= http://expositions.bnf.fr/livrarab/grands/0_01.htm | title=Le Prophète Mahomet | publisher=L'art du livre arabe | accessdate=03-02-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This image was the subject of a [[Online petition to remove Muhammad depictions from Wikipedia|2008 petition to have it removed from Wikipedia]].]]
* [[Depictions of Muhammad]] have inspired considerable controversy and censorship in the 2000s, including the adjacent image.
* ''[[The Jewel of Medina]]'', a work of historical fiction censored pre-publication.

== In Judaism ==
Throughout the history of the publishing of Jewish books, various works have been censored or banned. These can be divided into two main categories: Censorship by a non-Jewish government, and self-censorship. Self-censorship could be done either by the author himself, or by the publisher, out of fear from the gentiles or public reaction. Another important distinction that has to be made is between the censorship which existed already on manuscripts, before the printing press was invented, and the more official censorship after the printing press was invented.

===Gentile government censorship===
Many studies have been written on censorship and its influence on the publishing of Jewish books. For example, studies have appeared on the censorship of Jewish books when they were first starting to be published, in [[Italy]] in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. Other studies have been written on the censorship of the Czarist government in [[Russia]] in the nineteenth century.

Many of the "official" Christian government censors of Jewish books were Jewish apostates. The main reason for this was due to their knowledge of Hebrew, especially Rabbinic Hebrew.

In Czarist Russia in the nineteenth century, it was decreed that Jewish books could only be published in two cities, [[Vilnius]] and [[Zhitomir]].

===Censorship by Jewish religious authorities===
{{see also|Heresy in Judaism#Jews accused of heresy}}
The [[Mishnah]] ([[Sanhedrin]] 10:1) prohibits the reading of [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|extra-biblical books]] (ספרים חיצונים). The [[Talmud]] explains this to mean the book of Ben Sirah ([[Sirach]]).
In the early thirteenth century the philosophical book ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' by [[Maimonides]] was prohibited to be read until one was older by some French and Spanish Jewish leaders, because of the perceived danger of [[philosophy]]. Philosophy was prohibited to be learned until the age of forty. The same restriction was later applied to [[Kabbalah]], in the fifteenth century.
In the 1720s, the kabbalistic works of Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzato]] were banned by religious leaders. In the 1690s, the book [[Pri Chadash]] was banned in Egypt for arguing on earlier authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejewisheye.com/gedolimb34.html|accessed 4 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, when government censorship of Jewish books is uncommon, books are mainly self-censored, or banned by Orthodox Jewish religious authorities. [[Marc Shapiro]] points out that not all books considered heretical by Orthodox Jews are banned; only those books on which there is a risk that Orthodox Jews may read them are banned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/3_2_Shapiro.pdf | Accessed 4 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples:
*The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Siddur]] (1945), revised by [[Mordecai Kaplan]].
*''Torah Study: A Survey of Classic Sources on Timely Issues'' (1990), by Rabbi [[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Leo Levi]], was banned by Rabbi [[Elazar Shach]]. It was banned because it discussed the value of studying subjects other than [[Torah study|Torah]].
*''My Uncle The Netziv'' (1988), an excerpt of the book ''Mekor Baruch'' by Rabbi [[Baruch Epstein]], was banned by anonymous Rabbis in [[Lakewood CDP, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]. It was banned because it was perceived to have said unflattering things about the [[Netziv]].&lt;ref&gt;http://download.yutorah.org/2011/TU2_Schachter1.pdf (PDF)|Accessed 6 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*''HaGaon'' (Hebrew, 2002), a biography of the [[Vilna Gaon]], by Dov Eliach, was banned by [[Chassidic]] leaders for its attacks against Chassidus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seforim.traditiononline.org/index.cfm/HaGaon |title=Tradition Seforim Blog : HaGaon |publisher=Seforim.traditiononline.org |accessdate=2013-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709071211/http://seforim.traditiononline.org/index.cfm/HaGaon |archivedate=9 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Science of Torah'' (2001), by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]], was banned by Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and others. It was banned because it explained how the theory of evolution can fit with Judaism; evolution is opposed by many authorities. Slifkin's books ''Mysterious Creatures'' (2003) and ''The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax'' (2004) were also banned, because they brought down opinions that [[Chazal]] could be incorrect in their scientific knowledge.
*''[[Making of a Godol]]'' (2002), by Rabbi [[Natan Kamenetzky]], was banned by Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and other Orthodox Jewish authorities because of its sometimes unflattering portrayals of Jewish leaders.
*''The Dignity of Difference'' (2002), by Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], was banned by Rabbi Elayshiv and others. It was banned because it was perceived to equate Judaism with other religions.
*''One People, Two Worlds: A Reform rabbi and an Orthodox rabbi explore the issues that divide them'' (2003) by [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Rabbi [[Ammiel Hirsch]] and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]], was banned by the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] of [[Agudath Israel of America]] and the heads of [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey.
*''[[Kosher Jesus]]'', by Rabbi [[Shmuley Boteach]], was banned in 2012 by the [[Chabad]] rabbi [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]], who labelled the book as heretical and stated that it "poses a tremendous risk to the Jewish community," and that "I have never read a book, let alone one authored by a purported ''[[frum]]'' Jew, that does more to enhance the evangelical [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary]] message and agenda than the aforementioned book".&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/life/Kosher+Jesus+book+ignites+skirmish+between+Jewish+scholars/6064343/story.html |title='Kosher Jesus' book ignites skirmish between Jewish scholars |last=Boswell |first=Randy |date=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |work=Canada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bahá'í Faith ==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has a requirement that Bahá'í authors should seek review of their works by the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the country in which it will be printed. The requirement was initiated by [[`Abdu'l-Baha]] and intended to sunset when the religion grows in numbers. The publication review requirement does not apply to most online content or local promotional material. According to the [[Universal House of Justice]], the highest governing body of the religion, 
{{quote|The purpose of review is to protect the Faith against misrepresentation by its own followers at this early stage of its existence when comparatively few people have any knowledge of it. An erroneous presentation of the Teachings by a Bahá'í who is accounted a scholar, in a scholarly journal, would by that very fact, do far more harm than an erroneous presentation made by an obscure Bahá'í author with no pretensions to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&amp;chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The review requirement has been criticized by a few academic Bahá'ís as censorship. [[Juan Cole]], professor of history at the University of Michigana, had conflicts over the issue and withdrew his membership as a Bahá'í, claiming that it "has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole | last2= |first2= |date= June 1998 |title= The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |publisher=  |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages= |doi= |access-date= September 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis MacEoin]] similarly resigned his membership and said that the review stifled research in [[Bahá'í studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= MacEoin |first= Denis| authorlink = Denis MacEoin| last2= |first2= |date= 1990 |title= The crisis in Babi and Baha'i studies: part of a wider crisis in academic freedom? |url= http://fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/archives/Denis%20MacEoin,%20Crisis%20in%20Babi%20and%20Baha'i%20Studies.pdf |journal= British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |publisher= |volume= 17 |issue= 1 |pages= 55–61|doi=10.1080/13530199008705506 |access-date= September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moojan Momen]], another academic in the field of [[Bahá'í studies]] who has called MacEoin and Cole "apostates," disagrees and states that "there is no more 'censorship' involved in this process than with any other academic journal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Marginality and Apostasy in the Bahá'í Community | url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_marginality_apostasy| first = Moojan | last= Momen |authorlink= Moojan Momen | journal="Religion" | pages = 187–209 | year = 2007 | number = 37:3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, the public reaction to Mandel's [[censorship]] decree was one of disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=59973&amp;postcount=18 Bruce Dunbar, "Mandel Oversteps Bounds," Edmonton Journal, September 23, 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=60311&amp;postcount=21 Donna McKinnon, "No Place For Censorship," Edmonton Journal, September 23, 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=60548&amp;postcount=29 "Venting," compiled by Terry McConnell, Edmonton Journal, September 25, 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=61469&amp;postcount=34 Joe Renaud, "Art's Message Isn't Always Pretty," Edmonton Journal, September 30, 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=61473&amp;postcount=38 Krishna Bagdiya, "Sculptures No Threat," Edmonton Journal, September 30, 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the [[Edmonton Journal]]'s Paula Simons, David Goa, religious scholar, cultural anthropologist, and director of the University of Alberta's [[Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life]], states ''"In India, Lord Ganesha is on everything -- playing cards, advertising signs, lotto tickets, even diapers, I suspect."'' Within the traditional [[Thirty-two forms of Ganesha]] in Hinduism, Ganesha is sometimes presented nude, in both infant ([[Bala Ganapati]]) and erotic ([[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]) forms. Simons concludes, ''"In his haste to appease a few protesters, the mayor, usually a champion of the arts, made a serious error in judgment. Instead of giving McCourt's divinely inspired statues the bum's rush, we should be celebrating this Canadian cross-pollination of cultures and aesthetic forms"''.&lt;ref name="sac" /&gt; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s columnist [[Margaret Wente]] agreed with Simons: ''"The mayor, of course, was quite wrong. Mr. McCourt's sculptures did not insult the Hindu community. They insulted a small but vocal conservative religious group that is about as representative of Hindus as Hassidic Jews are of Jews.... There's a big difference between respecting different cultures and caving in to illiberalism and superstition."'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/why-are-we-so-afraid-to-offend/article725582/ Margaret Wente, "Why Are We So Afraid To Offend?," The Globe and Mail, September 29, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such negative responses in the media to visual art censorship in Canada, in 2014 the Edmonton Arts Council subsequently refused a donation of one of McCourt's sculptures, "''Destroyer of Obstacles''," evidently because the sculpture had genitalia ''beneath its clothes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2015/04/24/reaching-for-a-reasonable-justification-for-censorship/ PZ Myers, "Reaching For a Reasonable Justification for Censorship," Pharyngula, April 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting with seven Hindu community group representative to seek out their opinion of the donation, the Edmonton Arts Council received a response that McCourt's sculpture was ''"an offense to their religion"'' and that the ban enacted by Mayor Mandel should remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5abab0a9c9b37e16ccd9e973c&amp;id=7a39732458 Edmonton Arts Council - Briefing Note, June 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this consultation, ''"the Public Art Committee unanimously voted to decline acceptance of the gift, as the artwork did not meet "community or civic suitability" criteria."'' In McCourt's view, ''“It is not the purpose of a city’s public art collection to placate special interests,”'' he says. ''“I want Edmonton to build the best civic art collection that we can get, never mind the politics, the religion, etc. of the artists making the work.”''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curiousarts.ca/the-pleasures-and-perils-of-public-art Donna McKinnon, "The Pleasures and Perils of Public Art," Curious Arts, November 27, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bahubali Shravana Belagola.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|The Lord [[Bahubali]] statue symbolising absolute renunciation from the [[Samsara]].]]
'''Renunciation''' (or '''renouncing''') is the act of rejecting something, especially if it is something that the renouncer has previously enjoyed or endorsed.

In religion, renunciation often indicates an abandonment of pursuit of material comforts, in the interests of achieving [[spiritual enlightenment]]. It is highly practiced in Jainism. In [[Hinduism]], the renounced order of life is ''[[sannyasa|sannyāsa]]''; in Buddhism, the Pali word for "renunciation" is ''[[nekkhamma]]'', conveying more specifically "giving up the world and leading a holy life" or "freedom from lust, craving and desires".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 377, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali entry for "Nekkhamma"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707141638/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:692.pali |date=7 July 2012 }} (retrieved 2008-04-12).  Rhys Davids &amp; Stede speculate that the [[Sanskrit]] term with which ''nekkhamma'' is associated is either:
:* ''nai{{IAST|ṣ}}kramya'' &amp;mdash; "inactivity, abstinence or exemption from acts and their consequences" ([http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0570-naipAtya.jpg Monier Williams, 1964, p. 570, entry for "Naish"])
:* ''nai{{IAST|ṣ}}kāmya'' &amp;mdash; "suppression of desire, profound contemplation" ([http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0570-naipAtya.jpg ''ibid''.]).&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Sangha]], [[Bhikkhu]], [[Bhikkhuni]], [[Śramaṇa]]. In [[Christianity]], some denominations have a tradition of renunciation of [[the Devil]].

Legally, renunciation arises in [[nationality law]] with the [[renunciation of citizenship]], a formal process by which the renouncer ceases to hold [[citizenship]] with a specific country. A person can also renounce property, as when a person submits a [[disclaimer of interest]] in property that has been left to them in a [[will (law)|will]].

==Mahatma Gandhi==

It is widely believed in India that voluntary renunciation is how one gains power, for whatever purpose. In South Africa (1893-1915) [[Gandhi]] tried many spiritual practices and experiments, almost all of them including a component of renunciation, based in the practice of [[Sannyasi]]. After reading “Unto this Last” By John Ruskin in 1904 he redoubled his commitment to gain greater control over self, increasing his capacity to work for the common welfare and find a greater sense of oneness with others. The ultimate renunciation is of self, one's separateness from others and the world.

==Christianity==
In some [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]], renunciation of the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is a common [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[rubric]]. This is most often seen in connection with the sacrament of [[baptism]]. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church a baptism usually contains the "Prayer of Exorcism". Later in the ceremony, the parents and [[Godparent|godparents]] are asked to publicly renounce the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/textcontents/index/4/subindex/67/textindex/7|title=The Catholic Liturgical Library|website=www.catholicliturgy.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] dismissed this rubric in a 2014 renewal of liturgy. According to [[The Independent]], this was done in an attempt to "widen the appeal" of the rite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/devil-vows-taken-out-of-christening-services-as-church-of-england-aims-to-widen-appeal-9604399.html|title=Devil vows taken out of Christening services as Church of England aims|date=2014-07-14|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prior report for the Church's Liturgical Commission stated that "[f]or the majority of those attending, the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-2690262/BAPTISM-SERVICES-MAY-OMIT-DEVIL.html|title=BAPTISM SERVICES MAY OMIT 'DEVIL'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Church of Norway]], the public renunciation of the Devil is a obligatory element in the [[Church service|Main Service]]. It is stated by the congregation before the profession of faith (usually the [[Apostles' Creed]], as the [[Nicene Creed]] is largely reserved for special observances). When performed in a service which includes a baptism, it is also considered an extension of the testimony given by the [[Godparent|sponsors]], as they are required to confess to a denomination which does not rejects the Apostles' or the Nicene Creed, nor rejects [[infant baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://kirken.no/globalassets/kirken.no/om-troen/liturgier-oversatt/the-order-of-the-principal-service.pdf "''The Order of the Principal Service''", as derived from "''The Service Book for the Church of Norway''".

'''Shree Pavapuri Tirth Dham''' is situated at [[Sirohi district]] of [[Rajasthan]]. This temple was built by K. P. Sanghvi Group and it comprises a Jain [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Tirth]] (Temple complex) and Jeev Raksha Kendra (Animal Welfare Center).

==Campus==
The Tirth derived its name after the Pavada Agriculture well that exists there.

Shri Kumarpalbhai V. Shah inspired Late Shri Hajarimalji Poonamchandji Sanghvi (Bafna) and Shri Babulalji Poonamchandji Sanghvi (Bafna), the founders of K. P. Sanghvi Group, to construct a Tirth Dham.  They started construction and development of the campus on 30 May 1998, Saturday (Jeth Shukla 15, 2054 V. S.). The initial thought was to construct a small temple and a shelter for 100 cows only but the campus is now spread over more than {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land. The temple complex occupies {{convert|3101472|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} area and the Jeev Raksha Kendra (Animal Welfare Center) occupies {{convert|7196112|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. 

It took two and a half years to construct the temple with an average of 400 artisans working daily. The construction was completed on 7 February 2001, Wednesday (Magh Shukla 14, 2057 V. S.) and was finally opened for worship.

==Animal Welfare Center==
The campus has an Animal Welfare Center that tends to stray cows, buffaloes, dogs and donkeys. Founded in 1998, the [[goshala]] covers over {{convert|7000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of area and houses more than 5000 stray cattle. To take care of the animals, the Center also employs over 150 people and a few veterinary doctors.&lt;ref name=Pankaj&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=7IZm46Bt1TgC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=pavapuri+sirohi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Es1z2jfPHB&amp;sig=a5DVgZusRvz5_i7KJX0KaCZr_WY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FShUuXaIovLrQeO6YCgDQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwATg8#v=onepage&amp;q=pavapuri%20sirohi&amp;f=false | title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability | publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate Publishing Ltd.]] | author=Jain, Pankaj | year=2011 | pages=98-99 | isbn=1409405923 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vachana sahitya''' is a form of rhythmic writing in Kannada (see also [[Kannada poetry]]) that evolved in the 11th century CE and flourished in the 12th century, as a part of the Sharana movement. The word ''vachanas'' literally means "(that which is) said". These are readily intelligible prose texts.

Devara Dasimayya  who lived in the mid 10th century is considered the first proponent of lingayatism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
 
Later poets, such as [[Basava]] (1160), the founder of [[Lingayatism]], prime minister of [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Southern Kalachuri]] [[Bijjala II|King Bijjala II]], considered Chennaiah to be his literary father.

==Vachanas and Sharana movement==
[[File:Plam leaf of 11th and 12th Century with Vachanas.jpg|thumb|left|450px|Palm leaf with Vachanas (11th - 12th century).]]
Basavaadi Sharana's Vachanas are their experiences in the process of God realization. About 800 sharanas practiced the technique and wrote their experiences in terms of ''Guru'' (Unmanifest Chaitanya), ''Linga'' (Manifest Chaitanya), ''Jangama'' (Pure consciousness of Lingatattva in one's prana), ''Padodaka'' (intimacy with the knower/source of Lingatattva), and ''Prasada'' (becoming lingatattva).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As per record, this form exchange of experience of the realization of the God in group discussion has happened only in [[Karnataka]] by the sharanas mainly under the guidance of Basavanna the founder of Lingayth religion, [[Channa Basavanna]] [[Allama Prabhu]] and [[siddarameshwar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This fact has been attributed to the popularity of the movement. More than 200 Vachana writers (''Vachanakaras'') have been recorded, more than thirty of whom were women.&lt;ref name="vac"&gt;Sastri (1955), p361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vac1"&gt;Other well known Vachana writers were Chennabasava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, Kondaguli Kesiraja etc. (Narasimhacharya 1988, p20)&lt;/ref&gt;

Vachanas are brief paragraphs, and they end with one or the other local names under which [[Shiva]] is invoked or offered ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|Pooja]]''. In style, they are epigrammatical, parallelistic and allusive. They dwell on the vanity of riches, the valuelessness of mere rites or book learning, the uncertainty of life and the spiritual privileges of Shiva Bhakta (worshiper of lord Shiva).&lt;ref name="Vachana literature"&gt;Edward Rice, ''A History of Kannada Literature'', 1921, Asian Educational Services, (Reprinted 1982), pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; The Vachanas call men to give up the desire for worldly wealth and ease, to live lives of sobriety and detachment from the world and to turn to Siva for refuge.&lt;ref name="Vachana literature" /&gt;

Authors of a particular Vachana can be identified by the style of invocation of God (Basveshvara invokes "Kudala Sangama Deva", while Allama Prabhu invokes "Guheshwara", Akkamadevi invokes "Channa Mallikarjuna", Siddhrama (Siddheshwar) of Solapur invokes "Kapilasidda Mallikarjuna") in the vachana. The existing readings of the vachanas are mostly set by the European understanding of the Indian traditions.

About 20,000 vachanas have been published. The government of Karnataka has published Samagra Vachana Samputa in 15 volumes. [[Karnataka University]] Dharwad has published collections of individual vachana poets.

Jedara Dasimaiah is called the 'Adya Vachanakara' (The First Vachanakara).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">'''Velada''' is the name of the healing vigils carried out by [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[curandero]]s'' (such as [[María Sabina]]). The rituals involved the use of [[psilocybin]] (magic mushrooms) or ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Danilo Parra, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvebgv/salvia-velada-mazatec-shaman-ceremony-portfolio-v23n8 Salvia Velada: Experiencing a Traditional Mazatec Shaman Ceremony], ''Vice.com'', 8 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; to commune with God and experience enlightenment.

==History==
In May 1957, the banker and ethnomycologist [[R. Gordon Wasson]] published an article in the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]'', describing his first experience consuming the mushroom and following the Velada of a shaman back in 1955. He claimed to be among the two first modern Western men to follow a traditional Velada ritual on psilocybin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Jj8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA100#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true LIFE Magazine article (May 13, 1957)]&lt;/ref&gt; His tale inspired a generation of «mycotourists» seeking to experience the authentic Mazatec Veladas.&lt;ref&gt;Paja Faudree, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kYQWa9pzobEC Singing for the Dead: The Politics of Indigenous Revival in Mexico], ''Duke University Press'', 29 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychedelictimes entheogens"&gt;Wesley Thoricatha, [https://psychedelictimes.com/psilocybin-mushrooms/history-of-psychedelics-how-the-mazatec-tribe-brought-entheogens-to-the-world/ History of Psychedelics: How the Mazatec Tribe Brought Entheogens to the World], ''Psychedelictims.com'', 28 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Wasson's [[curandero]] was [[Maria Sabina]]. She was seen as a traitor by her community and rejected. She had received rock stars such as [[John Lennon]], [[Mick Jagger]], and [[Bob Dylan]] to follow the Mazatec Velada, which had led to an international exposition of the Mazatec's entheogenic secrets.&lt;ref name="psychedelictimes entheogens"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">According to [[Roman Catholicism]], a '''venial sin''' is a lesser sin that does not result in a complete separation from [[God]] and eternal [[damnation]] in [[Hell]] as an unrepented [[mortal sin]] would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a8.htm|quote=1863. Venial sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace, friendship with God, charity, and consequently eternal happiness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venial Sin|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/venial+sin|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A venial sin consists in acting as one should not, without the actual incompatibility with the state of grace that a mortal sin implies; they do not break one's friendship with God, but injure it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Colin|title=Mortal verses Venial Sin|url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/mortal_versus_venial.htm|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

An act, when it is not ordered towards that which is good, is considered to be sinful – either venially or mortally. When such an act is venially sinful, it entails subject-matter that is not considered to be "grave". Such an action, even if it is committed with full knowledge and full consent, remains venial, so long as the subject-matter of the act is not serious. If the subject-matter of a given act is "grave", however, the commission of that act may be mortally sinful. Intentional ignorance and "hardness of heart" increase "the voluntary character of a sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=1859|long=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in discussing the distinction between venial and [[mortal sin]] in his [[Summa Theologica]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] indicated that a venial sin differs from a mortal sin, in the same way that something imperfect differs from something that is perfect.

As such, one can arrive at what kind of sin, for example, was committed, by asking the following three questions:

# Did the act involve a grave matter?
# Was the act committed with full knowledge of the wrongdoing that had been done in the act?
# Was the act done with full consent of the will?

If all three questions are answered in the affirmative, the criteria for a mortal sin have been met. If any one of the three questions are answered in the negative, only the criteria for a venial sin have been met. In cases of doubt regarding any of these three questions, it is assumed that the criteria for a mortal sin were not met.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Each venial [[sin]] that one commits adds to the [[penance]] that one must do. Penance left undone during life converts to punishment in [[Purgatory]]. A venial sin can be left [[Confession (religion)|unconfessed]] so long as there is some purpose of amendment. One receives from the sacrament of reconciliation the grace to help overcome venial, as well as mortal sins. It is recommended that confession of venial sins be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Fr. William|title=The Arlington Catholic Herald|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/MORTSIN.htm|date=March 30, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Canon Law (CIC 988)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venial sins require some kind of penance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Council of Trent|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tsacr-p.htm|chapter=The Necessity of the Sacrament of Penance|quote=These words were said by our Lord in reference to grievous and mortal sins, although at the same time lighter sins, which are called venial, also require some sort of penance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[Magisterium]], venial sins usually remain venial no matter how many one commits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a8.htm "However venial sin does not break the covenant with God. "]&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot "add up" to collectively constitute a [[mortal sin]], but their accumulation does lead to being more vulnerable to committing mortal sin.&lt;ref&gt;" But do not despise these sins which we call light: if you take them for light when you weigh them, tremble when you count them. A number of light objects makes a great mass" [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a8.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases where repeat offenses may become a grave matter. For instance, if one were to steal small amounts of property from a particular person, over time one would have stolen enough that it would develop into a serious theft from that person.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Donald F. Miller, C.Ss.R., 'Examen for Laymen' http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=3635&amp;repos=1&amp;subrepos=0&amp;searchid=753266 Retrieved 2011-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In all this, one ought not to take venial sin lightly, especially when committed deliberately. No one without a special grace (generally taken to apply only to the Blessed Virgin Mary)
can avoid even semi-deliberate venial sins entirely (according to the definition of Trent). But one must, to avoid mortal sins, seek (as far as possible) to overcome venial sins. The Magisterium teaches that although a number of venial sins do not themselves add up to a mortal sin, each venial sin weakens the will further, and the more willing one becomes in allowing such falls, the more one is inclined towards, and will inevitably fall into (if one continues along this path), mortal sin.&lt;ref&gt;"Deliberate and non repented venial sin disposes us little by little to commit mortal sin."[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a8.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, 21 September 2013, four masked gunmen attacked the [[Westgate, Nairobi|Westgate shopping mall]], an [[luxury goods|upscale]] mall in [[Nairobi]],&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite news| author1=Associated Press| author2=Daniel, Douglass K. | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/gunmen-use-grenades-open-fire-at-nairobis-most-upscale-mall/2013/09/21/a9403b3a-22a8-11e3-ad1a-1a919f2ed890_story_1.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922155502/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/gunmen-use-grenades-open-fire-at-nairobis-most-upscale-mall/2013/09/21/a9403b3a-22a8-11e3-ad1a-1a919f2ed890_story_1.html | archive-date=22 September 2013 |title=39 people killed in Kenya mall attack claimed by Somali militants; hostages still held| date=21 September 2013| work=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2013|page=2| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; Kenya.

Approximately 200 people were wounded in the [[mass shooting]].

The [[extremist Islamic]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] claimed responsibility for the incident, which it characterised as retribution for the [[Kenya Defence Forces|Kenyan military]]'s deployment in the group's home country of [[Somalia]]. Many media outlets also suspected the insurgent group's involvement in the attack based on earlier reprisal warnings it had issued in the wake of [[Operation Linda Nchi]] from 2011 to 2012.

Kenyan authorities arrested dozens of people in the aftermath of the attack, but had not announced any suspects directly related to the siege. On 4 November 2013, a Kenyan court charged four Somali nationals with harbouring the gunmen in their homes, with each pleading not guilty.

On 20 September 2015, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine reported the Westgate attack on 21 September lasted several hours, with the last victim killed before special Kenyan security forces entered the mall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/20/nairobi-kenya-westgate-mall-attack-al-shabab/ |title=‘Close Your Eyes and Pretend to Be Dead’ What really happened two years ago in the bloody attack on Nairobi’s Westgate Mall.

==Background==

The incident followed threats from [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] in late 2011 of attacks in [[Kenya]] in retaliation for [[Operation Linda Nchi]], a coordinated military operation in southern [[Somalia]] that was launched against the group by the [[Somali Armed Forces]] and [[Kenya Defence Forces]].&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jcoln"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Communique – Operation Linda Nchi|url=http://kenyahighcomtz.org/?action=event-read-more.html&amp;id=1|publisher=Kenya High Commission, Tanzania|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week before the incident and a month after [[United Nations]] warnings of possible attacks, Kenyan police claimed to have disrupted a major attack in its final stages of planning after arresting two people with grenades, [[AK-47]] assault rifles, and suicide vests packed with [[ball bearings]]. The two suspects were from a Nairobi neighbourhood where Somali immigrants live. A manhunt was also launched for eight more suspects.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite news| author1=Pflanz, Mike | author2=Alexander, Harriet | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10325536/Nairobi-shopping-mall-attacks-Britons-among-those-caught-up-in-terrorist-assault.html | title=Nairobi shopping mall attacks: Britons among those caught up in terrorist assault| date=21 September 2013| work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 September 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' claimed that it had seen United Nations documents that warned that in the previous month the threat of an "attempted large-scale attack" in Kenya was "elevated."&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; After the incident, Nairobi senator [[Mike Sonko]] claimed that he had warned the security services of a possible attack three months previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Bariyo, Nicholas | author2=Vogt, Heidi | author3=Bryan-Low, Cassell|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304526204579096713497161006 | title=Kenya Starts Probe in Wake of Mall Siege| date=25 September 2013| work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kenyan-post.com/2013/09/shocking-mike-sonko-claims-he-alerted.html | title=Mike Sonko claims he alerted NSIS...| date=25 September 2013| work=The Kenyan Daily Post|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country was celebrating the [[International Day of Peace]] when the incident took place.

On Saturday 21 September 2013, at about noon,&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt; at least four masked assailants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/10/29/world/africa/29reuters-kenya-security-looting.html|title=Kenya Says Some Soldiers Looted During Nairobi Mall Attack|date=29 October 2013| publisher=New York Times|accessdate=29 October 2013| agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; (initially claimed by the government to be between 10 and 15)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24216327 |title= Nairobi attack: Kenya forces comb Westgate site |publisher=BBC | date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kenya-mall-shooting-kills-at-least-22-1.1863137|title=Canadians die in Kenya massacre claimed by al-Qaeda-linked group|date=21 September 2013| publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=25 September 2013 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the [[Westgate, Nairobi|Westgate shopping mall]], the most [[luxury goods|upscale]] mall in [[Nairobi]],&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; in its [[Westlands]] district.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Fighting with armed police continued over 48 hours later.&lt;ref name="aljazmon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/09/2013923184818675146.html |title=Battle for control of Nairobi mall rages on | date=23 September 2013| publisher=Al Jazeera | accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameras in the mall revealed the gunmen carried [[assault rifle]]s and wore civilian clothing. There were additional reports of [[grenade]] explosions. Police surrounded the area and urged residents to stay away. A report indicated that about 80 people were trapped in the basement, but police said that they had escorted some shoppers to safety and were trying to capture the gunmen.&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt; The Secretary-General of the [[Kenya Red Cross Society]], [[Abbas Gullet]], said that rescue workers could not reach some of the patrons in the mall. Inspector General of Police [[David Kimaiyo]] wrote that there were "police at the scene and the area [was] surrounded."&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/kenya-forces-deployed-at-nairobi-shopping-mall-after-gunfire |title=Kenya forces deployed at Nairobi shopping mall after gunfire | date=21 September 2013| work=The Malay Mail |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Rob Van Dijk, an employee of the Dutch embassy, said that while he was eating at a restaurant the attack started with grenades and was followed by gunfire as patrons screamed and dropped to the ground. Other witnesses said the attack began at the outdoor seating area of Artcaffe at the front of the mall. An Artcaffe employee, Patrick Kuria, said: "We started by hearing gunshots downstairs and outside. Later we heard them come inside. We took cover. Then we saw two gunmen wearing black turbans. I saw them shoot." Some of the casualties were at the entrance to the mall after the assailants moved outside and a stand-off then commenced with police. Ambulances were present at the mall as rescuers started moving emerging victims. Reports indicated children were among the victims, and patrons that were carrying small children were among those trapped. Mall security guards used shopping carts to ferry out wounded children.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news| author1=Petrecca, Laura| author2=Bhatti, Jabeen (Associated Press)|title=39 die in Kenya mall siege; hostages still held| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/09/21/witness-kenya-mall-attackers-target-non-muslims/2846319/|newspaper=USA Today|date=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NTV (Kenya)|Nation TV]] footage showed dozens of people escaping from a back entrance. [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] correspondent Marco Lui was on the second floor of the mall when the attack started; he said that two explosions happened within about five minutes of each other. "We heard a noise from the ground floor and people started running to the parking area on the rooftop. They were panicking and then the second blast went off and people were even more panicked." Other eyewitnesses said that in addition to grenades, the attackers used [[AK-47]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ombok|first=Eric|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-21/kenyan-police-surround-nairobi-shopping-mall-after-gunfire.html|title=Kenya Forces Deployed at Nairobi Shopping Mall After Gunfire|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=17 September 2013|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty people were rescued from a toy shop on the upper floor.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; As the Kenyan army troops arrived, they used [[tear gas]] to try to smoke out the attackers from the cinema complex. Vehicles riddled with bullet holes were left abandoned in front of the mall. Kimaiyo said: "Our officers are on the ground carrying out an evacuation of those inside as they search for the attackers who are said to be inside."&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; A police officer said that the gunmen were barricaded inside the [[Nakumatt]] supermarket. He indicated that there were three bodies there while he pointed to a pool of blood by a children's shoe shop. He then pointed to a hamburger bar where music still played and indicated more bodies were found there.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-kenya-mall-attack-20130921,0,4570194.story |title=Dozens killed in Nairobi mall attack |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=21 September 2013 |agency=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922055838/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-kenya-mall-attack-20130921,0,4570194.story |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue efforts==

[[Goran Tomasevic]], [[Reuters]] chief photographer for [[East Africa]], recorded the first few hours of the attacks in which he described extremely distressed people including children, women and men bleeding from the impact of shrapnel and gunshots.&lt;ref name="Twtnmm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomasevic |first=Goran |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/09/23/witnessing-the-nairobi-mall-massacre/ |title=Witnessing the Nairobi mall massacre &amp;#124; Photographers Blog |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Yusuf Haji, son of former Defence Minister of Kenya [[Mohamed Yusuf Haji]], on receiving text messages from his brother, an undercover anti-terrorism agent who was stuck inside the shopping center, travelled to the mall with his handgun and entered with other civilian rescuers. He helped rescue a mother and her three daughters, providing cover with other armed rescuers. Tomasevic's photos of the rescue efforts by civilians were beamed all around the world.&lt;ref name="Twtnmm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laing|first=Aislinn|title=Revealed: American family rescued by hero of attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10337908/Revealed-American-family-rescued-by-hero-of-attack-on-Nairobis-Westgate-mall.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=26 September 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By nightfall, the mall remained sealed off to the public while security services searched floor by floor for the gunmen, believed to still be inside with the hostages.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news | author1=Gettleman, Jeffrey | author2=Kulish, Nicholas | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/africa/nairobi-mall-shooting.html |title=Gunmen Kill Dozens in Terror Attack at Kenyan Mall |work=The New York Times |date=21 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; People continued to trickle out from hiding places.&lt;ref name="abc2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Straziuso|url=http://abcnews.com/International/wireStory/gunmen-open-fire-nairobis-upscale-mall-20326850|title=Kenya Minister Says 59 Killed in Mall Attack| date=21 September 2013 | publisher=ABC News|accessdate=21 September 2013 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Security Minister [[Mutea Iringo]] then said that the government was in control of the situation. Kimaiyo also wrote that several of the other assailants had been pinned down after security forces moved into the mall.&lt;ref name="aljaz3"/&gt; President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] said the security operation was "delicate" and that a top priority was to safeguard hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Macharia, James | author2=Miriri, Duncan | url=http://news.msn.com/world/39-dead-in-kenya-mall-attack-hostages-still-held?stay=1 |title=Somali militants claim Kenya mall attack; 30 dead |publisher=MSN |accessdate=22 September 2013 | agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 2:30 – an hour after reporting five "visibly shaken" hostages' release – the [[Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre|National Disaster Operation Centre]] (NDOC) wrote that "major operations underway."&lt;ref name="ccn2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=39 killed and more carnage feared as Kenya mall attackers dig in|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/21/world/africa/kenya-mall-gunbattle/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=21 September 2013|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next evening, after nightfall, over 24 hours after the beginning of the attack, gunfire was still heard at the mall. The military spokesman, Colonel Cyrus Oguna, said that most of the hostages had been released, saying that they were "dehydrated and suffering from shock;" he added that four Kenyan soldiers were injured in the rescue operation.&lt;ref name="aljaz3"/&gt; Scores of by-standers gathered by the mall as the operations continued.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/africa/nairobi-shopping-centre-attacks-death-toll-hits-68-as-siege-continues-29596919.html | title=Nairobi shopping centre attacks: 'Most' hostages freed | work=The Irish Independent | date=22 September 2013 | accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDOC forecast that the operation would end that night. Kenyatta said to the nation that "the criminals are now all located in one place within the building...We have as good a chance to successfully neutralise the terrorists as we can hope for". He also called for patience and said that he had received "numerous offers of assistance from friendly countries."&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite news|last=Vincenot|first=Aymeric|title=Kenya forces battle to end deadly mall siege|url=https://news.yahoo.com/somalias-shebab-claims-responsibility-nairobi-mall-attack-182747786.html | date=22 September 2013| publisher=Yahoo! | agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September, Lenku assured that "we are doing anything reasonably possible, cautiously though, to bring this process to an end", and said that at least three al-Shabab fighters were killed and ten Kenyan soldiers wounded.&lt;ref name="aljazmon"/&gt; Eleven other soldiers were also injured that day,&lt;ref name="aljaztue"/&gt; and three Kenyan commandos were shot at close range.&lt;ref name=20130922nyt-gettle&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenya Forces Said to Be Securing Mall After Long Standoff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/world/africa/kenya-presses-assault-against-militants-in-mall.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=23 September 2013|first1=Jeffrey|last1=Gettleman|first2=Nicholas|last2=Kulish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that three floors of the mall collapsed during the attack, trapping some bodies inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/24/world/africa/kenya-mall-attack/index.html?sr=fb092413mallsiege145p |title=Attackers defeated in mall siege, Kenya's president says |publisher=CNN |date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Onlookers near Westgate shopping mall.jpg|thumb|right|Onlookers during fighting at the Westgate mall area.]]

On the night of 23/24 September, there was a lull in firing, but it resumed in the early morning hours. As the day progressed, police said that they were conducting a final sweep of the complex as the interior ministry released a statement that said the four-day-long assault was "very near the end." The gunmen were still inside.&lt;ref name="aljaztue"/&gt; He vowed "full accountability for the mindless destruction, deaths, pain, loss and suffering we have all undergone." The Kenyan Red Cross said that 63 people were still missing. In Nairobi, daily business returned to normal; appeals replenished [[blood bank]]s, and over US$650,000 was raised to support the affected families.&lt;ref name="end1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stefan Smith and Peter Martell |url=https://news.yahoo.com/kenya-president-says-mall-siege-over-losses-immense-165332742.html |title=Kenyan president announces end to mall bloodbath | date=25 September 2013 | publisher=Yahoo!

===Israeli involvement===
At the time of the attacks, the mall was owned by Israelis, and at least four restaurants in the mall are owned/operated by Israelis, according to Israeli sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/3-israelis-escape-as-nairobi-shopping-center-attack-continues/2013/09/22/|title=3 Israelis Escape as Nairobi Shopping Center Attack Continues|first=Yori|last=Yanover|date=22 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[International Business Times]]'' stated that Kenya and Israel had a secret security pact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/507981/20130922/nairobi-kenya-israel-westgate-al-shabaab-siege.htm "Nairobi Westgate Mall Siege: Israel and Kenya Have 'Secret Security Pact'"].

===Looting===
In the days following the initial attack, Kenyan soldiers were sent in the mall to rescue people inside and find the gunmen. Yet when the soldiers were sent in, many of them were caught on camera looting almost every shop in the mall while it was besieged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|title=Video shows Kenyan soldiers looting besieged mall|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-kenya-mall-siege-looting-20131003,0,463349.story|accessdate=6 October 2013|newspaper=latimes.com|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pflanz|first=Mike|title=Nairobi mall attack: new CCTV footage shows soldiers 'looting from cash registers'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10353759/Nairobi-mall-attack-new-CCTV-footage-shows-soldiers-looting-from-cash-registers.html|accessdate=6 October 2013|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=3 October 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two soldiers were arrested and jailed for looting mobile phones and several others were questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pflanz|first=Mike|title=Kenyan army admits that soldiers looted Westgate during siege|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10411403/Kenyan-army-admits-that-soldiers-looted-Westgate-mall-during-siege.html|accessdate=29 October 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
British police officers based in Kenya arrived on the scene to help Kenyan counter-terrorism officials, and Kenyan officials began an investigation. Security was also tightened in public places across Kenya.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/story/2013-09-21/gunmen-open-fire-in-kenya-mall-nairobi|title='25 killed' in Kenya mall siege|publisher=Itv.com|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten arrests were reported on 24 September.&lt;ref name="aljaztue"/&gt; In announcing the end of operations, Kenyatta said "forensic investigations are underway to establish the nationalities of all those involved" and suggested that a British woman and two or three US citizens "may have been involved in the attack" but that could not be confirmed at the time. [[Chief of Defence Forces (Kenya)|Kenyan Defence Chief]], General [[Julius Waweru Karangi|Julius Karangi]], said the attackers were from "different countries."&lt;ref name="end1"/&gt;

The [[National Intelligence Service (Kenya)|National Intelligence Service]] (NIS) was strongly criticised for failing to warn of the attack after ''[[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]]'' reported that two unnamed NIS officers had told it that the NIS had passed warnings about an attack to the police, and that a pregnant woman had been warned by her brother, an NIS officer, not to visit the Westgate mall that Saturday "because she would not be able to run with her bulging tummy".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Star (Kenya)|The Star]]'', 26 September 2013, [http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-137366/nis-gave-advance-westgate-warning 'NIS GAVE ADVANCE WESTGATE WARNING']&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that Kenya had prior intelligence of an attack in Nairobi, and that there were reports of NIS agents being at Westgate a few hours before the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Afua Hirsch]], ''[[The Observer]]'', 28 September 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/28/kenya-authorities-warned-of-attack Kenyan authorities had been warned about threat to buildings 'day before attacks']&lt;/ref&gt; From its start, the investigation was hampered by a wide range of conflicting eyewitness testimony about the number of attackers, the gunmen's true identities, and even their ultimate fates.&lt;ref name=Nation092813&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hard questions emerge over handling of terror attack |author=Mukinda, Fred  |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |date=28 September 2013 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Hard-questions-emerge-over-handling-of-terror-attack/-/1056/2011514/-/4wf74hz/-/index.html |accessdate=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over sixty persons were listed by the [[Red Cross]] as [[missing person|missing]], though police asserted that they were all among the dead; in news reports, some have been described as additional terrorists who escaped alive, though the Kenyan government firmly denies this.&lt;ref name=Nation092813/&gt;

It was reported on 10 October that the police, army, and intelligence services had been engaging in "blame games" after the attack. Some international forensic teams had reportedly returned home, frustrated that they were not allowed full access to the mall.&lt;ref name="Star 10 Oct"/&gt;

==Perpetrators==
Initially, the Ministry of Interior said: "It is a possibility that it is an attack by terrorists, so we are treating the matter very seriously."&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; Nairobi police chief [[Benson Kibue]] called the incident a "terrorist" attack and added that there were likely no more than 10 perpetrators involved.&lt;ref name="final assault"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/world-news/kenya-crisis-aussie-among-the-dead/story-fndir2ev-1226724454313#ixzz2fXAaYfFE |title=Troops mount final assault on Nairobi terrorists who killed 68 |publisher=News.com.au| date=23 September 2013 | agency=AP, AFP| accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Billow Kerrow]] from [[Mandera County]], Nairobi said: "It's too early to know what kind of people these are, but from what we are getting, these are people who speak in the [[Swahili language]].

An eyewitness said that the attackers had told [[Muslim]]s to leave and that non-Muslims would be targeted.

Before it was banned, a Twitter account claiming to represent al-Shabaab posted a series of messages alleging that the attacks were "just retribution" for crimes committed by Kenya's military.&lt;ref name="aljaz3"/&gt; "For long we have waged war against the Kenyans in our land, now it's time to shift the battleground and take the war to their land", said one post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/2013/09/attack-nairobi-highlights-ongoing-conflict-east-africa/ "Terrorists Challenge Kenyan Government With Mall Attack"].

A group spokesman, Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, said: "If you want Kenya in peace, it will not happen as long as your boys are in [Somalia]."&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; Another al-Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Abu Muscab, told [[Al Jazeera]] that the attack was in retaliation for Kenyan troops entering Somalia and that the timing was deliberately chosen to be a surprise attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamza Mohamed |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/09/2013923628350977.html |title=Q&amp;A: Al-Shabab defends Nairobi attack |publisher=Al Jazeera }}&lt;/ref&gt; al-Shabaab repeated their demands for Kenya's withdrawal from Somalia.

Kenyan authorities arrested dozens of people in the aftermath of the attack, but had not announced any suspects directly related to the siege. On 4 November 2013, four individuals reported to be Somali nationals were charged by a Kenyan court in relation to the attack.&lt;ref name="Fscwawma"&gt;{{cite news|title=4 Somalis Charged With Aiding Westgate Mall Attack|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/somalis-charged-aiding-westgate-mall-attack-20774005|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=AFP|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identified as Mohammed Ahmed Abdi, Liban Abdullah, Adnan Ibrahim and Hussein Hassan, they were accused of supporting terrorist elements in Kenya, harboring the gunmen in their homes, illicitly registering as a Kenyan citizen, and obtaining false identification documents.&lt;ref name="Fscwawma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wsfcona"&gt;{{cite news|title=Westgate siege: Four charged over Nairobi attack|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24804892|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the men were accused of being the shooters involved in the siege, the latter of whom Kenyan military officials asserted had all died.

A separate investigation of the attack was conducted by the New York Police Department (NYPD). The report's findings, released in December, 2013, suggested that the attack had been carried out by only four [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] terrorists, all of whom most likely escaped the mall alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Yorke |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190795929/NYPD-Westgate-Report#dow |title=Analysis of al-Shabaab's Attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya |publisher= New York Police Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an investigation conducted between Kenyan and US State Department officials suggested that while there were only four gunmen who carried out the attack, they were all likely killed during the standoff.&lt;ref name=straziuso /&gt;  Lt.

==Reactions==

===Domestic===
The attack has been described as one of the worst acts of [[terrorism in Kenya]] since the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombing of the U.S. embassy]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=Nation092813/&gt; [[President of Kenya|President]] [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] said on national television that Kenya had "overcome terrorist attacks before" and vowed to "hunt down the perpetrators wherever they run".&lt;ref name="aljaz3"/&gt;

On 10 October 2013, it was reported that President Kenyatta had admitted that the Westgate operation was "bungled", and undertook to carry out a complete investigation.

The '''World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for Peace''' "brings together [[Imam]]s and [[Rabbi]]s who formally seek to initiate [[rapprochement]] between [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]".

Three [[congress]]es have been held, in [[Brussels]], January 2005, then in [[Seville]], March 2006, and recently in [[Paris]], [[UNESCO]], in December 2008. These gatherings were attended by religious leaders, from over 43 countries, who are actively committed to the path of dialogue between their communities.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imamsrabbis.org/en/index/index Official website&lt;/ref&gt; WCIRP is a project of [[Hommes de Parole]], a [[Swiss]] foundation based in [[Geneva]], created in 2001, by Alain Michel.

==First World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace: 2005==
The ''First World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace'' took place in Brussels, Belgium from 6 January 2005. 150 Rabbis and Imams participated.  The focus of the conference was: “Islam and Judaism as instruments of peace - recognition and respect of others”.  The program was intended to be a forum for planning concrete actions and setting up of frameworks for cooperation. The goals of the meeting included 1) condemning violence perpetrated in the name of religion 2) creation of a dialog and partnership between the two religions 3) facilitate development of peaceful solutions to conflict by influential religious leaders 4) gather these leaders before the media to promote a message of peace. A final declaration, posted on the [http://www.hommesdeparole.org/ Hommes de Parole Web site] was made as follows:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;We, leaders, representatives, Rabbis and Imams of [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] religious communities who have assembled from all over the world for the first world congress of Imams and Rabbis for Peace affirm our commitment to strive to end all bloodshed and attacks against innocent human beings that offend the right to life and dignity given by the Almighty to all human beings.

#We call upon all people to combat hate, ignorance and their causes and to build together a world of peace, rich in diversity, in which all faiths and their practices are respected and protected.
#We call upon the political leaders of all peoples to work for righteous and peaceful durable solutions around the world and in particular in the Holy Land for the benefit of all peoples and faith-communities who live in the land and hold it dear.
#We pledge ourselves to pursue a shared goal of respect for human rights for all people and peoples, without which no peace can be possible.
#We call upon all religious leaders in Jewish and Muslim congregations around the world to devote regular sermons and addresses to their communities on the importance of inter-religious respect and reverence for all human life under all circumstances.
#We announce the establishment of a permanent joint committee to help implement these commitments and propose programmatic initiatives on a regular basis, in keeping with the proposals presented during the congress and in its spirit for the well being of all peoples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Second World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace: 2006==
The ''Second World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace'' took place in Seville, Spain from 19 to 22 March 2006.  The Second Congress focused on building trust and confidence necessary for joint projects, creating a forum in which religious leaders can use their influence in conflict resolution, help religious leaders to challenge the misuse of religion in fanaticism, and to create structures to facilitate practical day-to-day work in prioritized areas. A final declaration, posted on the [http://www.hommesdeparole.org/ Hommes de Parole Web site], was made as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the name of the One Creator and Master of the Universe, the Compassionate and All Merciful, we Muslim and Jewish leaders and representatives, gathered for the Second World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for Peace organized by Hommes de Parole in Seville, in the region of Andalusia - recalling the past era in which Jews and Muslims lived together here in harmony and mutual enrichment - and aspiring for such relations today and in the future.
*We accordingly affirm that contrary to widespread misrepresentation, there is no inherent conflict between Islam and Judaism, on the contrary. While modern politics has regrettably impacted negatively upon the relationship, our two religions share the most fundamental values of faith in the One Almighty whose name is Peace, who is merciful, compassionate and just; and who calls on us human beings to manifest these values in our lives and to advance them in relation to all persons whose lives and dignity are sacred. Therefore we reiterate the message we sent from our first congress, that we deplore bloodshed or violence in the name of any ideology everywhere. Especially when such is perpetrated in the name of religion it is a desecration of religion, itself and the gravest offense against the Holy Name of the Creator.
*Thus, in addition to calling upon all our co-religionists to respect all human life, dignity and rights, to promote peace and justice; we call upon them and the governments of the world and international institutions to show respect for the attachments and symbols of all religions, as well as their holy sites, houses of worship and cemeteries, particularly in the Holy Land, due to its special sensitivity.
*Accordingly, we condemn any negative representation of these, let alone any desecration, Heaven forbid. Similarly, we condemn any incitement against a faith or people, let alone any call for their elimination, and we urge authorities to do likewise.
*We recognize that there is widespread misrepresentation of our religions, - one in the other's community as well as in the world at large.
*We affirm therefore the urgent need for truthful and respectful education about each other's faith and tradition in our respective communities and schools; and call upon those responsible to promote such essential education for peaceful co-existence.
*Solemnly we pledge ourselves to the aforementioned continue to seek out one another to build bridges of respect, hope and friendship, to combat incitement and hostility, to overcome all barriers and obstacles, to reinforce mutual trust, serving the noble goal of universal peace especially in the land that is holy to us all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Third World Congress of Imams and Rabbis for peace: 15–17 December 2008, Paris, France==
