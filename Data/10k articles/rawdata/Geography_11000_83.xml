The '''A405''' is a [[dual carriageway]] road in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]]. At present, it is 4.8 miles (7.7 km) long and runs from the [[A41 road|A41]] at [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden Green]], near [[Watford]], to the [[A414 road|A414]] at [[Park Street, Hertfordshire|Park Street Roundabout]] near [[St Albans]]. It forms part of the ''North Orbital Road'', an uncompleted outer ring road around [[London]].

== Present route ==

The A405 starts at a [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] roundabout junction with the A41 at Leavesden Green. From here, it travels northeast to a crossing with Sheepcot Lane at Woodside, then east to a [[traffic light]] junction with the [[A412 road|A412]] near [[Garston, Hertfordshire|Garston]]. This 1.4-mile (2.2-km) section is known as ''Kingsway''.

From the A412, the A405 travels north, past West Hertfordshire Crematorium and Penfold Park Golf Course, to junction 6 of the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at Waterdale (2.3 miles, 3.7 km).

It then veers northeast, passing the village of [[Bricket Wood]], before meeting the [[M25 motorway|M25]] at junction 21a (3.1 miles, 5 km). Drivers wishing to access the M25 from the M1 northbound, or the M1 southbound from the M25, must use this section of the A405 as the junction between the two motorways, known as Chiswell Interchange, does not feature the corresponding slip roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/badjunctions/1-25/ |title=Bad Junctions: M1-M25 (Chiswell Interchange) |publisher=CBRD.co.uk |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the M25, the A405 continues northeast, with a roundabout junction with the B4630 for [[Chiswell Green]] (3.6 miles, 5.8 km), then another with Tippendell Lane for [[How Wood]] (4.2 miles, 6.8 km). The road terminates at Park Street Roundabout, a junction with the A414 and the [[A5183 road|A5183]] (formerly part of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]); until 2009 this was junction 1 of the [[M10 motorway (Great Britain)|M10]].

== Earlier route ==

The A405 originally took up a greater proportion of the ''North Orbital Road''. From Park Street Roundabout, it travelled east, crossing the [[River Ver]] and the [[Midland Main Line]] before meeting the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] (now the [[A1081 road|A1081]]) at [[London Colney]]. It then veered northeast, past [[Colney Heath]], before ending at the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] near [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]]. This gave it a total length of 9.7 miles (15.6 km).

In the mid-1970s, the A405 was extended from Leavesden Green. This extension ran concurrently with the A41 to [[Hunton Bridge]], then continued westwards over the [[River Gade]] and past the hamlet of Chandler's Cross. It then veered south to pass between [[Rickmansworth]] and [[Chorleywood]], crossing the [[River Chess]], the [[A404 road|A404]] (with which it had a grade-separated junction) and the [[London to Aylesbury Line|London to Aylesbury]] and [[London Underground]] [[Metropolitan line]]s. It ended just north of [[Maple Cross]], at the A412, on which the ''North Orbital Road'' continued south to [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. This took the length of the A405 to 16.3 miles (26.2 km).

Almost all of this extension was incorporated into the M25 in the mid-1980s, as the section between junction 17 and the spur at junction 19 (the aforementioned junction with the A404 becoming junction 18). At around the same time, the section of the A405 east of Park Street Roundabout was re-designated as part of the A414 (the original St Albans–Hatfield section of that road becoming the A1057), though it continues to be called the ''North Orbital Road''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6665">{{Politics of Turkey}}

Turkey has a unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey is a unitary not a federal system, and the provinces are subordinated to the centre. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the governors and city governors. Besides the governors and the city governors, other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government rather than appointed by mayors or elected by constituents.&lt;ref name=justice.gov.tr&gt;{{cite web|title=General Structure of Turkish Public Administration|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|website=justice.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321203401/http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]] for administrative purposes. Each province is divided into [[Districts of Turkey|districts]], for a total of 923 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ytr.html|title=Turkey Districts|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey is also subdivided into 7 [[Geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division.

The largely centralized structure of decision-making in Ankara is often considered an impediment to good governance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards an Education Decentralization Strategy for Turkey: Guideposts from international experience|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTURKEY/Resources/361616-1142415001082/Turkey_decentralization_strategy.pdf|author=Alec Ian Gershberg|publisher=[[World Bank]]|date=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;&lt;ref name=afd/&gt; and causes resentment in particular in ethnic minority regions.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey's Kurdish Moment|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/turkeys-kurdish-moment|author=Soner Cagaptay|publisher=The Washington Institute|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HDP arrests pose grave risks for Turkey’s future|url=http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/12/hdp-arrests-risks-turkeys-future/|author=Stefano Sarsale|publisher=Global Risk Insights|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps towards decentralization since 2004 have proved to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey.&lt;ref name=afd&gt;{{cite web|title=Decentralisation in Turkey|url=http://www.afd.fr/jahia/webdav/site/afd/shared/PUBLICATIONS/RECHERCHE/Scientifiques/Focales/07-VA-Focales.pdf|author1=Ulaş BAYRAKTAR|author2=Élise MASSICARD|publisher=[[French Development Agency|Agence française de développement]]|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Civic Participation’ or ‘Customer Satisfaction’?

The '''Al-Fakkah Field''', also known as ''Jebel Al-Fauqi'' or ''Jebal Al-Fauqi'', is an [[oil field]] located in southern [[Iraq]]'s [[Maysan Governorate]] and [[Khūzestān Province]], [[Iran]]. The oil field produced {{convert|50000|oilbbl/d}} prior to the 2003 [[Iraq War]] and is part of the Maysan oilfield complex that altogether holds reserve of {{convert|2.5|Goilbbl}}.&lt;ref name= "wsjoil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doeirq"&gt;[http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq/pdf/13_EIA_Iraq_CAB.pdf U.S. Department of Energy - Iraq Country Brief - June 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106052331/http://lugar.senate.gov/iraq/pdf/13_EIA_Iraq_CAB.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oil field is considered shared but an area of dispute between Iraq and Iran. Iraq unsuccessfully put the oil field up for bidding in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khabaronline.ir/news-31942.aspx Fakkah is a part of Iran's territory - Khabar Online - December 22nd 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720180738/http://www.khabaronline.ir/news-31942.aspx |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq and Iran dispute ==
Iraq and Iran have been in dispute over the Fakkah oil field and other adjacent fields such as the Abu Ghurab, and Buzugan since 2003. In the past, Iraq has accused Iran of "horizontal drilling" in the Fakkah field. This would entail Iran drilling into Iraqi territory to search for oil. The two sides also dispute the precise location of the border. In 2009, Iran had begun to make incursions into a disputed area of the Fakkah field but were often turned away by Iraqi workers.&lt;ref name="wsjoil"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126114921937697207 "Iranian Troops Occupy Oil Field in Iraq, Stoking Tension" – ''Wall Street Journal'' – December 19th, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2009, about a dozen Iranian troops crossed three hundred yards into Iraq and seized oil well No. 4 in the Fakkah Field, raising the Iranian flag on site. The incident infuriated Iraq who demanded that Iran withdraw. While the Fakkah oil field is considered shared, Iraq considers well No. 4 as theirs. The well was drilled in 1979 and initially produced {{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day. However, production on the well ceased in 1980 due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE60Q0T820100127 "Iranian forces fully withdraw from Iraq oilfield" – Reuters – January 27th, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/selected-headlines-91.html The Jebel Al-Fauqi Dispute PBS December 18th, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, after a series of political negotiations, Iran withdrew from oil well No. 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/world-news/middle-east/iran-army-withdraws-from-iraqi-oil-field-after-talks-1983302.html "Iran army withdraws from Iraqi oil field after talks" – ''Independent'' – December 21st 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an alternative to the [[Michigan left]] intersection.

== Design ==
Left turns are prohibited at the main intersection, which therefore requires only a two-phase signal.  Vehicles yield upon entry to the roundabout. If the roundabout has only two entrances, the entry from the main intersection does not have to yield. 

The roundabout diameter, including the center island and circulating roadway, varies from 90 feet to 300 feet depending on the speed of traffic on the approaches, the volume of traffic served, the number of approaches, and the design vehicle.

This configuration would reduce delay for the arterial street, increase capacity, and reduce the number of stops required.  The primary problem with such a configuration is driver disregard for the left turn prohibition at the main intersection.

As yet no agency has designed a complete bowtie road junction.

==Location and extent==
[[File:BD Map Rivers of North Bengal2.jpg|thumb|left|Overview map showing Chalan Beel among the main rivers in North Bengal]]
Chalan Beel is an extensive [[lowland]] area in the lower [[Atrai River|Atrai]] [[Drainage basin|basin]], and spreads across [[Singra Upazila|Singra]] and [[Gurudaspur Upazila|Gurudaspur]] [[upazila]]s on [[Natore District]], [[Chatmohar Upazila|Chatmohar]], [[Bhangura Upazila|Bhangura]] and [[Faridpur Upazila|Faridpur]] upazilas of [[Pabna District]], and [[Ullahpara Upazila|Ullahpara]], [[Raiganj Upazila|Raiganj]] and [[Tarash Upazila|Tarash]] upazilas of [[Sirajganj District]]. It consists of a series of [[beel]]s connected to one another by various [[canal|channels]] to form a continuous water body during the rainy season. Although the beel area expands into a vast water body with dense [[Aquatic plant|aquatic]] vegetation as long as the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] remains flooded during the [[monsoon]] months, it dries out in the winter months, leaving only patches of water in the central parts of this zone.&lt;ref name = "IUCN"&gt;{{cite book |date=2002 |editor1-last=Nishat |editor1-first=Ainun |editor2-last=Huq |editor2-first=S.

Chalan Beel is fast silting up. In the past it covered an area of about 1,085&amp;nbsp;km² but was reduced to 368&amp;nbsp;km² in 1909,&lt;!--by 1909, or was there a reclamation project that year? The railways came in the early 1900s. I presume there must have been survey around that time but I am not getting the details.--&gt; of which only 85&amp;nbsp;km² remained underwater throughout the year. It has since shrunk to only 26&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name = "Banglapedia"/&gt;

==History==
The most important factor dominating the river history in [[Bengal]] is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, which has been the most beneficial gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, S.C., Chief Engineer, Bengal, ''Rivers of the Bengal Delta'', Government of Bengal, 1941, reproduced in ''Rivers of Bengal'', Vol I, 2001, p. 101, published by Education Department, Government of West Bengal.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main volume of water from the [[Ganges River]] began flowing through the [[Padma River|Padma]] channel in the sixteenth century. Silt from the Padma helped in building up the southern portion of north Bengal. This is the most plausible explanation for the existence of a depression around Chalan Beel. The [[Teesta River|Teesta]] was active in the region until it changed its course in 1787. This territory lies in between the land raised in the north by the Teesta system when it was active and that in the south by the Padma.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, S.C., p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is another explanation for the creation of the depression. The Padma has been changing its course over the centuries. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the main channel of the Padma is shown as flowing through [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]]-[[Barisal District|Bakharganj]], but there also is a suggestion of another, possibly earlier channel. This channel runs through Rampur Boalia in [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]], Chalan Beel, [[Dhaleswari River|Dhaleswari]] and [[Buriganga River|Buriganga]] before meeting the [[Meghna River|Meghna]]. At that time the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] was virtually non-existent and the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] used to flow through its old channel.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Niharranjan, ''Bangalir Itihas, Adi Parba'', {{Bn icon}}, first published 1972, reprint 2005, p. 83, Dey’s Publishing, 13 Bankim Chatterjee Street, Kolkata, {{ISBN|81-7079-270-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of railways==
An estimate taken in 1945 found about 47 rivers and other waterways flowed into the Chalan Beel, a [[drainage basin|watershed]] of about {{convert|1547|sqmi|km2}}. In addition to being a [[Interchange (road)|crossroads]] for the many waterways it also served as the origin for the many rivers flowing south or east that eventually meet with the Padma or Jamuna. In the early 1900s, Chalan Beel began to be hemmed in by the construction of the [[Eastern Bengal Railway]] [[Chilahati-Parbatipur-Santahar-Darshana Line|main line]] on the west and the [[Santahar-Kaunia Line|Santahar-Bogra]] branch line on the north. The natural pattern of the water's drainage channels in this area were disrupted by the obstruction caused by the railway construction since railways in these low lands had to be built on [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]].&lt;ref name = "Railways"/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The banks of the beel are covered with dense stands of [[Saccharum spontaneum|kash]], [[Acacia nilotica|babla]], [[Arundo donax|nol]], [[Ipomoea|dhol kolmi]], [[Bombax ceiba|simul]], and [[Phoenix sylvestris|date palm]]. Seven species of frogs and one species of toad represent the amphibian fauna. Chalan Beel has a total of 34 species of reptiles include ten turtles and tortoises, nine lizards and various snake species. There are 27 species of mammals from 12 families.&lt;ref name="IUCN"/&gt;

==Pollution==
Chalan Beel has experienced the negative effects of pesticide use in the surrounding farmlands. In 2010, Bangladesh Agricultural University research, found pesticide use has increased sixfold since 1982, and the fish population of Chalan Beel has halved in the same period. A 25 kilometre highway constructed on the Beel has divided into two and caused havoc on the fish breeding by disrupting their movement. Commercial [[overfishing]], grill and drag net and other destructive fishing have harmed the fish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 December 2010 |title=Bangladesh's once plentiful rivers run low on fish |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/bangladeshs-once-plentiful-rivers-run-low-on-fish-2169547.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |agency=Agence France-Presse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722075535/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/bangladeshs-once-plentiful-rivers-run-low-on-fish-2169547.html |archive-date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arrondissements of Cameroon''' are the third-level units of administration in [[Cameroon]]. The arrondissements are organised by divisions and sub divisions of each province (now Regions).

As of 2005 (and since 1996) there are 2 urban communities ([[Douala]] and [[Yaoundé]]) divided into 11 urban districts (5 in Douala and 6 in Yaounde), 9 towns with special status ([[Nkongsamba]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamenda]], [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]], [[Edéa]], [[Ebolowa]], [[Garoua]], [[Maroua]] and [[Kumba]])
, 11 urban communes and 305 rural communes.

The councils are headed by mayors and municipal councillors who are elected. The councils have a responsibility in principle for the management of local affairs under the supervision of the State.

Under Cameroonian law, the councils provide and regulate administrative, economic and social development, define and enforce work practices to increase efficiency and improve the quality of services, promote training and retraining of municipal staff.

The ballot for the election of municipal elections is a mixed system with both a majority system and a proportional representation system. The party which obtains the absolute majority of votes wins all the seats.

If no party receives an absolute majority, the party that obtains the plurality gets half the seats, with the other half allocated in proportion to the votes of each party.

The law requires the parties to take account of the various sociological components of the district, including the representation of ethnic minorities.

Urban municipalities and special urban communities are headed by representatives appointed by decree of President of the Republic of Cameroon, who serve as mayor and the metropolitan chairman.

In urban communities, there are urban district headed by elected municipal councils, but whose functions are much reduced than in other municipalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8782">'''East Coast bias''' is the perceived tendency for [[sports broadcasting]] and [[sports journalism|journalism]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to give greater weight and attention to teams and athletes on the East Coast of their respective countries than those on the West Coast.

==Overview==
East Coast bias is used to explain perceived slights of teams and players relative to their comparable counterparts on the West Coast.&lt;ref name=filice/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

National coverage of live games is also perceived as favoring certain teams located on the Eastern side of the continent. For example, critics of what ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' chooses to program allege that the show particularly favors the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/97121 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203122138/http://www.thestar.com/article/97121 |archivedate=December 3, 2007 |deadurl=true |title=Campbell adapts to HNIC hot seat |accessdate=2007-01-10 |last=Zelkovich |first=Chris | location=Toronto | work=The Star | date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[ESPN]]'s baseball coverage has been the target of criticism because of its perceived bias towards the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/apr/13/padres-report-rotation05252/?padres|last=Krasovic|first=Tom|title=Black tinkers with pitching rotation|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Timezoneswest.PNG|thumb|Time zone map of North America]]
The North American continent is divided into seven time zones, spanning 6½ hours from [[Alaska]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Most of the continent's population (including all of the major professional sports teams) is concentrated in the four time zones of the [[contiguous United States]] and Canada west of the [[Maritimes]]; this, however, still poses a significant obstacle in that the easternmost sports teams are a full three hours ahead of their western counterparts. For sports that play in [[prime time]] according to local time zones (as is the case with [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], and [[basketball]]), this can result in games played on the West Coast starting after 10 p.m. Eastern time (and not ending until around or after 1 a.m.), while the East is sleeping and after printing deadlines for the next day's newspapers have passed. Gennaro Filice of [[SI.com]] wrote that [[Major League Baseball]]'s West Coast night games are ending as "the country's most influential scribes are catching Z after Z."&lt;ref name=filice&gt;{{cite news|last=Filice |first=Gennaro |title=Hoffman's dominance and Girardi's familiar situation |work=[[SI.com]] |date=September 7, 2006 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1053737/1/index.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wtYSIAw3?url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1053737/index.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Buccigross]] of [[ESPN]] notes that a lot of people in the East are asleep when [[National Hockey League]]'s West night games are going on, resulting in lower television ratings for those West Coast games, which in turn contributes to the lack of national broadcasts of West games.&lt;ref name=buccigross&gt;{{cite news|last=Buccigross |first=John |title=Time to give the West its due |date=February 2, 2010 |work=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/notebook/_/page/buccigross_100202/nhl-east-coast-bias-john-buccigross-looks-balance-nhl-scales |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61D9XseKF?url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/notebook/_/page/buccigross_100202/nhl-east-coast-bias-john-buccigross-looks-balance-nhl-scales |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the major media hub is the East Coast city of [[New York City|New York]], with ESPN and [[NBC Sports]] having their hubs in the neighboring state of [[Connecticut]] (although [[Los Angeles]] also serves as a significant hub on the West Coast). Canada's two major media hubs, [[Toronto]] (for English-language media) and [[Montréal]] (for French), are also both in the Eastern Time Zone. Buccigross wrote that an imbalance is understandable from Eastern writers, considering they are influenced by their close proximity and easier access to the happenings in the East.&lt;ref name=buccigross/&gt;  The East is home to nearly half of the country's population and is both more densely populated and was settled and developed much earlier than the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verducci |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Verducci |title=Case Closed |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=May 13, 2002 |url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=With+his+intimidating+entrance+and+a+changeup+from+hell%2C+-+05.13.02+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=425853013&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1025739%2F1%2Findex.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w5rGv4Zc?url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire%3D%26title%3DWith%2Bhis%2Bintimidating%2Bentrance%2Band%2Ba%2Bchangeup%2Bfrom%2Bhell%2C%2B-%2B05.13.02%2B-%2BSI%2BVault%26urlID%3D425853013%26action%3Dcpt%26partnerID%3D289881%26fb%3DY%26url%3Dhttp://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/m |archivedate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] sportscaster [[Joe Buck]] attributes the shift to the economics of running a business: "If you think there is a perceived East Coast bias, guess what? You're right. That's where people are watching, that's where the numbers are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cesar |first=Dan |title=Did "East Coast bias" sink Series ratings? |date=November 5, 2010 |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/dan-caesar/article_6f55fa57-7973-5097-9c1a-e0f9ee8a5386.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wtcecIbc?url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/dan-caesar/article_6f55fa57-7973-5097-9c1a-e0f9ee8a5386.html |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN ombudsman [[Le Anne Schreiber]] wrote that fans should forget about expecting equity in teams the network selects to broadcast. "It is long proven in NBA and NFL and MLB that spreading the wealth to 30 or 32 teams is a prescription for deflating ratings," said Len DeLuca, ESPN senior vice president for programming.&lt;ref name=schreiber&gt;{{cite web |last=Schreiber |first=Le Anne |authorlink=Le Anne Schreiber |title=Geography lesson: Breaking down the bias in ESPN's coverage |date=August 15, 2008 |work=ESPN.com |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=schreiber_leanne&amp;id=3534299 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wtfo0QkS?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=schreiber_leanne&amp;id=3534299 |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecocity Builders''' is a 501c non profit located in [[Oakland, California]] that provides advocacy, consulting, and education in [[Urban planning#Sustainable development and sustainability|sustainable city planning]] with a focus on access by proximity and pedestrian-oriented development. Ecocity Builders also implements urban design projects utilizing a large network of alliances with city governments, businesses and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. Ecocity Builders' approach is based the work of founder [[Richard Register]], an American artist, peace activist and urban theorist.

==Core Principles==

Ecocity Builders is primarily concerned with promoting the creation of [[ecocity|ecocities]], a phrase first coined by Richard Register at the 1st International Ecocity Conference in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/2014/07/14/firsts-observing-our-ecocity-influence-unfolding/ |title=Firsts: Observing our ecocity influence unfolding |author=Richard Register |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.T.A. Pickett, M.L. Cadenasso, and Brian McGrath, ‘’Resilience in Ecology and Urban Design: Linking Theory and Practice for Sustainable Cities.’’ (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013), pp. 290-219&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders defines an ecocity as an "ecologically healthy human settlement modeled on the self-sustaining resilient structure and function of natural [[ecosystem]]s and living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/why-ecocities/ecocity-definition/ |title=Ecocities: Definition |publisher=Ecocity Builders |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecocity can encompass any size of settlement, from neighborhood or village up to metropolis, that functions in harmony with the ecosystems of which it is part. These greater environmental systems include the [[Drainage basin|watershed]], [[bioregion]], and ultimately, of the planet, as well as human social systems such as local, regional, national and world economic, governmental, and cultural exchange systems.

[[Biometrics]] is central to the Ecocity concept through the analogy of the cities as living organisms. Cities (including their inhabitants) exhibit and require systems for movement (transport), respiration (processes to obtain energy), sensitivity (responding to its environment), growth (evolving/changing over time), reproduction (including education, construction, planning and development, etc.), excretion (outputs and wastes), and nutrition (need for air, water, soil, food for inhabitants, materials, etc.).

Ecocities exhibit characteristic design elements such as pedestrian-oriented "nodes" or centers of resources and social interaction, mixed-use planning, pervasive natural features (gardens, urban agriculture, parks), de-emphasis on individual vehicular transit, and equitable access to resources. Register's ecocities are influenced by the [[arcology]] movement including an emphasis on hyperstructures—large, complex interconnected buildings. Register has published collections of his extensive drawings of ecocity plans and interventions in several books (see “Sources”).

==History and Early Years==

Ecocity Builders was founded by Richard Register in 1992 in order to further specific aims of the first International Ecocity Conference (Berkeley, 1990). The first conference was convened by the Urban Ecology group, an organization also founded by Richard Register. Ecocity Builders went on to involve many of the same key actors as Urban Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us: History |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/about-us/history/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecocity Builders' early years were characterized by a number of local projects in the [[San Francisco East Bay]], primarily [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. These projects included creek daylighting Cordonices Creek, Slow Streets, and community projects.

===Creek Daylighting===

Ecocity Builders flagship project included one of the earliest daylighted and [[Stream restoration|restored creek beds]] in the United States. The [[Codornices Creek]] project, 1994, removed the water channel from its cement culvert along the Albany/Oakland border and created a mile-long park. Ecocity Builders collaborated with the [http://urbancreeks.org/ Urban Creeks Council], who applied for and received $25,000 from the Department of Water Resources Board to fund the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codornices Creek |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/codornices-creek/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving the World |author=Richard Register |url=http://www.culturechange.org/issue10/rregister.html |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second lower half of the creek park was restored in 2004 on a budget of $2.1 million under the auspices of the [http://www.codornicescreekwatershed.org/projects.htm Codornices Creek Watershed Council].

===Depaving===

Ecocity Builders helped plan and provided support for a variety of small to medium-sized depaving projects in Berkeley. Examples include removing five parking spaces at University Avenue Homes' low income residence for a garden, and Halcyon Commons.&lt;ref name="Richard Register, 2006"&gt;Richard Register, ''Ecocities: Building Cities in Balance with Nature'' (Gabriola Island, BC, Canada: New Society Publishers, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The latter converted a 28 space parking lot into a community-designed mini-park featuring a large grassy area surrounded by flowering shrubs and trees, a picnic area, and a tire swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depaving |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/depaving/ |accessdate=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow Streets===

Starting in 1979 Richard Register and other Berkeley activists began advocating the City of Berkeley for traffic-calming street plans based on the Australian "slow ways" streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/past/milvia-slow-street/&lt;/ref&gt; The Milvia Slow Street, part of the City of Berkeley's Bicycle Boulevard network, was finally designed under their guidance in 1990. The design covers roughly six blocks of residential street in which 30 curb bulb-outs were placed to narrow the street at intersections and mid-block locations. These bulb-outs and planted islands create a serpentine design, which requires vehicles to slow and negotiate a winding path along the street. Official studies confirmed the Milvia Slow Street to have a significant calming impact on vehicle speed and volume along the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berkeley Bicycle Boulevard Design Tools and Guidelines, Chapter 5, pp. 5.1-5.3 |date=2000-04-13 |url=http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/uploadedFiles/Public_Works/Level_3_-_General/ch5.pdf |accessdate=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecocity District Mapping===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ecocity Builders urban villages map Berkeley.jpg|thumbnail|Urban villages mapping of Berkeley, CA]] --&gt;Richard Register piloted a method for identifying “urban villages” in large urban areas in his book ''Ecocity Berkeley'' (1987). He proposed the eventual densification of these areas to create more compact, efficient urban entities where goods and services can be accessed via walking and biking.

Vol 7., Issue 1, (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The results identified actual active urban nodes (clusters of commercial, social and transit activity) as opposed to the on-the-book zoning for commercial/transit centers. They also identified barriers in these areas to being “complete” service access, such as a lack of large grocery store in [[West Oakland, Oakland, California|West Oakland]], and lack of integrated transit in [[Montclair, Oakland, California|Montclair Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecocity Mapping |publisher=Ecocity Builders |url=http://ecocitybuilders.org/projects/current/ecocity-mapping/ |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and Advocacy===

In Berkeley Ecocity Builders successfully co-authored and lobbied for policies that are currently enforced, including the Ecocity Amendment to the 2001 General Plan, the Solar Greenhouse Ordinance, and the Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===International Ecocity Framework and Standards (IEFS)===

The [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]'s [https://www.bcit.ca/construction/ School of Construction and the Environment] and Ecocity Builders worked together to develop a scientific rubric for evaluating the Ecocity status of a human settlement. The rubric is based on 12 environmental, social, and resource-based indicators of urban health. The [http://www.ecocitystandards.org/ IEFS] forms the basis for several other partnerships and projects aiming to measure, map, and act on these indicators.

===Ecocitizen World Map Project===

The Ecocitizen World Map Project is a suite of tools and methods that uses PUMIS and GIS technology to explore, understand, and measure holistic urban health from a citizen’s perspective. The project provides an online mapping platform allowing residents to access and combine local, community-uploaded data with open-government data on key indicators such as air and water quality, access to transit, crime, and cultural amenities. The indicators measured by mapping align with the IEFS and can be used to evaluate a city or neighborhood’s ecocity status.

The first Ecocitizen World Map Project pilots were conducted in April 2014 in the cities of Cairo and Casablanca. Students and community members participated in "bootcamps" to learn PUMIS surveying techniques and conducted parcel audits in the neighborhoods of Roches Noires and Imbaba. Initial surveying focused on water use.

The participatory approach to data collection enables stakeholders to acquire previously unknown data and is designed to empower local communities to engage in relevant issues, giving them incentive to become involved in finding solutions to existing problems.

This Ecocitizen World Map Project is a public-private partnership led by Ecocity Builders in collaboration with principal initial partners the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Esri]], the Association of American Geographers, Eye on Earth (a partnership of [[UNEP]] + [[Abu Dhabi]] Environmental Data Initiative), along with local academic partners, [[NGO]]s and community organizations. The project's initial three pilot cities include [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]] (supported by a grant from the OAS’ Sustainable Communities in the Americas Initiative), [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] (supported by a grant from [http://www.eoesummit.org/ Eye on Earth).]

===Advising and Consulting===

Ecocity Builders provides a set of [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/policy/ policy development and advocacy tools] as well as contracting as an adviser for projects worldwide. Ecocity Builders and Richard Register have consulted on construction, planning and development in [[Auroville]], [[India]]; [[Changwon]], [[South Korea]], [[Willits, California|Willits]], [[California]], [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Huaibei]], [[China]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], and [[Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city|Tianjin Ecocity]], [[China]].

===Ecocity World Summit Series===

Chief ongoing project of Ecocity Builders is the biennial conference series known as the [http://www.ecocityworldsummit.com|Ecocity World Summit] (formerly the [http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Ecocity Conference Series]). The series focuses on key actions cities and citizens can take to rebuild human habitat in balance with living systems. The conference focuses on design, planning, data-gathering, and governance of creating sustainable, equitable cities. This Ecocity Summit series, begun in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]] in 1990, was a first of its kind and is now the longest continuously running conference on ecological towns, cities and villages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/ International Conference Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Past World Summits have featured a wide range of leaders and innovators, including environmentalist [[David Brower]]; Apollo 14 astronaut [[Edgar Mitchell]]; [[Rusong Wang]], member of the Chinese Peoples Congress and head of the environmental sciences division of the Chinese Academy of Science; India’s animal rights champion Ambika Shukla; CEO and Chairperson of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Dr. Naoko Ishii; former San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]], architect/philosopher [[Paolo Soleri]]; and [[Denis Hayes]], director of the original national Earth Day in 1970 and keynote for the first Ecocity Conference.

The 2015 Summit will take place in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in October 2015.

'''Antoine Émile Ernest Desjardins''' (30 September 1823, [[Noisy-sur-Oise]] – 22 October 1886, Paris) was a French historian, [[geographer]] and [[archaeologist]]. He was a younger brother of historian Abel Desjardins (1814–1886).

In 1856 he began teaching classes in Latin [[epigraphy]] at the [[Lycée Napoleon]] in Paris, and from 1861 taught courses in geography at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. For several years he conducted archaeological research in Italy, [[Egypt]] and regions along the [[Danube]]. In 1875, he became a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]].&lt;ref name=SS&gt;[http://cths.fr/an/prosopo.php?id=214 Desjardins, Ernest Émile Antoine] Sociétés savantes de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RhhKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=%22Ernest+Desjardins%22+%22Noisy-sur-Oise%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y72p15P2Oa&amp;sig=uLDftCALx7bMZrdMY0ckC7JCLC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_vyzopzKAhWCHT4KHe1aDwQ4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ernest%20Desjardins%22%20%22Noisy-sur-Oise%22&amp;f=false Walford's Antiquarian, Volume 10] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he was appointed professor of epigraphy and Roman antiquities at the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Auteur:Ernest_Desjardins Ernest Desjardins] fr.

Worldwide '''Geographic Location Codes''' (GLCs) list the number and letter codes [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]] should use in designating geographic locations anywhere in the [[United States]] or abroad in [[computer program]]s. Use of standard codes facilitates the interchange of [[machine-readable data]] from agency to agency within the federal community and between federal offices and state and local groups. These codes are also used by some companies as a coding standard as well, especially those that must deal with federal, state and local governments for such things as [[tax]]es. The GLCs are administered by the [[U.S. General Services Administration]] (GSA).

The '''Geography Cup''' is an [[online]], [[international]] competition between the United States and the [[United Kingdom]], with the aim of determining which nation collectively knows more about [[geography]]. It was also intended to raise awareness of the importance of world geography in the [[modern world]]. Any resident of the U.S. or UK could participate to test their own geographic knowledge and to support their nation. The first (and so far only) competition took place between 12 November and 31 December 2006 to coincide with [[Geography Awareness Week]], the third week in November.&lt;ref name="GAW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geographyaction/habitats/gaw.html |title=National Geographic Geography Awareness Week |accessdate=2007-02-03 |work=National Geographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

==Creation==
The Geography Cup was created in late 2006 by two geography enthusiasts: Roger Andresen from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and Daniel Raven-Ellison from [[Reading, Berkshire]]. Both became committed to expanding [[General public|public]] awareness of the importance of geography after seeing the results of [[Opinion poll|poll]]s illustrating Americans' and Britons' startling lack of geographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=Christian Science Monitor
|date=2006-12-13
|accessdate=2007-01-06}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A poll of young Americans conducted in the United States  by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in 2006 found that only 37% of those polled could find [[Iraq]] on a map, and half could not even find the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="NGpoll"&gt;{{cite web

Andresen and Raven-Ellison created the competition for two main reasons. One reason was to determine whether people who live in the United States or people who live in the United Kingdom knew more about world geography. However, the main reason was to encourage people to learn more about world geography and to understand the importance of geography.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The two creators plan to hold the competition [[yearly]] beginning in the third week in November to coincide with Geography Awareness Week, established in the United States by [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="GAW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

==Quiz==
Any citizen of the USA or the UK was eligible to participate in the contest. Upon signup, the [[website]] determined which country a user lived in based on their [[IP address]] and automatically put the user into the correct [[team]]. The [[quiz]] consisted of thirteen random, geography-related questions that had to be answered in a total of two minutes. The first ten questions consisted of placing randomly selected [[country|countries]] onto a blank [[political map]]. The final three questions consisted of geography-related trivia questions that were answered by selecting the correct country on the [[blank map]]. Each user could practice, affect their own score, and learn about geography by playing as many times as they wanted to, but only three plays per 24-hour period could affect their nation's score.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

The randomly selected countries could be any country (or [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]]) in the world. This included the large and well-known regions ([[Russia]], [[Canada]], United States, etc.) as well as smaller and more obscure nations ([[Palau]], [[Djibouti]], [[Togo]], etc.). Most participants had little trouble recognizing the major [[Europe]]an and [[Asia]]n countries but many people on both teams had trouble locating small [[Pacific Islands]] and some [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African]] countries.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|title=US's online geographers don't look out of place|work=Guardian Unlimited|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-12-16|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1973280,00.html#article_continue|accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivia questions were sometimes related directly to geography, e. g., "[[Kiribati|Made up of 33 atolls, which country straddles both the equator and the International Date Line?]]". However, some were about current events to test if participants knew where, geographically, news stories were taking place, e. g., "[[North Korea|Which Asian country recently made its first test of a nuclear weapon?]]".&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

Due to the large difference in [[population]] between the United States and the United Kingdom, the [[Score (game)|score]] of each team was determined by an average [[percentage]] based on the percentage scores of each individual player. After each game, a player could see how he or she affected their nation's score and their own personal percentage. Because there were 13 questions, each question was worth approximately 7.7%.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

===2006 final score===
The USA won with a final [[accuracy]] score of 62.368% after trailing for a few days, while the UK lagged behind slightly at the end with an accuracy of 57.947%. The USA had 41,885 participants while the UK team had 10,820, indicating about 30% greater per capita participation in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Website problems===
Users in Britain using [[Internet Explorer]] reported some problems with the website. Also, some US and UK residents were rejected or put into the incorrect team because their [[internet service provider]] used overseas [[Server (computing)|servers]]. Finally, after the surge of media attention following the [[Reuters]] and [[Christian Science Monitor]] articles, the number of users exceeded the capacity of the servers, causing a temporary suspension of the competition.&lt;ref name="SLN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningnet.co.uk/ubb/Forum5/HTML/007152.html |title=Geography Cup |accessdate=2007-02-19 |date=2006-12-24 |work=Geography Forum |publisher=Staffordshire Learning Net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072854/http://www.learningnet.co.uk/ubb/Forum5/HTML/007152.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sponsors===
The Geography Cup was sponsored by '''A Broader View''', founded by Roger Andresen to decrease geographical ignorance with geography [[puzzles]] and [[game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abroaderview.com/about_us.htm |title=A Broader View: About Us |accessdate=2007-02-02 |last=Andresen |first=Roger |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129013314/http://www.abroaderview.com/about_us.htm |archivedate=2007-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sponsored by '''Give Geography Its Place''', founded by Daniel Raven-Ellison and David Rayner to raise awareness of the importance geography in [[UK media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Support===
The Geographic Alliance in [[Nevada]] (GAIN), part of National Geographic EdNet, encouraged its members to participate in the competition in the belief that "It is only fitting that these two countries compete in a geography competition, as they both share the same widely-publicized affliction." Polls in the United States, including the National Geographic-Roper poll, and similar polls in the UK, which include a magazine poll cited by the [[BBC]], illustrate a glaring lack of geographic knowledge by young people on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name="NGpoll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Join Team USA in the 1st Annual Geography Cup!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">'''Hermann von Wissmann''' (Born 2 September 1895 in [[Etzweiler]]; died 5 September 1979 in [[Zell am See]]) was a German-Austrian explorer of Arabia.

==Life==

The son of the African explorer [[Hermann Wissmann|Hermann von Wissmann]] (with the same name), he studied in geography in Vienna and then made a name for himself with his research work concerning the problem of hill farmers in Ennstal. Between 1931 and 1939 he launched a number of expeditions, accompanied by Daniel van der Meulen (1894–1989) to South Arabia, an area which would become the main emphasis of his research. He busied himself with the ancient geography and history of this region and developed a chronology for [[Ancient history of Yemen|ancient South Arabia]]. He was in effect the strongest advocate for the so-called ‘Long Chronology’, which maintains that the beginnings of the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean Kingdom]] date back to the 8th century BCE.

Wissmann, who also explored the south Chinese Province of [[Yunnan]] for a while, was one of the last true explorers, working in the style of the second age of discovery: he undertook long journeys by caravan, during which he worked with a compass and a pedometer, recording what he saw with a pencil. Finally, until his retirement in 1958, he was a full professor for geography at the [[University of Tübingen]].

'''ISO 3166-2:KP''' is the entry for [[North Korea]] (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for North Korea, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Nampo|1 metropolitan city]], [[province-level divisions of North Korea|1 capital city, 1 special city, and 9 provinces]]. All of them except the metropolitan city are province-level subdivisions. The three special administrative regions, i.e., the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]], the [[Mount Kumgang Tourist Region]], and the [[Sinuiju Special Administrative Region]], are not listed.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|KP}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of North Korea. The second part is two digits:
* 01: capital city
* 02&amp;ndash;10: provinces
* 13: special city
* 14: metropolitan city

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Johann Georg Kohl''' (28 April 1808, in [[Bremen]] – 28 October 1878) was a German [[travel writer]], [[historian]], and [[geographer]].

== Life ==
Son of a wine merchant, he attended a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Bremen, and then studied law at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]].  When his father died in 1830, he had to break off his studies, and spent six years working as a tutor in [[Courland]].  He then traveled to [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]] and other parts of Russia.  In 1838, he returned to Germany and settled in [[Dresden]] from where he visited much of Europe and wrote about his experiences.

==Future Theories==
Kohl's main scientific work, ''Der Verkehr und die Ansiedlungen der Menschen in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der Gestalt der Erdoberfläche'' (Transportation and settlement of people and their dependence on surface terrain) (1841, 1850) is regarded as the founding document of modern transport and urban geography.  Using Moscow as an example, he formulated a mathematical theory for the development of spherical cities and how eventually these cities would develop skyscrapers and underground shopping centers. Similarly, also fundamental to the theoretical geography was his ''Die geographische Lage der Hauptstädte Europas'' (The Geographical Location of the Capitals of Europe) (1874).

== Travels in Britain ==
In 1842, Kohl visited York. He wrote a lengthy description of the Minster and York's Quaker community 
(see pp.62-69 in Palliser and Palliser ''eds.'' 1979 ''York as They Saw It: From Alcuin to Lord Esher''. William Sessions Limited.

== Travels in America ==
From 1854 to 1858, he traveled in the United States. He prepared some valuable maps for the U.S. government, and at the request of the [[United States Coast Survey]] prepared two reports:  ''History of the Discovery of the U. S. Coast'' and the ''History and Investigation of the Gulf Stream'' (Bremen, 1868).&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Kohl, John George |year=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Washington and at [[Harvard]], Kohl made friends with many writers (including [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Washington Irving]]) and scholars (including [[George Bancroft]], [[Charles Bennett Deane]] and [[Louis Agassiz]]).  Kohl's book ''Reisen in Canada und durch die Staaten von New York und Pennsylvanien'' (Travels in Canada and the states of New York and Pennsylvania; 1856) is still consulted for historical study into [[Pennsylvania Dutch]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On his return to Europe, he settled in [[Bremen]] where he was appointed city librarian in 1863.&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Kohl, Johann Georg|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kapustin Yar''' ({{lang-ru|Капустин Яр}}) is a [[Russia]]n rocket launch and development site in [[Astrakhan Oblast]], between [[Volgograd]] and [[Astrakhan]].  It was established by the [[Soviet Union]] on 13 May 1946 and in the beginning used technology, material and scientific support from defeated [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Numerous launches of test rockets for the Russian military were carried out at the site, as well as [[satellite]] and [[sounding rocket]] launches. The town of [[Znamensk, Astrakhan Oblast|Znamensk]] was built nearby to serve the missile test range.

==History==
The 4th Missile Test Range "Kapustin Yar" was established by a decree of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] "''On Questions of Jet Propelled Weapons''" on 13 May 1946. The test range was created under the supervision of General-lieutenant [[Vasily Voznyuk]] (commander of the range 1946-1973) in the desert north end of the Astrakhan region. The first rocket was launched from the site on 18 October 1947; it was one of eleven German [[V-2 rocket|A-4s]] that had been captured.

The State R&amp;D Test Range No 8 (GNIIP-8, "test range S") was established at Kapustin Yar in June 1951.

Five atmospheric [[nuclear test]]s of small power (10-40 kt) were performed over the site in 1957-1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://kapyar.ru/index.php?pg=404&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1959 Kapustin Yar was the only publicly known Soviet missile test range. Non-Soviet observers believed at first that [[Sputnik 1]] and [[Sputnik 2|2]] launched from the site.&lt;ref name="ley195910"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1959-10/Galaxy_1959_10#page/n71/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy | date=October 1959 | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Ley, Willy | pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the further growth and development, Kapustin Yar became a [[Spaceport|cosmodrome]], serving in this function since 1966. The rate of space launches was very low, usually 1-2 a year and during the Soviet era, it hosted only the two smallest launch vehicles, the R-12 and R-14 derived Kosmos boosters. There were no space launches at all from 1988-1998. The town of Znamensk was established to support the scientists working on the facilities, their families and supporting personnel. Initially this was a [[closed city|secret city]], not shown on maps and requiring official permission to visit.

Evidence of the importance of Kapustin Yar was obtained by Western intelligence through debriefing of returning German scientists and spy flights. The first such flight reportedly{{who|date=September 2018}} took place in mid-1953 using a high flying [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] aircraft of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The UK Government has never admitted such a flight took place nor have any of the supposed participants provided direct evidence&lt;ref&gt;Lashmar, Paul: "Spy Flights of the Cold War" Sutton Publishing 1998 {{ISBN|0-7509-1970-1}} pp 76-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedlow, Gregory W and Welzenbach, Donald E: "[https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/u2.pdf The CIA and the U-2 Program, 1954-1974]" History Staff Centre for the Study of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its role as a development site for new technology, Kapustin Yar is also the site of numerous Soviet-era [[UFO]] sightings and has been called "Russia's [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]".&lt;ref&gt;Featured in the 2005 ''[[UFO Files]]'' documentary episode "Russian Roswell" which aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial '''Lake Connecticut''' formed over what is now [[Long Island Sound]] and coastal [[Connecticut]] at the fore edge of the ice sheet of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], as the lobe of the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] began to retreat, some 18 to 20,000 years before present. It was dammed by the [[terminal moraine]] that now forms the spine of [[Long Island]] and [[Fishers Island]]. About 15,000 [[Before Present|BP]], the moraine dam that impounded Lake Connecticut failed; the outlet, known as The Race for its tidal [[rip current]]s, lies between the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of Long Island and Fishers Island. For a time, much of the lake bed was exposed to wind-driven erosion: the cue is found in soundings that reveal regional [[Unconformity|unconformities]] in the sediment bed of Long Island Sound.

The fore-edge lake formed by glacial meltwater expanded to be about the same size as present-day Long Island Sound; it may have been connected at times with similar freshwater lakes in [[Block Island Sound]] and [[Buzzards Bay]], while sea level was low. The fairly shallow average depth of 78 feet (24 m) of today's Long Island Sound is the result of fine lake-bottom sediments deposited as glacial outwash slowed in Lake Connecticut. Suspended as [[rock flour]], the fine sediments would have rendered Lake Connecticut a turquoise blue-green.

The end of Lake Connecticut was marked by a series of intervals of salt water incursion after about 15,000 [[Before Present|BP]] and subsequent refreshening, as rising sea levels and [[isostatic rebound]] of land depressed by the former weight of ice sheets adjusted to one another.

===Dartmoor===
{{details|topic=Dartmoor's tors|List of Dartmoor tors and hills}}
[[File:Saddle tor to Hey tor pano.jpg|Panorama of some of Dartmoor's tors in the snow|right|thumb]]
Dartmoor represents one of the largest areas of exposed granite in the United Kingdom, covering an area of 368 square miles (954 square kilometres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm Dartmoor National Park Authority website. Retrieved 12 October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805074307/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/index/aboutus.htm |date=5 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a chain of granite stretching through Cornwall, as far as the [[Isles of Scilly]].

Some of the more durable granite survived to form the rocky crowns of Dartmoor tors. One of the best known is at [[Haytor]], on the eastern part of the moor, whose granite is of unusually fine quality and was quarried from the hillside below the tor during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its stone was used to construct the pillars outside the [[British Museum]] in London, and to build [[London Bridge]]. The last granite to be quarried there was used to build [[Exeter]] War Memorial in 1919.

[[Ten Tors]] is an annual weekend [[hiking|hike]] on Dartmoor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22177">Many traditional place names were changed in [[British Raj|India during British rule]], as well as a limited number during earlier Muslim conquests. Ever since the [[United Kingdom|British]] left [[India]] in 1947, many cities, streets, places, and buildings throughout India have been changed back to their original names over the decades. Certain traditional names that have not been changed, however, continue to be popular.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">'''Map algebra''' is a set-based [[algebra]] for manipulating [[geographic]] data, proposed by Dr. [[Dana Tomlin]] in the early 1980s.  It is a set of primitive operations in a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) which allows two or more [[Raster graphics|raster]] [[Layers (digital image editing)|layer]]s ("maps") of similar dimensions to produce a new raster layer (map) using algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction etc.

Depending on the spatial neighborhood, GIS transformations are categorized into four classes: ''local'', ''focal'', ''global'', and ''zonal''. Local operations works on individual raster cells, or [[pixel]]s. Focal operations work on cells and their neighbors, whereas global operations work on the entire layer. Finally, zonal operations work on areas of cells that share the same value. The input and output for each operator being map, the operators can be combined into a procedure or script, to perform complex tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographic Information Systems and Science|author=Longley|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|ISBN=978-0-470-72144-5|pages=414–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When map algebra is performed in cells from local operations, different types of operations can be used:
* Arithmetic operations uses basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Statistical operations uses statistical operations such as minimum, maximum, average and median.
* Relational operations compares cells using functions such as greater than, smaller than or equal to.
* Trigonometric operations uses sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine between two or more raster layers.
* Exponential and logarithmic operations use exponent and logarithm functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=GISGeography|title=Map Algebra-Global, Zonal, Focal and Local Functions|url=http://gisgeography.com/map-algebra-global-zonal-focal-local/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major GIS systems use map algebra concepts, including [[ERDAS Imagine]] and [[ArcGIS]]. ArcGIS 10 implements Map Algebra in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]; functions are imported Python methods and Python's overloading capability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3.4. Special method names¶|url=https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html|website=The Python Language Reference|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for operators. For example, rasters can be multiplied using the "*" arithmetic operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esri|first1=Inc.|title=ArcGIS 10.0 Help|url=http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//00p600000002000000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some examples, in [[MapBasic]]:
&lt;source lang="MapBasic"&gt;
# demo for Brown's Pond data set
# Give layers
#  altitude
#  development – 0: vacant, 1: major, 2: minor, 3: houses, 4: buildings, 5 cement
#  water – 0: dry, 2: wet, 3: pond

# calculate the slope at each location based on altitude
slope = IncrementalGradient of altitude

# identify the areas that are too steep
toosteep = LocalRating of slope
  where 1 replaces 4 5 6
  where VOID replaces ...

# create layer unifying water and development
occupied = LocalRating of development
  where water replaces VOID

notbad = LocalRating of occupied and toosteep
  where 1 replaces VOID and VOID
  where VOID replaces ... and ...

roads = LocalRating of development
  where 1 replaces 1 2
  where VOID replaces ...

nearread = FocalNeighbor of roads at 0 ... 10

aspect = IncrementalAspect of altitude

southface = LocalRating of aspect
  where 1 replaces 135 ... 225
  where VOID replaces ...

sites = LocalMinimum of nearroad and southface and notbad

sitenums = FocalInsularity of sites at 0 ... 1

sitesize = ZonalSum of 1 within sitenums

bestsites = LocalRating of sitesize
  where sitesize replaces 100 ... 300
  where VOID replaces ...

'''NVA''' is an arts organisation and charity based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. It was founded in 1992 by [[Angus Farquhar]], a former member of the group [[Test Dept]]. The company's name is an acronym of ''nacionale vitae activa'', a Latin term meaning 'the right to influence public affairs'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/about/ About NVA.] Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is best known for its dramatic, large-scale environmental artworks in Scottish natural landscapes, building on the site-specific performances that Farquhar created with Test Dept. These works have included ''The Secret Sign'', ''The Path'', ''The Storr'' and ''Half Life''. The works are designed to involve local communities and to incorporate regeneration aspects that will benefit the landscapes in the future. For example, improvements were made to the footpaths around The Storr as part of the preparation for that work.

== ''The Secret Sign'' ==

''The Secret Sign'' took place at night on 9–16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near [[Loch Lomond]]. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows blacked out) to the site of the work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots. They were then escorted through the glen by members of the company. Various artistic interventions were visible along the way, including lights, sounds, birds of prey and live performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+secret+sign/ ''The Secret Sign''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Path'' ==

''The Path'' was a two-hour night-time walk that took place from 19 May – 4 June 2000 at Glen Lyon in Perthshire. Like ''The Secret Sign'' it featured light, sound, performance and music, including Buddhist chant by Ani Choying Drolma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+path/ ''The Path''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Storr'' ==

''The Storr'' took place at night from 1 August – 17 September 2005 at [[The Storr]], a rocky hill in [[Trotternish]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]. Audience members were bussed to the site from bases in [[Portree]] and [[Staffin]] and kitted out with head torches and walking sticks. They were then led up to the base of the Old Man of Storr, a natural rock formation. Like the earlier works, the walk was marked by lights, sounds, music and performance. The work contained music by [[Geir Jenssen]] and [[Paul Mounsey]], live performance by [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] singer Ann Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet [[Sorley MacLean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+storr+unfolding+landscape/ ''The Storr''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of ''The Storr'' included a series of [[LED]] stars which together made up the largest light sculpture ever seen in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1532752,00.html Call of the wild]". ''The Guardian'' 21 July 2005. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of mounting the work was £1 million.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

== ''Half Life'' ==

''Half Life'' took place at [[Kilmartin Glen]], [[Argyll]] from 4–16 September 2007, and was a collaboration between NVA and the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. It consisted of two parts: a daytime element, where visitors could explore a series of sites and installations based around known and rarely seen prehistoric landmarks; and a night-time element, consisting of an outdoor production staged in a forest location at the entrance to the glen, centred on a sculptural set constructed from felled logs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/half+life/ ''Half Life''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''White Bike Plan'' ==

In April 2010 NVA re-enacted Witte Fietsenplan (White Bike Plan), a free transport programme by the Provos, the Dutch counter culture movement of the 1960s. NVA released 50 white bicycles across the city, which were available for the audience of Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art to travel between venues for the duration of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/witte+feitsenplan+white+bike+plan-24/ ''White Bike Plan''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Glasgow Harvest'' ==

NVA hosted the first Glasgow Harvest in August 2010 at the Hidden Gardens. Glasgow Harvest was a celebration of urban farming, and encouraged visitors to participate in a mass open-air meal prepared using their home-grown ingredients.
Visitors were invited to contribute to an immense jam wall, sample edible punk haircuts, and submit to competition the creative containers they had used to grow plants. Glasgow's allotments made 12 different soups and 20 local schools participated in the Double Rubble Chip Challenge - making chips at Harvest from potatoes they had grown from seed in their playgrounds.

== ''Speed of Light'' ==
Speed of Light was a major [[Edinburgh International Festival]] 2012 commission, one of Scotland's signature contributions to the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad|Olympic cultural programme]]. Conceived and produced by NVA, the transformation of [[Arthur's Seat]], [[Edinburgh]]'s iconic mountain, combined innovative public art and sport. Using energy-harvesting technologies to illuminate walkers and specially designed battery-powered light suits worn by runners, Speed of Light harnessed collective action to create a multi-layered night-time animation. NVA's Speed of Light also investigated the physical and emotional aspects to endurance running and the extent to which the power of the mind can override physical pain. A series of related blogs, web portraits, events, lectures and co-commissions were presented in partnership with eight of the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed of Light: Overview|url=http://nvaspeedoflight.org.uk/#!/page/2/Overview|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Olmsted Brothers''' company was an influential [[landscape]] [[architectural firm]] in the [[United States]], established in 1898 by brothers [[John Charles Olmsted]] (1852–1920) and [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] (1870–1957), sons of the eminent [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=Charles E.|title=The Olmsted Firm—An Introduction|url=http://www.olmsted.org/the-olmsted-legacy/the-olmsted-firm/an-introduction|publisher=Olmsted.org|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Olmsted Brothers inherited the nation's first landscape architecture business from their father [[Frederick Law Olmsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1898-1980: Olmsted Brothers|url=https://tclf.org/pioneer/olmsted-bros|publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This firm was a successor to the earlier firm of '''Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot''' after the death of their partner [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] in 1897. The two brothers were among the founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) and played an influential role in creating the [[National Park Service]]. Prior to their takeover of the firm, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. had worked as an apprentice under his father, helping to design projects such as [[Biltmore Estate]] and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] before graduating from [[Harvard University]]. The firm employed nearly 60 staff at its peak in the early 1930s. Notable landscape architects in the firm included [[James Frederick Dawson]] and Percival Gallagher.&lt;ref name="tlcf"&gt;{{cite web| title=Percival Gallagher| url=http://tclf.org/content/percival-gallagher| publisher=The Cultural Landscape Foundation| accessdate=2012-04-11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050114/http://tclf.org/content/percival-gallagher| archivedate=2012-02-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sirs"&gt;{{cite web| title=Percival Gallagher| url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=12622E21190UU.7082&amp;profile=all&amp;uri=link=3100006~!105700~!3100001~!3100002&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=2&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;term=Gallagher%2C+Percival%2C&amp;index=| publisher=Smithsonian Institution Research Information System: Archives, Manuscripts and Photographs Catalog| accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Olmsted family member in the firm, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., retired in 1949.&lt;ref name="easton"&gt;{{cite news| title=Masters Of Green| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2003/0427/cover.html| author=Valerie Easton| date=27 April 2003| work=[[The Seattle Times]]| publisher=seattletimes.com| accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm itself remained in operation, moving from  Brookline in 1980 and continuing in Fremont, NH until 2000. This created one continuous firm from 1858-2000.&lt;ref name="end"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/nov/05/frederick-law-olmsted-americas-green-giant/ |title=America's Green Giant |last=Filler |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Filler |date=November 5, 2015 |volume=62 |number=17 |page=16 |journal=[[New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office and archives==
"Fairsted" -- the firm's 100-year-old business headquarters and design office -- has been carefully preserved as the [[Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site]], located on {{convert|7|acre|ha|3}} of landscaped grounds at 99 Warren St., [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaitzevsky|first1=Cynthia|title=Fairsted: A Cultural Landscape Report for the Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fairsted.html?id=9N3jb8ow6OYC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers excellent insights into the practice of large-scale landscape design and engineering. The site also houses an archive (access by appointment only) of the firm's designs, plant lists, and photos for hundreds of projects.

==Design work==
The Olmsted Brothers completed numerous high-profile projects, many of which remain popular to this day, including park systems, universities, exposition grounds, libraries, hospitals, residential neighborhoods and state capitols. Notable commissions include the roadways in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] and [[Acadia National Park]]s, [[Yosemite Valley]], Atlanta's [[Piedmont Park]], a residential neighborhood in [[Oak Bay, British Columbia|Oak Bay]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]: [[Uplands, Greater Victoria|Uplands]]; entire park systems in cities such as [[Cleveland Metroparks|Cleveland]], [[Olmsted Portland park plan|Portland]], [[Seattle]],&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990502&amp;slug=2958185| work=The Seattle Times| author=David B.

The Olmsted Brothers also co-authored, with [[Harland Bartholomew]], a 1930 report for the [[Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce]] entitled "Parks, Playgrounds, and Beaches for the Los Angeles Region" encouraging the preservation of outdoor public space in southern California.&lt;ref name="edenbydesign"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hise, Greg |author2=Deverell, William | title=Eden by Design: The 1930 Olmsted-Bartholomew Plan for the Los Angeles Region| publisher=University of California Press |date=7 June 2000 |isbn=978-0-520-22415-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report was largely ignored by the city, but became an important urban planning reference.

==Economy and infrastructure of Macau ==

[[Economy of Macau]] &amp;ndash; Macau's economy has grown dramatically since the opening up of its casino industry to foreign competition in 2001. With the influx of affluent Chinese tourists in the region since its handover in 1999, foreign investments in Macau has transformed the territory into one of the world's largest gaming centres.  In 2007, Macau surpassed Las Vegas to be the world's biggest gambling centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/business/worldbusiness/23cnd-macao.html|title=Macao Surpasses Las Vegas as Gambling Center|last=Barboza|first=David|date=2007-01-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tourism hence plays a big part of the city's economy, especially since the relaxation of Chinese travel restrictions. In 2015, this city of 646,800 hosted nearly 30.7 million visitors, 67% of which were from mainland China. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Domaines geologiques france.png|thumb|Paris Basin (Bassin parisien)]]
The '''Paris Basin''' is one of the major geological regions of [[France]] having developed since the [[Triassic]] on a basement formed by the [[Variscan orogeny]].  The [[sedimentary basin]] is a large sag in the [[craton]], bordered by the [[Armorican Massif]] to the west, the Ardennes-Brabant axis to the north, the [[Massif des Vosges]] to the east, and the [[Massif Central]] to the south.&lt;ref name=Duval&gt;Duval, B.C., 1992, Villeperdue Field, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978-1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, {{ISBN|0891813330}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|252}}

==Extent==
The region usually regarded as the Paris Basin is rather smaller than the area formed by the geological structure. The former occupies the centre of the northern half of the country, excluding Eastern France. The latter extends from the hills just south of [[Calais]] to [[Poitiers]] and from [[Caen]] to the brink of the middle Rhine Valley, east of [[Saarbrücken]].

==Geography==
The countryside is one of plains and plateaux of limited altitude. In the south-east and east the plain of ''[[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]'' and the ''Seuil de Bourgogne'' (Threshold of Burgundy) differential erosion of the strata has left low scarps with the dip slopes towards the centre. The varying nature of the clays, limestones and chalk gives rise to the characteristics of the regions such as ''Champagne Humide'' (Damp Champagne), ''Champagne Pouilleuse'' (poor Champagne),&lt;ref&gt;''Pouilleuse'' means 'lousy' that is, 'infested with lice' but its meaning has broadened in use to include 'down and out'. This is a region of thin, chalk soils and little surface water. The epithet indicates the extreme poverty of the region when the name was acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Pays de Caux]]'' and the ''[[Pays de Bray]]''.

==Structure==
The Paris Basin is a [[Geology|geological]] [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] of [[sedimentary rock]]s. It overlies geological [[Stratum|strata]] disturbed by the Variscan orogeny and forms a broad shallow bowl in which successive marine deposits from throughout periods from the [[Triassic]] to the [[Pliocene]] were laid down, their extent generally diminishing with time. Based on analysis of [[fossil]]s recognized in the Paris Basin strata during the 1820s and 1830s, the pioneering geologist [[Charles Lyell]] divided the [[Tertiary]]  into three ages he named the Pliocene, the [[Miocene]] and the [[Eocene]].

To the west, the strata folded by the Variscan rise from below the more recent marine deposits in the hills of [[Brittany]] and, to the east, the [[Ardennes]], [[Hunsrück]] and [[Vosges]]. To the south, it borders on the [[Massif Central]] and the [[Morvan]]. To the north, its strata link into those of the bed of the [[English Channel]] and south-eastern [[England]]. Other boundaries lie on ridges in more recent deposits and scarps such as the [[Côte d'Or (escarpment)|Côte d'Or]] (on an [[Alpine orogeny|Alpine]] [[Geological fault|fault line]]) and the Hills of [[Artois]] which overlie the margin of [[London-Brabant Massif]].

==Oil Fields==
Two large oil fields are located in the basin, one is the '''Chaunoy Field''', the other is the '''Villeperdue Field''', discovered in c limestone]] 1850 m deep.&lt;ref name=Duval/&gt;{{rp|251}}

'''Ras el Ain''', ({{lang-ar|راس العين}}) (Lit. Fountain-head; The head of the Spring&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1881, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp00conduoft#page/10/mode/1up 10]&lt;/ref&gt;), is a place abounding with immense fountains, with reservoirs and aqueducts {{convert|6|km|mi|sp=us}} south of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], and ca. {{convert|77|km|mi|sp=us}} south of [[Beirut]], in the [[South Governorate]] (Liban-Sud), in the municipality of Batouliyat. The place lies in a very green and fertile plain, about one kilometer from the sea coast. It is a popular tourist destination, owing to its [[artesian well]]s fed by underground springs and collected in stone reservoirs that have been maintained through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middleeast.com/tyre.htm General Tourist Information about Tyre]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the main source of water for ancient Tyre since Phoenician days. One of the reservoirs fed the arched aqueducts of the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], and which once stretched all the way to Tyre. Remains of these aqueducts, exhibiting strong and excellent masonry, with round arches and a continuous [[cornice]] above them, can still be seen today,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Robinson (scholar)| Robinson]] and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp.  [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/386/mode/1up 386]–388&lt;/ref&gt; and a short stretch of the original aqueduct is still used today in Tyre's present-day waterworks.
[[File:A-343 - Ras al-Ayin in South Lebanon.jpg|thumb|'''Ras al-Ain in 1900''' ([[Gertrude Bell]] Archive, Newcastle University)]]
A reference to this place is mentioned in the 3rd century [[Mosaic of Rehob]] as ''Rosh Mayya'' (Fountain-head).&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Safrai (1977). ''Marginal Notes on the Rehob Inscription'', Zion: pub. by Historical Society of Israel, p. 17 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' (SWP) described it: "A village built of stone, containing about 100 [[Metawileh]], in the plain, surrounded by gardens of figs, pomegranates, mulberries, and olives. Five mills in the village, and near, in working order,a good many ruined."&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/50/mode/1up 50]-51&lt;/ref&gt;

They further noted about the water-ways: This is the spring-head which supplied ancient Tyre by means of a long aqueduct. The springs are enclosed in four strongly-built reservoirs, as at [[Tabgha|Tabghah]], by means of which the water is raised to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet, in order that an aqueduct with a slight fall should be able to carry it to the neighbourhood of Tyre. The walls of these reservoirs are of large well-dressed [[ashlar]]-work, and vary in thickness. The stones are joined and coated on the inside with strong cement. The principal reservoir is octagonal in shape, with sides of irregular length. Its diameter measures sixty-six feet, and it is twenty-five feet above the ground. The retaining walls are very thick, and show traces of modern repairs in one part. They have so gentle a slope that it is not difficult to ride up on to the broad border eight feet wide round the spring."&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/69/mode/1up 69]-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red line''', or "to '''cross the red line'''", is a phrase used worldwide to mean a figurative [[point of no return]] or [[line in the sand (phrase)|line in the sand]], or "a limit past which safety can no longer be guaranteed."&lt;ref name="def of phrase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redline |title=Redline - Definition |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmer&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323993804578612210634238812 |title=The Long History of the Phrase 'Red Line'  |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |author=Ben Zimmer |date=July 19, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120155955/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323993804578612210634238812 |archivedate=2015-01-20 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origin of the phrase in English traces back to the "[[Red Line Agreement]]" in 1928 between largest oil companies of Britain, the USA and France at the time of the end of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. At the time of signature, the borders of the empire were not clear and to remedy the problem an Armenian businessman named [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], took a red pencil to draw in an arbitrary manner the borders of the divided empire.

The expression remained significant to global diplomacy and was reused during the UN's founding after the WWII, especially in the Anglophone world. Uniquely, in France one would "cross the yellow line" (''franchir la ligne jaune'').&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Melnik, Professor of Geopolitics. [http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/diplomatie-ou-vient-expression-franchir-ligne-rouge-alexandre-melnik-836058.html Diplomatie : d'où vient l'expression "franchir la ligne rouge" ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of usage==

In Israel, the phrase was notably used as a political metaphor by Foreign Minister [[Yigal Allon]], in 1975, when said that Washington "has managed to draw a red line which all the Arab countries know they must not cross - that America is not going to sacrifice Israel for the sake of Arab support."&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; [[Yitzhak Rabin]] later used the phrase to refer to the line past which the Syrian army should not be allowed to cross after the 1976 occupation of [[Lebanon]].  On September 27, 2012 at the 67th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York in a speech addressing Iran's nuclear program Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] publicly added a red line to a prepared bomb cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Heller, Associated Press. [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-assembly-israel-iran-idUSBRE88Q0GI20120927 Netanyahu draws "red line" on Iran's nuclear program]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ben Yagoda]], a professor of English and journalism at the [[University of Delaware]], in 1987, there are references to "red lines" in conflicts between Chad and Libya, and in a 1999 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, Muslim clerics in Iran are reported to draw a "'red line for the revolution' that no one should cross."&lt;ref name="NG red line"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130507-red-line-obama-syria-mccain-chemical-weapons/ | title=red line | publisher=National Geographic News | date=7 May 2013 | author=Smith, Roff | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011195735/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130507-red-line-obama-syria-mccain-chemical-weapons/ | archivedate=2017-10-11 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These references occurred earlier as well, appearing a Milwaukee Sentinel article of 26 January 1984 regarding French intervention in Chad and a "red line" held by French forces in southern Chad.&lt;ref&gt;"French plans attack invading Chad rebels," Milwaukee Sentinel, 26 January 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been used by U.S. diplomats going back to the 1990s. For example, U.S. officials, quoted by Reuters news agency in May 1994, used the term in reference to negotiations with North Korea over the withdrawal of reactor fuel; and Martin Walker in ''The Guardian'' used the same phrase in June, in reference to statements by United States officials.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Pagani, "U.N. Nuclear Experts in North Korea," Reuters wire article, 19 May 1994;  Martin Walker, "North Korea 'has crossed red line' " ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State Warren Christopher used the phrase in reference to NATO control over the peace-keeping mission in Bosnia on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' on 22 October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;"1,000 Muslims start trek home as Bosnian truce finally holds," Toledo Blade, 23 October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Barack Obama]] used the phrase on August 20, 2012, during the [[Syrian civil war]] in relation to [[chemical weapons]],&lt;ref name="The Spectator magazine 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/mind-your-language/8927441/that-red-line-were-not-supposed-to-cross-what-exactly-is-it/ | title=What, exactly, is a 'red line'? | publisher=The Spectator magazine | date=8 June 2013 | accessdate=30 July 2013 | author=Wordsworth, Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation."&lt;ref name="Off-the-Cuff response"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/world/middleeast/obamas-vow-on-chemical-weapons-puts-him-in-tough-spot.html?_r=1&amp; | title=Off-the-Cuff Obama Line Put U.S. in Bind on Syria | publisher=The [[New York Times]] | date=May 4, 2013 | accessdate=30 July 2013 | author=BAKER, PETER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; 

In the US, the phrase then became a source of contention when political opponent [[John McCain]] said the red line was "apparently written in disappearing ink," due to the perception the red line had been crossed with no action.&lt;ref name="NG red line"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; On the one year anniversary of Obama's red line speech the [[2013 Ghouta attacks|Ghouta chemical attacks]] occurred.

==Thin Red Line==
[[File:Robert Gibb - The Thin Red Line.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Thin Red Line (painting)|''The Thin Red Line'']] (1881) by Robert Gibb, depicting the 93rd Regiment fighting off Russian cavalry at the Battle of Balaclava in 1854]]
From British English, an entirely different figure of speech for an act of great courage against impossible order or thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack, or the "[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|thin red line]]", originates from reports of a [[Red coat (British army)|red-coated]] Scottish regiment at the [[Battle of Balaclava]] during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name="Military history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.argylls.co.uk/history/the-93rd-sutherland-highlanders-1799-1881/thin-red-line-1854/236-qthe-thin-red-lineq-balaklava-1854 | title=Overview, "The Thin Red Line" Balaklava, 1854 | publisher=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders | accessdate=30 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HnsP3EHO?url=http://www.argylls.co.uk/history/the-93rd-sutherland-highlanders-1799-1881/thin-red-line-1854/236-qthe-thin-red-lineq-balaklava-1854 | archivedate=2 July 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; A journalist described a "thin red streak tipped with a line of steel" with the appearance of the [[93rd (Highland) Regiment]] and parts of the Turkish army as they stood before (and repelled) a vastly superior force of Russian cavalry. The reference was soon shortened into the thin red line,&lt;ref&gt;Dot Wordsworth, The Spectator magazine, dated 8 June 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; and famously described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in the poem ''[[Tommy (Kipling poem)|Tommy]]'' as "the thin red line of 'eroes [heroes]."&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt;

Notable literary uses included [[George Orwell]] who in ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' invented a book-within-a-book called the "''Hundred Page History of Britain'', a 'nasty little duodecimo book' of 1888, which declared anachronistically that Napoleon 'soon found that in the “thin red line” he had more than met his match.'"&lt;ref name="The Spectator magazine 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/mind-your-language/8927441/that-red-line-were-not-supposed-to-cross-what-exactly-is-it/ | title=What, exactly, is a 'red line'? | publisher=The Spectator magazine | date=8 June 2013 | accessdate=30 July 2013 | author=Wordsworth, Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] later used ''[[The Thin Red Line (novel)|The Thin Red Line]]'' as the title of his 1962 novel about a World War II battle, helping to further popularize its usage.

Its popularity of this use in the USA has increased since the Andrew Marton's [[The Thin Red Line (1964 film)|1964 movie]] and [[Terrence Malick]]'s [[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|1998 movie]] of Jones's novel, the latter of which was ranked as one of the 10 best action and war films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/thin-red-line-action |title=The Thin Red Line: No 10 best action and war film of all time  |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=David Thomson |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea has been extended in the 20th century to apply to police officers, as [[The Thin Blue Line]], in reference to the frequently blue color of police uniforms.

[[File:Sihoť, Karlova Ves, Bratislava (6).JPG|thumb|A small, inceptive, river island at [[Sihoť]], [[Bratislava]],

A '''river island''' is any [[river flood|exposed]] land within a [[river]]. Properly defined it excludes [[shoal]]s between seasonally varying flows and may exclude semi-coastal islands such as in [[River delta|delta]]s.  

These islands result from changes in the course of a river such as interactions with a [[tributary]] or the opposing [[fluvial]] actions of [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] and/or [[river erosion|erosion]] such as forming a natural [[cutting (transportation)|cut]] and [[meander]]. Nascent vegetation-free [[sandbar]]s and [[mudflats]] may dissipate and shift or build up into such islands through [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] and which may be assisted through [[terraforming|artificial reinforcement]] or natural factors such as, [[reed (plant)|reed]]s, [[palm tree|palm]]s, [[evergreen|evergreen trees]] or [[Weeping willow (tree)|willows]], to large examples covering many square kilometers, examples of which are given below.

__TOC__
{{clr}}

== Regional nomenclature ==
{{Wiktionary|towhead}}
The term "'''towhead'''" implies a little [[islet]] or [[sandbar]] within a river (most often the [[Mississippi River]]) having a grouping or thicket of trees, and is often used in the [[Midwestern United States]]. Many rivers, if wide enough, can house considerably large islands. The term "towhead" was popularised by [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.

In England, a river island in the [[Thames]] is referred to as an "[[ait]]" (or "eyot").

== Largest and smallest ==
[[File:FridayIsle01.JPG|thumb|[[Friday_Island,_River_Thames|Friday Island]] is an example of a very small island with a solid-foundations [[house]]]]
[[Majuli]] in India, being non-coastal and being between two channels of one river is recognised by the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as world's largest example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Majuli|first1=River Island|title=Largest river island|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-river-island-|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but [[Ilha do Bananal]] meets the same qualifications and is much larger. [[Umananda Island|Umananda]] is among contenders as the smallest permanently-inhabited river island with fixed dwellings at 0.02&amp;nbsp;km². Majuli and Umananda lie in the [[Brahmaputra River]]. Many as tiny as Umananda or smaller, inhabited, exist in the [[Amazon basin]] and [[Bangladesh]]. On [[River engineering#Canalization of rivers|canalised rivers]] such as the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Seine|Seine]] one-home islands of permanent-materials homes exist such as [[Monkey_Island,_Bray|Monkey]], [[Friday_Island,_River_Thames|Friday]], [[Hollyhock Island|Holm]] and [[D'Oyly Carte Island|D'Oyly Carte]] islands, as canalisation reduces the erosion of the islands and in particular limits the height of [[flash flooding]] by maintaining substantial "heads" of water through [[Barrage (dam)|barrages]].

'''Robeson Channel''' ({{coord|82|00|N|061|30|W|region:CA-NU_type:waterbody_scale:2000000|display=inline,title|name=Robeson Channel}}) is a body of water lying between [[Greenland]] and [[Canada]]'s northernmost island, [[Ellesmere Island]]. It is the most northerly part of [[Nares Strait]], linking [[Hall Basin]] to the south with the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north.

It is about {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} in length and between {{convert|11|to|18|mi|abbr=on}} wide. [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]], the world's most northerly permanently inhabited settlement, lies nearby.

It was named during the 1871 [[Polaris Expedition]], for American [[George Robeson]], Secretary of the Navy in the [[Ulysses S. Grant]] administration.

'''Space Saves Society ''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Charitable organisation|charity]] organisation seeking to apply space-borne earth observation technology to monitoring and protecting the [[water resources]] of our planet.

The organisation, founded and based in London, UK seeks to achieve international collaborations upon its causes, which include studying major water resources. The members of the organisation expect to deliver insights upon climate changes and the underlying mechanisms involved. Emphasis is placed on both the environmental prosperity and equilibrium, as well as on the wellness of the surrounding populations, the depending commerce, the health risks and other parameters believed to be interdependent.

The activities of the organisation vary among various risks but also emphasise on the importance of sustainable management to lead to effective economic growth, along with environmental prosperity.

==Motivation and background==
Satellite technology has been used for [[earth observation]] since the beginning of the first space missions realised. During the past few years this area of research has been gaining a lot of interest, so as to manage environmental risks and natural hazards (tsunamis, floods, volcanoes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/ Natural Hazards-Nasa Earth Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;). The fear of climate changes, the consideration that most of the complex environmental mechanisms remain still very little explored and understood and the linkage between environmental indicators and health well-being,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eo2heaven.org EO2HEAVEN Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hereplusproject.eu/ HEREPLUS Project]&lt;/ref&gt; pose urgent needs for amplifying our monitoring techniques. Many initiatives have been granted in order to support environment-oriented consortiums, while additionally many international collaborations have been formed, namely [[GEOSS]] and GMES
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmes.info/ Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Saves Society follows the work of many international organisations which also use space-borne data for gaining insights upon the environment (&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/ International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalchange.gov/ United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amesd.org/ African Monitoring of the Environment Sustainable Development (AMESD)  ]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/ World Water Assessment Program (WWAP) ]&lt;/ref&gt;
and other), and particularly focuses on the importance of water resources.

===The importance of water===
Water covers the largest percentage of our planet’s surface and it is vital for our survival. However, many areas still suffer from absence of drinking water. The Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsscc.org/ Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) ]&lt;/ref&gt; refers that “Today 2.5 billion people, including almost one billion children, live without even basic sanitation. Every 20 seconds, a child dies as a result of poor sanitation. That's 1.5 million preventable deaths each year.”

Fishery is estimated being one of the major commerce markets. Worldwide Estimated total international trade in fishery commodities’ total production have shifted from 122.201 (1000 t) in 1999 to 142.287 (1000 t) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ]&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient management could optimise this commerce but would also ensure that human activities in the water areas do not interfere with the ecosystem’s equilibrium.
  
Water resources have not been so widely studied as compared to land and atmosphere, mainly because there exist more difficulties in the first case scenario. That’s the reason why studies in such cases are usually realised via UAVs and in-situ measurements. However, recent developments in [[water remote sensing]] allows more detailed analysis and understanding of the status of the water regions studied and of the effects that this can give rise to.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10991541 SMOS satellite tracks Pakistan floodS ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means and Areas of focus===
Space Saves Society makes uses of satellite imagery and satellite radiometer readings. The first, being acquired across a variety of EM spectrums, enables the identification of information otherwise impossible to be perceived, such as changes in recent changes in water volume, pollution, changes in concentration and vegetation, etc. Radiometer readings vary among surface temperatures, currents, salinity and other properties which can be used as indicators for understanding the changes and stresses an area might undergo. 
 
Based upon the above technology, Space Saves Society focuses its studies on the following six main areas:

*Water Pollution – level of water pollution, coastal and other
*Sustainable Water Resources – exploration of new water resources, found underground, etc.
*Natural Hazards – potential hazards (like tsunami) may be detected in quite early stages
*Ecosystems' Equilibrium – monitoring of in depth vegetation and photosynthetic activity can be used as indicators of the underwater life quality
*Changes in Water Volume - monitoring changes in bathimetry and volume
*Natural Resources Economy – helping optimisation and management of fisheried commerce

===Activities and projects===
Being recently founded, Space Saves Society has yet to create any charitable activities for the public to attend and support. However, the organisation has already announced its first project, named Five Lakes Water Protection Global Project. The project is going to be initiated on July 1, 2011 and will collect and analyse data of five of the most significant (in size, volume and near-by populations) lakes worldwide: 
*Baikal (Russia)
*Victoria (Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya)
*Titicaca (Bolivia, Peru)
*Superior (United States, Canada)
*Tanganyika (Burundi, Congo, Tanzania, Zambia)

'''Tel Or''' ({{lang-he-n|תל אור}} - Hill of Light), known today as '''Qaryet Jisr Al-Majame''' ({{lang-ar|قرية جسر المجامع}} - The Community Bridge Village), was a [[company town]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] which housed the predominantly-Jewish workers at the [[Naharayim]] hydroelectric power plant on the Transjordanian side of the Palestine-Transjordan border.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town was settled in 1930 and lasted until its depopulation in 1948 during the Arab-Israeli War, when it was overrun by Iraqi and Transjordanian forces.

The 1948 war also forced 70 Palestinian families, from a village just meters away on the other side of the Jordan River, to populate the abandoned site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.7iber.com/politics-economics/jisr-al-majameh-in-baqoura-a-jordanian-land-with-unknown-owners|title=Jisr Al-Majameh in Baqoura, a Jordanian land with unknown owners|language=Arabic|work=7iber|accessdate=16 October 2018|date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:NaharayimBaqura.jpg|thumb|Nahariyim/Baqoura region in 1953 and now]]
In 1928 the engineer [[Pinhas Rutenberg|Pinhas Rotenberg]] began the construction of the Naharayim hydroelectric power plant on the territory of Transjordanian Emirate. The plant was constructed at the point of intersection of the Yarmouk and the Lower Jordan river, and its purpose was to utilize the flow of water in order to generate electricity for towns and cities of [[Mandatory Palestine]].

In the vicinity of the power plant, the village of Tel Or was built, being the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. Tel Or was designated for residence of the permanent employees of the power plant and their families, aiming to create an agricultural village at the Eastern border of the Land of Israel. Employees of the power station also farmed thousands of dunams of land and sold some of the produce at a company workers’ supermarket in [[Haifa]]. Due to its relative isolation and despite the limited number of resident families, the village included a clinic, a kindergarten, and even a school, established by Yosef Hanani for the children of employees.

During the 1947-8 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, because of the difficult security situation, the Naharayim power plant ceased operation for the first time in 15 years. In violation of a November 1947 agreement between Meir and Abdullah, the [[Arab Legion]]'s 4th Battalion launched a mortar and artillery attack on the Naharayim [[Tegart fort|police fort]] and [[Kibbutz]] [[Gesher, Israel|Gesher]] on April 27–29, 1948. On the evening of April 27, the Legion began shelling the fort and kibbutz, stepping up the attack the following day. Many of the kibbutz buildings were destroyed.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews|author=Morris, B.|date=2003|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=9781860649899|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=zL_1icJwNP0C&amp;pg=PA134|page=134|accessdate=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of April 29, a Legion officer demanded the evacuation of the Gesher police fort, but was turned down. After protests to the British Mandate administration, the shelling was halted, and Abdullah was reprimanded for "aggression against Palestine territory."&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; The families of the employees were evacuated in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Yishuv forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. The village of Tel Or was shortly abandoned by the residents, who fled to Yishuv-controlled areas to the West.

An [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraqi]] brigade invaded at Naharayim area on May 15, 1948, in an unsuccessful attempt to take the Gesher kibbutz and fort.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; The power plant was occupied and looted by the Iraqi forces. After the Tel Or village and the power plant were overran by the Arab forces they were destroyed. To prevent Iraqi tanks from attacking Jewish villages in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], the sluice gates of the Degania dam were opened. The rush of water, which deepened the river at this spot, was instrumental in blocking the Iraqi-Jordanian incursion.

The remains of Tel Or are in Jordan not far from the [[Island of Peace]]. There is an ongoing project to develop a Jordan River Peace Park, spanning the border with Israel, that will include the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Jordan River Peace Park | author = EcoPeace Middle East | url = http://ecopeaceme.org/projects/lower-jordan-river/jordan-river-peace-park/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1948 war also forced 70 Palestinian families, from a village just meters away on the other side of the Jordan River, to populate the abandoned site.

'''''The Fantastic Journey''''' is an American [[science fiction]] television series that was originally aired on [[NBC]] from February 3 through June 16, 1977.

==Premise==
The series concerns a family and their associates who charter a boat out into the [[Caribbean]] for a scientific expedition.  After an encounter in the area of the [[Bermuda Triangle]] with an unnatural green cloud, the group find themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious uncharted island from which they are unable to escape.
[[File:Christina Hart Jared Martin The Fantastic Journey 1977.JPG|220px|thumb|[[Christina Hart]] as Gwenith, with Jared Martin as Varian, in "An Act of Love"]]
They encounter Varian ([[Jared Martin]]), initially disguised as an [[Arawak]] native, who is later revealed to be from the year 2230.  A 23rd-century pacifist, musician and healer, Varian explains to the travelers that, like he and many before them, they have been caught in a space/time continuum where people from the past, present, future and from other worlds are trapped, co-existing on the island in a series of "Time Zones".  The only way home can be found in a place called "Evoland", which lies "far to the rising sun".  (It was indicated in interviews of the time that Evoland was also the name of the island.) The only way to travel between Time Zones is via invisible gateways that instantaneously transport individuals or groups from one zone to another. In one episode "Beyond The Mountain" the group also encounters a second cloud, which has much the same effect, but which also splits up the group.

After the [[television pilot|initial pilot]] story, a steady group of travelers forms around Varian as ''de facto'' leader, and the series then follows this group as they travel across the many Time Zones of the island to find Evoland. On their way, they encounter people from different planets and times who are also trapped on the island and who have adapted to their plight in different ways. The pilot initially suggested the historical past would be explored; however, the producers of the show rapidly adopted a consistently futuristic tone during the series following pressure from the network. They also dropped three characters after the pilot as they wanted a more exotic group of travelers, hence the arrival of Liana and Willoway. Liana disappears from the last two episodes when Katie Saylor fell ill.

==Cast==
* Varian ([[Jared Martin]]): "A man from the 23rd century possessing awesome powers", Varian generally uses a kind of crystalline "tuning fork" device called the Sonic Energizer through which he focuses his thoughts into what is described as a sonic manipulation of matter.  The device is completely useless in anyone else's hands, and seems capable of a huge variety of tasks, from opening doors to disrupting electrical systems to large scale acts of destruction, as well as its apparently intended function as a diagnostic and healing device. Following the departure of Professor Paul Jordan at the end of the pilot film, Varian takes over as ''de facto'' leader to the travelers and adopts a parental role over Paul's teenage son, Scott (most notable in episodes such as "An Act of Love" and "Turnabout").
* Scott Jordan ([[Ike Eisenmann]]): "The 13-year-old son of a famous scientist", Scott has an excellent knowledge of Earth history and events, but is still young and has much to learn.
* Dr. Fred Walters ([[Carl Franklin]]): "A young doctor just out of medical school" whose impulsive and rather hot-headed nature acts as a counterpoint to the calm, pacifistic Varian.  A friend of Scott's father and the only other member of the group from the same time period, the athletic black physician takes the role of protective "older brother" with the young teen.
* Liana ([[Katie Saylor]]): "Daughter of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] father and an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] mother", the beautiful blond Liana possessed greater than human physical strength (due to her mother being from [[planet]] with a higher [[gravity]] than [[Earth]]) and powerful [[psychic phenomenon|psychic]] abilities (presumably due to her mixed heritage) which allow her to, among other things, [[telepathic|telepathically]] communicate with animals. Saylor left the show after the episode "Turnabout" due to illness. In the next episode "Riddles" the reason for her not being present with the group was given that she opted to stay a few days at Coriel to help the inhabitants work out their new government and would catch up with the group later.
* Dr. Jonathan Willoway ([[Roddy McDowall]]): "Rebel scientist from the 1960s" who has a mastery of computers, robotics and scientific knowledge which is quite useful to the group. He is something of a never entirely trustworthy [[black sheep]], basically a cooler version of Dr Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' without the congenital cowardice who often tends to do things for his own mysterious reasons. Over the course of the episodes, however, the black-clad Willoway comes to care about Scott and his fellow travelers and becomes more integrated into the group, although Fred makes no secret about still not trusting him which leads to a bickering [[Mr. Spock|Spock]]/[[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]]-style relationship between the two.
* Sil-El (The Felix Team&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cult.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=210:fantastic-journey&amp;catid=37:series-formats&amp;Itemid=27&lt;/ref&gt;): Liana's companion and pet, a tuxedo cat "[[Bicolor cat]]" cat with which she can communicate telepathically and who sometimes scouts ahead for her, acting as an extra set of eyes and ears.

==Production==
[[D. C. Fontana]] recalled that once the show had been commissioned, she and the producers had a very short period of time to develop and produce the show before filming commenced. Additional scenes were filmed and inserted into the pilot which introduces the Atlanteans who are the focus of Episode 2, but this new material also quickly moves off-screen the characters Paul, Eve and Jill (who were originally intended to be regulars), as the network wanted a more diverse group of travelers. Also, a subplot involving the travelers finding a 1940s Air Force pilot held prisoner by 16th century pirates was removed from the first episode.

The show benefited from a larger than normal amount of location filming, with familiar sites such as the Hollywood Hills, Zuma Beach, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA and Griffith Park Observatory all appearing in various episodes. The character Willaway was created specifically with [[Roddy McDowall]] in mind. Fortunately the actor was interested and took the role when approached.

Although airing in a time when the nation's interest in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[UFO]]s and fantasy was at a height, the show failed to last beyond the ten episodes, having been scheduled as a mid-season replacement (following the failure of another fantasy series, ''[[Gemini Man]]'') against ''[[The Waltons]]'' and ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', both very popular family shows.  NBC ordered 12 episodes to follow the revised pilot, but production ended early when it was apparent that the ratings were low. The show was either pre-empted or its time-slot changed several times during its short run. By its tenth episode, its ratings had dropped, and it was cancelled. The script for an unproduced eleventh episode, "Romulus", circulates on the Internet. Within a few months of its abrupt ending, several of the production team would be producing the thematically similar ''[[Logan's Run (TV series)|Logan's Run]]'' for the Fall 1977 season.

The '''Wide Area Augmentation System''' ('''WAAS''') is an [[air navigation]] aid developed by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to [[GNSS augmentation|augment]] the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), with the goal of improving its accuracy, integrity, and availability. Essentially, WAAS is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including [[precision approach]]es to any airport within its coverage area.&lt;ref name="FAA_WAAS_FAQ"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/faq/waas FAQ for WAAS]&lt;/ref&gt; It may be further enhanced with the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS) also known by the preferred ICAO term Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) in critical areas.

WAAS uses a network of ground-based reference stations, in [[North America]] and [[Hawaii]], to measure small variations in the GPS satellites' signals in the [[western hemisphere]]. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary WAAS satellites in a timely manner (every 5 seconds or better). Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where WAAS-enabled GPS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy.

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) calls this type of system a [[GNSS augmentation|satellite-based augmentation system]] (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs, the Indian [[GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN), the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) and the Japanese [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS), respectively. Commercial systems include [[StarFire (navigation system)|StarFire]] and [[OmniSTAR]].

==WAAS objectives==
[[File:WAAS service area.png|right|thumb|Typical WAAS service area. Dark red indicates best WAAS coverage. The service contours change over time with satellite geometry and ionospheric conditions.]]

===Accuracy===
The WAAS specification requires it to provide a position accuracy of {{convert|7.6|m}} or less (for both lateral and vertical measurements), at least 95% of the time.&lt;ref name=WASSspec&gt;FAA. [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/library/documents/media/waas/2892bC2a.pdf Specification for the Wide Area Augmentation System(WAAS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004122449/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/library/documents/media/waas/2892bC2a.pdf |date=2008-10-04 }}. FAA-E- 2892b. August 13, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Actual performance measurements of the system at specific locations have shown it typically provides better than {{convert|1.0|m}} laterally and {{convert|1.5|m}} vertically throughout most of the [[contiguous United States]] and large parts of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="WAAS_NSTB_PAN_Report_Jul06"&gt;National Satellite Test Bed (NSTB), [http://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/REPORTS/waaspan17.pdf WAAS PAN Report (July 2006)]. Retrieved November 22nd, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, WAAS is capable of achieving the required Category I precision approach accuracy of {{convert|16|m}} laterally and {{convert|4.0|m}} vertically.&lt;ref name="faa.gov"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Press Release  [http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?contentKey=4006 FAA Announces Major Milestone for Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)]. March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrity===
Integrity of a navigation system includes the ability to provide timely warnings when its signal is providing misleading data that could potentially create hazards. The WAAS specification requires the system detect errors in the GPS or WAAS network and notify users within 6.2 seconds.&lt;ref name=WASSspec/&gt; Certifying that WAAS is safe for [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR)  (i.e. flying in the clouds) requires proving there is only an extremely small probability that an error exceeding the requirements for accuracy will go undetected. Specifically, the probability is stated as 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;, and is equivalent to no more than 3 seconds of bad data per year. This provides integrity information equivalent to or better than [[Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring]] (RAIM).&lt;ref name="House_Subcommitee_0600"&gt;US House of Representatives Committee on Transportation's Subcommittee on Aviation [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/Trans/hpw106-100.000/hpw106-100_1.HTM Hearing on Cost Overruns &amp; Delays in the FAA's Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) &amp; Related Radio Spectrum Issues]. June 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===
Availability is the probability that a navigation system meets the accuracy and integrity requirements. Before the advent of WAAS, GPS specifications allowed for system unavailability for as much as a total time of four days per year (99% availability).{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} The WAAS specification mandates availability as 99.999% ([[High availability#Percentage calculation|five nines]]) throughout the service area, equivalent to a downtime of just over 5 minutes per year.&lt;ref name=WASSspec/&gt;&lt;ref name="House_Subcommitee_0600" /&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:WAAS Reference Station Barrow Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|WAAS reference station in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]]]]
As with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in general, WAAS is composed of three main segments:  the [[ground segment]], [[space segment]], and user segment.

===Ground segment===
The ground segment is composed of multiple Wide-area Reference Stations (WRS). These precisely surveyed ground stations monitor and collect information on the GPS signals, then send their data to three Wide-area Master Stations (WMS) using a terrestrial communications network. The reference stations also monitor signals from WAAS geostationary satellites, providing integrity information regarding them as well. As of October 2007 there were 38 WRSs:  twenty in the [[contiguous United States]] (CONUS), seven in Alaska, one in Hawaii, one in Puerto Rico, five in Mexico, and four in Canada.&lt;ref name="WAAS_INTL"&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/waas/news/index.cfm News release from FAA announcing WAAS expansion into Mexico and Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WAAS_CGSIC47"&gt;FAA presentation, [http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/cgsicMeetings/47/%5B12%5D%20WAAS-LAAS-CGSIC-07.pdf WAAS and LAAS status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614020313/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/cgsicMeetings/47/%5B12%5D%20WAAS-LAAS-CGSIC-07.pdf |date=2011-06-14 }} at 47th meeting of the Civil Global Positioning System Service Interface Committee, September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the data from the WRS sites, the WMSs generate two different sets of corrections: fast and slow. The fast corrections are for errors which are changing rapidly and primarily concern the GPS satellites' instantaneous positions and clock errors. These corrections are considered user position-independent, which means they can be applied instantly by any receiver inside the WAAS broadcast [[Footprint (satellite)|footprint]]. The slow corrections include long-term [[ephemeris|ephemeric]] and clock error estimates, as well as [[ionospheric delay]] information. WAAS supplies delay corrections for a number of points (organized in a grid pattern) across the WAAS service area&lt;ref name="FAA_WAAS_FAQ" /&gt;  (see [[#User segment|User Segment]], below, to understand how these corrections are used).

Once these correction messages are generated, the WMSs send them to two pairs of Ground Uplink Stations (GUS), which then transmit to satellites in the Space segment for rebroadcast to the User segment.&lt;ref name="NAS_GUS"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Airspace System Architecture, [http://www.nas-architecture.faa.gov/nas/mechanism/mech_data.cfm?mid=7054 Ground Uplink Stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828225454/http://www.nas-architecture.faa.gov/nas/mechanism/mech_data.cfm?mid=7054 |date=2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reference stations====
Each FAA [[Air Route Traffic Control Center]] in the [[U.S. state|50 states]] has a WAAS reference station, except for [[Indianapolis]]. There are also stations positioned in Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="FAA_WAAS_FAQ" /&gt; See [[List of WAAS reference stations]] for the coordinates of the individual receiving antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It needs to be changed before it can be put back here. --&gt;The space segment consists of multiple [[artificial satellites|communication satellites]] which broadcast the correction messages generated by the WAAS Master Stations for reception by the user segment. The satellites also broadcast the same type of range information as normal GPS satellites, effectively increasing the number of satellites available for a position fix. The space segment consists of three commercial satellites: ''[[Inmarsat-4 F3]]'', Telesat's ''[[Anik F1R]]'', and Intelsat's ''[[Galaxy 15]]''.&lt;ref name="prn-135-resumes"&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/augmentation-assistance/news/waas-prn-135-resumes-normal-operation-11243 WAAS PRN 135 Resumes Normal Operation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727142321/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/augmentation-assistance/news/waas-prn-135-resumes-normal-operation-11243 |date=2011-07-27 }}.

The original two WAAS satellites, named ''Pacific Ocean Region'' (POR) and ''Atlantic Ocean Region-West'' (AOR-W), were leased space on [[Inmarsat#Inmarsat-3 satellites|Inmarsat III]] satellites. These satellites ceased WAAS transmissions on July 31, 2007. With the end of the Inmarsat lease approaching, two new satellites (Galaxy 15 and Anik F1R) were launched in late 2005. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051218044320/http://www.panamsat.com/global_network/galaxy_15.asp Galaxy 15] is a [[PanAmSat]], and Anik F1R is a [[Telesat]]. As with the previous satellites, these are leased services under the FAA's Geostationary Satellite Communications Control Segment contract with [[Lockheed Martin]] for WAAS geostationary satellite leased services, who is contracted to provide up to three satellites through the year 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Announcement [http://gps.faa.gov/Library/Data/waas/March_2005.doc March 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208030033/http://gps.faa.gov/Library/Data/waas/March_2005.doc |date=2006-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third satellite was later added to the system. From March to November 2010, the FAA broadcast a WAAS test signal on a leased transponder on the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/waas/news/ FAA: New WAAS GEO to Begin Broadcasting in Test Mode in March (2010)].

In the table above, PRN is the satellite's actual Pseudo-Random Noise code.  NMEA is the satellite number sent by some receivers when outputting satellite information.  ( NMEA = PRN - 87 ).

===User segment===
The user segment is the GPS and WAAS receiver, which uses the information broadcast from each GPS satellite to determine its location and the current time, and receives the WAAS corrections from the Space segment. The two types of correction messages received (fast and slow) are used in different ways.

The GPS receiver can immediately apply the fast type of correction data, which includes the corrected satellite position and clock data, and determines its current location using normal GPS calculations. Once an approximate position fix is obtained the receiver begins to use the slow corrections to improve its accuracy. Among the slow correction data is the ionospheric delay. As the GPS signal travels from the satellite to the receiver, it passes through the ionosphere. The receiver calculates the location where the signal pierced the ionosphere and, if it has received an ionospheric delay value for that location, corrects for the error the ionosphere created.

While the slow data can be updated every minute if necessary, [[ephemeris]] errors and ionosphere errors do not change this frequently, so they are only updated every two minutes and are considered valid for up to six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DGPS on Garmin Receivers |url=http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/dgps.htm#waas |accessdate=2007-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2006}}
The WAAS was jointly developed by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the [http://gauss.gge.unb.ca/us1996frp.pdf Federal Radionavigation Program] (DOT-VNTSC-RSPA-95-1/DOD-4650.5), beginning in 1994, to provide performance comparable to category 1 [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) for all aircraft possessing the appropriately certified equipment.&lt;ref name="FAA_WAAS_FAQ" /&gt; Without WAAS, ionospheric disturbances, [[clock drift]], and satellite orbit errors create too much error and uncertainty in the GPS signal to meet the requirements for a [[precision approach]] (see [[Gps#Accuracy and error sources|GPS sources of error]]). A precision approach includes altitude information and provides course guidance, distance from the runway, and elevation information at all points along the approach, usually down to lower altitudes and weather minimums than non-precision approaches.

Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did not have the ability to provide lateral and vertical navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the [[instrument landing system]] (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. The newer system is free of huge antenna systems at each airport.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}

For some time the FAA and [[NASA]] developed a much improved system, the [[microwave landing system]] (MLS). The entire MLS system for a particular approach was isolated in one or two boxes located beside the runway, dramatically reducing the cost of implementation. MLS also offered a number of practical advantages that eased traffic considerations, both for aircraft and radio channels. Unfortunately, MLS would also require every airport and aircraft to upgrade their equipment.

During the development of MLS, consumer GPS receivers of various quality started appearing. GPS offered a huge number of advantages to the pilot, combining all of an aircraft's long-distance navigation systems into a single easy-to-use system, often small enough to be hand held. Deploying an aircraft navigation system based on GPS was largely a problem of developing new techniques and standards, as opposed to new equipment. The FAA started planning to shut down their existing long-distance systems ([[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] and [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]s) in favor of GPS. This left the problem of approaches, however. GPS is simply not accurate enough to replace ILS systems. Typical accuracy is about {{convert|15|m}}, whereas even a "CAT I" approach, the least demanding, requires a vertical accuracy of {{convert|4|m}}.

This inaccuracy in GPS is mostly due to large "billows" in the [[ionosphere]], which slow the radio signal from the satellites by a random amount. Since GPS relies on timing the signals to measure distances, this slowing of the signal makes the satellite appear farther away. The billows move slowly, and can be characterized using a variety of methods from the ground, or by examining the GPS signals themselves. By broadcasting this information to GPS receivers every minute or so, this source of error can be significantly reduced.
&lt;!-- The following paragraph is subject to deletion --&gt;&lt;!-- Why? Explain on talk page --&gt;
This led to the concept of [[Differential GPS]], which used separate radio systems to broadcast the correction signal to receivers. Aircraft could then install a receiver which would be plugged into the GPS unit, the signal being broadcast on a variety of frequencies for different users (FM radio for cars, longwave for ships, etc.).  Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.

The FAA considered systems that could allow the same correction signals to be broadcast over a much wider area, such as from a satellite, leading directly to WAAS. Since a GPS unit already consists of a satellite receiver, it made much more sense to send out the correction signals on the same frequencies used by GPS units, than to use an entirely separate system and thereby double the probability of failure.  In addition to lowering implementation costs by "piggybacking" on a planned satellite launch, this also allowed the signal to be broadcast from [[geostationary orbit]], which meant a small number of satellites could cover all of North America.

On July 10, 2003, the WAAS signal was activated for general aviation, covering 95% of the United States, and portions of Alaska offering {{convert|350|ft}} minimums.

On January 17, 2008, Alabama-based Hickok &amp; Associates became the first designer of helicopter WAAS with Localizer Performance (LP) and [[Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance]] (LPV) approaches, and the only entity with FAA-approved criteria (which even FAA has yet to develop).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/waas-approaches-coming-to-heliports/?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=a7ee70cd1a{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flttechonline.com/Current/Hickok%20and%20Associates%20Developing%20WAAS%20Approaches%20for%20Helicopters.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ainonline.com/ain-and-ainalerts/aviation-international-news/single-publication-story/browse/0/article/owners-responsible-for-private-helo-approaches/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}[mode]=1&lt;/ref&gt;  This helicopter WAAS criteria offers as low as 250 foot minimums and decreased visibility requirements to enable missions previously not possible.  On April 1, 2009, FAA AFS-400 approved the first three helicopter WAAS GPS approach procedures for Hickok &amp; Associates' customer California Shock/Trauma Air Rescue (CALSTAR). Since then they have designed many approved WAAS helicopter approaches for various EMS hospitals and air providers, within the United States as well as in other countries and continents.

On December 30, 2009, Seattle-based Horizon Air flew the first scheduled-passenger service flight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/newsroom/QXnews/QXstories/QX_20100108_104108.asp|title=Horizon Makes Aviation History with First WAAS Flight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using WAAS with LPV  on flight 2014, a Portland to Seattle flight operated by a Bombardier Q400 with a WAAS FMS from [http://www.uasc.com Universal Avionics].  The airline, in partnership with the FAA, will outfit seven Q400-aircraft with WAAS and share flight data to better determine the suitability of WAAS in scheduled air service applications.

==Benefits==
[[File:Napa GUS facility.jpg|thumb|WAAS ground uplink station (GUS) in [[Napa, California]]]]
WAAS addresses all of the "navigation problem", providing highly accurate positioning that is extremely easy to use, for the cost of a single receiver installed on the aircraft. Ground- and space-based infrastructure is relatively limited, and no on-airport system is needed. WAAS allows a precision approach to be published for any airport, for the cost of developing the procedures and publishing the new approach plates. This means that almost any airport can have a precision approach and the cost of implementation is dramatically reduced.

Additionally WAAS works just as well between airports. This allows the aircraft to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because of its ability to provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite's information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.

The above benefits create not only convenience, but also have the potential to generate significant cost savings. The cost to provide the WAAS signal, serving all 5,400 public use airports, is just under [[US$]]50 million per year.  In comparison, the current ground based systems such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS), installed at only 600 airports, cost US$82 million in annual maintenance.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} Without ground navigation hardware to purchase, the total cost of publishing a runway's WAAS approach is approximately US$50,000; compared to the $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 cost to install an ILS radio system.&lt;ref name="AOPA_welcomes_WAAS"&gt;[[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]],  [http://www.aopa.org/whatsnew/newsitems/2006/060307waas.html AOPA welcomes improved WAAS minimums]. March 7, 2006. Accessed January 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further savings can come from the nighttime closure of airport towers with a low volume of traffic. The FAA is reviewing 48 towers for such a potential reduction of services, which it estimates will save around US$100,000 per year at each tower, for a total annual savings of nearly US$5 million.&lt;ref name="House_testimony_boyer"&gt;[http://www.house.gov/transportation/aviation/05-04-05/boyer.pdf Testimony to US House Aviation Subcommitte] by Phil Boyer, dated May 4, 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks and limitations==
For all its benefits, WAAS is not without drawbacks and critical limitations:
* [[Space weather]].  All man-made satellite systems are subject to space weather and space debris threats.  For example, a solar super-storm event composed of an extremely large and fast earthbound [[Coronal Mass Ejection]] (CME) could disable the geosynchronous or GPS satellite elements of WAAS.
* The broadcasting satellites are geostationary, which causes them to be less than 10° above the horizon for locations north of 71.4° latitude. This means aircraft in areas of [[Alaska]] or [[northern Canada]] may have difficulty maintaining a lock on the WAAS signal.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University. [http://waas.stanford.edu/~wwu/papers/gps/PDF/LoPLANS02.pdf WAAS Performance in the 2001 Alaska Flight Trials of the High Speed Loran Data Channel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427104555/http://waas.stanford.edu/~wwu/papers/gps/PDF/LoPLANS02.pdf |date=2006-04-27 }}. Accessed June 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To calculate an ionospheric grid point's delay, that point must be located between a satellite and a reference station. The low number of satellites and ground stations limit the number of points which can be calculated.
* Aircraft conducting WAAS approaches must possess certified GPS receivers, which are much more expensive than non-certified units. In 2006, Garmin's least expensive certified receiver, the GNS 430W, had a suggested retail price of [[US$]]10,750.&lt;ref name="garmin_gns480_press_release"&gt;Garmin International [http://www.garmin.com/pressroom/aviation/110906.html Press Release] dated November 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* WAAS is not capable of the accuracies required for Category II or III ILS approaches. Thus, WAAS is not a sole-solution and either existing ILS equipment must be maintained or it must be replaced by new systems, such as the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS).&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration. [http://gps.faa.gov/FAQ/faq-waas.htm WAAS FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517035105/http://gps.faa.gov/FAQ/faq-waas.htm |date=2006-05-17 }}. Accessed June 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* WAAS Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches with 200-foot minimums will not be published for airports without medium intensity lighting, precision runway markings and a parallel taxiway. Smaller airports, which currently may not have these features, would have to upgrade their facilities or require pilots to use higher minimums.&lt;ref name="AOPA_welcomes_WAAS" /&gt;
* As precision increases and error approaches zero, the [[navigation paradox]] states that there is an increased collision risk, as the likelihood of two craft occupying the same space on the shortest distance line between two navigational points has increased.

==Future of WAAS==

===Improvement to aviation operations===
In 2007, WAAS vertical guidance was projected to be available nearly all the time (greater than 99%), and its coverage encompasses the full continental U.S., most of Alaska, northern Mexico, and southern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration. [http://gps.faa.gov/programs/waas/questionsanswers.htm WAAS 200ft Minimum Related Questions and Answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925215639/http://gps.faa.gov/programs/waas/questionsanswers.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}. Accessed June 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the accuracy of WAAS would meet or exceed the requirements for Category 1 [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] approaches, namely, three-dimensional position information down to 200 feet (60 m) above touchdown zone elevation.&lt;ref name="faa.gov" /&gt;

===Software improvements===
Software improvements, to be implemented by September 2008, significantly improve signal availability of vertical guidance throughout the CONUS and Alaska. Area covered by the 95% available LPV solution in Alaska improves from 62% to 86%. And in the CONUS, the 100% availability LPV-200 coverage rises from 48% to 84%, with 100% coverage of the LPV solution.&lt;ref name="WAAS_CGSIC47" /&gt;

===Space segment upgrades===
Both Galaxy XV (PRN #135) and Anik F1R (PRN #138) contain an L1 &amp; L5 GPS payload. This means they will potentially be usable with the [[GPS modernization|L5 modernized GPS signals]] when the new signals and receivers become available. With L5, avionics will be able to use a combination of signals to provide the most accurate service possible, thereby increasing availability of the service. These avionics systems will use ionospheric corrections broadcast by WAAS, or self-generated onboard dual frequency corrections, depending on which one is more accurate.&lt;ref name="FAA_GPS_Modern"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), [http://gps.faa.gov/gpsbasics/GPSmodernization-text.htm GPS Modernization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926023328/http://gps.faa.gov/GPSbasics/GPSmodernization-text.htm |date=2006-09-26 }} Page.
