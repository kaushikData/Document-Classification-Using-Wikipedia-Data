'''Animal latrines''' ('''latrine areas''',&lt;ref name=horse/&gt; '''animal toilets''', '''defecation sites''') are places where [[wildlife]] animals habitually [[defecate]] and [[urinate]]. Many kinds of animals are highly specific  in this respect and have stereotyped routines, including approach and departure.&lt;ref&gt;"Mammalogy", {{ISBN|0763762997}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LD1nDlzXYicC&amp;pg=PA562, p. 562]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of them have communal, ''i.e.'', shared, latrines.
{{TOC right}}

==Animals with dedicated defecation sites==

Animals with communal latrines include [[raccoon]]s,  [[Eurasian badger]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41393089_On_the_Fruit_Consumption_of_Eurasian_Badger_(Meles_meles)_(Mammalia_Mustelidae)_during_the_Autumn_Season_in_Sredna_Gora_Mountains_(Bulgaria) |title=On the Fruit Consumption of Eurasian Badger (Meles meles) (Mammalia: Mustelidae) during the Autumn Season in Sredna Gora Mountains (Bulgaria) |publisher=ResearchGate |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; [[deer]],&lt;ref name=deer/&gt; [[antelope]]s,&lt;ref name=ante&gt;[http://eprints.ru.ac.za/2571/1/LUNT-PhD-TR11-207.pdf "THE ROLE OF SMALL ANTELOPE IN ECOSYSTEM  FUNCTIONING IN THE MATOBO HILLS, ZIMBABWE"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232000/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/2571/1/LUNT-PhD-TR11-207.pdf |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[horse]]s,&lt;ref name=horse&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhEXRDFLK9kC&amp;pg=PA211 |title=Equine Behavior: A Guide for Veterinarians and Equine Scientists|edition=2nd |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |page=211|editor=McGreevy, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dicynodont]]s (a 240-million-year-old site is the "world's oldest public toilet").&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25126333 "Giant prehistoric toilet unearthed"], James Morgan, science reporter, ''[[BBC News]]'', 28 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A regularly used toilet area or [[dunghill]], created by many [[mammal]]s, such as [[hyrax]]es or [[mole (animal)|mole]]s, is also called a [[midden]].&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/37/8/703.abstract |title=A record of rapid Holocene climate change preserved in hyrax middens from southwestern Africa |publisher=Geology.gsapubs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10267-006-0303-y#page-1 "Establishment of the case of Hebeloma radicosum growth on the latrine of the wood mouse"], ''[[Mycoscience]]'', October 2006, Volume 47, Issue 5, pp 263–268 (click "Look inside" link)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[lizard]]s, such as yakka [[skink]]s (''[[Egernia rugosa]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nr1XjdJUmqYC&amp;pg=PA224 |title=Queensland's Threatened Animals|author =Lee Curtis|page=224 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thorny devil]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewey |first=Tanya |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Moloch_horridus/ |title=ADW: Moloch horridus: INFORMATION |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; use dedicated defecation sites.

[[European rabbit]]s may deposit their pellets both randomly over the range and at communal latrine sites.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon I.A. Latrine use by the European rabbit (Oryctolagus-Cuniculus). J Mammal 1991;72:769–775 {{doi|10.2307/1381841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function and impact==

===Territoriality===

Middens and other types of defecation sites may serve as [[territorial marker]]s.&lt;ref name=ante/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; Elaborate "dungpile rituals" are reported for adult [[stallions]],&lt;ref name=horse/&gt;  and [[deer]] bucks,&lt;ref name=deer&gt;George B. Schaller, "The Deer and the Tiger", [https://books.google.com/books?id=KOVGHXfod0wC&amp;pg=PA164 p. 164]&lt;/ref&gt; which are thought to serve for confrontation avoidance. In contrast, female and young animals exhibit no such behavior.&lt;ref name=horse/&gt;

===Sanitation===
Dedicated defecation sites are thought to be the result of sanitation-driven behavior. For example, [[spider mite]] ''[[Stigmaeopsis miscanthi]]'' constructs woven nests, and nest members defecate at only one site inside the nest.&lt;ref&gt;Yukie Sato, Yutaka Saito, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01184.x/abstract "Nest Sanitation in Social Spider Mites: Interspecific Differences in Defecation Behavior"], {{doi|10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01184.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated latrine areas observed by free-roaming horses mean that grazing area is kept parasite-free. Even stabled horses seem to have vestiges of such behavior.&lt;ref name=horse/&gt;

Herbivoral [[livestock]] is at risk of parasite/pathogen exposure from feces during grazing, therefore there is an interest in research of livestock behavior in presence of feces both of their own species, and others, including wildlife, including the dependence on defecation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/2/426.full#ref-37 "Livestock grazing behavior and inter- versus intraspecific disease risk via the fecal–oral route"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological impact===
Latrines of herbivores, such as antelopes, play an important role in ecology by providing enrichment of certain areas in nutrients. It is described that [[duiker]] and [[steenbok]] antelopes tended to defecate in exposed sites, generally on very sandy soil, while [[klipspringer]] preferred rocky outcrops, thus enriching the nutrient-deficient areas, as well as depositing plant seed there.&lt;ref name=ante/&gt;

===Raccoon latrines===
A common nuisance of  [[raccoon]]s is '''raccoon latrines''' (raccoon toilets), which may contain eggs of the worm ''[[Baylisascaris procyonis]]''. Nuisance raccoon latrines may be found in attics, on flat roofs, on logs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icwdm.org/inspection/course/InspectionUnit4d.aspx "Inspecting for Raccoon Damage"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pestcontrolnorthwest.com/nuisanceanimals.html "Nuisance Animals Around The Home"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/baylisascaris/resources/raccoonlatrines.pdf "Raccoon Latrines: Identification and Clean-up"], a  [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in research==
In addition to immediate research of animal behavior and biology, animal toilets and [[coprolite]]s are an instrument of research for not directly related purposes in [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[paleontology]]  [[climate research]], and other areas. They provide various information: plant habitats, historical information about prehistoric life and climate, etc.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/50000-year-old-animal-toilet-offers-clues-climate-change-history-1091384 "50,000 Year Old Animal Toilet Offers Clues To Climate Change History"], ''[[International Business Times]],'' February 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal latrine associates==
Some [[fungi]] are animal latrine associates. For example, ''[[Hebeloma radicosum]]'' is an [[ammonia fungi|ammonia fungus]] which associates with latrines of moles, [[wood mice]],&lt;ref name="Sagara 2006"/&gt; and [[shrew]]s.&lt;ref name="Sagara 2008"/&gt;

There is a curious association of ''[[Cucumis humifructus]]'' ("aardvark cucumber" or "aardvark pumpkin") with latrines of [[aardvark]]s. ''C. humifructus'' [[geocarpy|produces its fruit underground]], the aardvark burrows for them, and then deposits its seeds in dunghills near its habitat. The distribution of ''C. humifructus'' tends to match that of aardvark latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bgci.org/worldwide/article/111/ |title=Information Needed About the Aardvark Cucumber (''Cucumis humofructus'') |journal=BGCNews |year=1997 |volume=2 |issue=8 |author =Jeremy Hollmann |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some insects (e.g., [[termite]]s and [[dung beetle]]s)&lt;ref name=ante/&gt; feed on animal [[excrement]] and hence are natural associates of dung sites.

'''Arachnology''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[spider]]s and related animals such as [[scorpion]]s, [[Pseudoscorpionida|pseudoscorpions]], and [[Opiliones|harvestmen]], collectively called [[arachnid]]s. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are '''arachnologists'''.

The word ''[[wiktionary:arachnology|arachnology]]'' derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀράχνη}}, ''arachnē'', "spider"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.

==Arachnology as a science==
Arachnologists are primarily responsible for [[biological classification|classifying]] arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination they are sometimes referred to as 'spider experts'. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]] to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment ([[behavioural ecology]]), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats ([[faunistics]]). Other arachnologists perform research on the [[anatomy]] or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.

===Subdisciplines===
Arachnology can be broken down into more specific specialties. These topics include:
* '''[[acarology]]''' –  the study of [[tick]]s and [[mite]]s.
* '''[[araneology]]''' –  the study of [[spiders]].
* '''[[scorpiology]]''' – the study of [[scorpion]]s.

==Arachnological societies==
Arachnologists are served by a number of [[scientific societies]], both national and international in scope. Their main role is to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases to publish [[academic journals]]. Some are also involved in [[science outreach]] programs, like the ''European spider of the year'', which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.

==Popular arachnology==
In the 1970s, arachnids – particularly [[tarantulas]] – started to become popular as exotic pets. Many tarantulas thus become more widely known by their common names such as the [[Mexican redknee tarantula]] (''[[Brachypelma smithi]]'').

Various societies now focus on the [[husbandry]], care, study and captive breeding of tarantulas, and other arachnids. They also typically produce journals or newsletters with articles and advice on these subjects.

'''Astro microbiology''', or exo microbiology, is the study of [[microorganisms]] in outer space. It stems from an interdisciplinary approach, which incorporates both [[microbiology]] and [[astrobiology]]. Astrobiology's efforts are aimed at understanding the origins of life and the search for life other than on Earth. Because microorganisms are the most widespread form of life on Earth, and are capable of colonising almost any environment, scientists usually focus on microbial life in the field of astrobiology. Moreover, small and simple cells usually evolve first on a planet rather than larger, [[multicellular organisms]], and have an increased likelihood of being transported from one planet to another via the [[panspermia]] theory.&lt;ref name="PSAU"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://faculty.psau.edu.sa/m.rahamathulla/page/3601 | title=Exo microbiology (or Astro microbiology) | publisher=Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Rahamathulla, Mohamudha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary Exploration ==

[[File:Eso1509a - Mars planet.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Depiction of a once water covered Mars]]
The search for extraterrestrial microbial life have focused mostly on [[Mars]] due to its promising environment and close proximity; however, other astrobiological sites include the moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Enceladus]]. All of these sites currently have or have had a recent history of possessing liquid water, which scientists hypothesize as the most consequential precursor for biological life. Europa and Enceladus appear to have large amounts of liquid water hidden beneath the layers of ice that covers their surfaces. Titan, on the other hand, is only planetary body besides Earth with liquid hydrocarbons on its surface. Mars is the main area of interest for the search for life primarily because of convincing evidence that suggests surface liquid water activity in recent history. Furthermore, Mars has an atmosphere containing abundant amounts of carbon and nitrogen, both essential elements needed for life.&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/9780470015902.a0021899/asset/a0021899.pdf?v=1&amp;t=io3v5qmq&amp;s=0b2b4f2b1c2ad43d928103c34c0febbf39660bdc&amp;systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+14th+May+11%3A00-14%3A00+BST+%2F+06%3A00-09%3A00+EDT+%2F+18%3A00-21%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience. | title=Astromicrobiology | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | work=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | date=10 September 2010 | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Davila, Alfonso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==

So far, the search for microbial life in extraterrestrial locations have been less than successful. The first of such attempts, occurred through NASA's [[Viking program]] in the 1970s, in which two Mars landers were used to conduct experiments that searched for biosignatures of life on Mars. The landers utilized robotic arms to collect soil samples into sealed containers that were brought back to Earth. The results were largely inconclusive, although some scientists still dispute them.

In 2008, Russian cosmonauts reported findings of sea [[plankton]] living on the outside surfaces of the International Space stations windows. They have yet to find explanations for the discovery, but it seems to have been a result of human contamination, though this may never be proven.

Currently, the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission has a rover on Mars that continues to be operational. Launched on 26 November 2011, and landing at [[Gale Crater]] on 6 August 2012, its goals are to assess the habitability of Mars' environment – amongst its collection of data for Martian geology, climate and availability of water, are instruments that search for biosignatures daily. Thus far, its results have not been fruitful.

== Experimentation ==

=== Earth ===
Many studies on Earth have been conducted to collect data on the response of terrestrial microbes to various simulated environmental conditions of outer space. The responses of microbes, such as viruses, bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and lichens, to isolated factors of outer space (microgravity, galactic cosmic radiation, solar UV radiation, and space vacuum) were determined in space and laboratory simulation experiments. In general, microorganisms tended to thrive in the simulated space flight environment – subjects showed symptoms of enhanced growth and an uncharacteristic ability to proliferate despite the presence of normally suppressive levels of antibiotics. The mechanisms responsible for explaining these enhanced responses have yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name="Horneck, Gerda 2010 121–156"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2832349 | title=Space Microbiology | author=Horneck, Gerda | journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | year=2010 | volume=74 | issue=1 | pages=121–156 | doi=10.1128/mmbr.00016-09 | pmid=20197502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space ===
The ability of microorganisms to survive in an outer space environment was investigated to approximate upper boundaries of the biosphere and to determine the accuracy of the interplanetary transport theory for microorganisms. Among the investigated variables, solar UV radiation had the most harmful effect on microbial samples. Among all the samples, only lichens ([[Rhizocarpon geographicum]] and [[Xanthoria elegans]]) fully survived the 2 weeks of exposure to outer space. Earth's ozone layer greatly protects against the deleterious effects of solar UV, which is why organisms typically are unable to survive without ozone protection. When shielded against solar UV, various samples were able to survive for long periods of times; spores of [[B. subtilis]], for example, were able to proliferate in space for up to 6 years. The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, called [[lithopanspermia]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Horneck, Gerda 2010 121–156"/&gt;

Modern technology has already allowed us to use microbes to assist us in extracting materials on Earth, including over 25% of the our current copper supply. Similarly, microbes could help serve a similar purpose on other planets to mine resources, extract useful materials, or create self-sustaining reactors. The most promising of these candidates known to date is [[cyanobacteria]]. [[Cyanobacteria#Earth_history|Billions of years ago]], cyanobacteria originally helped us create a habitable Earth by pumping oxygen into the atmosphere, and manage to exist in the darkest corners of the Earth. Cyanobacteria, along with some other rock-eating microbes, seem to be able to withstand the harsh conditions of the vacuum of space without much effort. On Mars, however, cyanobacteria will not even have to endure such harsh conditions.&lt;ref name="Microbes Colonize Earth"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/how-microbes-could-help-colonize-mars/ | title=How Microbes Could Help Colonize Mars | publisher=NASA | work=Astrobiology Magazine | date=9 September 2010 | accessdate=12 May 2016 | author=Hsu, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are currently working on the possibility of installing bioreactors or similar facilities on Mars, which would run entirely on cyanobacteria and provide material for the creation of fuel cells, soil crust formation, regolith amelioration, extraction of useful metals/elements, nutrient release into the soil, and dust removal; a variety of other potentially useful functions are also in the works.&lt;ref name="Microbes Colonize Earth"/&gt;

'''Backpage''' was a [[classified advertising]] website launched in 2004. Until its seizure by U.S. authorities in April 2018, it offered classified listings for a wide variety of products and services including automotive, jobs listings, and [[real estate]]. In 2011, Backpage was the second largest classified ad listing service on the Internet in the United States after [[Craigslist]].&lt;ref name="dorish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backpage Vs. Craigslist |first=Joe |last=Dorish |url=http://furniture-care.knoji.com/backpage-vs-craigslist/ |publisher=Knoji |date=February 2011 |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's offering of adult services sections had been highly controversial, due to allegations that Backpage knowingly allowed and encouraged users to post ads related to [[prostitution]] and [[human trafficking]], particularly involving minors, and took steps to intentionally obfuscate the activities. After a series of court cases and the arrest of the company's CEO and other officials, Backpage removed the adult services subsection in the United States in 2017.

On April 6, 2018 backpage.com and affiliated websites were seized as part of an enforcement action by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], the [[United States Department of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ap-backpagecom-ceo-pleads-guilty-to-california-money-charges-2018-4|title=Backpage.com CEO pleads guilty to California money charges|work=Business Insider|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigator Division]], with analytical assistance from the [[Joint Regional Intelligence Center]]. 

Its CEO, Carl Ferrer, pleaded guilty to charges of facilitating prostitution and money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|page=3B|title=Backpage CEO pleads guilty, could spend 5 years in prison|first1=Megan|last1=Cassidy|first2=Ricgard|last2=Ruelas|date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Near the turn of the 21st century, [[Internet]]-based classified advertising, particularly the website [[Craigslist]], was having a significant impact on the classified advertising business in newspapers nationwide.{{fact|date=May 2018}} Classified advertising in daily newspapers as well as weekly alternatives, suburban papers and community papers was moving to the free advertising model of Craigslist and other smaller websites.{{fact|date=May 2018}  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Workers on What It Means to Lose Backpage |url=https://mowamba.com/2018/10/29/7-sex-workers-on-what-to-lose-backpage/ |website=mowamba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in response to this phenomenon, [[New Times Media]] (later to be known as [[Village Voice Media]]), a publisher of 11 alternative newsweeklies, launched a free classified website called backpage.com.&lt;ref name="kiefer"&gt;{{citation |last=Kiefer |first=Michael |date=September 23, 2012 |title=Phoenix New Times founders selling company |publisher=The Arizona Republic |location=Phoenix |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120922phoenix-new-times-founders-selling.html |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation and traditions of free classified advertising and free circulation were part of the fundamentals of the alternative newsweeklies dating back to 1971.  The ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' and the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' were pioneers in these operating philosophies.&lt;ref name="valeo"&gt;{{citation|last=Valeo|first=Tom|title=The Chicago Reader: A '70s Success Story|date=November 4, 1979|url=http://sites.google.com/site/chireaderhistory/documents/Herald791104.pdf|location=Chicago, IL|publisher=Daily Herald|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="am-midewst"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=|quote=|access-date=|via=|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Sisson|editor2-first=Christian|editor2-last=Zacher|editor3-first=Andrew|editor3-last=Cayton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Backpage soon became the second largest online classified site in the United States.&lt;ref name=kiefer /&gt; The site included the various categories found in newspaper classified sections including those that were unique to and part of the [[First Amendment]]-driven traditions of most alternative weeklies. These included personals (including adult-oriented personal ads), adult services, musicians and "[[New Age]]" services.

== Adult section ==
Until January 9, 2017, Backpage contained an adult section containing different subcategories of various sex work professions (escorts, erotic masseuses, strippers, phone sex operators, etc). 
After accusations from the United States Senate of being directly involved with sex-trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors, the company suspended its adult listings, describing the move as "the direct result of unconstitutional government censorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backpage pulls adult ads and accuses government of 'censorship'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/backpage-pulls-adult-ads-blames-censorship-after-report-sex-trafficking-n705056|accessdate=March 1, 2017|work=NBC News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many escorts and erotic masseuses admit to moving their ads to the "massage" and "women seeking men" listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salinger|first1=Alexa|title=The Ultimate Guide to Backpage Ads|date=2017|publisher=Amazon Digital Services|location=New York|pages=38|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Backpage-Ads-ebook/dp/B075HDY2YB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505605372&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+ultimate+guide+to+backpage+ads|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is illegal throughout the United States, except for some counties in Nevada.

Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project]] of Sacramento, criticized the shutdown, questioning how many sex workers across the United States no longer had a way to support themselves. Backpage allowed for sex workers using the site to post bad date lists, screen clients and communicate with other sex workers to ensure a safer experience.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/health/sex-workers-craigslist-personals-trafficking-bill/index.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Activists argued that the move would force some of the site's users to work on the street instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/backpage-adult-classifieds-sex-workers-danger-trafficking|title=Backpage's halt of adult classifieds will endanger sex workers, advocates warn|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=January 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 1, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the deletion of Backpage, a duplicate site called yesbackpage.de has been brought to the surface. Yesbackpage is almost identical to what Backpage use to be, including sex trafficking and prostitution ads. &lt;ref&gt;https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/10/02/cook-county-sheriff-working-to-shut-down-sex-trafficking-websites/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.yesbackpage.de&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
{{too long|section|date=April 2018}}
There has been significant public controversy and discourse regarding the adult section of Backpage.com. Most of the criticism has centered on the charge that Backpage is used to market minors (i.e. underage sex trafficking), and that they contribute to a surge of prostitution in areas that they operate.&lt;ref name="surge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alabama2017-01-25/&gt; Media, law enforcement, politicians and parents of trafficked children have weighed in on this matter.&lt;ref name=NCMEC_brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-lurid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/10/a-lurid-journey-through-backpage-com/|title=A lurid journey through Backpage.com|last2=Steffen|first2=Sheila|date=May 10, 2012|website=CNN.com|publisher=cnn.com|access-date=January 21, 2016|last1=Feyerick|first1=Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irvine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/backpage-ad-site-aider-of-traffickers-or-way-to-stop-them/|title=Backpage ad site: Aider of traffickers, or way to stop them?|last=Irvine|first=Martha|date=August 16, 2015|newspaper=Seattle Times|location=Seattle, Washington|access-date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/01/26/backpages-takes-heat-for-prostitution-ads-that-are-everywhere/|title=Backpage Takes Heat, But Prostitution Ads Are Everywhere|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] (NCMEC), the majority of child sex trafficking cases referred to NCMEC involve ads on Backpage.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-NCMEC brief-10|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  Backpage says that it blocks about a million ads per month, mostly suspected of child sex trafficking or prostitution.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-surge-11|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Of those, they report around 400 ads a month to NCMEC which in turn notify law enforcement.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-CNN-lurid-12|[12]]][[Backpage#cite note-irvine-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Content submitted to Backpage is surveyed by an automated scan for terms related to prostitution. At least one member of a team of over 100 people also oversees each entry before it is posted.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-forbes1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Backpage has had continued issues with [[credit card]] processors, who were under pressure from law enforcement to cease working with companies that allegedly allow or encourage illegal prostitution. In 2015 Backpage lost all credit card processing agreements, leaving [[Bitcoin]] as the remaining option for paid ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Luke|title=Backpage Goes Bitcoin-Only|url=http://bravenewcoin.com/news/backpage-goes-bitcoin-only/|website=bravenewcoin|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[amicus curiae brief]], the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children says the efforts of Backpage are inadequate and their reporting lacked in several areas. They say Backpage does not report all ads that have been flagged as being underage, does not report when someone tries to advertise children under 18 years of age, and does not respond to requests of parents to have ads of their trafficked children removed. They also say Backpage "encourage[s] dissemination of child sex trafficking content on its website". They say Backpage is much slower in removing ads that advertise children than ads placed by authorities aimed at trapping traffickers, guides traffickers in creating false pages for underage children, instructs traffickers and buyers on how to pay anonymously, and makes it easier to make adult posts than other posts. They said "To all intents and purposes, Backpage has instituted no effective procedures to prevent child sex trafficking ads from being created on its site." They say that they do not use obvious techniques to identify traffickers, such as using the same phone number, email address or credit card of a known trafficker, or reusing the same picture of known victim of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=NCMEC_brief/&gt;

Advocates for Backpage point out that by carefully scrutinizing each posting in the Adult section before it is posted, removing questionable posts and reporting potential cases of the trafficking of minors to the authorities and NGOs such as NCMEC, Backpage is aiding in the fight against this activity. In addition, they argue that by providing prompt and detailed information about postings to law enforcement when asked to do so (including phone numbers, credit card numbers and IP addresses), Backpage aids law enforcement in protecting minors from such activity. They also contend that the prompt and complete production of this information results in more convictions for illegal activities and that shutting down the adult section of Backpage will simply drive the traffickers to other places on the internet that will be less forthcoming about crucial information for law enforcement.&lt;ref name=irvine /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2012/06/26/sex-lies-and-suicide-whats-wrong-with-the-war-on-sex-trafficking/#1f828246b392205ffdc86b39 |title=Sex, Lies and Suicide: What's Wrong with the War on Sex Trafficking |last=Ruvolo |first=Julie |date=June 26, 2012 |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |access-date=January 21, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/306533-americas-top-online-brothel-is-critical-tool-for-law-enforcement|title=America's top online brothel a critical tool for law enforcement|last=Charles|first=J.B.|date=November 17, 2016|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liz McDougall, an attorney serving as general counsel for Backpage.com, said that Backpage is an "ally in the fight against [[human trafficking]]." She said that the adult section of Backpage is closely monitored, and that shutting it down "would simply drive the trafficking underground." She said that websites like Backpage, that are able to monitor trafficking activity and report it to law enforcement, are key in the fight against human trafficking.&lt;ref name="mcdougall"&gt;{{cite news |last=McDougall |first= Liz |date= May 6, 2012 |title=Backpage.com is an ally in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2018143440_guest07mcdougall.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |location=Seattle, Washington |access-date=May 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDougall said that shutting down the service on a cooperative United States–based website would only drive trafficking to underground and international websites that are more difficult to monitor, and are often outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.&lt;ref name=mcdougall /&gt;

Writers for ''Forbes'', the ''Huffington Post'', and ''Fast Company'' have suggested that Backpage is a useful tool for law enforcement and the public in exposing the perpetrators of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=forbes1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3038284/the-backpagecom-conundrum |title=The Backpage.com Paradox |last=Anderson |first=Lessley |date=November 19, 2014 |website=Fast Company |publisher=Fast Company |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost2"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/backpage-credit-cards-sex_55b96ed3e4b0af35367a4530 |title=Sex Workers Say Credit Card Bans On Online Ads Do More Harm Than Good |last=Hanson |first=Hilary |date=July 30, 2015 |journal=Huffington Post |access-date=January 21, 2016 |quote=It's the more marginalized and poorer workers who are hit hardest by this. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous NGOs and others contend that the potential harm done by a website that features a section for adult posting is far greater than any actions the site may take to aid law enforcement. In many cases, the critics of Backpage say that these efforts are less than is necessary or possible. Some say that no efforts to police the site and report bad actors outweigh the negative impact the site may have in this area. The general counsel for National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said, "Backpage’s reporting is not conducted in good faith."&lt;ref name="CNN-lurid" /&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' writer [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]], in a number of his Fact Checker columns, debunked many of the inflated sex trafficking statistics and claims cited by politicians, NGOs, lawmakers and the media.&lt;ref name="Kessler1"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=June 11, 2015 |title=The Four-Pinocchio claim that ‘on average, girls first become victims of sex trafficking at 13 years old’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/11/the-dubious-claim-that-on-average-girls-first-become-victims-of-sex-trafficking-at-13-years-old/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler2"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=May 28, 2015 |title=The bogus claim that 300,000 U.S. children are ‘at risk’ of sexual exploitation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/28/the-bogus-claim-that-300000-u-s-children-are-at-risk-of-sexual-exploitation/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]]  |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler3"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=June 2, 2015 |title=The false claim that human trafficking is a ‘$9.5 billion business’ in the United States |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/02/the-false-claim-that-child-sex-trafficking-is-a-9-5-billion-business-in-the-united-states/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]]  | access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler4"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=April 24, 2015 |title=Why you should be wary of statistics on ‘modern slavery’ and ‘trafficking’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/24/why-you-should-be-wary-of-statistics-on-modern-slavery-and-trafficking/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] | access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the behest of a number of NGO's including Fair Girls and NCMEC, Fitzgibbon Media (a well-known progressive/liberal [[public relations]] agency) created a multimedia campaign to garner support for the anti-Backpage position. They enlisted support from musicians, politicians, journalists, media companies and retailers. The campaign created a greater public dialogue, both pro and con, regarding Backpage.&lt;ref name="fitzgibbon"&gt;{{cite web |dead-url=yes |archive-url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8Uc1JYP1NkIJ:adam.curry.com/art/1372261745_TxT8pkDD.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |url=http://www.fitzgibbonmedia.com/casestudies/exposing-backpage/ |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |title=Exposing Backpage.com |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.fitzgibbonmedia.com |publisher=Fitzgibbon Media |access-date= January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Fitzgibbon Media was closed due to multiple allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Fitzgibbon owner Tervor Fitzgibbon.&lt;ref name="huffpost1"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fitzgibbon-media_us_567330fce4b014efe0d4cb4e |title=The Disturbing Story Of Widespread Sexual Assault Allegations At A Major Progressive PR Firm |last1=Terkel |first1=Amanda |last2=Grim |first2=Ryan |last3=Stein |first3=Sam |date=December 19, 2015 |journal=Huffington Post |access-date=January 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies including [[H&amp;M]], [[IKEA]], and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] canceled ads for publications owned by Village Voice Media.

In 2012, Village Voice Media separated their newspaper company, which then consisted of eleven weekly alternative newspapers and their affiliated web properties, from Backpage, leaving Backpage in control of shareholders Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin. Executives for the spinoff holding company, called [[Voice Media Group]] (VMG) and based in Denver, raised "some money from private investors" in order to purchase the newspapers.&lt;ref name="Reuters-9-24-2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/24/us-usa-villagevoice-backpage-idINBRE88N04020120924 |title=Village Voice newspaper chain to split from controversial ad site |last1=Francescani |first1=Chris |author2=Nadia Damouni  |date=September 24, 2012 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=December 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO of VMG, said "Backpage has been a distraction—there's no question about it—to the core (editorial) properties."&lt;ref name="Reuters-9-24-2012" /&gt; In December 2014, [[Village Voice Media]] sold Backpage to a Dutch holding company.

=== Legal decisions ===
Beginning in 2011 a number of legal challenges were initiated by foes of Backpage in attempts to eliminate the adult section of the website and or shut down the website entirely. These actions included legislative initiatives as well as lawsuits brought by individuals; all of these lawsuits, which were mostly brought by politicians and NGOs, were successfully challenged by Backpage, which argued that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections of [[free speech]] were being compromised by any restriction on postings by individuals on the Backpage website. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] amendments to the Constitution as well as the Commerce Clause were also cited as reasons that these efforts were illegal under U.S. law. 

[[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] of 1996 (CDA) served as an additional cornerstone in the defense. Section 230 says that "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider." This portion of the CDA was drafted to protect ISPs and other interactive service providers on the Internet from liability for content originating from third parties.&lt;ref name="CDA230"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehrlich |first=Paul |date=January 1, 2002 |title=Communications Decency Act 230 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1358&amp;context=btlj |journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal |volume=17 |issue=1 |access-date=January 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of this portion of the CDA overturned the decision in Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co. in which Prodigy was deemed by the court to be a publisher and therefore liable for content posted on its site.&lt;ref name="CDA230" /&gt; Many observers have credited the passage of section 230 of the CDA as the spark that ignited the explosive growth of the internet.&lt;ref name="Techdirt-Masnick" /&gt; The protection afforded to website owners under section 230 was upheld in numerous court cases subsequent to the passage of the legislation in 1996 including [[Doe v. MySpace Inc.]], 528 F.3d 413 (5th Cir. 2008) and [[Dart v. Craigslist, Inc.]], 665 F. Supp. 2d 961 (N.D. Ill. October 20, 2009).

*'''''M.A. v. Village Voice Media, LLC''''' - In September 2010, M.A. v. Village Voice Media was held in Missouri courts. The plaintiff alleged that Backpage "had knowledge...that postings on their website were advertisements for prosititution" and "illegal sexual contact with minors," that "crimes were being committed" and therefore "had a desire that these posters accomplish[] their nefarious illegal prostitution activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://casetext.com/case/ma-v-village-voice-media-holdings| title=809 F.Supp.2d 1041 (E.D.

*'''''Backpage.com, LLC v. Cooper''''' — In 2012, the state of [[Tennessee]] passed similar legislation mirroring most of the language in the Washington law. The law specifically targeted Backpage. Backpage filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Tennessee seeking a restraining order and temporary injunction to prevent enforcement of this law.

Rather, the court held that under the First Amendment, the State must prove a defendant's scienter that specific speech is unlawful "to avoid the hazard of self-censorship," and therefore the State's presumption of illegality would impose "an impossible burden" on "websites such as Backpage.com . . . to review all of their millions of postings or, more likely, shut down their adult services section entirely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://casetext.com/case/backpagecom-llc-v-cooper| title=939 F.Supp.2d 805 (M.D. Tenn. 2013) Backpage.com, LLC v.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that the challenged practices "[s]ingly or in the aggregate . . . amount to neither affirmative participation in an illegal venture nor active web content creation." The court held that Backpage could not be liable for the "existence of an escorts section" ("whatever its social merits, [the section] is not illegal").

=== Alleged victims ===
On April 9, 2018, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]]'s indictment against Backpage was unsealed. It contains details about 17 alleged victims who range from minors as young as 14 years old to adults, who were allegedly trafficked on the site while Backpage was knowingly facilitating [[prostitution]]. One 15-year-old is alleged to have been forced to do in-calls at hotels. A second teenager was allegedly told to "perform sexual acts at gunpoint and choked" until she had seizures, before being [[Gang rape|gang-raped]]. A third victim, advertised under the [[pseudonym]] "Nadia" was [[Stabbing|stabbed]] to death, while a fourth victim was [[Murder|murdered]] in 2015, and her corpse deliberately burned. The lawyer for Backpage operations manager Andrew Padilla stated that his client was "not legally responsible for any actions of third parties under U.S. law. He is no more responsible than the owner of a community billboard when someone places an ad on it,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/backpage-indictment-trafficking_us_5acbcaeae4b0337ad1eadf6a|title=Backpage.com Founders Indicted For Facilitating Prostitution On Site|last=Amatulli|first=Jenna|date=April 9, 2018|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=April 13, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage’s revenue was directly attributable to [[prostitution]]-related ads, and many of the ads involved victims of [[sex trafficking]], including children under the age of 18.

Backpage general counsel Liz McDougall dismissed the raid as an "election year stunt" which wasn't "a good-faith action by law enforcement", and stated that the company would "take all steps necessary to end this frivolous prosecution and will pursue its full remedies under federal law against the state actors who chose to ignore the law, as it has done successfully in other cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-backpage-ceo-arrested-charged-20161006-snap-story.html|title=Backpage says criminal charges by Kamala Harris are 'election year stunt'|last=Hamilton|first=Matt|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backpage also accused California attorney general [[Kamala Harris]] of an illegal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/10/07/backpage-com-ceo-will-fight-sex-trafficking-charges-lawyer-says/|title=Backpage.com CEO Will Fight Sex Trafficking Charges, Lawyer Says|work=CBS Los Angeles|access-date=November 21, 2016|date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of observers immediately criticized the arrests, including writers such as Mike Masnick at Techdirt, Noah Feldman at Bloomberg and Elizabeth Nolan Brown at Reason.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/10/07/charges-against-backpage-ceo-listed|title=Here's How Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer Supposedly Profited From Child Sex Trafficking|date=October 7, 2016|newspaper=Reason.com|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Masnick points out that the arrests are in contradiction to section 230 of the CDA and the First Amendment rights of Backpage as has been upheld in numerous court decisions over the five previous years. He posited that AG Harris was more interested in the publicity from the arrests for political gain than in enforcing a law she had previously admitted was unenforceable by individual states as specified in section 230.  In addition he points out that the details in the complaint appear to support Backpage’s assertion that it responds appropriately when advised of illegal ads on its site and removes them promptly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161006/23395935732/details-charges-against-backpage-execs-pimping-look-totally-bogus.shtml|title=Details Of Charges Against Backpage Execs For 'Pimping' Look Totally Bogus|newspaper=Techdirt.|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161020/00271735843/arrested-backpage-execs-ask-kamala-harris-to-drop-bogus-case-she-herself-has-admitted-she-has-no-authority-to-bring.shtml|title=Arrested Backpage Execs Ask Kamala Harris To Drop Bogus Case She Herself Has Admitted She Has No Authority To Bring|newspaper=Techdirt.|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman said: "It takes a lot to turn a publisher of sex ads into a First Amendment hero. But the attorney general of California has managed the feat. By charging Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of Backpage.com, with pimping and sex trafficking in minors, Kamala Harris has seriously breached the constitutional wall meant to protect the free press."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-10/publisher-of-sex-trafficking-ads-isn-t-the-criminal|title=Publisher of Sex-Trafficking Ads Isn't the Criminal|last=Feldman|first=Noah|date=October 10, 2016|newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, attorneys for Ferrer, Larkin and Lacey, sent a letter to the California AG Kamala Harris asking that all charges against their clients be dropped.&lt;ref name=AttorneyGeneralHarris/&gt; The AG’s office did not agree to the request for dismissal.

On October 19, 2016, attorneys for Backpage filed a Demurrer to the Criminal Complaint against CEO Carl Ferrer and former Backpage owners Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin.  In it they argued that all charges against their clients should be dismissed based upon, among other things,  that the Attorney General’s prosecution "tramples First Amendment Rights and is flatly barred by Section 230 as she has admitted". Numerous previous court ruling and decisions were cited in the Demurrer supporting this position.&lt;ref name=PeopleVFerrer/&gt;

The AG filed its response to the Demurrer on November 4, 2016. Backpage Attorneys filed their reply in support of the Demurrer on November 10, 2016.  On November 16, 2016 Judge Michael Bowman of the Superior Court of the State of California issued a tentative ruling in this case supporting the position of Backpage and granting its request for dismissal of the case.&lt;ref name=PeopleVFerrerA/&gt;  He then heard oral arguments in his courtroom from both parties and indicated he would issue a final ruling by December 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/backpage-com-online-brothel-pimping-charges-may-be-thrown-out|title=Backpage.com ‘Online Brothel’ Pimping Charges May Be Tossed|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2016, Judge Bowman issued a Final Ruling 62 on this matter.  Bowman dismissed all the charges in the complaint, stating that:

"...Congress has precluded liability for online publishers for the action of publishing third party speech and thus provided for both a foreclosure from prosecution and an affirmative defense at trial. Congress has spoken on this matter and it is for Congress, not this Court, to revisit.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=California vs Ferrar, et al|court=Cal.

On December 23, 2016, the state of California then filed new charges against Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer and former Backpage owners Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.  They were charged with pimping and money laundering.&lt;ref name=CaliforniaVFerrerViaPhoenixTimes/&gt;

Lawyers for Backpage responded that the charges rehashed the earlier case that had been dismissed on December 9, 2016.  Jim Grant, an attorney for Backpage said: “She (CA AG Kamala Harris) cannot avoid First Amendment protections, federal law or her obligations to follow the law, although her new complaint is a transparent effort to do exactly that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/calif-files-new-charges-against-backpage-com-ceo-after-case-n699706|title=Calif. files new charges against Backpage.com CEO after case dismissed|newspaper=NBC News|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arraignment was set for January 11, 2017.

Since April 2015, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ("PSI") has been investigating Backpage.com as part of a stated overall investigation of human trafficking.  After a voluntary, day-long briefing and interview provided by the company’s General Counsel, PSI followed up with a subpoena to Backpage.com demanding over 40 categories of documents, covering 120 subjects, regarding Backpage’s business practices.  Much of the subpoena targeted Backpage’s editorial functions as an online intermediary.  Over the ensuing months, Backpage raised and PSI rejected numerous objections to the subpoena, including that the subpoena was impermissibly burdensome both in the volume of documents PSI demanded and in its intrusion into constitutionally-protected editorial discretion.  PSI subsequently issued a shorter document subpoena with only eight requests but broader in scope and also targeting Backpage.com's editorial functions.  Backpage.com continued to object on First Amendment and other grounds.

PSI applied in March 2016 for a federal court order to enforce three of the eight categories of documents in the subpoena.  In August 2016, the U.S. District Court in D.C. granted PSI’s application and ordered Backpage to produce documents responsive to the three requests.&lt;ref&gt;''Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations v. Ferrer'', __ F.Supp.3d ___, 2016 WL 4179289, Misc. Action No. 16-mc-621 (RMC) (D.D.C. August 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backpage immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay, which the district court denied, then filed emergency stay petitions with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and Supreme Court.  Each appellate court issued temporary stays to consider whether to grant a stay pending appeal,&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrer v. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations'', 137 S. Ct. 1 (Mem.), 195 L.E.2d 900, 85 USLW 3075 (Sep 6, 2016),&lt;/ref&gt;  but eventually denied the emergency stay requests,&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrer v. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations'', 137 S. Ct. 28 (Mem.), 195 L.E.2d 901, 85 USLW 3084 (Sep 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the D.C. Circuit agreed to expedite the appeal, and one of its judges who considered the emergency stay said he would have granted it.  Backpage has continued to pursue its appeal despite producing thousands of documents to PSI pursuant to the District Court order.  PSI scheduled a Subcommittee hearing regarding Backpage.com for January 10, 2017.

On January 9, 2017, the United States Supreme Court refused to re-consider a ruling by the U.S 1st Circuit Court of Appeals that a suit filed in Boston federal court in 2014 against Backpage by three women who claimed that Backpage was responsible for them being forced into illegal sex transactions.  The Court of Appeals held that Backpage could not be held liable as the "publisher or speaker" for postings on its site by third parties in accordance with the protections provided to website operators under section 230 of the CDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-backpage-idUSKBN14T1OR|title=U.S. Supreme Court will not examine tech industry legal shield|date=January 9, 2017|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on January 9, 2017, prior to its scheduled hearings on Backpage the next day, the PSI released a report that accused Backpage of knowingly facilitating child sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=Mccaskill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/313545-senators-blast-backpage-executives-after-site-closes-adult-section|title=Senators blast Backpage executives as site closes adult section|last=Neidig|first=Harper|date=January 10, 2017|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Backpage announced that it would remove its adult sections from all of its sites in the United States. Backpage said it was taking this action due to many years of continuing acts by the government to unconstitutionally censor the site’s content via harassment and extra-legal tactics and to make it too costly to continue its publishing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/10/backpage-com-shuts-down-adult-services-ads-after-relentless-pressure-from-authorities/|title=Backpage.com shuts down adult services ads after relentless pressure from authorities| newspaper = [[Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] |access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170109/17502636445/backpage-kills-adult-ads-same-day-supreme-court-backed-legal-protections-due-to-grandstanding-senators.shtml|title=Backpage Kills Adult Ads On The Same Day Supreme Court Backed Its Legal Protections, Due To Grandstanding Senators|newspaper=Techdirt|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-March 2018 and early-April 2018, courts in Massachusetts and Florida affirmed that Backpage's facilitation of sex trafficking fell outside of the immunity granted by Section 230 safe harbors. The latter ruling argued that because Backpage "materially contributed to the content of the advertisement" by censoring specific keywords, it became a publisher of content and thus no longer protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180329/23024539528/court-shows-sesta-is-not-needed-says-backpage-can-lose-cda-230-protections-if-it-helped-create-illegal-content.shtml|title=Court Shows SESTA Is Not Needed: Says Backpage Can Lose Its CDA 230 Protections If It Helped Create Illegal Content|work=Techdirt.|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180404/11214139563/yet-another-court-says-victims-dont-need-sesta-fosta-to-go-after-backpage.shtml|title=Yet Another Court Says Victims Don't Need SESTA/FOSTA To Go After Backpage|work=Techdirt|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent refinement of co-citation takes into account placement of citations with the document. |Figure visualizing co-citation on the left and a refinement of co-citation, Co-citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) on the right.]]
'''Co-citation''', like [[Bibliographic coupling|Bibliographic Coupling]], is a [[Semantics|semantic similarity]] measure for documents that makes use of [[citation]] relationships. Co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents ''are cited'' together by other documents.&lt;ref name="Small"&gt;Henry Small, 1973 [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: a new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 24:265–269.&lt;/ref&gt; If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. The more co-citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength, and the more likely they are semantically related.&lt;ref name="Small"/&gt;

The figure to the right illustrates the concept of co-citation and a more recent variation of co-citation which accounts for the placement of citations in the full text of documents. The figure's left image shows the Documents A and B, which are both cited by Documents C, D and E; thus Documents A and B have a '''co-citation strength''', or '''co-citation index'''&lt;ref&gt;Jeppe Nicolaisen, [http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/cocitation_by_jeppe_nicolaisen.htm Co-citation], in Birger Hjørland, ed., [http://www.db.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/home.htm Core Concepts in Library and Information Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525203337/http://www.db.dk/bh/core%20concepts%20in%20lis/home.htm |date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of three. This score is usually established using [[citation index]]es. Documents featuring high numbers of co-citations are regarded as more similar.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Small, 1973. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure's right image shows a citing document which cites the Documents 1, 2 and 3. Both the Documents 1 and 2 and the Documents 2 and 3 have a co-citation strength of one, given that they are cited together by exactly one other document. However, Documents 2 and 3 are cited in much closer proximity to each other in the citing document compared to Document 1. To make co-citation a more meaningful measure in this case, a '''Co-Citation Proximity Index (CPI)''' can be introduced to account for the placement of citations relative to each other. Documents co-cited at greater relative distances in the full text receive lower CPI values.&lt;ref name="Gipp"&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf "Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis"] in Birger Larsen and Jacqueline Leta, editors, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI’09), volume 2, pages 571–575, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gipp and Beel were the first to propose using modified co-citation weights based on proximity.&lt;ref name="Boyack"&gt;Kevin W. Boyack, Henry Small and Richard Klavans, 2013 [http://sticonference.org/Proceedings/vol1/Boyack_Improving_155.pdf "Improving the Accuracy of Co-citation Clustering Using Full Text"] Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Volume 64, Issue 9, pages 1759–1767, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific and Technical Information Serial of VINITI, 6(2):3–8&lt;/ref&gt; are credited for introducing co-citation analysis in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jeppe Nicolaisen, 2005 [http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/cocitation_by_jeppe_nicolaisen.htm "Co-citation"], from The Royal School of Library and Information Science (RSLIS), Copenhagen, Denmark. Retrieved December, 28. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Both researchers came up with the measure independently, although Marshakova gained less credit, likely because her work was published in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Havemann, 2009. "Einführung in die Bibliometrie." Humboldt University of Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-citation analysis provides a forward-looking assessment on document similarity in contrast to Bibliographic Coupling, which is retrospective.&lt;ref&gt;Garfield, E., November 27, 2001. [http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/drexelbelvergriffith92001.pdf "From Bibliographic Coupling to Co-Citation Analysis Via Algorithmic Historio-Bibliography: A Citationist’s Tribute to Belver C. Griffith.] a paper presented at the Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; The citations a paper receives in the future depend on the evolution of an academic field, thus co-citation frequencies can still change. In the adjacent diagram, for example, Doc A and Doc B may still be co-cited by future documents, say Doc F and Doc G. This characteristic of co-citation allows for a dynamic document classification system when compared to Bibliographic Coupling.

Over the decades, researchers proposed variants or enhancements to the original co-citation concept. Howard White introduced author co-citation analysis in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Howard D. White and Belver C. Griffith, 1981. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.4630320302/abstract "Author Cocitation: A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure."] Journal of the American Society for Information Science (JASIS), May, 1981 volume 32(3), pp. 163-171. -- the first ACA paper. DOI = 10.1002/asi.4630320302.&lt;/ref&gt; Gipp and Beel proposed '''[[Co-citation Proximity Analysis]] (CPA)''' and introduced the CPI as an enhancement to the original co-citation concept in 2009.&lt;ref name ="Gipp"/&gt; Co-citation Proximity Analysis considers the proximity of citations within the full-texts for similarity computation and therefore allows for a more fine-grained assessment of semantic document similarity than pure co-citation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Schwarzer, M. Schubotz, N. Meuschke, C. Breitinger, V. Markl, and B. Gipp, [https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/schwarzer2016.pdf "Evaluating Link-based Recommendations for Wikipedia"] in Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), New York, NY, USA, 2016, pp. 191-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
The motivations of authors for citing literature can vary greatly and occur for a variety of reasons aside from simply referring to academically relevant documents. Cole and Cole expressed this concern based on the observation that scientists tend to cite friends and research colleges more frequently, a partiality known as ''[[cronyism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J. R. &amp; Cole, S., 1973. "Social Stratification in Science". Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been observed that academic works which have already gained much credit and reputation in a field tend to receive even more credit and thus citations in future literature, an observation termed the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|''Matthew effect'']] in science.

'''Disintegrins''' are a family of small [[protein]]s (45–84 [[amino acid]]s in length) from [[viper venoms]] that function as potent inhibitors of both [[platelet]] aggregation and [[integrin]]-dependent [[cell adhesion]].&lt;ref name="PUB00035680"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McLane MA, Sanchez EE, Wong A, Paquette-Straub C, Perez JC |title=Disintegrins |journal=Curr Drug Targets Cardiovasc Haematol Disord |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages= 327–55|year=2004 |pmid=15578957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PUB00035681"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Lu D, Scully MF, Kakkar VV |title=Snake venom metalloproteinase containing a disintegrin-like domain, its structure-activity relationships at interacting with integrins |journal=Curr Med Chem Cardiovasc Hematol Agents |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages= 249–60|year=2005 |pmid=15974889 |doi=10.2174/1568016054368205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Disintegrins work by countering the [[blood clotting]] steps, inhibiting the clumping of [[platelets]]. They interact with the beta-1 and -3 families of [[integrins]] receptors. Integrins are [[cell receptor]]s involved in cell–cell and cell–[[extracellular matrix]] interactions, serving as the final common pathway leading to aggregation via formation of platelet–platelet bridges, which are essential in [[thrombosis]] and [[haemostasis]]. Disintegrins contain an [[RGD motif|RGD]] (Arg-Gly-Asp) or KGD (Lys-Gly-Asp) sequence motif that binds specifically to integrin IIb-IIIa receptors on the platelet surface, thereby blocking the binding of [[fibrinogen]] to the receptor–glycoprotein complex of activated platelets. Disintegrins act as [[receptor antagonist]]s, inhibiting aggregation induced by [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[thrombin]], [[platelet-activating factor]] and [[collagen]].&lt;ref name="PUB00035682"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rahman S, Xu CS |title=Identification by Site-directed Mutagenesis of Amino Acid Residues Flanking RGD Motifs of Snake Venom Disintegrins for Their Structure and Function |journal=Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages= 153–157|year=2001 |pmid=12050803}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of disintegrin in preventing blood [[coagulation]] renders it of medical interest, particularly with regard to its use as an anti-coagulant.&lt;ref name="PUB00035683"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Lu D, Scully MF, Kakkar VV |title=Integrins in drug targeting-RGD templates in toxins |journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=12 |issue=22 |pages= 2749–69|year=2006 |pmid=16918409 |doi=10.2174/138161206777947713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Disintegrins: 49-51 amino acids, 4 disulfide bonds&lt;br&gt;
Medium Disintegrins: 70 amino acids, 6 disulfide bonds&lt;br&gt;
Large Disintegrins: 84 amino acids, 7 disulfide bonds&lt;br&gt;
Dimeric Disintegrins: 67 amino acids, 4 intra-chain disulfide bonds&lt;br&gt;
Snake Venom Metalloproteinases: 100 amino acids, 8 disulfide bond

==Evolution of disintegrin family==
Disintegrins evolved via gene duplication of an ancestral [[protein family]], the ADAM family. Small, medium, large, and dimeric disintegrin family are found only in the family Viperidae, suggesting duplication and diversification about 12-20 million years ago. Snake venom metalloproteinases are found through the entire superfamily [[Colubroidea]], suggesting that they evolved before Colubroidea diversified roughly 60 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Juárez P, Comas I, González-Candelas F, Calvete JJ |title=Evolution of Snake Venom Disintegrins by Positive Darwinian Selection|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2391–2407|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn179|pmid=18701431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sources of disintegrin proteins==
Disintegrin-like proteins are found in various species ranging from slime mold to humans. Some other proteins known to contain a disintegrin domain are:

* Some snake venom zinc metalloproteinases&lt;ref name="PUB00035685"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira Cde F, Fernandes CM, Zuliani JP, Zamuner SF |title=Inflammatory effects of snake venom metalloproteinases |journal=Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz |volume=100 |issue= |pages= 181–4|year=2005 |pmid=15962120 |doi=10.1590/s0074-02762005000900031}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain fused to a disintegrin domain. Such is the case for trimerelysin I (HR1B), atrolysin-e (Ht-e) and trigramin. It has been suggested that these proteinases are able to cleave themselves from the disintegrin domains and that the latter may arise from such a post-translational processing.
* The beta-subunit of guinea pig sperm surface protein PH30.&lt;ref name="PUB00004116"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/356248a0 |vauthors=Turck CW, Myles DG, Primakoff P, Blobel CP, Wolfsberg TG, White JM |title=A potential fusion peptide and an integrin ligand domain in a protein active in sperm-egg fusion |journal=Nature |volume=356 |issue=6366 |pages=248–252 |year=1992 |pmid=1552944}}&lt;/ref&gt; PH30 is a protein involved in sperm-egg fusion. The beta subunit contains a disintegrin at the N-terminal extremity.
* Mammalian epididymial apical protein 1 (EAP I).&lt;ref name="PUB00000515"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall L, Jones R, Barker PJ, Perry AC |title=A mammalian epididymal protein with remarkable sequence similarity to snake venom haemorrhagic peptides |journal=Biochem. J. |volume=286 |issue= |pages=671–675 |year=1992 |pmid=1417724 |pmc=1132955}}&lt;/ref&gt; EAP I is associated with the sperm membrane and may play a role in sperm maturation. Structurally, EAP I consists of an N-terminal domain, followed by a zinc metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin domain, and a large C-terminal domain that contains a transmembrane region.
*[[ADAM Protein|ADAM]] and [[ADAMTS]] protein families, which include important protease enzymes. As an example, the secreted protease [[ADAMTS13]], found in serum, cleaves [[Von Willebrand factor]] and acts as a natural, endogenous inhibitor of platelet adhesion and aggregation.

== History ==
Rapid advances in the ability to genetically modify biological organisms have advanced a new engineering discipline, commonly referred to as [[synthetic biology]]. This approach seeks to harness the power of living systems for a variety of manufacturing applications, such as advanced therapeutics, sustainable fuels, chemical feedstocks, and advanced materials. To date, research in synthetic biology has typically relied on trial-and-error approaches, which are costly, laborious, and inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, C. A., Chuang, R. Y., Noskov, V.

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Environmental journalism''' is the collection, verification, production, distribution and exhibition of information regarding current events, trends, issues and people that are associated with the non-human world with which humans necessarily interact.  To be an environmental journalist, one must have an understanding of scientific language and practice, knowledge of historical environmental events, the ability to keep abreast of environmental policy decisions and the work of environmental organizations, a general understanding of current environmental concerns, and the ability to communicate all of that information to the public in such a way that it can be easily understood, despite its complexity.

Environmental journalism falls within the scope of [[environmental communication]], and its roots can be traced to [[nature writing]].  One key controversy in environmental journalism is a continuing disagreement over how to distinguish it from its allied genres and disciplines.

== History ==

While the practice of nature writing has a rich history that dates back at least as far as the [[exploration narratives]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and follows tradition up through prominent nature writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the late 19th century, [[John Burroughs]] and [[John Muir]] in the early 20th century, and [[Aldo Leopold]] in the 1940s, the field of environmental journalism did not begin to take shape until the 1960s and 1970s.

The growth of environmental journalism as a profession roughly parallels that of the environmental movement, which became a mainstream cultural movement with the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''Silent Spring'' in 1962 and was further legitimized by the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.  Grassroots environmental organizations made a booming appearance on the political scene in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of what many considered to be the "environmental crisis", and working to influence [[environmental policy]] decisions.  The mass media has followed and generated public interest on environmental issues ever since.

The field of environmental journalism was further legitimized by the creation of the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] [http://www.sej.org] in 1990, whose mission "is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality, accuracy, and visibility of environmental reporting."   Today, academic programs are offered at a number of institutions to train budding journalists in the rigors, complexity and sheer breadth of environmental journalism.

==Advocacy debate==

There exists a minor rift in the community of environmental journalists.  Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though not at the expense of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue.   This debate is not likely to be settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.

==Genres==
{{See also|Environmental Media Awards|The British Environment and Media Awards|List of environmental books}}

=== Environmental communication ===
{{main|Environmental communication}}
Environmental communication is all of the forms of communication that are engaged with the social debate about environmental issues and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theieca.org/|title=What is Environmental Communication?|author=Meisner, Mark|publisher=Environmental Communication Network|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also within the scope of environmental communication are the genres of [[nature writing]], science writing, environmental literature, environmental interpretation and environmental advocacy.  While there is a great deal of overlap among the various genres within environmental communication, they are each deserving of their own definition.

===Nature writing===
{{Main|Nature writing}}

Nature writing is the genre with the longest history in environmental communication. In his book, ''This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing'', Thomas J. Lyon attempts to use a "taxonomy of nature writing" in order to define the genre.  He suggests that his classifications, too, suffer a great deal of overlap and intergrading. "The literature of nature has three main dimensions to it: natural history information, personal responses to nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature" (Lyon 20). In the natural history essay, "the main burden of the writing is to convey pointed instruction in the facts of nature," such as with the ramble-type nature writing of John Burroughs (Lyon 21). "In essays of experience, the author's firsthand contact with nature is the frame for the writing," as with Edward Abbey's contemplation of a desert sunset (Lyon 23). In the philosophical interpretation of nature, the content is similar to that of the natural history and personal experience essays, "but the mode of presentation tends to be more abstract and scholarly" (Lyon 25). ''The Norton Book of Nature Writing'' adds a few new dimensions to the genre of nature writing, including animal narratives, garden essays, farming essays, ecofeminist works, writing on environmental justice, and works advocating environmental preservation, sustainability and biological diversity.  Environmental journalism pulls from the tradition and scope of nature writing.

===Science writing===
{{See also|Popular science}}

Science writing is writing that focuses specifically on topics of scientific study, generally translating jargon that is difficult for those outside a particular scientific field to understand into language that is easily digestible.  This genre can be narrative or informative.  Not all science writing falls within the bounds of environmental communication, only science writing that takes on topics relevant to the environment. Environmental journalism also pulls from the tradition and scope of science writing.

===Environmental interpretation===
{{See also|Heritage interpretation}}

Environmental interpretation is a particular format for the communication of relevant information.  It "involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren't scientists can readily understand.  And it involves doing it in a way that's entertaining and interesting to these people" (Ham 3). Environmental interpretation is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason to learn more about the topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8–28). While environmental journalism is not derived from environmental interpretation, it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.

===Environmental literature===
{{see also|Outdoor literature}}
Environmental literature is writing that comments intelligently on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society and the environment.  Most nature writing and some science writing falls within the scope of environmental literature.  Often, environmental literature is understood to espouse care and concern for the environment, thus advocating a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man to nature.  Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature

===Environmental advocacy===
{{See also|Environmentalism}}

Environmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews.  Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication.  It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.

==Topics==

The field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics.  According to ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'', environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues.  The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.

Environmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9968">This article is about the role of '''Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling in Mesoderm Formation'''.

[[Mesoderm]] formation is a complex developmental process involving an intricate network of [[Signal transduction|signaling pathways]] that coordinate their activities to ensure that a selective group of cells will eventually give rise to mesodermal tissues in the adult organism. [[Fibroblast growth factor]] contributes to this process not only by promoting mesoderm formation, but also by inhibiting [[endoderm]]al development.

==Introduction==

During early [[vertebrate]] development, the stage is set for the [[Regional specification|specification]] of the three [[germ layer]]s : [[endoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[ectoderm]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which will give rise to the adult organism. The mesoderm will eventually differentiate into numerous tissues including [[muscles]] and [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process requires the precise integration of a variety of signaling pathways such as the transforming growth factor type β ([[Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta|TGFβ]]), fibroblast growth factor ([[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]]), bone morphogenetic protein ([[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]), and [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]], to achieve the [[Regulation of gene expression|induction]], specification, formation and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of the mesoderm layer within a given time and space.

==Network of signaling pathways==

Members of the TGF-β superfamily, [[Activin and inhibin|Activin]] and [[NODAL|Nodal]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are essential for mesodermal induction, while FGF and Wnt are in charge of its maintenance and BMP is responsible for its patterning &lt;sup&gt;(2, 4)&lt;/sup&gt;. It is important to note that these pathways, in turn, depend on each other. For example, in [[Xenopus]], disruption of FGF signaling results in the inhibition of the Nodal-dependent induction and formation of trunk and tail mesoderm &lt;sup&gt;(5,6)&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating that TGF-β dependent mesodermal induction is itself dependent on FGF signaling &lt;sup&gt;(7)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==FGF signaling==

During the [[blastula]] and [[Gastrulation|gastrula]] stages, vegetal cells (the presumptive endoderm),  release signals to marginal zone cells resulting in the induction and patterning of the mesoderm &lt;sup&gt;(1, 8)&lt;/sup&gt;. One of these signals, FGF, achieves this through the regulation of T box transcription factors, a strategy which is shared among ''Xenopus'', mouse and [[zebrafish]] &lt;sup&gt;(9)&lt;/sup&gt;. Upon FGF binding to its receptor, FGFR, the receptor pair dimerizes and is transphosphorylated, enabling it to recruit proteins that activate Ras and Raf. This is followed by the subsequent phosphorylation of MEK and MAPK. [[MAPK]] can then enter into the nucleus and activate target transcription factors &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Regulation of T box transcription factors==

In particular, three [[T-box|T box]] [[transcription factors]], [[Brachyury]] (frogs) or No tail (fish) &lt;sup&gt;(10)&lt;/sup&gt;, VegT (frog) or Spadetail (fish), and Tbx6 (fish and frogs) &lt;sup&gt;(11)&lt;/sup&gt; are important FGF targets that play a key role in mesoderm formation &lt;sup&gt;(12,13)&lt;/sup&gt;. In ''Xenopus'', zebrafish and mouse, Brachyury (bra), is required for [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] formation &lt;sup&gt;(9)&lt;/sup&gt;. FGF is necessary for the initial localization of Xbra to the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal side]] of the [[embryo]] in the marginal zone as well as for establishing and maintaining proper expression of the transcript. Disruption of FGF signaling with an FGFR inhibitor, SU5402, results in loss of Xbra expression in embryos &lt;sup&gt;(14,15)&lt;/sup&gt;. FGF could activate Xbra expression through Ets2, a FGF target transcription factor that binds to an FGF-responsive element of the upstream sequence &lt;sup&gt;(16)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Feedback loop==

Activation of FGF by two [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that function together, [[FGF4]] and [[FGF8]] &lt;sup&gt;(17)&lt;/sup&gt; in ''Xenopus'' and FGF8 and FGF24 in zebrafish &lt;sup&gt;(18)&lt;/sup&gt;, is necessary for mesoderm formation. Both FGF signaling and Xbra expression are maintained through a [[Feedback|feedback loop]] in which upon FGF activation, Xbra expression is turned on and Xbra then directly activates eFGF, a FGF family member &lt;sup&gt;(19)&lt;/sup&gt;. By keeping the FGF signal active, this feedback loop contributes to the function of Fgf4 in paraxial mesoderm specification &lt;sup&gt;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;. Inhibition of FGFR results in a significant reduction of both Xbra and Fgf4 expression. Although it is unlikely that Fgf8 is part of the feedback loop, it contributes to mesoderm formation by activating Fgf4 &lt;sup&gt;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Other components and functions==

Furthermore, inhibition of other components of the FGF pathway, including [[Ras (protein)|Ras]], Raf and the transcription factor Ets2, disrupts mesodermal formation, while their over-expression induces mesodermal markers &lt;sup&gt;(9)&lt;/sup&gt;.
In addition to promoting mesodermal formation, FGF can also prevent endodermal development. In zebrafish, FGF activity can down-regulate Casanova, a Nodal transcription factor and thereby prevent its endodermal development function &lt;sup&gt;(20)&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Regulation of VegT==

Another key player in mesoderm formation is VegT, a maternally and zygotically expressed transcription inducer localized in the [[Polarity in embryogenesis|vegetal hemisphere]]. In ''Xenopus'', VegT activates transcription of Nodal-related genes (Xnr) genes, Activin and other mesodermal transcripts, which are responsible for initiating mesodermal formation &lt;sup&gt;(14,21)&lt;/sup&gt;. Using dominant negative Activin receptors in ''Xenopus'' animal caps, it has been shown that FGF signaling is crucial for mesoderm formation through the activation of this and other TGFβ family members &lt;sup&gt;(7,22)&lt;/sup&gt;, and this process is mediated by the VegT-dependent transcription activation.

The mesodermal induction properties of VegT are dose-dependent, such that in Xenopus animal cap explants, high doses induces dorsal mesoderm, while lower doses result in ventral mesoderm &lt;sup&gt;(23)&lt;/sup&gt;. Most importantly, VegT plays a significant role in Xbra expression, and this is dependent on FGF signaling. In ''Xenopus'', disruption of FGF signaling, inhibits the transcription-inducing activity of VegT and Xbra expression, even at the doses where VegT is known to robustly induce Xbra expression. This demonstrates that VegT induction of Xbra and its subsequent function in mesoderm formation is dependent on FGF signaling &lt;sup&gt;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;.

The '''Ghent-Bruges School''' is a manner or movement of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] from about 1475 to about 1550 that developed in southern Netherlands, now Belgium. The term was first used in 1891 by Joseph Destree, author of ''Recherches sur les elumineurs flamands'' and art historian [[Paul Durrieu]].&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118"&gt;Jane Turner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BIXXNwEOv8C&amp;pg=PA118 The Grove Dictionary of Art: From renaissance to impressionism : styles and movements in western art 1400-1900]''. St. Martin's Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-312-22975-7}}. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

It replaced the "courtly style" of about 1440 to 1474 during the southern Netherlands reigns of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]]. That mid-15th-century style consisted of works in primary colors of "wooden, clumsily painted stock figures".&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt; 

The Ghent-Bruges School style created illuminated manuscripts with realistic images of people, including half- and full-length portraits, colorful landscapes and the use of bright and pastel colors.&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt;

'''Graduate Medical Program (GMP)''' or sometimes also known as '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Program (GEP)]]''' or '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM)]]''' are terms generally used outside of the United States to refer to medical programs usually of 4-years duration where applicants are [[university]] graduates who have taken aptitude tests such as the [[GAMSAT]], [[UKCAT]] or [[MCAT]]. These tests are not to be confused with tests such as the [[UMAT]] since tests such as the [[UMAT]] are designed for high school graduates. Medical programs in the United States technically do not require the completion of a previous degree, but do require the completion of 2–3 years of pre-medical sciences at the university level and so are thus classified as [[Second entry degree]]s. However, since in places such as [[Australia]] medical applicants were historically generally high school graduates and only recently have medical schools changed to requiring the completion of a previous [[bachelor's degree]], the terms '''Graduate Medical Program''' and '''Graduate Entry Medicine''' arose to differentiate the new courses.

[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' grimoire.]]
A '''grimoire''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ɪ|m|ˈ|w|ɑr}} {{respell|grim|WAHR}}) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like [[talismans]] and [[amulets]], how to perform magical [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] and [[divination]], and how to [[evocation|summon]] or [[invocation|invoke]] supernatural entities such as [[angel]]s, [[spirits]], [[Deity|deities]] and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"&gt;Davies (2009:1)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the [[Bible]]) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all ''books on magic'' could be thought of as grimoires, not all ''magical books'' should be thought of as grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''grimoire'' is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly [[ceremonial magic]]ians and [[cunning folk]], have used grimoires, the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from [[Jamaica]] to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-5)&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is most commonly believed that the term ''grimoire'' originated from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''grammaire'', which had initially been used to refer to all books written in [[Latin]]. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because "many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

However, the term ''grimoire'' later developed into a [[figure of speech]] amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in [[occultism]] amongst the British following the publication of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett's]] ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]]'' (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===

The earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), where they have been found inscribed on [[cuneiform]] clay tablets that [[archaeology|archaeologists]] excavated from the city of [[Uruk]] and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:8)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as [[heka (god)|heka]], was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by [[Alexander the Great]], invaded Egypt in 332 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"&gt;Davies (2009:8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next three centuries of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] writing system evolved, and the [[Library of Alexandria]] was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"/&gt; Around this time the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] and the Greek [[Hermes]]; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"&gt;Davies (2009:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed that books on magic were invented by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]]. The 1st-century AD writer [[Pliny the Elder]] stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher [[Zoroaster]] around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician [[Osthanes]]. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"&gt;Davies (2009:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Hebrews|Jewish]] people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from [[Moses]], who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical [[Old Testament]]), present him as a [[polytheism|polytheist]] who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"/&gt;

Meanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], sects of [[early Christianity]]. In the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'' found within the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], for instance, there is information on [[astrology]] and the [[angels]]. In possible connection with the ''Book of Enoch'', the idea of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and his great-grandson [[Noah]] having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|quote="Many of those [in [[Ephesus]]] who believed [in Christianity] now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power."|source=[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19, c. 1st century}}

Israelite King [[Solomon]] was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of [[demonic possession|possession]]. The book may have been the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' but was more probably a different work.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=E. M.|authorlink=Eliza Marian Butler |title=Ritual Magic |year=1979 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-521-29553-X |edition=Reprint |chapter=The Solomonic Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''Testament of Solomon'' is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.

The work tells of the building of [[The Temple]] and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel [[Michael]] gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the [[Seal of Solomon]], had the power to bind [[demons]] from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the ''Testament'', he was tempted into worshiping "false gods", such as [[Moloch]], [[Baal]], and [[Rapha (god)|Rapha]]. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Christianity became the dominant faith of the [[Roman Empire]], the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with [[paganism]], and [[book burning|burned books of magic]]. The [[New Testament]] records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of [[Sceva]] became known, many converts decided to [[Book burning at Ephesus|burn their own magic and pagan books]] in the city of [[Ephesus]]; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:18-20)&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician [[Pythagoras]].

=== Medieval period ===
In the [[Medieval]] period, the production of grimoires continued in [[Christendom]], as well as amongst [[Jews]] and the followers of the newly founded [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. As the historian Owen Davies noted, "while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with "natural magic" and those that dealt in "demonic magic".&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"&gt;Davies (2009:22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]]; for instance, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the [[Devil]] and his [[demons]]. These grimoires dealt in such topics as [[necromancy]], [[divination]] and [[demonology]].&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"/&gt; Despite this, "there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,"&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:36)&lt;/ref&gt; while several grimoires were attributed to [[Popes]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'', featuring magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (or סגולות, ''seguloth'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]
One such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century ''Ghâyat al-Hakîm fi'l-sihr'', was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the ''[[Picatrix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:25-26)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century [[The Sworn Book of Honorius|''Sworn Book of Honorius'']], for instance, was (like the ancient ''Testament of Solomon'' before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king [[Solomon]] and included ideas such as prayers and a [[ritual circle]], with the [[mysticism|mystical]] purpose of having visions of God, [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew ''[[Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh]]'', translated in Europe as the ''Liber Razielis Archangeli''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the ''[[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'' or the ''Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon''. In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the ''Clavicula Salomonis'', or the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:15)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist [[Trithemius]] (1462–1516) supposedly had a ''Book of Simon the Magician'', based upon the New Testament figure of [[Simon Magus]]. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of [[Jesus Christ]]'s and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a [[satanism|devil worshiper]] and evil individual.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet [[Virgil]], astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and philosopher [[Aristotle]], had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:24)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the [[Franciscan]] friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1214–94) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors "ought to be prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:37)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
As the [[early modern period]] commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], the [[witch-hunt]]s and the advent of printing. The [[Renaissance]] saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in [[Hermeticism]] among [[occult]]ists and [[ceremonial magic]]ians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient ''Corpus hermeticum'' into Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99).

Alongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish [[mysticism]] known as the [[Kabbalah]], which was spread across the continent by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:46)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important magician of the Renaissance was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'', in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47-48)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), who published ''Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature'', in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:48)&lt;/ref&gt; A third such individual was [[Johann Georg Faust]], upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as [[Christopher Marlow]]e's ''Doctor [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Faust]]us'', that portrayed him as consulting with demons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:49-50)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[demonology]] had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including ''The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'', which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa,&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of [[exorcism]], the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:59-60)&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including ''Magia naturalis'', written by [[Giambattista Della Porta]] (1535–1615).&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:57)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pentagram and human body (Agrippa).jpg|thumb|A man inscribed in a [[pentagram]], from [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (Eng., ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). The signs on the perimeter are [[astrology|astrological]].]]

The advent of [[printing]] in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The ''nóminas'' were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:45)&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly in [[Protestant]] countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], where such grimoires were published.

Despite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:53-54)&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular [[folk magic]] of the average people and, in particular, that of the [[cunning folk]], who were professionally involved in folk magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:66-67)&lt;/ref&gt; These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires and the parts of North America controlled by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:84-90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the [[Inquisition]], a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered [[heresy|heretical]]. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:54-55)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1599, the church published the ''Indexes of Prohibited Books'', in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which were still popular.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of [[witchcraft]], which was believed to be [[Satanism|Satanic]] in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Witch Hunt]], caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women.&lt;ref name="Patrick 2007 p. 802"&gt;{{cite book | last=Patrick | first=J. | title=Renaissance and Reformation | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7614-7650-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JDOVMDi8d4C&amp;pg=PA802 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate [[Iceland]] proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:70-73)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of [[the Enlightenment]], many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.

Meanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as [[Rosicrucianism]], which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Emperor [[Lucifer]], master of all the [[fallen angel|rebel spirits]], I beg you to favour me in the call that I am making to your grand minister LUCIFUGÉ ROFOCALE, desiring to make a pact with him; I beg you also, prince [[Beelzebub]] to protect me in my undertaking. O count [[Astaroth|Astarot]]! Be favourable to me, and make it so that this night the grand Lucifege appears to me in human form, and without any bad odour, and that he accords to me, by the pact that I am going to present to him, all the riches I need."|source= From the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]''.}}

The 18th century saw the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a movement devoted to [[science]] and [[rationalism]], predominantly amongst the ruling classes. However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as did the witch trials in certain{{which|date=August 2012}} areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for [[treasure]]. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new form of printing developed in France, the ''[[Bibliothèque bleue]]''. Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} of the populace, in particular the ''Grand Albert'', the ''[[Petit Albert]]'' (1782), the ''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' and the ''[[Grimoire of Pope Leo|Enchiridion Leonis Papae]]''. The ''Petit Albert'' contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a [[Hand of Glory]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:98-101)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'', which was considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}} particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, [[Lucifuge Rofocale|Lucifugé Rofocale]], to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the ''Dragon rouge'' and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:101-104)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar books published in France at the time included the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' and the ''[[Grimoirium Verum]]''. The ''Black Pullet'', probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of [[Napoleon]]'s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |title=grimoire |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2006 |isbn= 1-4381-3000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread availability of printed grimoires in France—despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church—soon{{when|date=August 2012}} spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, [[Geneva]] was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:109-110)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the ''Libro de San Cipriano'', or ''The Book of St. Ciprian'', which falsely claimed to date from c.&amp;nbsp;1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:114-115)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sixthandseventhbooks frontpiece 1880.png|thumb|The title page of the 1880 New York edition of ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses''.]]

In Germany, with the increased interest in [[folklore]] during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779–1832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:121-122)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'' were among the works that later spread to the countries of [[Scandinavia]], where, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], grimoires were known as [[Cyprianus|black books]] and were commonly found among members of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:134-136)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as [[Ebenezer Sibly]]'s ''A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology''. In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] published ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' in 1801. ''The Magus'' contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123-124)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, ''The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic'', although it was never published, largely because Britain [[Napoleonic wars|was at war with France]], and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released ''The Philosophical Merlin'' (1822) and ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century'' (1825), but neither sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:135-137)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, several of these texts (including ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'' and the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'') were reclaimed by para-[[Masonic]] magical organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
''[[The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malchus |first= Marius |title= The Secret Grimoire of Turiel |publisher= Theophania Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-926842-80-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern grimoire, the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]], inspired by [[Babylonian mythology]] and by the "[[Ars Goetia]]", a section in the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' that concerns the summoning of demons. The ''Azoëtia'' of [[Andrew D. Chumbley]] has been described by Gavin Semple as a modern grimoire.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azoëtia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', ''Starfire'' Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] publicly appeared in the 1940s, and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] introduced the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' as a Wiccan grimoire.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite journal |title= Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires  |journal= [[The Guardian]]  |date= 4 April 2008|last= Davies |first= Owen |authorlink= Owen Davies (historian) |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history |accessdate= 2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], headmaster of the [[Grey School of Wizardry]], wrote and compiled the school's ''Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page, 2004) and the sequel ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page 2006).&lt;ref name=Myash2011&gt;
Myash, Jeff, (March 2, 2011), [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361852/Grey-School-Wizardry-Real-life-Dumbledore-opens-worlds-wizard-school.html "This spells trouble! Real-life Dumbledore opens world's first wizard school"], ''MailOnline'', Retrieved October 13, 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in [[fantasy fiction]] and [[role-playing games]]. The most famous fictional grimoire is the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', a creation of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4968">'''HTTP tunneling''' is used to create a network link between two computers in conditions of restricted network connectivity including [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Network address translation|NAT]]s and [[Access control list#Networking_ACLs|ACL]]s, among other restrictions. The tunnel is created by an intermediary called a [[Proxy server|proxy server]] which is usually located in a [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]].

Tunneling can also allow communication using a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] that normally wouldn’t be supported on the restricted network.


== HTTP CONNECT method ==
The most common form of HTTP tunneling is the standardized [[Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods|HTTP CONNECT]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title= Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 |rfc= 2616 |sectionname= Method Definitions, CONNECT |section= 9.9 |page= 56 |last= Fielding |first= R. |year= 1999 |month= June |publisher= [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate= 2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2817) |rfc= 2817 |accessdate= 3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this mechanism, the client asks an HTTP proxy server to forward the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection to the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client. Only the initial connection request is HTTP - after that, the server simply proxies the established TCP connection.

This mechanism is how a client behind an HTTP proxy can access websites using [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] or TLS (i.e. HTTPS). Proxy servers may also limit connections by only allowing connections to the default HTTPS port 443, [[Whitelist|whitelisting]] hosts, or blocking traffic which doesn't appear to be SSL.

===Example negotiation===
The client connects to the proxy server and requests tunneling by specifying the port and the host computer it would like to connect to. The port is used to indicate the protocol being requested.&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="http"&gt;
CONNECT example.host.com:22 HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials

&lt;/source&gt;

If the connection was allowed and the proxy has connected to the specified host then the proxy will return a 2XX success response.&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="http"&gt;
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

&lt;/source&gt;
 
The client is now being proxied to the remote host. Any data sent to the proxy server is now forwarded, unmodified, to the remote host&lt;ref name="rfc7231.4.3.6"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content |rfc=7231 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=4.3.6 |page=30 |year=2014 |month=June |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=4 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the client can communicate using any protocol accepted by the remote host.
In the example below, the client is starting SSH communications as hinted to, by the port number, in the initial CONNECT request.

 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.3\r\n
 ...

== HTTP tunneling without using CONNECT ==
A HTTP tunnel can also be implemented using only the usual HTTP methods as POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. This is similar to the approach used in Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP ([[BOSH (protocol)|BOSH]]).

In this {{Citation/make link|https://github.com/luizluca/bridge|proof-of-concept program }}, a special HTTP server runs outside the protected network and a client program is run on a computer inside the protected network. Whenever any network traffic is passed from the client, the client repackages the traffic data as a HTTP request and relays the data to the outside server, which extracts and executes the original network request for the client. The response to the request, sent to the server, is then repackaged as an HTTP response and relayed back to the client. Since all traffic is encapsulated inside normal GET and POST requests and responses, this approach works through most proxies and firewalls.

Sir '''Henry Duncan Littlejohn''' (1826 – 30 September 1914) was a Scottish surgeon, [[forensic scientist]] and [[public health]] pioneer. He is also known as an inspiration for the literary character [[Sherlock Holmes]].

==Life==

Henry Littlejohn was born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1826 to Isabella Duncan and Thomas Littlejohn, a confectioner of 33 Leith Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83400915|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his studies at the [[Perth Academy]], before attending the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]]. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with distinction in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lothianlives.org.uk/?page_id=1711 |title= Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn: the beginning |publisher=Edinburgh City Archives |accessdate= 5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught surgery by [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Professor Alexander Monro]] and [[Robert Halliday Gunning|Dr Robert Halliday Gunning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/research_awards/prizes/prize_lists/gunning_victoria_history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Littlejohn served as Edinburgh's first [[Medical Officer of Health]] (1862–1908), introducing model sanitation improvements and the legal requirement to [[Notifiable disease|notify cases of infectious diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst219.html|title=Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn|work=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed significantly to the public health movement in Edinburgh and to public health administration and also to urban management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Laxton | first1 = Paul | last2 = Rodger | first2 = Richard | title = Insanitary City: Henry Littlejohn and the Condition of Edinburgh |isbn=1859362206| publisher = Carnegie Publishing Ltd. |year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Edinburgh City Hospital |author= Gray, J. A.  |publisher= Tuckwell Press | date=1999 |isbn= 1862320969}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assisted in later years by Dr [[Thomas William Drinkwater]] [[FRSE]].&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1940, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; Littlejohn also co-founded the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf|title=The Littlejohn Collection|publisher=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Library &amp; Archive|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long a lecturer for the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] at [[Surgeons' Hall]], he was appointed to the [[Medical jurisprudence|Chair of Medical Jurisprudence]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1897.

Serving as Edinburgh's Police Surgeon from 1854 and as Medical Advisor to the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown in Scotland]] in criminal cases, he was often called upon as an [[expert witness]]. From 1862 he was Edinburgh's first Medical Officer of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh: Mapping the City by Christopler Fleet and Daniel MacCannell&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Ministers and elders in the Church of Scotland|kirk elder]] at the [[St Giles' Cathedral|High Kirk of Edinburgh]], Littlejohn filled several prominent posts in public life, including nine years on the board of the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], president of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (1875–76), president of the [[Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh]] (1883–85), and president of the [[Royal Institute of Public Health]] (1893).

Although [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] primarily credited [[Joseph Bell]] as being the source of inspiration for his character [[Sherlock Holmes]], he also cited Henry Littlejohn as being a contributing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doyle |first=A. Conan |title=The Boys' Sherlock Holmes, New &amp; Enlarged Edition |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1961 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Littlejohn, as a forensic expert involved in police investigations, appears to have been joined by Bell on several investigations; furthermore, Littlejohn taught Doyle forensic medicine when Doyle was studying at the medical school of the University of Edinburgh.

Henry Littlejohn was knighted in 1895 by Queen Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lothianlives.org.uk/?page_id=1742|title=Sir Henry Duncan Littlejohn: Wider impact of his work|publisher=Edinburgh City Archives|accessdate =1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later life he lived at 24 Royal Circus in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Second New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at Benreoch, near [[Arrochar, Argyll and Bute|Arrochar]] in Argyll in 1914, and was interred at the [[Dean Cemetery]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.2806.648-b|pmc=2299842| title = SIR HENRY D. LITTLEJOHN, M.D., LL.D.Edin., F.R.C.S.E| journal = BMJ| volume = 2| issue = 2806| pages = 648| year = 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is on the edge of the southern path towards the west end. He is buried with his wife, Isabella Jane Harvey, and their children.

==Henry Harvey Littlejohn==

Sir Henry was the father of Henry Harvey Littlejohn (1862-1927) (normally just called Harvey Littlejohn during his life but posthumously largely called Henry) who followed in his father's footsteps and continued his adoption of tangential thinking to resolve investigations. His early years were spent at the family home, then at 40 York Place.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1863-64&lt;/ref&gt;

H. H. Littlejohn adopted unusual methods of study. This included mapping instances of [[typhoid]] across [[Edinburgh]] in 1891 in conjunction with the noted map-maker, [[John George Bartholomew|J. G. Bartholomew]]. The purpose of this was to track down the source of the outbreak. This technique is now common practice in police techniques to observe patterns in pursuit of crime detection.

The results, published in the Edinburgh Medical Journal in March 1891, proved the outbreak centred upon a property at Gardner's Crescent, in the west of the city, with almost all neighbouring houses becoming infected. He then tracked the original source to a batch of milk from one individual farm, tracked down all the shops that it supplied, and had all milk destroyed (compensating the shop-owners).&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh: Mapping the City, Christopher Fleet and Daniel MacCannell&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]], and Sir [[Thomas Richard Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first persons in the world to be appointed as Chief Police Surgeon for a city (1906).

In later life Harvey Littlejohn lived at 1 Atholl Crescent in Edinburgh's West End.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at a nursing home in [[Edinburgh]] on 15 August 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080820/https://library.rcsed.ac.uk/docs/GD23_Papers_of_the_Littlejohns.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Harvey is buried in his father's plot at [[Dean Cemetery]].

'''Husk''' (or '''hull''') in [[botany]] is the outer shell or coating of a [[seed]]. It often refers to the leafy outer covering of an ear of [[maize]] (corn) as it grows on the plant. Literally, a husk or hull includes the protective outer covering of a seed, [[fruit]], or [[vegetable]]. It can also refer to the [[exuvia]] of bugs or small animals left behind after [[ecdysis|moulting]].

In [[cooking]], '''hull''' can also refer to other waste parts of fruits and vegetables, notably the cap or [[sepal]] of a [[strawberry]].

The husk of a [[legume]] and some similar fruits is called a '''pod'''.

Plantago-seed mucilage is often referred to as husk, or [[psyllium]] husk.

Crop plants of several species have been selected that have hulless seeds, including [[Pepita|pumpkins]], [[Oat|oats]], and [[barley]]. 

==Husking and dehulling==
{{One source|section|date=April 2018}}
Husking of corn is the process of removing its outer layers, leaving only the [[Maize|cob]] or seed rack of the corn. 
Dehulling is the process of removing the hulls (or [[chaff]]) from [[bean]]s and other [[seed]]s.  This is sometimes done using a machine known as a [[huller]]. To prepare the seeds to have [[oil]]s extracted from them, they are cleaned to remove any foreign objects.  Next, the seeds have their hulls, or outer coverings, or husk, removed.  There are three different types of dehulling systems that can be used to process [[soybean]]s: Hot dehulling, warm dehulling and cold dehulling. Hot dehulling is the system offered in areas where beans are processed directly from the field. Warm dehulling is often used by processors who import their soybeans. Cold dehulling is used in plants that have existing drying and conditioning equipment, but need to add dehulling equipment to produce high protein meal. The different dehulling [[temperature]] options are for different types of production, beans and preparation equipment.

In third-world countries, husking and dehulling is still often done by hand using a large [[mortar and pestle]]. These are usually made of wood, and operated by one or more people.

The husk is [[biodegradable]] and may be [[compost]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r17aBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=husk+is+biodegradable+and+composted.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFpvaV_4vVAhWLllQKHbfkC4sQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=husk%20is%20biodegradable%20and%20composted.&amp;f=false|title=Biomass Utilization|last=Cote|first=Wilfred|date=2013-12-01|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475708332|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212184412/https://books.google.com/books?id=r17aBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395&amp;dq=husk+is+biodegradable+and+composted.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFpvaV_4vVAhWLllQKHbfkC4sQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=husk%20is%20biodegradable%20and%20composted.&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is limited to programs which teach four or more languages. There are many others which teach one language.

'''Alphabetical Lists of Languages''' show the courses available to learn each language, at Lang1234, Martindale, Omniglot, Rüdiger Köppe, and UCLA. For the thousands of languages not listed on those sites, for which no course exists, [[Global Recordings Network]] has recorded a standard set of Bible stories in 6,000 languages. With effort, learners can study any language by comparing its recordings to the same story in a language they know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Language Museum|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=[[Alexander Argüelles]] |accessdate=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The list below''' shows the number of languages taught by each program, the name of the program, and the number of different languages used for instruction. Multiple languages of instruction may be available for some but not all courses. For example [[Reise Know-How]] uses 6 languages to teach German, but only German to teach the other languages. On the other hand [[Eurotalk]], [[Pronunciator]] and [[50Languages]] use all languages to teach all the other languages.

A '''Madonna''' ({{IPA-it|maˈdɔnna|lang}}) is a representation of [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], either alone or with her [[child Jesus]]. These images are central [[icon]]s for both the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, Wendy, ''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA696&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions]'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}} page 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is {{ety|it|ma donna|my lady}}. 
The '''Madonna and Child''' type is very prevalent in Christian iconography, divided into many traditional subtypes especially in [[Eastern Orthodox iconography]], often known after the location of a notable icon of the type, such as the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'', ''[[Agiosoritissa]]'', ''[[Blachernitissa]]'', etc., or descriptive of the depicted posture, as in ''[[Hodegetria]]'', ''[[Eleusa icon|Eleusa]]'', etc.

The term ''Madonna'' in the sense of "picture or statue of the Virgin Mary" enters English usage in the 17th century, primarily in reference to works of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. "Madonna" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', e.g. the ''[[Annunciation to Mary]]'', are not typically called "Madonna".

The earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=catacomb&amp;f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt; These are in a narrative context. The classical "Madonna" or "Theotokos" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as "[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' ("God-bearer") in 431.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&amp;pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} page&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it.
In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists,  such as [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Henry Moore]]) while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.

Liturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of Δεσποινα (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' "Lady". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|maˈdɔnna|pron}} ("My Lady") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (δεσποινίς ἡμῶν) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' "Our Lady".&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74 p. 74].

These names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.--&gt;

While the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, "a Madonna", or "a Madonna with Child" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A "Madonna" may alternatively be called "Virgin" or "Our Lady", but "Madonna" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called "Our Lady of Vladimir", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the "Madonna of Vladimir".&lt;ref&gt;"Madonna of Vladimir" e.g. in

==Modes of representation==
There are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.
* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.
* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].
* The ''Madonna enthroned'' is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the ''Madonna and Child'' often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].
* The ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.&lt;ref name=Meiss&gt;''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;
* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the "Mother of God". Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].
* The seated ''Madonna and Child'' is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].
* The ''Adoring Madonna'' is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.
* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.

==History==
[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of [[19th century]]]]
The earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lasareff, "Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as "[[idolatry|idols]]", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] "image"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.&lt;ref&gt;m. Mundell, "Monophysite church decoration" ''Iconoclasm'' (Birmingham) 1977, p 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern examples show the Madonna enthroned, even wearing the closed Byzantine pearl-encrusted crown with pendants, with the Christ Child on her lap.&lt;ref&gt;As in the fresco fragments of the lower [[Basilica di San Clemente]], Rome: see John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.

Late Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.

===Early images===
[[File:Mary &amp; Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, [[6th century]], [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]

There was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] ("God-bearer") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].

By the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; "isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.

The earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.

The ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].&lt;ref Name =Trinchieri&gt;''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&amp;pg=PA15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine influence on the West===
[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]

Very few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.

While theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.

However, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.

===Later medieval period===
[[File:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|288px|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)| Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.]]

It was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.

This is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308–11), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.
[[File:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c.1410]]

The privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.

Despite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.

While the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, it should be noted that her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.

Italian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.

===Renaissance===
[[File:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|thumb|180px|The ''Madonna on a Crescent Moon in [[Hortus Conclusus]] '' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter. ]]
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c.  1484 AD.]]

While the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.

Some of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others.  The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.

The subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Pietà]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.

===Modern images===
[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]
In some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.

In Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''. Some date back to the Middle Ages, while some are still being made today. Usually found on the level of the second floor or higher, and often on the corner of a house, such sculptures were found in great numbers in many cities; [[Mainz]], for instance, was supposed to have had more than 200 of them [[Bombing of Mainz in World War II|before World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

At the culmination of his mission, in 629 CE, Muhammad [[Conquest of Mecca|conquered Mecca]] with a Muslim army, with his first action being the "cleansing" or "purifying" of the [[Kaaba]], wherein he removed all [[pre-Islamic Arabian gods|the pre-Islamic pagan images and idols]] from inside the temple.According to reports collected by [[Ibn Ishaq]] and [[al-Azraqi]], Muhammad did, however, protectively put his hand over a painting of Mary and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], and a fresco of [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] in order to keep them from being effaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.

Moreover one Christian had been allowed and even encouraged to paint an icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Christ on an inside wall of the Ka'bah, where it sharply contrasted with all the other paintings. But [[Quraysh]] were more or less insensitive to this contrast: for them it was simply a question of increasing the multitude of idols by another two; and it was partly their tolerance that made them so impenetrable .... Apart from the icon of the Virgin Mary and the child Jesus, and a painting of an old man, said to be [[Abraham]], the walls inside had been covered with pictures of [[pagan]] [[deities]]. Placing his hand protectively over the icon, the Prophet told [[Uthman]] to see that all the other paintings, except that of Abraham, were effaced."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Source'' (Rochester: Inner Traditions, 1987), pp. 17, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable types and individual works==
[[File:Czestochowska.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], Poland.]] 
There are a large number of articles on individual works of various sorts in [[:Category:Virgin Mary in art]] and its sub-category.  See also the incomplete [[List of depictions of the Virgin and Child]]. The term "Madonna" is sometimes used to refer to representations of Mary that were not created by Italians. A small selection of examples include:
*''[[Golden Madonna of Essen]]'', the earliest large-scale sculptural example in Western Europe and a precedent for the polychrome wooden processional sculptures of Romanesque France, a type known as Throne of Wisdom.
*''[[Madonna of humility]]'' depicting a Madonna sitting on the ground, or low cushions
*''[[Madonna and Child (Duccio)|Madonna and Child]]'', a painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, from around the year 1300.
*''[[The Black Madonna of Częstochowa]]'' (''Czarna Madonna'' or ''Matka Boska Częstochowska'' in Polish) icon, which was, according to legend, painted by St. Luke the Evangelist on a cypress table top from the house of the Holy Family.
*''[[The Benois Madonna|Madonna and Child with Flowers]]'', possibly one of two works begun by the artist.
*''[[Madonna Eleusa]]'' (of tenderness) has been depicted both in the Eastern and Western churches.
*''[[Madonna of the Steps]]'', a relief by Michelangelo.
*''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', by [[Raphael]]
*''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'', by [[Parmigianino]].
*''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'', the name of two paintings by Salvador [[Dalí]] created in 1949 and 1950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1352">In mathematics, the '''max–min inequality''' is as follows:  for any function ''f'': ''Z'' × ''W'' → ℝ,
: &lt;math&gt;
\sup_{z \in Z} \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) \leq \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z, w).
&lt;/math&gt;

When equality holds one says that ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' satisfies a strong max–min property (or a [[saddle point|saddle-point]] property). As the function ''f''(''z'',''w'')=sin(''z''+''w'')  illustrates, this equality does not always hold. A theorem giving conditions on ''f'', ''W'' and ''Z'' in order to guarantee the saddle point property is called a [[minimax theorem]].

==Proof==
Define &lt;math&gt; g(z) \triangleq \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) &lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow g(z) \leq f(z, w), \forall z \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z g(z) \leq \sup_z f(z, w) , \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \sup_z f(z, w), \forall w &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow \sup_z \inf_w f(z,w) \leq \inf_w \sup_z f(z, w) \qquad \square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Medical resident work hours''' refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by [[medical intern]]s and residents during their [[medical residency]].

As per ACGME residents are allowed to work a max of 80hours a week. so typically residents will work 40-80  hours a week depends on speciality and rotation within the speciality ,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week.&lt;ref name=HRG&gt;[http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201116/http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.&lt;ref name="dishonesty" /&gt;

Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Defoe, Deidre M., et al. "Long Hours and Little Sleep: Work Schedules of Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology." ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'', vol. 97, no. 6, June 2001, pp. 1015–18. ''ScienceDirect'', doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01363-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 3604 first- and second-year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=DeWitt C.|last2=Daugherty|first2=Steven R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue in Residency Training: Results of a National Survey of First- and Second-Year Residents|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/27/2/217/2708402|journal=Sleep|volume=27|issue=2|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/sleep/27.2.217|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of high workloads ==
Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse.

Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US [[National Resident Matching Program#Controversy and lawsuits|have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to]], meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision.&lt;ref name="HRG"/&gt;  This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges|accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts]], thus reducing the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for residents, despite the work for much larger numbers of residents being available.

In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.

There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive.

The medical culture has also been blamed. "Generation-bashing", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork.&lt;ref name=schultz/&gt; A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt; A higher "entry barrier", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired.

There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods.

The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt;

==Effects on health==

===Effects of sleep deprivation on residents===
The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust.

Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;See Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991); {{cite journal | author = Bøggild Henrik, Knutsson Anders | year = 1999 | title = Shift Work, Risk Factors, and Cardiovascular Disease | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Health | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 85–99 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.410}}; and Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), "Shiftwork and Health," special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Yo-El S|last2=Ooms|first2=Sharon J|last3=Sutphen|first3=Courtney|last4=Macauley|first4=Shannon L.|last5=Zangrilli|first5=Margaret A.|last6=Jerome|first6=Gina|last7=Fagan|first7=Anne M.|last8=Mignot|first8=Emmanuel|last9=Zempel|first9=John M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2104/3933862|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=8|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1093/brain/awx148|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauppinen |first=Timo |year=2001 |title=The 24-Hour Society and Industrial Relations Strategies |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=European Industrial Relations Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |year=2003 |title=Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients===
The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s and affect [[Sleep deprivation#On attention and working memory|attention and working memory]]. Chronically sleep-deprived people also tend to strongly underestimate their degree of impairment.&lt;ref name="SleepDepPVT"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year= 2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469|last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, hand-eye coordination decreased to a level equal to the performance observed at a blood alcohol concentration of roughly 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Drew|last2=Reid|first2=Kathryn|date=July 1997|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/40775|journal=Nature|volume=388|issue=6639|pages=235–235|doi=10.1038/40775|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of 959 physicians, staying awake for a continuous 24 to 30 hours decreased physicians' overall performance by nearly 1 standard deviation and clinical performance by more than 1.5 standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philibert|first=Ingrid|date=2005-11-01|title=Sleep Loss and Performance in Residents and Nonphysicians: A Meta-Analytic Examination|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/28/11/1392/2707966|journal=Sleep|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1392–1402|doi=10.1093/sleep/28.11.1392|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. "Night float" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1| issn = 1949-8357| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 349–363| last1 = Bolster| first1 = Lauren| last2 = Rourke| first2 = Liam| title = The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review| journal = Journal of Graduate Medical Education| date = 2015| pmid = 26457139| pmc = 4597944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0014013031000085671| issn = 0014-0139| volume = 46| issue = 7| pages = 653–663| last1 = CAVALLO| first1 = ANITA| last2 = RIS| first2 = M.

Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Coggins R, Rosekind MR, Buccino KR. Relationship of day versus night sleep to physician performance and mood. Ann Emerg Med 1994;24:928-934.&lt;/ref&gt; First year medical residents given an EKG arrhythmia-detection task performed significantly worse while sleep-deprived than when well-rested.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman RC, Bigger JT, Kornfeld DS. The intern and sleep loss. N Eng J Med 1971;285:201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Medical residents were also found to take more time and make more errors on laparoscopic procedures after one night on call.&lt;ref&gt;Taffinder NJ, McManus IC, Gul Y, et al. Effect of sleep deprivation on surgeons' dexterity on laparoscopy simulator. Lancet 1998;352:1191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grantcharov TP, Bardram L, Funch-Jensen P, et al. Laparoscopic performance after one night on call in a surgical department: prospective study. BMJ 2001;323:1222-1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors [[blind experiment|blinded]] to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study.&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some new doctors are working 30-hour shifts at hospitals around the U.S. |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 28, 2015 |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib19Nov2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Northwestern-led study of medical residents working 28-hour shifts decried |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 19, 2015 |last=Russell |first=John |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-northwestern-long-hours-1119-biz-20151119-story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duty hour restrictions ==
===Effects of duty hour restrictions===
Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Residents Work Long Hours Despite Rules| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2016-05-06| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/12/04/166477987/medical-residents-work-long-hours-despite-rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|problems]]. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed.

Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs.

===Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US===
The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the [[ACGME]] allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff.

One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Najma|last2=Devitt|first2=Katharine S.|last3=Keshet|first3=Itay|last4=Spicer|first4=Jonathan|last5=Imrie|first5=Kevin|last6=Feldman|first6=Liane|last7=Cools-Lartigue|first7=Jonathan|last8=Kayssi|first8=Ahmed|last9=Lipsman|first9=Nir|date=2014-06-01|title=A systematic review of the effects of resident duty hour restrictions in surgery: impact on resident wellness, training, and patient outcomes|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=259|issue=6|pages=1041–1053|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000595|issn=1528-1140|pmc=4047317|pmid=24662409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolster|first=Lauren|last2=Rourke|first2=Liam|date=2015-09-01|title=The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=7|issue=3|pages=349–363|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1|issn=1949-8357|pmc=4597944|pmid=26457139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Wang|first6=Yanli|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=975–983|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.975|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 reform===
One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Canamucio|first6=Anne|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among patients in VA hospitals in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=984–992|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.984|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Kanaka D.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jayanta|date=2007-07-17|title=Changes in hospital mortality associated with residency work-hour regulations|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=2|pages=73–80|issn=1539-3704|pmid=17548403|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 reform===
When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Srijan|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry R.|last3=Didwania|first3=Aashish K.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Ann C.|last5=Amarnath|first5=Sudha|last6=Kolars|first6=Joseph C.|last7=Dalack|first7=Gregory W.|last8=Nichols|first8=Breck|last9=Guille|first9=Constance|date=2013-04-22|title=Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=8|pages=657–662; discussion 663|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.351|issn=2168-6114|pmc=4016974|pmid=23529201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Anindita|last3=Friedman|first3=William A.|date=2011-12-01|title=Results of a national neurosurgery resident survey on duty hour regulations|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1162–1170|doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182245989|issn=1524-4040|pmid=21606883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choby|first=Beth|last2=Passmore|first2=Cindy|date=2007-06-01|title=Faculty perceptions of the ACGME resident duty hour regulations in family medicine|journal=Family Medicine|volume=39|issue=6|pages=392–398|issn=0742-3225|pmid=17549647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Megha|last2=Drolet|first2=Brian C.|last3=Tammaro|first3=Dominick|last4=Fischer|first4=Staci A.|date=2014-10-01|title=Resident duty hours: a survey of internal medicine program directors|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1349–1354|doi=10.1007/s11606-014-2912-z|issn=1525-1497|pmc=4175662|pmid=24913004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|Problems with duty hour restrictions]].

=== Problems with duty hour restrictions ===
It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours&lt;ref name=dishonesty&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Charles L.|date=2013-12-01|title=Are Duty Hour Regulations Promoting a Culture of Dishonesty Among Resident Physicians?|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=5|issue=4|pages=553–555|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-13-00220.1|issn=1949-8349|pmc=3886449|pmid=24454999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even punished if they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.169| issn = 2168-6262| volume = 148| issue = 5| pages = 427–433| last1 = Drolet| first1 = Brian C.| last2 = Sangisetty| first2 = Suma| last3 = Tracy| first3 = Thomas F.| last4 = Cioffi| first4 = William G.| title = Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations| journal = JAMA Surgery| date =2013| pmid = 23677406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, these studies – particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jena|first=Anupam B.|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2013-09-01|title=Duty hour reform in a shifting medical landscape|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1238–1240|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2439-8|issn=1525-1497|pmc=3744286|pmid=23568191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty Hours, Quality of Care, and Patient Safety: General Surgery Resident Perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1072-7515|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Stuart H.|last2=Miller|first2=Robert H.|last3=Weng|first3=Cindy|last4=Gurgel|first4=Richard K.|date=2014-10-01|title=The effect of duty hour regulation on resident surgical case volume in otolaryngology|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume=151|issue=4|pages=599–605|doi=10.1177/0194599814546111|issn=1097-6817|pmid=25135524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hundert|first=Samuel A.|last2=White|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Reilly|first3=Dominic F.|date=2015-08-01|title=Number of General Medicine Hospital Admissions Performed by Internal Medicine Residents Before and After the 2011 Duty-Hour Regulations|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=108|issue=8|pages=476–481|doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000323|issn=1541-8243|pmid=26280773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision-making and medical errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed methods of reducing workloads ==
The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilkey/&gt;

Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 ''[[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/AnnualReports/PY2012/Healthcare%20Labor%20Shortages%20and%20Potential%20Solutions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment.

===Regulations===

====EU regulation====
Junior doctors in the [[European Union]] fall under the [[European Working Time Directive]], which specifies:

* 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
* 11 hours continuous rest per day 
* one day off each week, or two days off each [[fortnight]] 
* 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours

However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours.  Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bma.org.uk/support-at-work/ewtd/ewtd-juniors&lt;/ref&gt;

====American regulation====
The issue is politically controversial in the [[United States]], where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's [[medical residency]]. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/dh-ComparisonTable2003v2011.pdf Regulation changes]&lt;/ref&gt; regulations from the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours for first, second, and third year residents.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2003rulesJAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert I, Friedmann P, Williams WT |title=New requirements for resident duty hours |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=9 |pages=1112–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12204081 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.9.1112|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011rulesNEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas J.

What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts.  While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report [https://archive.is/20121211093643/http://www.iom.edu/residenthours ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''.] While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1).  The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours.  The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance.   The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, David A., et al. "Resident Duty Hours and Medical Education Policy — Raising the Evidence Bar." ''New England Journal of Medicine'', vol. 376, no. 18, May 2017, pp. 1704–06. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM'', doi:10.1056/NEJMp1703690.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bilimoria KY, Chung JW, Hedges LV, et al.

N Engl J Med 2016;374:713-727&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at primary outcomes of 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Starting July 1, 2017, the ACGME raised the maximum number of consecutive hours a first year resident can work from 16 hours to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/blog/acgme-duty-hours-not-the-only-big-change-in-requirements/|title=ACGME Duty Hours Have Changed. What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the survey of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These residents cited "additional experience" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by "opportunity to see rare cases" (46.5%) and "continuity with patients" (31.8%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=====Towards an 80-hour work week=====
The [[Libby Zion Law|Libby Zion case]], in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Nachiket|date=2014-12-30|title=Learning lessons: the Libby Zion case revisited|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=64|issue=25|pages=2802–2804|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.007|issn=1558-3597|pmid=25541134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=2006-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there."&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medial Residents' Working Hours |url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/healthcare/articles.cfm?ID=6666 |publisher=Public Citizen, Health Research Group |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="ACGMEDutyHours"/&gt;

The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require:
# An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
# A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
# A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
# No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
# One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
# In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.&lt;ref&gt;"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs."  2006.  Page 45 of 154.  [http://www.osteopathic.org/pdf/sir_postdoctrainproced.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call.
#The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours.
#The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period.
#Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.
#All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity.
#Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts.
#The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved.
#The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period.

Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection.&lt;ref name=Wilkey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert Neil|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum-Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CF8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3D2b8NT76sEuLZ0QGn8cTZBQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy.  Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce.  Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.).  Additionally, a one-size-fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties.

==Coping mechanisms== 
Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R.|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T.|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty hours, quality of care, and patient safety: general surgery resident perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77; discussion 77–79|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1879-1190|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions.

Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

'''MultiSeat Desktop Virtualization''' is a method by which a common desktop [[Personal computer|PC]], with extra [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s, mice, and video screens directly attached to it, can be used to install, load, and concurrently run multiple operating systems.  These operating systems can be the same across all "seats" or they can be different.  It is similar to server based computing only in the fact that one [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] is supporting multiple users. On the other hand, it is different because the "terminals" (or seats, as they are known in multiseat jargon) are composed of nothing more than the regular keyboard, monitor and mouse, and these devices are plugged directly into the PC. USB hubs can be used for cable management of the keyboards and mice, and extra video cards (typically dual or quad output) may need to be installed.

==Introduction==
It is commonly known that modern day PC's are extremely powerful and have substantial excess CPU processing power. In fact, most desktop applications do not use the multi-core capabilities of today's CPUs. When an application is launched it runs on the first core, and when a second application is launched, it continues to run on the first core. That process continues (with the second and subsequent cores basically idling) until the original core gets very busy. At that point, the operating system tells the new applications to run on the second and subsequent cores.

===Server based computing===

Server based computing has been around for a long time specifically to take advantage of this excess CPU power and allow multiple users to share it. It started in the 50's and 60's with batch processing and has taken its current day form with [[Citrix]] and [[Terminal Services]]. [[nComputing]] and [[Microsoft Multipoint]] are current iterations of the same thin client technology. The typical problem with this type of system is that it is dependent upon one operating system and one set of applications and there are many software titles that are not allowed to be shared among multiple users. That means that the first user of a program will get access but subsequent users will not. Another problem is that the video is not delivered via native means. It is usually delivered via network traffic and must rely upon the "packetizing" methods employed using TCP-IP. This means that video does not run very well, especially if the network traffic is busy.

===Server Virtualization===

[[Virtualization]] can solve some of these problems. Virtualization is a method by which the "guest" operating system runs on top of, while being separated from the "bare metal" hardware. This means that multiple "guest" operating systems can be run, solving the problem of single user applications not being able to be launched for multiple, concurrent users. [[Xen]] used in conjunction with Citrix, or [[VMware]] used in conjunction with Microsoft Terminal Services are examples of this technology. Although it is still server based computing and relies upon a "thin" or a "fat" client to display the video output of the session, it allows multiple users to launch the same application because they are launching totally different instances of the same application, in different "guest" operating systems. But the issue still remains that video does not run very well because it still relies upon the network to delivery video. It is also extremely complicated to install and maintain, require extra training and knowledge.

===Multiseat desktop virtualization differences===

Multiseat desktop virtualization is an entirely new methodology which combines the cost saving benefits and ease of maintenance of server based computing, the time savings of hardware agnostic cloning, and the capabilities of [[desktop virtualization]], with the performance capabilities of real PC functionality. It takes advantage of this fact to enable ordinary users to install a multiseat PC giving 2 "seats" with a dual-core CPU or 4 "seats" with a quad-core CPU. The operating system of this PC is initially installed just like a regular PC. Regular PC users can install and use this type of product without having to install servers, or know how to manage complicated, server based computing or server based virtualization products. It has the combined benefits of a Type 1 hypervisor and a Type 2 hypervisor [[virtual machine]]. It does this with the efficiency of a Type 1 hypervisor while maintaining the portability of a Type II hypervisor.

A '''mummy''' is a deceased [[human]] or an [[animal]] whose [[skin]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], extreme cold, very low [[humidity]], or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately [[embalming|embalmed]] with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally [[desiccation|desiccated]] bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD (See the section [[#Etymology and meaning|Etymology and meaning]]).

Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent,&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt; both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million [[animal mummies]] have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.&lt;ref name="pets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html|title=Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are [[sacred ibis]], and radiocarbon dating suggests  the Egyptian Ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S. El|last4=Ikram|first4=S.|last5=Curtis|first5=C.|last6=Holland|first6=B.|last7=Willerslev|first7=E.|last8=Millar|first8=C.D.|last9=Lambert|first9=D.M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of Sacred Ibis mummies from ancient Egypt|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X15301243|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=4|pages=355–361|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the well-known mummies of [[ancient Egypt]], deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The [[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave mummies]] of Fallon, Nevada in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the [[Chinchorro mummies]] found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartkusa |first=Luke |last2=Amarasiriwardena |first2=Dulasiri |last3=Arriaza |first3=Bernardo |last4=Bellis |first4=David |last5=Yañez |first5=Jorge |year=2011 |title=Exploring lead exposure in ancient Chilean mummies using a single strand of hair by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) |journal=Microchemical Journal |volume=98 |pages=267–274 |doi=10.1016/j.microc.2011.02.008 |issn=0026-265X |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a [[decapitation|severed head]] dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 AD at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America.&lt;ref name="head"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeometry.org/paleoamerican.htm|title=Andean Head Dated 6,000 Years Old|publisher=archaeometry.org|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology and meaning ==
&lt;!-- Do not change "Etymology" to "Egyptology" --&gt;
The English word ''mummy'' is derived from medieval Latin ''mumia'', a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word ''mūmiya'' (مومياء) and from a Persian word ''mūm'' (wax),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mummy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: mummy |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate= 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant an embalmed corpse, and as well as the bituminous embalming substance, and also meant "[[Asphalt|bitumen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mummy |title=origin of word "mummy" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}} Also "mummy" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed6barch#page/763/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']. Also "momie" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/momie CNRTL.fr (in French)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English|Medieval English]] term "mummy" was defined as "medical preparation of the substance of mummies", rather than the entire corpse, with [[Richard Hakluyt]] in 1599 AD complaining that "these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow".&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Mummy, 1", citing Hakluyr's "Voyages, II, 201"&lt;/ref&gt; These substances were defined as [[mummia]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] defines a mummy as "the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial", citing sources from 1615 AD onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 1, 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chamber's ''Cyclopædia'']] and the Victorian zoologist [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland]]&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 3c&lt;/ref&gt; define a mummy as follows: "A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow".

Wasps of the genus ''[[Aleiodes]]'' are known as "mummy wasps" because they wrap their caterpillar prey as "mummies".

While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Greece]], most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=1-2}} Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] novelties such as [[mummia]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=1}} The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first [[X-ray]] of a mummy came in 1903, when professors [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[Howard Carter]] used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of [[Thutmose IV]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=3}} British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=16}}

Pathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=14-15}} In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in [[Puerto de la Cruz]] on [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].  More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being integration of [[Medical research|biomedical]] and [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.{{sfn| Aufderheide|2003|p=2}}

In more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally "unwrap" mummies without risking damage to the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldock |first1=C |last2=Hughes |first2=SW |last3=Whittaker |first3=DK |last4=Taylor |first4=J |last5=Davis |first5=R |last6=Spencer |first6=AJ |last7=Tonge |first7=K |last8=Sofat |first8=A |year=1994 |title=3-D reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian mummy using x-ray computer tomography |url= http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29982/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue= |pages=806–808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in [[Stereoscopy|3-D]].&lt;ref name=Gewolb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gewolb |first=Josh |title=Computer identifies mummy |journal=Science |date=28 September 2001 |volume=293 |issue=5539 |page=2383 |doi=10.1126/science.293.5539.2383a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=DeChant&gt;{{cite web |last=De Chant |first=Tim |title=Did King Tut Die in a Chariot Accident? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/ancient/did-king-tut-die-in-a-chariot-accident/ |work=Nova Next |publisher=PBS |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Anthropogenic|Spontaneous|Natural}}Types ==

Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as [[Ötzi]], were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions such as those found in [[bog body|bogs]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=2}} While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}
The earliest [[ancient Egypt]]ian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In the era prior to 3500 BC,&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Egyptian Mummy |publisher=Penn Museum |url=http://www.penn.museum/long-term-exhibits/the-egyptian-mummy.html |accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Amandine [https://www.academia.edu/8963492/On_the_Origins_of_the_Egyptian_Mummification ON THE ORIGINS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIFICATION], Kmt 52, 2014, pp. 52-57&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians buried the dead in pit graves, without regard to [[social status]]. Pit graves were often shallow. This characteristic allowed for the hot, dry sand of the desert to [[dehydration|dehydrate]] the bodies, leading to natural mummification.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jimmy |title=An Overview of Mummification in Ancient Egypt |date=22 August 2011 |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/mummification.htm |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural preservation of the dead had a profound effect on [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Deliberate mummification became an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|2nd dynasty]] (about 2800 BC).&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; New research of an 11-year study by [[University of York]], [[Macquarie University]] and [[University of Oxford]] suggests mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought.&lt;ref name="uyork"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2014/research/mummification/ | title=Embalming study ‘rewrites’ key chapter in Egyptian history | publisher=University of York | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to [[Coffin Texts|living well in the afterlife]]. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy lead to the creation of elaborate [[tomb]]s, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Joann |title=Mummies Around the World |date=17 February 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/mummies_01.shtml |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve "true mummification" through a process of [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], followed by preserving the body in various minerals and oils.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.

The few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman period]]. The majority of the [[Papyrus|papyri]] that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as ''[[The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus|The Ritual of Embalming]]'' does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming, however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Riggs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Riggs |first=Christina |title=Funerary Rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods) |publisher=UCLA Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures |date=January 2010 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Wade |first2=Ronald S. |last=Brier |first=Bob |title=Surgical procedures during ancient Egyptian mummification |publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca |date=June 2001 |jstor=27802174 |volume=33 |pages=117–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few.

Written in Book 2 of the ''Histories'' is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using [[natron]] in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Greek historian Herodotus on the process of mummification -- and he has been proven accurate| publisher = utexas.edu| url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| accessdate = 9 November 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023202442/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| archivedate = 23 October 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

By utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the [[cranial cavity]] of the skull.&lt;ref name="Jarus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarus |first=Owen |title=Oops! Brain-Removal Tool Left in Mummy's Skull |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=14 December 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/oops-brain-removal-tool-left-mummys-skull-160456836.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus' works that the rod had been a hook made of iron.&lt;ref name="Herodotus" /&gt; Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers [[Bob Brier]] and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of [[Gravitation|gravity]], as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece-by-piece with a hook.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

Through various methods of study over many decades, modern [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of [[linen]] cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small [[amulet]]s to guard the decedent from evil.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in a resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. Resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Riggs" /&gt;

=== Mummification and rank ===
Mummification is one of the defining customs in [[ancient Egyptian society]] for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to [[Herodotus]]. They range from "the most perfect" to the method employed by the "poorer classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Most perfect" method ====

The most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described serve one of these two functions.
[[File:Mòmia Nesi BMVB 2964.jpg|alt=Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain|thumb|Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). [[Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer]]. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain]]
First, the [[brain]] was removed from the [[cranium]] through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to [[wiktionary:liquefy|liquefy]] the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the [[Flank (anatomy)|flank]] with a sharp blade fashioned from an [[Ethiopia]]n stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.

The [[abdominal cavity]] was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including [[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], and, Herodotus notes, "every other sort of spice except [[frankincense]]", also to preserve the person.

The body was further dehydrated by placing it in [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt, for seventy days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than seventy days. Any shorter time and the body is not completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body is too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then wash the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.

At this point, the body was given back to the family. These "perfect" mummies were then placed in wooden cases that were human-shaped. Richer people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |pages=50–51 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Avoiding expense ====

The second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who "wish to avoid expense". In this method, an oil derived from [[Cedrus|cedar trees]] was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of [[canopic jar]]s and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the [[rectum]]. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a [[shaft tomb]]. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inexpensive method ====

The third and least-expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the [[intestines]] with an unnamed liquid, injected as an [[enema]]. The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=ToLiveForever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=52 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the [[African continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steyn|first=Maryna|last2=Binneman|first2=Johan|last3=Loots|first3=Marius|date=2007|title=The Kouga Mummified Human Remains|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/5758/Steyn_Kouga(2007).pdf?sequence=1|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=62|pages=3-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosothwane|first=Morongwa|date=2011|title=The Tuli Mummy: A Preliminary Report from Northeastern Botswana|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/19039/Mosothwane_Tuli(2011).pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=66|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Libya ====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist [[Fabrizio Mori]] to [[Libya]] during the winter of 1958–1959 in the natural cave structure of [[Uan Muhuggiag]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281}} After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000–8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated [[Autopsy|post-mortem]], possibly in an effort to preserve the remains.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=282}} A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Science: Older than Egypt?|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865145,00.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=21 December 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281-282}}&lt;ref name=Wan&gt;{{cite web|title=Wan Muhuggiag|url=http://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
[[File:Momie de Jingzhou.jpg|thumb|300px|Mummy in the history museum of [[Jingzhou]]]]

The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates, however these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard" /&gt;

==== China ====
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|left|The mummy of [[Xin Zhui]].]]
Mummies from various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] throughout [[China]]'s history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zolfagharifard |first=Ellie |title=The Chinese mummy that aged 300 years in a day: Experts baffled by 'perfectly preserved' body that turned BLACK just hours after its coffin was opened |publisher=Mail Online |date=15 October 2013 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2460931/The-Chinese-mummy-aged-300-years-day-Experts-baffled-perfectly-preserved-body-turned-BLACK-just-hours-coffin-opened.html |accessdate=9 November 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is [[Xin Zhui]]. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the [[Mawangdui]] archaeological site in [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonn-Muller |first=Eti |title=China's Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=10 April 2009 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mawangdui/ |accessdate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the wife of the marquis of Dai during the [[Han dynasty]], who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative.&lt;ref name="K.Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K.

Her corpse was so well-preserved that surgeons from the Hunan Provincial Medical Institute were able to perform an autopsy.&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller" /&gt; The exact reason why her body was so completely preserved has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="Orbit"&gt;{{cite web| title = Meet the Lady Dai . . .| publisher = redorbit.com| date = 4 November 2004| url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/100340/meet_the_lady_dai____of_145bc_/| accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more infamous mummies to be discovered in China are those termed [[Tarim mummies]] because of their discovery in the [[Tarim Basin]]. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day [[Xinjiang]] region.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |title=A Host of Mummies, a Forest of Secrets |publisher=New York Times |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16archeo.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot long wooden poles in the place of tombstones.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt; [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] data&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert J. |last=Saiget |title=Caucasians preceded East Asians in basin |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |work=The Washington Times |publisher=News World Communications |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2007-08-20 |quote=A study last year by [[Jilin]] University also found that the mummies' DNA had Europoid genes. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420224622/http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |archivedate=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--a major newspaper as is legitimate a source as any other publication.--&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, but unpublished research is not.

It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt; Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt;

==== Siberia ====
In 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. [[Natalia Polosmak]] discovered the [[Siberian Ice Maiden]], a [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Siberian woman, on the [[Ukok Plateau]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] near the Mongolian border.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes"&gt;{{cite web| title = Siberian Princess reveals her 2,500 year old tattoos| publisher = The Siberian Times| date = 14 August 2012| url = http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/| accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adkins |first=Jan |title=Unquiet Mummies |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/unquiet-mummies.html |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her left arm and hand were tattooed with [[animal style]] figures, including a highly stylized [[deer]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the [[Altai Republic]], formed after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in [[Novosibirsk]] in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polosmak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polosmak |first=Natalya |title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven |journal=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |pages=80–103 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

==== Philippines ====
Philippine mummies are called [[Kabayan Mummies]]. They are common in [[Igorot]] culture and their heritage. The mummies are found in some areas named [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]] and among others. The mummies are dated between the 14th and 19th centuries.

=== Europe ===
The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/solved-the-mystery-of-britains-bronze-age-mummies-48475 |title=Solved: the mystery of Britain’s Bronze Age mummies |last=Booth |first=Tom |date=24 Nov 2015 |website=The Conversation |access-date=3 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest, and most infamous, mummies (nicknamed [[Ötzi]]) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st Century.

==== Bog bodies ====
{{Main article|Bog body}}
The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]] have produced a number of [[Bog body|bog bodies]], mummies of people deposited in [[bog|sphagnum bogs]], apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining [[stomach]] contents. A famous case is that of the [[Haraldskær Woman]], who was discovered by labourers in a bog in [[Jutland]] in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal [[sarcophagus]] at the Saint Nicolai Church, [[Vejle]], where she currently remains. Another famous bog body, also from Denmark, known as the [[Tollund Man]] was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. To this day, only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Library |first1=Silkeborg Public |last2=Museum |first2=Silkeborg |url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp |title=A Body Appears |work=The Tollund Man – A Face from Prehistoric Denmark |accessdate=22 September 2007 |publisher=Silkeborg Public Library |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Guanche mummies}}
The mummies of the [[Canary Islands]] belong to the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Guanches|Guanche]] people and date to the time before 14th Century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians; involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping of the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Ireland |first2=Robert |last=Horne |first=Patrick |title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization |journal=The Bryologist |year=1991 |volume=94 |issue=4 |page=407 |jstor=3243832 |publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society |doi=10.2307/3243832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockburn"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cockburn |editor1-first=Aidan |editor2-last=Cockburn |editor2-first=Eve |editor3-last=Reyman |editor3-first=Theodore A. |title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=University Press, Cambridge, UK |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Guanche+mummies |edition=2nd |accessdate=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic ====
[[File:Brno CZ Crypt at the Capuchin Monastery 02.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Mummies in the [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]]]]
The majority of mummies recovered in the [[Czech Republic]] come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=192}}&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu /&gt;

The [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]] contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES and MUMMIFIED REMAINS|url=http://www.orchestrion.cz/mummy.htm|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 18th Century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin monks]] of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu&gt;{{cite web|title=The Czech's Capuchin Crypt|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/czechs-capuchin-crypt|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the [[Church of St. Procopius of Sázava]] in [[Vamberk]] in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=Agentura&gt;{{cite web|title=Monastery of Broumov|url=http://www.broumovsko.cz/en/monastery-of-broumov/monastery-of-broumov|publisher=Agentura pro rozvoj Broumovska|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlické Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt;

The [[Klatovy]] catacombs currently house an exhibition of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674–1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klatovy&gt;{{cite web|title=New exposition|url=http://www.katakomby.cz/klatovycatacombs/newexposition.aspx|publisher=Klatovské katakomby|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
[[File:Skrudstrupspigen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a grave mound in Denmark.]]
Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Eshøj mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the [[Egtved Girl]], who were all found inside burial mounds, or [[tumuli]].

In 1875, the Borum Eshøj grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties.&lt;ref name=Natmus /&gt; Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50–60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/familien_i_borum_eshoej/kvinden_fra_borum_eshoej/language/uk/ |title=The woman from Borum Eshøj – Oldtiden |publisher=Oldtiden.natmus.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351–1345 BC.&lt;ref name=Natmus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-bronze-age/the-family-from-borum-eshoej/ |title= The family in Borum Eshøj |publisher= http://natmus.dk/ |accessdate= 11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a [[tumulus]] in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18–19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the [[sprang]] technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaul |first=Flemming |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skrydstrup |title=Skrydstrup, We know where she lived – 1001 Stories of Denmark |publisher=Kulturarv.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egtved Girl]], dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a [[bodice]] and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an [[Bradawl|awl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

==== Hungary ====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church in [[Vác]], Hungary from the 1729–1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in [[Budapest]]. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.&lt;ref name=AtlObs1&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES OF VÁC, HUNGARY|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary|publisher=AtlasObscura|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
[[File:Monks' Corridor.jpg|thumb|right|Mummies in the Monks' Corridor of the [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]].]]
The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=193}} Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.

The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the [[Ötztal Alps]] on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed [[Ötzi]], the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the [[Tamins-Carasso-Isera]] cultural group of [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite web |last=Owen |first=James |title=5 Surprising Facts About Otzi the Iceman |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-otzi-ice-man-mummy-five-facts/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=11 November 2013 |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OtziCulture&gt;{{cite web|title=Which cultural group did Ötzi belong to?|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111110719/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by [[Walther Parson]] of [[Innsbruck Medical University]] revealed Ötzi has 19 living genetic relatives.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

The [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini|Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo]] were built in the 16th century by the monks of Palermo’s Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the most famous final burials being that of [[Rosalia Lombardo]]. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies. (See: [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]])

The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the [[crypt]] of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di [[Pievepelago]], Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.&lt;ref name=Huddersfield&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Stefano Vanin’s forensic expertise is used to learn lessons from the extraordinary Mummies of Roccapelago|url=http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|publisher=University of Huddersfield|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=24 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111111205/http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically-significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.&lt;ref name=Spirit /&gt;

{{Main article|Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi}}

[[Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi]] ("Long ago person found" in the [[Southern Tutchone]] language of the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations]]), was found in August 1999 by three First Nations hunters at the edge of a glacier in [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned [[Inuit]] settlement called [[Qilakitsoq]], in Greenland. The "Greenland Mummies" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James M. |title=World Mummies: Greenland Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |publisher=Mummy Tombs |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208160451/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hart Hansen |editor1-first=Jens Peder |editor2-last=Meldgaard |editor2-first=Jørgen |editor3-last=Nordqvist |editor3-first=Jørgen |title=The Greenland Mummies |location=London |publisher=British Museum Publications |year=1991 |isbn=0-7141-2500-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
[[File:Placid death.JPG|left|190px|thumb|A mummy from Guanajuato]]
Intentional mummification in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]] was practiced by the [[Aztec]] culture. These bodies are collectively known as [[Aztec mummy|Aztec mummies]]. Genuine Aztec mummies were "bundled" in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask.&lt;ref name=Langely&gt;{{cite web |last=Langely |first=James |title=NOTES I-3: TEOTIHUACAN INCENSARIOS: THE 'V' MANTA AND ITS MESSAGE |url=http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |publisher=Internet Journal for Teotihuacan Archaeology and Iconography |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112060653/http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture. (See: [[Aztec mummy]])

Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico, though the most famous are the [[mummies of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor unravels secrets of the Guanajuato mummies |newspaper=US Fed News Service, Including US State News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at ''El Museo de las Momias'' in the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] since 1970.

==== United States ====
[[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave Man]] was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to [[guano]] mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains are currently held at the [[Nevada State Museum, Carson City|Nevada State Museum]].

=== Oceania ===
[[File:Robley with mokomokai collection 2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Horatio Gordon Robley with his mokomokai collection.]]

Mummies from the [[Oceania]] are not limited only to [[Australia]]. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in [[New Zealand]], and the [[Torres Strait]],{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=289}} though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=277}} Prior to the 20th Century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.

==== Australia ====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in [[Australia]] are thought be related to those found in the [[Torres Strait]] islands,&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=Warren |title=Mummification in Australia and in America |journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1928 |volume=58 |pages=115–138 |jstor=4619529}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques (See:[[Mummy#Torres Strait|Torres Strait]]). Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;

==== Torres Strait ====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy.&lt;ref name=Melanesia&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James |title=Melanesia Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |accessdate=15 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015193124/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Melanesia /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main article|Mokomokai}}

Some [[Māori people|Māori]] tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare.&lt;ref name=Maori1 /&gt; They are also known as [[Mokomokai]]. In the 19th Century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of which being housed across France alone. In 2010, the Rouen City Hall of France returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.&lt;ref name=Maori1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummified Maori head returned to NZ|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=10 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204030056/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that some Maori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread.&lt;ref name=Orchiston&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orchiston |first=D.

There is still controversy, however, as to the nature of the mummification process. Some bodies appear to be spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of deliberate practices. General modern consensus tends to agree that there could be a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the ancient Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

=== South America ===
The [[South America]]n continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental.&lt;ref name="head" /&gt; The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Earliest Mummies| publisher = The Field Museum| url = http://mummies.fieldmuseum.org/behind-the-scenes/south-american-mummies| accessdate = 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings.&lt;ref name="Arriaza"&gt;{{cite web |last2=Hapke |first2=Russell A. |last3=Standen |first3=Vivien G. |last=Arriaza |first=Bernardo |title=Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=16 December 1998|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/ |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru.

==== Chinchorro mummies ====
[[File:Momia cultura chinchorro año 3000 AC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chinchorro mummies are the oldest deliberate mummies.]]
{{Main article|Chinchorro mummies}}
The [[Chinchorro mummies]] are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in [[5th millennium BC]] and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years,&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the [[Atacama Desert]], which aided in desiccation.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt;

==== Inca mummies ====
[[File:Llullaillaco mummies in Salta city, Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco]] mummy in [[Salta Province]] ([[Argentina]]).]]
Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] period (1438–1532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]. These are collectively known as "ice mummies".&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo Peak]] in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano [[Sabancaya]] melted away ice that covered the body.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Ice Mummies of the Inca |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ice-mummies-inca.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plomo Mummy|Mummy of El Plomo]] was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

[[Mummy Juanita]] was discovered near the summit of [[Ampato]] in the Peruvian section of the [[Andes]] mountains by archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]].&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of [[Cusco]], as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

More evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the [[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco mummies]] on the border of Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Yancey |title=Interview: "Inca Mummy Man" Johan Reinhard |publisher=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0621_050621_incamummy.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''.&lt;ref name="Handwerk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Handwerk |first=Brian |title=Inca Child Sacrifice Victims Were Drugged |publisher=National Geographic |date=29 July 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130729-inca-mummy-maiden-sacrifice-coca-alcohol-drug-mountain-andes-children/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&amp;rptregcampaign=20131016_rw_membership_r1p_us_se_w#finished |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[biochemistry|biochemical analysis]] of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of [[alcohol]] and [[coca]], possibly in the form of [[chicha]], in the months leading up to sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt; The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child's mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt;

'''Inca emperors.''' The bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death.  In 1533, the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them.  The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney&lt;/ref&gt;

The population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors.  This reverence seemed idolatry to the [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital.  The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;McCaa, Robert, Nimlos, Aleta, and Hampe Martinez, Teodoro (nd) "Why Blame Smallpox"; http://users.pop.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/why_blame_smallpox.pdf, accessed 27 Jan 2017; Pringle, Harriet (2011), "Inca Empire", ''National Geographic'', http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/inca-empire/pringle-text/2, accessed 27 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful.  The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty.  Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle &lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-mummification ==
{{Main article|Buddhist mummies|Sokushinbutsu}}
Monks whose bodies remain [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.

Many Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in [[lotus position]], put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or [[Calcium oxide|lime]]) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.

Bodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[pine]] bark, and ''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum|urushi]]'' tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~anomaly/japan/dbuddha.htm |title=The Buddhist Mummies of Japan |publisher=Sonic.net |date=24 August 1998 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mummies ==
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]] wished to be mummified after he died.]]

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
In the 1830s, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of [[utilitarianism]], left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the "horror at dissection originates in ignorance"; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miss Cellania |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |title=6 Restless Corpses |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119161451/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and "seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought". His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the [[University College London]].

=== Vladimir Lenin ===
During the early 20th century, the Russian movement of [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], as represented by [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s death, [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]] suggested to [[Cryonics|cryonically preserve]] his body and brain in order to revive him in the future.&lt;ref name="azbuka"&gt;See the article: А.М. и А.А. Панченко «Осьмое чудо света», in the book Панченко А.М. О русской истории и культуре. St. Petersburg: Azbuka, 2003. Page 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary equipment was purchased abroad, but for a variety of reasons the plan was not realized.&lt;ref name="azbuka" /&gt; Instead his body was [[Embalming|embalmed]] and placed on permanent exhibition in the [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin Mausoleum]] in Moscow, where it is displayed to this day. The mausoleum itself was modeled by [[Alexey Shchusev]] on the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Tomb of Cyrus]].

===Gottfried Knoche===
In late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named [[Gottfried Knoche]] conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near [[La Guaira]]. He developed an [[embalming fluid]] (based on an [[aluminum chloride]] compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.

=== Summum ===
In 1975, an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] organization by the name of [[Summum]] introduced "Modern Mummification", a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum's process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, [[Claude Nowell|Summum Bonum Amen Ra]], who died in January 2008.&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravitz |first=Jessica |title=Summum: Homegrown spiritual group, in news and in a pyramid |publisher=CNN |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/11/summum-a-belief-system-in-the-news-%E2%80%93-and-unlike-any-other/ |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summum is currently considered to be the only "commercial mummification business" in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Grant |title=Summum: Religious group performs mummification rituals in Utah pyramid |publisher=KSL.com |date=30 October 2010 |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=22660276 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alan Billis ===
In 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification. The process was filmed for television, for the documentary ''Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret''.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite news |last=Knight |first=Kathryn |title=Married to the mummy: Taxi driver Alan told his wife he'd agreed to be mummified after death, so how did she feel finally seeing 'Tutan-Alan'? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2052037/Mummifying-Alan-How-did-Alan-Billis-wife-Jan-feel-finally-seeing-Tutan-Alan.html |publisher=Mail Online |accessdate=15 November 2013 |location=London |date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret | series=Mummifying Alan: Egypt's Last Secret  | network = Channel 4| airdate = 2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billis made the decision to allow his body to be mummified after being diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2009. His body currently resides at London's Gordon Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/gordon/newsevents/newsrecords/2012/Feb/Museums-final-resting-place-for-modern-mummy.aspx|title=King's College London – Museum's final resting place for modern mummy|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastination ===
{{Main article|Plastination}}
[[Plastination]] is a technique used in [[anatomy]] to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.

The technique was invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] when working at the anatomical institute of the [[Heidelberg University]] in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the [[Body Worlds]] traveling exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com |title=Body Worlds Official Web Site |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in [[Heidelberg]].

More than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.plastination.org/ |title=International Society for Plastination |publisher=Isp.plastination.org |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment of ancient mummies in modern times ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], based on a mistranslation from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the [[Desiccation|sun-desiccated]] corpses of criminals, slaves and [[Suicide|suicidal]] people were substituted by mendacious merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bodies/cases/case18.html | title = What was mummy medicine? | accessdate =8 February 2008 | publisher = [[Channel 4]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] in powdered form as in [[mellified man]].&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daly |first=N. |year=1994 |title=That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=24–51 |doi=10.2307/1345912 |jstor=1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as [[mummy brown]], based on ''[[mummia]]'' (sometimes called alternatively ''[[caput mortuum]]'', Latin for ''death's head''), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm Mumie - nicht lieferbar!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215033915/http://www.kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm |date=15 February 2012 }} article by Kremer Pigmente GmbH &amp; Co NYC,  (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;   Many thousands of mummified cats were also sent from Egypt to England to be processed for use in [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wake |first=Jehanne |author-link=Jehanne Wake |title=Kleinwort, Benson: the history of two families in banking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-828299-0 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm1fHrcgZuoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA118&amp;dq=mummified+cats+fertilizer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, Egyptology was a huge fad in Europe, especially in [[Victorian era|Victorian England]]. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions.&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping" /&gt; These sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.

The use of mummies as [[fuel]] for [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] was documented by [[Mark Twain]] (likely as a joke or humor),&lt;ref name="Straight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020222.html | publisher = [[The Straight Dope]] |  title = Do Egyptians burn mummies as fuel? | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate =16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the truth of the story remains debatable. During the [[American Civil War]], mummy-wrapping linens were said to have been used to manufacture paper.&lt;ref name="Straight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Capital Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pronovost |first=Michelle |url=http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106183429/http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2008 |date=17 March 2005 |publisher=[[Capital Weekly]] |title=Necessity of paper was the 'mummy' of invention}} &lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the reality of these claims is still equivocal.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Nicholson |authorlink=Nicholson Baker |title=''[[Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper]]'' |year=2001 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-375-50444-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dane"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dane |first=Joseph A. |year=1995 |title=The Curse of the Mummy Paper |journal=Printing History |volume=17 |pages=18–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest study of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] "The Future of Geothermal Energy – Impact of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) on the United States in the 21st Century" (2006) points out the essential importance of developing an economical deep geothermal boring technology. With current boring technologies, bore price rises exponentially with depth. Thus, finding a boring technology with which the bore price rise would be approximately linear with increasing bore depth is an important challenge.

==New drilling technologies requirements==

This MIT study characterizes the requirements on new fast and ultra-deep boring technology as follows:

==Examples of new drilling technologies==

There are more than 20 research efforts solving innovative drilling technology such as: laser, spallation, plasma, electron beam, pallets, enhanced rotary, electric spark and discharge, electric arc, water jet erosion, ultrasonic, chemical, induction, nuclear, forced flame explosive, turbine, high frequency, microwave, heating/cooling stress, electric current and several other. The most promising solutions are mentioned below:

1.	[[Spallation|Hydrothermal spallation]] – Thermal spallation drilling uses a large, downhole burner, much like a jet engine, to apply a high heat flux to the rock face. This drilling technology is based on thermal processes of rock spallation and fusion. 

2.	[[Plasma (physics)|Chemical plasma]] – is based on crushing by high-speed combustion, but nitric acid as oxidizing agent instead of oxygen.

3.	[[Erosion]] - most patents refer to water jet rock cutting. Different modification variants are described, e.g. utilization of cavitation, turbulent processes, combination with mechanical processes, etc.

4.	[[Laser]] - during the recent decade intense research has been made into utilization of high energy laser beams for rock disintegration. Primarily conversion of military equipment is concerned. Laser energy is used for the process of thermal spallation, melting, or evaporation of rock. 

5.	[[Electric discharge]] - The methods utilizing electric discharge are based on long-term experience gained in other application areas.  

6.	[[Plasma deep drilling technology|Electrical plasma]] - is based on crushing by irradiation of plasma with high temperature up to 20 000°C

7.      [[Direct transfer of heat]] - This technology is based on electrically melting rock at 1400°C; lava gravel will float to top; bore hole walls are of glass of surrounding rock.  Cost decreases with depth, with no limit on depth of bore hole.  Bore diameters from 1m to 10m.  Recovery of energy used to melt rock.

==High-energetic electrical plasma==
[[Image:Plasmatorch using water steam as plasma-creation gas.jpg|thumb|Plasmatorch using water steam as plasma-creation gas]]
One of the most promising approaches in deep drilling field is utilization of [[Plasma deep drilling technology|electrical plasma]]. It has lower energy efficiency than some of the other technologies, but it has several other advantages. Producing boreholes with wide range of diameters or drilling in water environment can be mentioned. The research team from Slovakia has developed drilling concept based on utilization of electrical plasma. The core of the research is held in [[Research Centre for Deep Drilling]] which was opened in the premises of [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]]. Only a very small number of companies have embraced this method, e.g. [[Geothermal Anywhere|GA Drilling]], headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia.
=== Advantages of Plasma deep drilling technology ===

# Higher drilling energy efficiency
# Continuous drilling process without replacement of mechanical parts
# Constant casing diameter
# Effective transport of disintegrated rock

==State of the art==

No one as of yet has proved the effective use of these techniques in severe conditions. Other complications including on site energy and material transport from 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;km bores also require refinement to become both technically and economically feasible.

''Nitrosomonas'' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-negative]] rod-shaped [[chemoautotrophic]] [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Microbewiki"&gt;http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Nitrosomonas&lt;/ref&gt;

This organism oxidizes [[ammonia]] into [[nitrite]] as a metabolic process. ''Nitrosomonas'' are useful in [[bioremediation]]. They are important in the [[nitrogen cycle]] by increasing the availability of nitrogen to plants while limiting [[carbon dioxide]] fixation.&lt;ref name="Microbewiki" /&gt; The genus is found in soil, freshwater, and on building surfaces, especially in areas that contains high levels of nitrogen compounds.

''Nitrosomonas'' prefers an optimum pH of 6.0-9.0 and a temperature range of 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C.  Most species are [[Motility|motile]] with a flagellum located in the polar regions.

The organism has power generating membranes, which form long, thin tubes inside the cell. These use electrons from the oxidation of ammonia to produce energy.&lt;ref name="Microbewiki" /&gt; It obtains the carbon it requires from the atmosphere via [[carbon fixation]], which converts carbon in a gaseous form into carbon bound in organic molecules.

Unlike plants, which fix carbon into sugar through energy gained through the process of [[photosynthesis]], ''Nitrosomonas'' use energy gained through the oxidation of ammonia to fix gaseous carbon dioxide into organic molecules. ''Nitrosomonas'' must consume large amounts of ammonia before cell division can occur, and the process of cell division may take up to several days. This microbe is [[Photophobia (biology)|photophobic]], and will generate a [[biofilm]] matrix or form clumps with other microbes to avoid light.&lt;ref name="Microbewiki" /&gt;

The species ''Nitrosomonas europaea'' has been identified as also being able to degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including [[trichloroethylene]], [[benzene]], and [[vinyl chloride]].&lt;ref name="genome"&gt;http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/niteu/niteu.home.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some ''Nitrosomonas'' species possess the enzyme urease{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, which catalyzes the conversion of the urea molecule to two ammonia molecules and one carbon dioxide molecule.   ''Nitrosomonas europaea'', as well as populations of soil-dwelling ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), have been shown to assimilate the carbon dioxide released by the reaction to make biomass via the [[Calvin Cycle]], and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to nitrite.  This feature may explain enhanced growth of AOB in the presence of urea in acidic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, K. L., G. K. Sims, and R. L. Mulvaney. 2005.  Availability of urea to autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as related to the fate of 14C- and 15N-labeled urea added to soil.  Biol. Fert. Soil. 42:137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources regard [[Nitrobacteraceae]] to be the family of the genus ''Nicosomonas''.

An '''occupational exposure limit''' is an upper limit on the acceptable [[concentration]] of a [[hazardous substance]] in workplace [[air]] for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect [[occupational safety and health]]. It is an important tool in [[risk assessment]] and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work | title=Occupational Exposure Limits | url=http://osha.europa.eu/good_practice/topics/dangerous_substances/oel | accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or [[control banding]] strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.

== Background ==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now.  With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the [[Occupational hygiene|Occupational Hygiene]] profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IOHA | title=International OEL Issues and Activities \ | url=http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | archivedate=2015-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers.  Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values.  In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers.  The "Hierarchy of OELs" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=AIHA | title=Webinar:  The New Era of Global Exposure Limit Setting Processes - Harmonization on an OEL Hierarchy Approach |url=http://www.aiha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy of Occupational Exposure Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]
[[File:Analysis of air sampling data using IHSTAT.JPG|thumb|Illustration of statistical output from IHSTAT using air sampling data]]
Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable.  These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.  These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs.  The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts.  A popular exposure data statistical tool called "IH STAT" is available from AIHA ([[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]).  IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;"Link to freeware version IHSTAT via AIHA Exposure Assessment Strategies website" https://www.aiha.org/get-involved/VolunteerGroups/Pages/Exposure-Assessment-Strategies-Committee.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

==Types==
* [[Permissible exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]
* [[Recommended exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
* [[Indicative limit value]], set by the European Union
* [[Threshold Limit Value|Threshold limit value]], set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]
* [[Occupational exposure banding]], a process that can be used when not enough data are available to determine quantiative exposure limits

== International limit values ==
The [[database]] ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: GESTIS – International limit values for chemical agents (Occupational exposure limits, OELs), http://www.dguv.de/ifa/gestis/gestis-internationale-grenzwerte-fuer-chemische-substanzen-limit-values-for-chemical-agents/index-2.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.

The present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international [[occupational safety and health]] institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the [[chemical nomenclature]] is diverging, [[synonym]]s can for example be found in the [[GESTIS Substance Database]].

The database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.

In modern usage, an '''orgy''' is a [[Group sex#Types of sex party|sex party]] where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[group sex]].

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinger]]s' parties do not always conform to this designation, because at many swinger parties the [[sexual partner]]s may all know each other or at least have some commonality among economic class, educational attainment or other shared attributes. Some swingers contend that an orgy, as opposed to a sex party, requires some anonymity of sexual partners in complete sexual abandon.&lt;ref name="differences cited in Swinger Survey Results on Difference Between Orgies and Group Sex"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swingersocial.com/the-swinger-blog/orgies-and-group-sex/ | title=Swinger Survey Results on Difference Between Orgies and Group Sex | publisher=The Swingers Blog | date=October 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2012 | author=Wojick, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other kinds of "sex party" may fare less well with this labeling.

Participation in an "orgy" is a common [[sexual fantasy]], and group sex targeting such consumers is a subgenre in [[pornographic film]]s. 

The term is also used metaphorically in expressions, such as an "orgy of colour" or an "orgy of destruction" to indicate excess, overabundance. The term "[[wikt:orgiastic|orgiastic]]" does not generally connote group sex and is closer to the [[orgia|classical roots]] and this metaphorical usage.

==Ancient ''orgia''==
{{Main article|Orgia}}

In [[ancient Greek religion]], ''[[orgia]]'' (ὄργια, sing. ὄργιον, ''orgion'') were [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic rites]] characteristic of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greek and Hellenistic mystery religions]]. Unlike public religion, or the private religious practices of a household, the mysteries were open only to initiates, and were thus "secret". Some rites were held at night. ''Orgia'' were part of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], the [[Dionysian Mysteries]], and the cult of [[Cybele]], which involved the [[Galli|castration of her priests]] in a frenzied trance. Because of their secret, nocturnal, and unscripted nature, the ''orgia'' were subject to prurient speculation and regarded with suspicion, particularly [[Religion in ancient Rome|by the Romans]], who attempted to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|suppress the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC. ''Orgia'' are popularly thought to have involved sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shipley|first=Joseph Twadell|title=Dictionary of Early English|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1955|pages=768|isbn=0-8065-2926-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, while sexuality and fertility were cultic concerns, the primary goal of the ''orgia'' was to achieve an ecstatic union with the divine.

==In films==
Orgy scenes are featured in various films, including ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=The 21 Craziest Moments in ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’: Cocaine-Fueled Orgies and More|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/17/the-21-craziest-moments-in-the-wolf-of-wall-street-cocaine-fueled-orgies-and-more.html|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the Institute is to build and maintain a stable food system, to take care of the local ecosystems, and to improve the quality of life in the rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://permacultureghana.wordpress.com/what-is-permaculture-2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edge5.com.au/permaculture-courses-fremantle/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://uk.lush.com/article/paul-yeboah-and-gpi&lt;/ref&gt;
The GPN trains students and community in sustainable ecological farming techniques.  They support projects throughout Ghana; women groups, micro-finance projects; teach growing [[moringa]]; mushroom production; alley cropping, food forests development and [[Agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fiohnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PAUL-TESTIMONY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ecovillage.org/ghana-permaculture-institute/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Permaculture]] is based on natural sustainable design systems. An agricultural system that uses practices to keep soil fertile, crops and livestock healthy. It encourages protection of the environment and an environmental lifestyle; so as to maintain environmental stability and maintain environmental resources for the future.  It rehabilitates eroded and [[deforested]] land. The Permaculture Network encourages the practice of permaculture at home. The Permaculture Network's mission is to encourage, educate, and promote the use of permaculture by farmers and people in Ghana, which will contribute to the environmental soundness, and stability of the country's future.

They host international volunteers, interns, and students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/economy/artikel.php?ID=123567&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghana Permaculture Network and Institute is a member of the Ghana [[Ecovillage]] Network. Which is an organization of sustainable development leaders and projects. Paul Yeboah is Vice President of the GEN which works towards promoting Indigenous Initiatives and Sustainability in Ghana. Permaculture is transforming communities in Ghana through education, food production, outreach, skills development, self-sufficiency, and creating small business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;http://gen.ecovillage.org/en/gen-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.permaculture.co.uk/how-permaculture-is-transforming-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;



==Background==
At the age of 22 Paul Yeboah was concerned with rural and urban poverty. He received an Agricultural Certificate from the Farm Institute in Ghana. He initiated a rural and urban fruit forest project by using seed supplies from the Kade Oil Palm Research Institute and Bonsu Cocoa Research Station. The seeds and seedlings were given to the farmers on a credit basis. This project was instrumental in the creation of rural processing businesses and employment for the poor.

In 2003 Paul Yeboah was the farm manager for the Abbott of Kristo Buase Benedictine Monastery in Ghana. [[Greg Knibbs]] was invited to come to the Monastery to assist in the redesigning of the farm using Permaculture practices to restore the soil to fertility. The soil was depleted from the use of synthetic chemical pollution. Yeboah met Greg Knibbs and they worked together to form the Ghana Permaculture Network which later became the Ghana Permaculture Institute.

==Career==
The Ghana Permaculture Network was coordinated by Paul Yeboah in 2003. The GPN started out as a small farm demonstration training site that later grew into the Ghana Permaculture Institute (GPI).
In 2007 the Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery was created. It was created to build community income, and to deal with environmental issues such as [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. It also does [[reforestation]]. The work is collaborative community effort involving women, youth, and men. All members of the community are a part of the profits and benefits of working towards enhancing their environment. The project builds environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;http://permaculturenews.org/2011/11/01/the-ghana-permaculture-nwodua-tree-nursery-project-saving-lives-granting-livelihoods-and-restoring-eco-systems/&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Yeboah is the Vice Chairman of the Ghana Ecovillage Network which was founded in 2012, and incorporated in 2013. It was formed by community leaders and groups with sustainable projects to promote Ecovillage strategies as models for sustainable development in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;http://gen.ecovillage.org/en/gen-ghana&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana Permaculture Network started out supporting local schools, community farmers in establishing tree nurseries, and tree planting projects.  The Ghana Permaculture Network has now expanded in various parts of Ghana,  into Togo, and Burkina Faso in West Africa.

==Permaculture Institute Projects (Educational Programs)==
The goal of the educational initiatives and projects is to promote lifelong learning with emphases on vocational training, and the need of viable skill development using practices of sustainable development.
* Permaculture Design Courses are taught in Ghana, Togo and Burkina Faso, West Africa.
* Ghana Permaculture Nwodua Tree Nursery Project -  Ghana is a deforested country. The Tree Nursery Project addresses issues of deforestation in order to reverse erosion. It teaches and advocates the importance of trees and climate change issues.
* Oyster mushroom production -  Using sawdust in bags the Permaculture Institute teaches how to grow mushrooms. This project allows participants to learn how to make a waste product sawdust useful. Which promotes healthy diet, nutrition and skill development. 
* Demonstration Training sites for how-to build Permaculture home gardens
* Moringa Production - Which helps to facilitate the development of small-businesses to generate income. A project that promotes healthy nutrition and skills development.
* [[Ecovillage]] Design Course - Which teaches and acquaints students with tools that can be utilized to redevelop their communities in ecological economically, culturally and socially ways to foster sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27126">'''Peace psychology''' is a subfield of [[psychology]] and [[peace research]] that deals with the psychological aspects of [[peace]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], [[violence]], and [[war]]. Peace psychology can be characterized by four interconnected pillars: (1) research, (2) education, (3) practice, and (4) advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.peacepsych.org/peace-resources.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first pillar, research, is documented most extensively in this article.

Peace psychological activities are based on psychological models (theories) and methods; they are usually normatively bound in their means and objectives by working towards the ideal of sustainable peace using (as far as possible) non-violent means. Violence and peace are usually defined in terms of [[Johan Galtung|Johan Galtung's]] extended conceptualization of peace,&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1969). Violence, peace, and peace research. ''Journal of Peace Research, 6'' (3), 167-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J. (1990). Cultural violence. ''Journal of Peace Research, 27'' (3), 291-305.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which peace is not merely the absence of personal (direct) violence and war (= negative peace), but also the absence of structural (indirect) and cultural violence (= [[positive peace]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christie, D. J., Wagner, R. V., &amp; Winter, D. D. (2001). Introduction to peace psychology. In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, &amp; D. D. Winter (Eds.), ''Peace, conflict, and violence: Peace psychology for the 21st century'' (pp. 1-13). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of peace can also be conceptualized as the comprehensive implementation of [[human rights]] (civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights); this should, among other purposes, ensure the satisfaction of basic human needs, such as positive personal and social identity, sense of control, security, (social) justice, well-being, a safe environment, and access to adequate food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Tropp, L. R. (2012). Understanding and responding to intergroup conflict: Toward an integrated analysis. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 3-10). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that focus on peace psychology include, for example, in the United States the Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict, and Violence (Peace Psychology Division [Division 48] of the [[American Psychological Association]]) and Psychologists for Social Responsibility, a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.psysr.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has the Forum Friedenspsychologie,&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.friedenspsychologie.de/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Psychological Society has an Interest Group called Psychologists for Peace. On the international level, there is the Committee for the Psychological Study of Peace as well as the International Network of Psychologists for Social Responsibility, which links organizations from (among other countries) Germany, Finland, the United States, Australia, Costa Rica, India, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.inspsysr.org/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research ==

Peace psychological research can be analytically (research ''on'' peace) or normatively (research ''for'' peace) oriented. Regardless of its analytical or normative orientation, peace psychological research mainly deals with the ''psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts'' (including war), the ''psychosocial conditions conducive or detrimental to a sustainable peace'', and the ''psychosocial effects of war and violence''. In each case, different levels of analysis and explanation are relevant: from the level of individuals to groups, social organizations and institutions, states and state systems (e.g., the [[European Union]]), military alliances (e.g., [[NATO]]), and collective security systems (e.g., the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] [OSCE]).

=== Formation and escalation of conflict ===

Peace psychology focuses on the psychological aspects of the formation, escalation, reduction, and resolution of conflicts. A [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] exists when the expectations, interests, needs, or actions of at least two parties to the conflict are perceived by at least one of the parties to be incompatible. Peace psychology is mainly concerned with conflicts between social groups (intergroup conflicts, such as between ethnic groups, clans, religious groups, states etc.), in terms of domains like power, wealth, access to raw materials and markets, cultural or religious values, honor, dignity, or recognition. In conflicts one has to distinguish between (overt) positions (e.g., " we don't negotiate with X") and underlying interests (e.g., power, spheres of influence and wealth) as well as between current triggers (e.g., violence at a political protest) and systematic, enduring, structural causes (e.g., deprivation of a group's political participation or access to professional employment). Although conflicts are inevitable and can lead to positive change when dealt with constructively,&lt;ref&gt;Kriesberg, L. (2007). ''Constructive conflicts: From escalation to resolution'' (3rd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; the escalation of conflicts and in particular the occurrence of violence are preventable. Psychological processes of information processing (attention, perception, memory, thinking, judgment), emotion, and motivation influence substantially how a conflict is handled, and in particular whether conflicts escalate to violent episodes. An important factor is the different points of view of the conflict parties, such as when behavior that is based on positive intentions is perceived by the opponent as aggressive and therefore contributes to escalation. Conflicts can easily escalate. A cycle of violence can arise in which both parties are involved, and original victims can become perpetrators, without realizing it ("victim myth").&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Tal, D. &amp; Hammack, P. L. (2012). Conflict, delegitimization, and violence. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 29-52). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflicts can be intensified specifically through the construction of [[Enemy Image|enemy images]], [[psychological warfare]], and [[propaganda]] promulgated by the media, political elite, educational systems, socialization, cultural symbols and other means. [[Enemy Image|Enemy images]] may have a kernel of truth, but overstate the negative sides of the opponent. The core features of a strong enemy image include: (1) a negative evaluation of the opponent (e.g., aggressive, immoral, but also inferior), (2) a one-sided blame for negative events, and (3) a different evaluation of similar actions of one's own side than the enemy ("double standard"; e.g., build-up of arms on one’s own side is self-defense, on the enemy's it is aggression). These constructions can cause [[dehumanization]] of the opponent, so that moral standards no longer apply.  In extreme cases, it may seem acceptable, even desirable, for the opponent to suffer and be killed. The construction of the enemy image has the central function of justifying armament, violence, and war. In addition, it enhances the individual and collective self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologists for Social Responsibility (2004). Enemy images: A resource material for reducing enmity. Washington, DC: Psychologists for Social Responsibility. http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/Enemyimagesmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological warfare]] includes methods of generating or strengthening war support among the civilian population and the military. These methods include disinformation using the media (war propaganda), but also sabotage, displacement, murder, and terror. War propaganda consists of two complementary strategies: (1) repeating, highlighting, and embellishing with detail information that functions to intensify the enemy image or threat perceptions, and (2) ignoring and devaluing information that may lead to de-escalation. In addition, negative behavior of the adversary may be provoked (e.g., by maneuvers at the state borders) or charges that the enemy engaged in heinous acts may be entirely invented (e.g., the [[Nayirah (testimony)|Nayirah testimony]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, S. (2004). Propaganda und Kriegsberichterstattung. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 317-329). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict reduction and resolution (peace psychological strategies) ===

Different peace psychological strategies for non-violent conflict resolution are discussed (conflict de-escalation, [[conflict resolution]], [[conflict transformation]]). One can distinguish between strategies on the ''official level'' (e.g., measures of tension reduction and trust build such as Charles E. Osgood's "Graduated and Reciprocated Initiatives in Tension Reduction" [GRIT], [[negotiations]], [[mediation]]), approaches of ''unofficial diplomacy'' (interactive problem-solving workshops), and strategies at the level of peace and conflict ''civil society'' (e.g., [[peace journalism]], contact between social groups).

==== Official level ====

Osgood's GRIT model was designed as a counter-concept to the [[arms race]] in the East-West conflict, in which the former superpowers, USA and USSR, constantly increased the quantity and quality of their arms so that the destruction of humankind by a [[nuclear war]] seemed increasingly possible. The GRIT model, in contrast, aimed to de-escalate and create an atmosphere of mutual trust. One party publicly announces and performs a verifiable, concrete step to reduce tension, and asks or invites the other side to do something similar (developing a spiral of trust). Care is taken so that each step does not endanger the safety of one's own side. GRIT was designed to reverse the tension involved in the nuclear arms race by having each side engage in graduated and reciprocal inititiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, C. E. (1962). ''An alternative to war or surrender.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no firm evidence, it has been suggested that U.S. President Kennedy and the Soviet leader Khrushchev based their negotiations after the [[Cuban missile crisis]] on this concept.&lt;ref&gt;Tzeng, O., Landis, D., &amp; Tzeng, D. Y. (2012). Charles E. Osgood's continuing contributions to intercultural communication and far beyond!. ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 36'', 832-842.&lt;/ref&gt;

When conflicted parties are engaged in long-lasting, severe conflicts, it can be difficult to have constructive bilateral negotiations. In this case, a third party (e.g., a social scientist or reputed politician) can serve as a mediator in order to facilitate conflict management. Mediators must be well aware of the conflict and its history, should have the confidence of both conflict parties, and need to be familiar with conflict analysis and communication strategies. Important strategies include establishing trust, working out the essential elements of conflict, and possibly dividing the problem so that at least partial solutions can be achieved and violence can be prevented or stopped. Problems arise when mediators are biased and have strong individual interests. Mediation success is more likely if the conflict is moderately intense, the power difference between the parties is low, and the mediators have high prestige (as a person or because of organizational affiliation).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, S. (2012). Mediation. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unofficial level ====

In severe, long-lasting conflicts, it may be advisable to intervene at a level below official [[diplomacy]]. Interactive problem solving is such an informal approach to bring members of the conflict parties together.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (2002). Interactive problem solving: Informal mediation by the scholar-practitioner. In J. Bercovitch (Ed.), ''Studies in international mediation: Essays in honor of Jeffrey Z. Rubin'' (pp. 167-193). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/node/831&lt;/ref&gt; These can include citizens who are well-respected from different areas of society, such as media, business, politics, education, or religion. A team of social scientists (e.g., psychologists) initiate and promote a problem-solving process with the elements of conflict diagnosis, generation of alternatives, and development of nonviolent solutions that results in outcomes that are satisfactory to all parties involved. There is the expectation or hope that the participants influence their governments and public opinion so that official negotiations can follow. Psychologically important components of the process are that the respective self and enemy images are corrected. Interactive problem solving was used in particular in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] by the U.S. psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] and his team.&lt;ref&gt;d' Estrée, T. P. (2012). Addressing intractable conflict through interactive problem-solving. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 229-251). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil society level ====

Media are often involved in the formation of enemy images and escalation of conflict. [[Peace journalism]], in contrast, has the objective of investigating and using the influence of the media as a means of encouraging the constructive, non-violent resolution of conflict. Key strategies include representing the conflicting parties as well as the conflict and its history appropriately, identifying propaganda, and articulating the suffering of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Kempf, W. (2012). Peace journalism. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[collective action]] and peaceful demonstrations of the population toward peaceful and socially just ends can have an influence on the decisions of those in power – particularly in democracies. Citizens' commitment depends, among other factors, on the existence of opportunities in society, individual value orientations (e.g., valuing non-violence, social justice), the presence of role models, and the perceived probability of success of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke, K., &amp; Shani, M. (2012). Activism, antiwar. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopidia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between opposing groups (e.g., on the level of municipalities, associations, universities, trade unions) can contribute to building positive relationships and the reduction of prejudice (see [[contact hypothesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The nature of prejudice.'' Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F., &amp; Tropp, L. R. (2011). ''When groups meet: The dynamics of intergroup contact.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, U., &amp; Hewstone, M. (2012). Intergroup contact. In L. R. Tropp (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of intergroup conflict'' (pp. 193-209). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions associated with the improvement of intergroup relations when groups come in contact with one another include: The actors involved have similar social status; there are common goals that can be achieved through cooperation; and the contacts are supported by authorities in society.

In [[asymmetric conflicts]], where one conflict party is politically, economically, and/or militarily clearly superior, the stronger party may not be interested in a truly sustainable conflict resolution. Under asymmetric conditions, when the root causes of the conflict cannot be sufficiently addressed, structural violence persists. For such situations, approaches have been developed such as [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[liberation psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., &amp; Sonn, C. C. (Eds.) (2009). ''Psychology of liberation: Theory and applications.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in Latin America and is related to [[liberation theology]].

[[Nonviolent resistance]] refers to public, non-violent behavior directed against injustice; it involves publicly explicating one's own intentions, committing to communicate with the other side, and the willingness to endure negative consequences of one's own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bläsi, B. (2004). Gewaltfreier Widerstand. In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 412-424). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of nonviolent resistance range from protests (e.g., demonstrations) to non-cooperation (e.g., strikes, boycotts) to [[civil resistance]] (e.g., traffic blockades). Particularly well known are the actions, speeches, and writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]].

=== Effects of war and violence ===

Peace psychology examines war and violence between groups also with the aim of illustrating the psychological and social costs of war and violence and to document the human suffering caused. The psychological consequences include, in particular, [[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] (mainly of the civilian population, but also members of the military), cognitive and emotional damage, and the destruction of trustful social relationships. Wars often do not resolve the underlying problems; they often provoke new violence and wars. For example, in post-war societies an increased level of family and community violence can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Macnair, R. M. (2012). Traumatic stress, perpetration-induced. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, resources necessary to deal with civilian issues (e.g., education, health, social welfare) are lost. There is still little comprehensive and objective research on the consequences and costs of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kantner, E. (2007). ''Shock and awe hits home: U.S. health costs of the war in Iraq.'' Washington, DC: Physicians for Social Responsibility. http://www.psr.org/assets/pdfs/shock-and-awe.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial conditions of sustainable peace ===

Even when violence has been stopped or a [[Peace Treaty]] reached, to prevent the risk of a renewed escalation, physical and economic reconstruction as well as socio-political and psychosocial interventions are required. These interventions aim to cure psychosocial wounds of war, build trust, develop a common [[collective memory]], recognize past wrongdoing, and achieve [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]] and/or [[forgiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamber, B. (2009). ''Transforming societies after political violence: Truth, reconciliation, and mental health.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are trauma therapy and [[truth commission|Truth and Reconciliation Commissions]].

Also, irrespective of any specific conflict and violence, peace psychological research looks at the psychosocial conditions that hamper or promote sustainable peace. The basic aim is to transform cultures of violence into cultures of [[peace]].&lt;ref name="De Rivera"&gt;De Rivera, J. (2012). Culture of peace. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology.'' Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cultural characteristics are obstacles to the development of sustainable peace: the view of one's own group (ethnicity, religion, nation, etc.) to be superior and more valuable and others as inferior and of little value (or in the extreme case: no value); the development of enemy images, [[dehumanization]] of others, legitimization of violence and damage; underlying beliefs (ideologies) such as [[ethnocentrism]], [[social dominance orientation]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nationalism]], [[militarism]], and an education system that promotes these ideologies; power differentials that are defended or increased by the powerful and that create unequal conditions in areas such as wealth, health, education, and political participation ([[structural violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, A. (2004). Kultur und Krieg In G. Sommer &amp; A. Fuchs (Eds.), ''Krieg und Frieden: Handbuch der Konflikt- und Friedenspsychologie'' (pp. 383-396). Weinheim: Beltz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among factors conducive to the development of sustainable peace are: the fundamental belief that conflicts are frequent, but that they can be solved without violence and for the benefit of the various conflict parties; the concept of [[humanism]] with the features of human dignity, [[pacifism]], [[empathy]], [[respect]], tolerance and [[solidarity]], and respect for all people or for humanity as a whole; critical proximity to one's own group that – in addition to positive identification – also integrates own weaknesses, mistakes, and committed wrongdoings in the collective self-concept.&lt;ref name="De Rivera" /&gt;

In the transformation of cultures of violence into cultures of peace the focus on [[human rights]] is of high importance. Human rights are inalienable rights that apply to all human beings, without distinction as to sex, color, ethnicity, language, religion, political opinion, or social origin (prohibition of discrimination). The UN Human Rights Charter contains the essential documents of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR, 1948) and the Twin Covenants (1966, [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]). The UDHR consists of 30 articles with more than 100 individual rights, including civil and political rights (e.g., right to life, prohibition of torture, right to fair and public trial, right to asylum, freedom of speech, regular elections), but also social, economic, and cultural rights (including the right to work, rest, holidays with pay, protection from unemployment, the right to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and free primary education). Of particular importance in the UN's human rights concept is that all human rights are significant (indivisibility) and that they apply to all people (universality). Psychological research on human rights has mainly examined knowledge, attitudes, and readiness to act in support of human rights. Representative surveys in Germany show that the realization of human rights is considered to be very important, but at the same time knowledge of human rights is low and inaccurate. The results show a "halving" of human rights: Some civil rights are known, while economic and social rights are hardly considered human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Stellmacher, J., &amp; Sommer, G. (2012). Human rights and human rights violations, psychological aspects of. In D. Christie (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of peace psychology'' (Vol. 2, pp. 514-518). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Of importance in peace psychology are also analyses of whether human rights are used in the sense of peace or whether they are abused for the construction of enemy images or to prepare wars.

== in education ==

Peace psychological findings are used in the content and practice of [[peace education]] at various levels, from primary school to secondary and tertiary education (e.g., in the form of peace psychology courses at universities&lt;ref&gt;[[Citation signal|See]] http://peacepsychology.org/peace-course-syllabi/&lt;/ref&gt;) to vocational training.

The Conflict Information Consortium at the University of Colorado offers the Beyond Intractability project, an openly accessible, cooperative learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.beyondintractability.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

Peace psychology practice refers, for example, to trauma therapeutic work, the implementation of trainings in nonviolent conflict resolution, and activities in such roles as [[Mediation|conflict mediator]] or [[peace worker|civil peace worker]]. Of particular importance is the cooperation between research and practice, such as in the form of [[evaluation research]], to contribute to the continuous improvement of practice.

'''Performance-Based Building Design''' is an approach to the [[design]] of any complexity of building, from single-detached homes up to and including high-rise apartments and office buildings.  A building constructed in this way is required to meet certain measurable or predictable performance requirements, such as energy efficiency or seismic load, without a specific prescribed method by which to attain those requirements.  This is in contrast to traditional prescribed [[building codes]], which mandate specific [[construction]] practises, such as stud size and distance between studs in [[framing (construction)|wooden frame construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062800/http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an approach provides the freedom to develop tools and methods to evaluate the entire life cycle of the building process, from the business dealings, to [[procurement]], through construction and the evaluation of results.

==Background==
One of the first implementations of performance-based building design requirements was in [[Hammurabi's Code]] (c. 1795 to 1750 BC), where is stated that “a house should not collapse and kill anybody”. This concept is also described in [[Vitruvius]]’s ''“De architectura libri decem”'' (“[[The ten books of architecture|The Ten Books of Architecture]]”) in first century BC.In modern times, the first definition of performance-based building design was introduced in 1965 in France by Blachère with the Agrément system &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cstb.fr/CSTB{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the building process remained relatively conventional for the next 50 years, based solely on experience and codes, regulations prescribed by [[law]] which stifled [[innovation]]s and change.  The prescription approach is a technical procedure based on past experience which consists of comparing the proposed design with standardized codes, so no [[simulation]] or [[Verification and validation|verification]] tools are needed for the design and building process.

A new approach began to emerge during the second half of the 20th century, when many local building markets began to show that they needed greater flexibility in the procurement procedures to facilitate the exchange of building goods between countries and to improve the speed of procedures and innovations in the building process.  This innovative approach to the procurement, design, contracting, management and maintenance of buildings was '''performance-based building''' (PBBD).

Most recently the clearest definition of performance based building approach was explained in 1982 by the CIB W60 Commission in the report n.64, where Gibson stated that ''“first and foremost, the performance approach is [...]  the practice of thinking and working in terms of ends rather than means.[ …] It is concerned with what a building or building product is required to do, and not with prescribing how it is to be constructed”.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cibworld.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research establishments have studied the implementation of PBBD during the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM/CIB/RILEM 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CSTB 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Ventre 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Paciuk 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIB 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huovila 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of areas of building design remain open to innovation.

During 1998-2001, the CIB Board and Programme Committee initiated the Proactive Programme on Performance-Based Building&lt;ref&gt;Foliente et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foliente 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in order to practically implement technical developments of performance-based building. This programme was followed by the establishment of the Performance-Based Building &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pebbu.nl&lt;/ref&gt; '''(PeBBu)''', running from October 2001 to October 2005, thanks to funds from the European Commission (EC) [[Fifth Framework Programme]].

The PeBBu Network had a broad and varied programme, a set of activities and produced many papers to aid in the implementation of such vision.

==PeBBu Thematic Network==
PeBBu Thematic Network was managed by the CIB General Secretariat (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building Construction), particularly by the CIB Development Foundation (CIBdf). The PeBBu Network started working in 2001 and completed in 2005.  In the PeBBu Network 73 organisations, included CIBdf (coordinating contractor), BBRI (Belgium), VTT (Finland), CSTB (France), EGM (Netherlands), TNO (Netherlands), BRE (UK), cooperated to this project bringing people together to share their work, their information and knowledge. The objectives of the Network was to stimulate and facilitate international dissemination and implementation of Performance Based Building in building and construction sector, maximising the contribution to this by the international Research and Development community.
The PeBBu Thematic Network result is described and explained in 26 final reports which included three reports with an overall PBB scope, a multitude of research reports from the PeBBu Domains, User Platforms and Regional Platforms, a Final Management report and four practice reports for providing practical support to the actual application of PBB concept in building and [[construction]] sector.

==PBB: Conceptual framework==
A conceptual framework for implementing a PBB market was identified while reviewing various viewpoints during the compilation of the 2nd International State of the Art Report for the PeBBu Thematic Network (Becker and Foliente 2005).
The building facility is a multi-component system with a generally very long life cycle. The system’s design agenda as a whole, and the more specific design objectives of its parts, originate from relevant user requirements. These requirements evolve into a comprehensive set of Performance Requirements that should be established by a large number of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the users, entrepreneur/owner, regulatory framework, design team, and manufacturers).
The main steps in a Performance Based Building Design process are
*# identifying and formulating the relevant User Requirements,
*# transforming the User Requirements identified into Performance Requirements and quantitative performance criteria,
*# using reliable design and evaluation tools to assess whether proposed solutions meet the stated criteria at a satisfactory level.

===Performance concept===
In a Performance-based approach, the focus of all decisions, is on the required performance-in-use and on the evaluations and testing of building asset.
Performance Based Building (PBB) is focused on performance required in use for the business processes and the needs of the users, and then on the evaluations and verification of building assets result. The Performance approach can be used whether the process is about an existing or new assets. It is applicable to the procurement of constructed assets and to any phase of the whole life cycle Building Process, such as [[strategic planning]], [[asset management]], briefing/programming, design and construction, operation and maintenance, management and use, renovations and alterations, codes, regulations and standards.
It includes many topics and criteria, which can be categorized as physical, functional, environmental, financial, economical, psychological, social, facilities, and other more. These criteria are related to singular project, according to the context
and the situation.

===Two key characterisics of performance concept===
Performance concept is based on two key characteristics :
* '''the use of two languages''', one for the clients/users requirements and the other for the supply of the performance;
* '''the need for validation and verification of results''' against performance targets.

====Two languages====
The Performance concept requires two languages: the language of demand requirements and the language of the required performance which should have a capability to fulfill the demand. It is important to recognize that these languages are different.
Szigeti and Davis (Performance Based Building: Conceptual Framework, 2005) explain that  ''“the dialog between client and supplier can be described as two halves of a “hamburger bun”, with the statement of the requirement in functional or performance language (FC - functional concept) matched to a solution (SC - solution concept) in more technical language, and the matching, verification / validation that needs to occur in between”.'' 
    
In a recent paper Ang, Groosman, and Scholten (2005) explain that the functional concept represents the set of unquantified objectives and scopes to be satisfied by the supply solutions, related to performance requirements. The solution concept represents technical realization that satisfies at least the required performance. Design decision is a development of a solution concept.

====Assessing result – match and compare====
Building performance evaluation is the process of systematically comparing  and matching the performance in use of building assets with explicitly documented or implicitly criteria for their expected performance. In the PBB approach is essential matching and comparing demand and supply.  It can be done by using a [[Verification and validation|validation]] method, by measurement, calculation, or testing. Tools and methods are used to permit some form of measurement of testing of the requirements, and the relating measurement of the capability of assets to perform.

There are many types of in-depth specialized technical evaluations and audits. These validations generally require time, a major effort by the customer group, and a high level of funding. Normally, the most valuable methods and tools are comprehensive scans which are performance based and include metrics that can easily be measured without lab-type instruments.
Evaluations and reviews, are integral  part of asset and portfolio management, design, construction, commissioning.
Evaluations can be used for different purposes, depending on the requirements being considered, for example they could be used in support of funding decisions, they could include a condition assessment to ensure that the level of degradation or the obsolescence is known, they could include an assessment of the utilization or  an assessment of the capability of the product result to perform functional expected requirements. Such evaluations can be used at any time during the life cycle of the asset.
PBB evaluations should be done in a routine manner, really the evaluations are often done only as part of Commissioning or shortly thereafter, or when there is a problem.

There are two different kinds of performance verifications. Performance evaluations  rate
the physical asset according to a set of existing criteria and indicators of capability, and match the results against the required levels of performance. The Occupant Satisfaction Surveys record the perceptions of the users, usually through a scale of satisfaction measurements. Both types of evaluations complement each other.
* '''Tools'''
Innovative decision-support methodologies are taking place in building sector. There are some tools explicitly based on the demand and supply concepts and other ones which employ standardized performance metrics that for the first time link facility
condition to the functional requirements of organizations and their customers. Projects can be planned, prioritize, and budgeted using a multi-criteria approach, that is transparent, comprehensive and auditable.
One of the methodologies that can be used is a '''gap analysis''' based on calibrated scales that measure both the levels of requirements and the capability of the asset that is either already used, or being designed, or offer to be bought, or leased. Such methodology is an ASTM and American National (ANSI) standard and is currently being considered as an ISO standard.
It is particularly useful when the information about the “gap”, if any, can be presented in support of funding decisions and actions.

There are a large number of  verification methodologies, (e.g. POEs, CRE-FM), and all of these need to refer back to explicit statements of requirements to be able to compare with expected performance.
To evaluate the result of a building asset against the expected performance requirements it is necessary to fix some tools used during the process.  These tools are the reference of whole life cycle building process, so organizations use '''‘key performance indicators (KPI)’'''  to prove that they are meeting the targets that have been set by senior management. At the same time performance measurement (PM) becomes central to managing organizations, their operations and logistic support.
These methodologies include the feedback loop that links a facility in use to the requirements and capabilities that are compared and matched whenever decisions are needed.

===Performance approach and prescriptive approach===
A prescriptive approach describes the way a building asset must be constructed, rather than the end result of the building process, and is related to the type and quality of materials used, the method of construction, and the workmanship, etc.
This type of approach is strictly mandated by a combination of law, codes, standards, and regulations, etc., and is based on past experience and consolidated know-how. The content of prescriptive codes and standards is usually a consequence of an accident causing injury or death which requires a remedy to avoid a repeat, as a consequence of some hazardous situation, or as a consequence of some recognized social need. In many countries, in both the public and private sector, research is taking place into a different set of codes, methods and tools based on performance criteria to complement the traditional prescriptive codes.
In the 1970s, this search produced the '''“Nordic Model”''' (NKB 1978), which constituted the reference model of  next performance-based codes. This model links easily to one of the key characteristics of the Performance approach, the dialog between the WHY, the WHAT and the HOW.

Using a Performance Based approach does not preclude the use of prescriptive specifications. Although the benefits of the adopting of a PBBD approach are significant, it is recognized that employing a performance-based approach at any stage in the building process is more complex and expensive than using the simpler prescriptive route. So, the application of this approach should not be regarded as an end in itself. When simple building are concerned or well proven technologies are used, the use of prescriptive codes results more effective, efficient, faster, or less costly, so prescriptive specifications will continue to be useful in many situations.

At the same time for the complex projects use of the performance based route at every stage is indispensable, in particular during design and evaluation phases.

It is not likely that a facility will be planned, procured, delivered, maintained, used and renovated using solely Performance Based documents at each step of the way, down the supply chain, to the procurement of products and materials, because there is not yet enough experience with the Performance Based Building approach. At the same time the prescriptive approach can bring to stifle changes and innovations, so best way to set building process is blending both different approaches.

==Statements of Requirements (SoR)==
The Statements of Requirements represents a reference for the whole life cycle management of facilities, they are the core of the conceptual framework came up from the PeBBu Thematic Network. They constitute the key to implementation of the PBB in the construction sector.

The SoRs is a document prepared by clients, or in the verbal statements communicated to supplies, it is based on the user functional needs. These user requirements are converted into performance requirements, which can be explicit or implicit. Such document should include information about what is essential to the client. SoRs will take different forms depending on the kind of client and what is being procured, at what phase of the Life Cycle or where in the supply chain a document is being used.
The SoRs should be, dynamic, not static, and should include more and more details as projects proceed. This document should be prepared at different levels of granularity, how detailed the documentation is at each stage depends on the complexity of the project and on the procurement route chosen for the project.

The SoRs represent a very important part of a continuous process of communication between clients (demand) and their project team (supply), they will be updated and managed using computerized tools and will contain all requirements throughout the life of the facility. This process is called “briefing” in UK and Commonwealth English, and “programming” in American English. An SoR is normally prepared for any project, whether it is a PBB project or not. Assembling such a document usually leads to a more appropriate match between the needs of clients and users and the constructed assets.
Statements of Requirements have to be very carefully stated so that it is easy to verify that a proposed solution can meet those requirements.

High level statement of requirements need to be paired with indicators of capability so design solutions can be evaluated before they are built in order to avoid mistakes. In the SoRs it is important to take into account some design aspect like flexibility indicators because constructed assets need for change during their life cycle, uses and activities can change very rapidly, so it is essential to test different solutions way that the spaces might be used according to anticipate changes.
SoRs, as understood in ISO 9000, include not only what the client requires and is prepared to pay for, but also the process and indicators that will provide the means to verify, and validate, that the product or service delivered meets those stated requirements.

As part of the worldwide movement to implement a PBB approach and to develop tools that will make it easier to shift to PBB, the [http://www.iai-tech.org International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI)] set up projects to map the processes that are part of Whole Life Cycle Management as ''Portfolio and Asset Management: Performance (PAMPeR) and Early Design” (ED).''
The IAI efforts are complemented by many other efforts to create standards for the information to be captured and analyzed to verify performance-in-use.

==Performance requirements (PR)==
Performance requirements translate user requirements in more precise quantitative measurable and technical terms, usually for a specific purpose.

Supply team prepares a document that includes, objectives and goals, performance requirements and criteria. It is important to include “indicators of performance” in the way that it can be measured the results against explicit requirements, whether qualitative or quantitative. Performance indicators need to be easily understood by the users and the evaluators. To validate the indicators and verify that required performance-in-use has been achieved it is necessary using appropriate methods and tools.
Levels of performance requirements can be stated as part of the preparation of SoRs, as part of project programs, or as part of requests for proposals and procurement contracts.
It is preferable adopting a flexible approach to the expression and comparison of performance levels, so required and achieved performance can be expressed not as single values but as bands between upper and lower limits. In consequence, in performance terms the criteria can be expressed as graduated scales, divided into broad bands.

==Performance based codes==
In the building and construction industry, until 25–30 years old, prescriptive codes, regulations and standards  made innovation and change difficult and costly to implement, and created technical restrictions to trade. These concerns have been the major drivers towards the use of a Performance Based approach to codes, regulations and standards. Performance-based building regulations have been implemented or are being developed in many countries but they have not yet reached their full potential. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that the overall regulatory system has not yet been fully addressed, and gaps exist in several key areas.
Bringing the regulatory and non-regulatory models together is probably the best way to work. This is shown in the '''“Total Performance System Models”''' diagram (Meacham, et al. 2002), that maps the flow of decision making from society and business objectives to construction solutions.

The difference between the regulatory and non-regulatory parts of the Total Performance System Models is that the first one is mandated by codes and regulations based on the law, while those other functional requirements, included in Statements of Requirements, are an integral part of what the client requires and is willing to pay for.
* '''Consequences relating to procedure'''
For procurements in the public sector and for publicly traded corporations, it’s important that the decisions and choices are transparent and explicit, regardless of the specific procurement route. All procurement processes can be either Prescriptive or Performance Based. Design-Build, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), [[private finance initiative]] (PFI) and similar procurement procedures are particularly suited to the use of a strong Performance Based Building application. If the expected performance are not stated explicitly and verifiably then these procurement methods will likely be more subject to disappointments and legal problems.
To get the benefits from these procurement approaches, it is essential to organize the services of the supply chain in order to get innovative, less costly, or better solutions by shifting decisions about “how” to the integrated team.

==Future scenarios==
Although the effort of a large number of research establishments in order to implement and diffuse the PBBD approach, it is difficult to innovate the practice of working and thinking in building sector. The positive trend is that more and more interest in this approach is happening around the world. Many countries tried to reform the way that building and construction is regulated and managed.

The core of implementation of PBB approach is that the clients, the users really know and understand why and what they require and that they can state easily and clearly their SoRs document. It is also important that the client is active, involved, informed and able to understand and choose best way for its interest, whether he’s a private or a public client, a big or a little structure, whether the  asset is for its own use or for use by others.

Procurement will be the key to improve performance approach when clients learn to be more explicit in their demands and to participate more aggressively in the management and delivery process of their most significant investment and resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6891">'''Education in the performing arts''' is a key part of many [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] [[curriculum|curricula]] and is also available as a specialisation at the [[tertiary education|tertiary]] level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The [[performing arts]], which include, but are not limited to [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]], are key elements of [[culture]] and engage participants at a number of levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The end point for performing arts education varies: some educators integrate arts into school classrooms to support other curricula while simultaneously building students' art skills, and some focus on performing arts as an academic discipline in itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Performing arts integration==
'''Performing arts integration in schools'''

Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Integration-Teaching-Multicultural-Settings/dp/0132565560|title=Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter through the Arts in Multicultural Settings|last=Goldberg|first=Merryl|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780132565561|edition=4|location=Boston|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for [[motor skill]]s and [[Psychosocial|psychosocial skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/18985575/childrens-developmental-benchmarks-and-stages|title=Children's Developmental Benchmarks and Stages|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student [[Self-expression values|self-expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/vp/cf/|title=Curriculum Frameworks - Visual &amp; Performing Arts (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of [[arts integration]] because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Emergent-Bilingual-Youth-Culturally/dp/0415509742|title=The Arts and Emergent Bilingual Youth: Building Culturally Responsive, Critical and Creative Education in School and Community Contexts|last=Chappell|first=Sharon Verner|last2=Faltis|first2=Christian J.|date=2013-04-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415509749|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts-based life situations, including [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Teaching-Integrating-Understanding-Curriculum/dp/0807750808|title=Artful Teaching: Integrating the Arts for Understanding Across the Curriculum, K-8|last=Donahue|first=David M.|date=2010-06-02|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807750803|editor-last=Stuart|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York; Reston, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performing arts integration out of schools'''

Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorliewski|first=Julie|last2=Porfilio|first2=Brad|year=2012|title=Revolutionizing Environmental Education through Indigenous Hip Hop Culture|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=17|pages=46–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issues of access and equity'''

Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Discipline-based performing arts==

The performing arts differ from the [[plastic arts]] insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] by special [[clothing]], [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc.

For students pursuing elite [[profession]]al [[career]]s in performing arts like [[classical ballet]] and [[circus]] arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The breadth of areas covered by the performing arts is wide, including:
*[[Acting]]
**[[Comedy]]
**[[Drama]]
**[[Magic (illusion)|Magic]]
**[[Film]]
**[[Opera]]
**[[Theatre]]
*[[Music]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4577">The '''Petkau effect''' is an early counterexample to linear-effect assumptions usually made about [[radiation]] exposure. It was found by Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Abram Petkau]] at the [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] [[Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment]], [[Manitoba]] and published in Health Physics March 1972.&lt;ref name=Petkau&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 22

| title = Effect of 22Na+ on a phospholipid membrane
| journal = Health Physics
| year = 1972
| doi=10.1097/00004032-197203000-00004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Petkau effect was coined by Swiss nuclear hazards commentator Ralph Graeub in 1985 in this book ''Der Petkau-Effekt und unsere strahlende Zukunft'' (The Petkau effect and our Radiating Future).&lt;ref name=Graeub&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Zytglogge

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petkau had been measuring, in the usual way, the radiation dose that would rupture a simulated artificial [[cell membrane]]. He found that 3500&amp;nbsp;[[rad (unit)|rad]]s delivered in {{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;hours (26&amp;nbsp;rad/min  =  15.5&amp;nbsp;Sv/h) would do it.&lt;ref name=Petkau2&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 49
| issue = 8
| pages = 1187
| last = Petkau
| first = A.
| title = Radiation Effect with a Model Lipid Membrane
| journal = Canadian Journal of Chemistry
| year = 1971
| doi=10.1139/v71-196
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, almost by chance, Petkau repeated the experiment with much weaker radiation and found that 0.7&amp;nbsp;rad delivered in {{frac|11|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;hours (1&amp;nbsp;millirad/min = 0.61&amp;nbsp;mSv/h) also ruptured the membrane. This was counter to the prevailing assumption of a linear relationship between total dose or dose rate and the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Djurovic, Branka, MD, PhD, "Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation", Slide 15, [[Military Medical Academy (Serbia)|Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The radiation was of ionizing nature, and produced negative [[oxygen]] [[ion]]s (free radicals). Those ions were more damaging to the simulated membrane in lower [[concentration]]s than higher (a somewhat counter-intuitive result in itself) because in the latter, they more readily recombine with each other instead of interfering with the membrane. The ion concentration directly correlated with the radiation dose rate and the composition had [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] consequences.

==Radio-protective effects of superoxide dismutase==

Petkau conducted further experiments with simulated cells in 1976 and found that the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] protected the cells from free radicals generated by ionizing radiation, obviating the effects seen in his earlier experiment.&lt;ref name=Petkau4&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petkau also discovered that superoxide dismutase was elevated in the [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells) in a sub-population of nuclear workers occupationally exposed to elevated radiation (''ca''. 10 mSv in 6 months), further supporting the hypothesis that superoxide dismutase is a radioprotective agent.&lt;ref name=Petkau3&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Petkau's original 1972 experiment apparently revealed the potential effects of ionizing radiation on cells without natural radioprotective mechanisms in place.

'''Plant genetic resources''' are plant genetic materials of actual or potential value.&lt;ref name ="CBD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/|title=CBD Home|website=Cbd.int|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Treaty"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/en/] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the variability within plants that comes from human and natural selection over millennia. Their intrinsic value mainly concerns agricultural crops.

According to the 1983 revised International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), plant genetic resources are defined as ''the entire generative and vegetative reproductive material of species with economical and/or social value, especially for the agriculture of the present and the future, with special emphasis on nutritional plants''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jarts.info/index.php/jarts/article/viewFile/72/65] {{dead link|date=June 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (1998) the FAO defined Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) as ''the diversity of genetic material contained in traditional varieties and modern cultivars as well as [[crop wild relatives]] and other wild plant species that can be used now or in the future for food and agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/sow/en/|title=Plant Production and Protection Division: State of the World's Plant Genetic Resources|website=Fao.org|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first use of plant genetic resources dates to more than 10,000 years ago, when farmers selected from the [[genetic variation]] they found in wild plants to develop their crops. As human populations moved to different climates and ecosystems, taking the crops with them, the crops adapted to the new environments, developing, for example, genetic traits providing tolerance to conditions such as drought, water logging, frost and extreme heat. These traits - and the plasticity inherent in having wide genetic variability - are important properties of plant genetic resources.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In recent centuries, although humans had been prolific in collecting exotic flora from all corners of the globe to fill their gardens, it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the widespread and organized collection of plant genetic resources for agricultural use began in earnest. Russian geneticist [[Nikolai Vavilov]], considered by some as the father of plant genetic resources, realized the value of genetic variability for breeding and collected thousands of seeds during his extensive travels to establish one of the first [[gene banks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-9525(87)90181-8|title=Plant genetic resources: An introduction to their conservation and use|first=A.H.D.|last=Brown|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=3|pages=82|accessdate=5 June 2018|doi=10.1016/0168-9525(87)90181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vavilov inspired the American [[Jack Harlan]] to collect seeds from across the globe for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA).&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Peter. 2010. Seeds, sex and civilization: how the hidden life of plants has shaped our world. Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Fairchild]], another botanist at USDA, successfully introduced many important crops (e.g. cherries, soybeans, pistachios) into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Beryl and Epstein, Samuel. Plant Explorer. New York: Julian Messner, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn’t until 1967 that the term ''genetic resources'' was coined by [[Otto Frankel]] and [[Erna Bennett]] at the historic International Conference on Crop Plant Exploration and Conservation, organized by the FAO and the [[International Biological Program]] (IBP)&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, O.H., and Bennett, E, (Eds.) 1970. Genetic Resources in Plants -- Their Exploration and Conservation, International Biological Programme, Handbook II. Blackwell, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, G., 2007.

A modest proposal for teosinte evolution and conservation in situ: the Balsas, Guerrero, Mexico. Maydica, 52(1), 49-58.&lt;/ref&gt; “The effective utilization of genetic resources requires that they are adequately classified and evaluated” was a key message from the conference.&lt;ref name="Pistorius"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pistorius, R.|date=1997|title=Scientists, plants and politics.

==Conservation==
[[File:D00315.jpg|thumb|Maize seeds in long-term storage at CIMMYT genebank. Photo credit: Anita Sanchez/CIMMYT]]

Plant genetic resource conservation has become increasingly important as more plants have become threatened or rare. At the same time, an exploding world population and rapid climate change have led humans to seek new resilient and nutritious crops. Plant conservation strategies generally combine elements of conservation on farm (as part of the crop production cycle, where it continues to evolve and support farmer needs), ''ex situ'' (for example in gene banks or field collections as seed or tissue samples) or ''in situ'' (where they grow in the wild or protected areas). Most ''in situ'' conservation concerns [[crop wild relatives]], an important source of genetic variation to crop breeding programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thayer |first1=Alan |title=A new look at conservation as a means of maintaining wild type genetic variation among economically important crop species |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Research |date=2005 |volume=20 |issue=16 |pages=117-132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant genetic resources that are conserved by any of these methods are often referred to as [[germplasm]], which is a shorthand term meaning "any genetic materials". The term originates from [[germ plasm]], [[August Weismann]]'s theory that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells, and which has been superseded by modern insights on inheritance, including [[epigenetics]] and non-nuclear [[DNA]].

After the [[Second World War]], efforts to conserve plant genetic resources came mainly from breeders’ organizations in the USA and Europe, which led to crop-specific collections primarily located in developed countries (e.g. [[IRRI]], [[CIMMYT]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, more focus was put on the collection and conservation of plant genetic resources in face of genetic erosion by organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[European Society of Breeding Research]] (EUCARPIA).&lt;ref name="Pistorius"/&gt;

A key event in the conservation of plant genetic resources was the establishment of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) (now [[Bioversity International]]) in 1974, whose mandate was ''to promote and assist in the worldwide effort to collect and conserve the plant germplasm needed for future research and production''. IBPGR mobilized scientists to create a global network of gene banks, thus marking the international recognition of the importance of plant genetic resources.&lt;ref name="Pistorius"/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Global Crop Diversity Trust]] was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the [[CGIAR]] and the FAO through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund. The goal of the Trust is to provide a secure and sustainable source of funding for the world's most important crop collections.

==Policy==

In response to the growing awareness of the global value of and threat to biological diversity, the United Nations drafted the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD),&lt;ref name="CBD"/&gt; the first global multilateral treaty focused on the conservation and sustainable use of [[biodiversity]]. Article 15 of the CBD specified that countries have national sovereignty over their genetic resources, but that there should be facilitated access and benefit sharing [[Access and Benefit Sharing Agreement|(ABS)]] under mutually agreed terms and with prior informed consent.

Going further to protect national sovereignty of plant genetic resources, an instrumental piece of legislation, The [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (ITPGRFA), was adopted by the FAO in November 2001 and came into force in 2004.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;

The ITPGRFA established several mechanisms under the Multilateral System, which grants free access and equitable use of 64 of the world’s most important crops ([http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/agphome/documents/PGR/PubPGR/ResourceBook/annex1.pdf Annex 1 crops]) for some uses (research, breeding and training for food and agriculture). The treaty prevents the recipients of genetic resources from claiming intellectual property rights over those resources in the form in which they received them, and ensures that access to genetic resources is consistent with international and national laws. This is facilitated by the [[Material Transfer Agreement|Standard Material Transfer Agreement]], a mandatory contract between providers and recipients for the exchange of germplasm under the Multilateral System. The Governing Body of the treaty, through FAO as the Third Party Beneficiary, has an interest in the agreements.&lt;ref name="Treaty"/&gt;

The [[Nagoya Protocol]] on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity that was adopted in 2010 and enforced in 2014. It provides greater legal transparency to policies governing fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/abs/|title=The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing|website=Cbd.int|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and controversies==
Due to the high value and complexity of plant genetic resources and the number of parties involved globally, some issues have arisen over their conservation and use.

Much of the material for breeding programs was collected from the Southern hemisphere and sent to gene banks in the Northern hemisphere, a concern that led to more emphasis on the national sovereignty of plant genetic resources and instigated policies that addressed the imbalance.&lt;ref name="Zemp"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.031|title=‘Genetic resources’, an analysis of a multifaceted concept|first=Anna|last=Deplazes-Zemp|date=1 June 2018|publisher=|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=222|pages=86–94|accessdate=5 June 2018|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased use of &lt;u&gt;plant genetic information&lt;/u&gt; for research, for example to find genes of interest for drought tolerance, has led to controversy on whether and to what extent the genetic data (separate from the organism) are subject to the international ABS regulations described above.&lt;ref name="Zemp"/&gt;

'''Pound's Artists: Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts in London, Paris and Italy''' was an exhibition held in 1985 to mark the centenary of [[Ezra Pound]]'s birth.

==History==
The exhibition was originally conceived by [[Clive Wilmer]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davie, 'Ezra Pound and the perfect lady', ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 7 No. 16 · 19 September 1985 http://www.lrb.co.uk/v07/n16/donald-davie/pound-and-the-perfect-lady&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown at [[Kettle's Yard]] from 14 June to 4 August 1985 to coincide with the 1985 [[Cambridge Poetry Festival]], and at the [[Tate Gallery]] from 11 September to 10 November 1985.

The exhibition team at the Tate was headed by Richard Humphreys, and at Kettle's Yard by Hilary Gresty and [[Andrew Nairne]].

==Contents==
A volume of essays by [[Richard Humphreys (writer)|Richard Humphreys]], John Alexander and [[Peter Robinson (poet)|Peter Robinson]], and edited by Richard Humphreys, was published by the Tate Gallery to accompany the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Humphreys (editor), ''Pound's Artists: Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts in London, Paris and Italy'', London (Tate Gallery), June 1985, {{ISBN|0-946590-29-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tate Gallery Symposium==
To accompany the exhibition, on 19 October 1985, the Tate Gallery held an ''Ezra Pound Symposium'' to examine the connections between Ezra Pound and the visual arts. The speakers were Ian Bell, Judy Collins, Paul Edwards, Patricia Hutchins, Lionel Kelly, Anthony Ozturk, Alan Robinson, Mike Weaver, Clive Wilmer and Harriet Zinnes.

'''Secotioid''' fungi are an intermediate growth form between mushroom-like [[hymenomycete]]s and closed bag-shaped [[gasteroid fungi|gasteromycetes]], where an evolutionary process of '''gasteromycetation''' has started but not run to completion.  Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical [[geotropism|geotropic]] orientation of the [[hymenophore]] needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the [[basidiospores]] are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'')—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost [[ballistospory]].&lt;ref name="Hibbett_1994"/&gt;

==Explanation of secotioid development and gasteromycetation==

Historically [[agarics]] and [[boletes]] (which bear their spores on a [[hymenium]] of gills or tubes respectively) were classified quite separately from the [[gasteroid fungi]], such as [[puff-balls]] and [[truffles]], of which the spores are formed in a large mass enclosed in an outer skin.  However, in spite of this apparently very great difference in form, recent mycological research, both at microscopic&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and molecular&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt; level has shown that sometimes species of open mushrooms are much more closely related to particular species of gasteroid fungi than they are to each other.  Fungi which do not open up to let their spores be dispersed in the air, but which show a clear [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] relation to agarics or boletes, constitute an intermediate form and are called '''secotioid'''.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

The word is derived from the name of the genus ''[[Secotium]]'', which contains such species.&lt;ref name=Conard/&gt;

On a microscopic scale, secotioid fungi do not expel their spores forcibly from the basidium and so the spores are statismospores.  Like gasteroid fungi, secotioid ones rely on animals such as rodents or insects to distribute their spores.

It seems that sometimes it can be disadvantageous for a mushroom to open up and free its spores in the usual way.  If this development is aborted, a secotioid form arises, perhaps to be followed eventually by an evolutionary progression to a fully gasteroid form.  This type of progression is called '''gasteromycetation''' and seems to have happened several times independently starting from various genera of "normal" mushrooms.  This means that the secotioid and also the gasteroid fungi are [[polyphyletic]].  According to the paper by Thiers,&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; in certain climates and certain seasons, it may be an advantage to remain closed because moisture can be conserved in that way.

There is a spectrum of secotioid species ranging from the open form to the closed form in the following respects:
*there may be an evident stipe, or there may be only a remnant consisting of a column of non-fertile tissue,
*if there is a stipe the edge of the cap may separate from it (partially opening), or may not,
*there may be recognizable gills (though oriented in all directions and very convoluted), or the fertile interior may be uniform like the [[gleba]] of gasteroid fungi, and
*the spore-bearing tissue may be above ground ([[epigeous]]), or underground ([[wikt:hypogeous|hypogeous]]), or partly buried.

The adjective "'''sequestrate'''" is sometimes used as a general term to mean "either secotioid or gasteroid".

==Examples==

[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b11 168-5.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Cross-section of ''Hymenogaster tener'']]
For example, the secotioid genus ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' has been shown to be closely related to agaric genera such as ''[[Hebeloma]]'', which were formerly placed in family [[Cortinariaceae]] or [[Strophariaceae]].  This is found by DNA analysis and also indicated on a microscopic scale by the resemblance of the spores and basidia.  According to a current classification system, ''Hebeloma'' now belongs to family [[Hymenogastraceae]], and is considered more narrowly related to the closed ''[[Hymenogaster]]'' fungi than, for instance, to the ordinary mushrooms in genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;

A similar case is the well-known "Deceiver" mushroom ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'' which is now classified in the ''[[Hydnangiaceae]]'', ''Hydnangium'' being a gastroid genus.

''[[Cortinarius]]'' is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as ''C. leucocephalus'', ''C. coneae'' and ''C. cartilagineus''.

Secotioid genus ''Nivatogastrium'' corresponds to agaric genus ''[[Pholiota]]''&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt; and provides a vivid example of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Nivatogastrium/&gt;

It has been found that a change in a single locus of a gene of the gilled mushroom ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]'' causes it to have a closed fruiting body.  This suggests that the emergence of a secotioid species may not require many mutations.&lt;ref name=Hibbett/&gt;

''[[Gastroboletus]]'' is a secotioid [[bolete]] genus where the fruiting bodies may or may not open, but in any case the tubes are not aligned vertically as in a true bolete.&lt;ref name=thiers/&gt;

''[[Agaricus deserticola]]'' is a secotioid species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus ''Secotium''. Similarly, ''[[Agaricus inapertus]]'' was formerly known as ''Endoptychum depressum'' until [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with ''Agaricus''.&lt;ref name=Vellinga2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellinga EC |author2=de Kok RPJ |author3=Bruns TD. |title=Phylogeny and taxonomy of ''Macrolepiota'' (Agaricaceae) |journal=Mycologia |year=2003 |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=442–56 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0095/003/0442.htm |doi=10.2307/3761886 |pmid=21156633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first social maps date from the early 20th century. A recent example is the mapping of the residences of U.S. [[Facebook]] users and their social links [http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/02/how-to-split-up-the-us.html].

In ''marketing'' a '''social map''' is a visualized analysis of a [[digital identity]] of a person, brand or company. A social map shows exactly where a digital identity is created, formed or discussed and sets each element in context and proportions.

These social map created an intense discussion about [[Online reputation|digital reputation]] and digital identities. For companies a so-called Corporate Social Map is still very new and an unusual methodology, but also very effective and meaningful.

'''Space weather''' is a branch of [[space physics]] and [[aeronomy]] concerned with the time varying conditions within the Solar System, including the [[solar wind]], emphasizing the space surrounding the Earth, including conditions in the [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Barbara B. |last1=Poppe |first2=Kristen P. |last2=Jorden |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books, Boulder, Colorado |title=Sentinels of the Sun: Forecasting Space Weather|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sentinels_of_the_Sun.html?id=WMh4REf3iZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather is distinct from the terrestrial [[weather]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] ([[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]]). The term ''space weather'' was first used in the 1950s and came into common usage in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Cade III |first = William B. |author2 = Christina Chan-Park |title = The Origin of "Space Weather" |journal = Space Weather |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = 2015 |doi = 10.1002/2014SW001141 |bibcode = 2015SpWea..13...99C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For many centuries, the effects of space weather were noticed but not understood. Displays of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] light have long been observed at high latitudes.

=== Genesis ===
In 1724, [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] reported that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] was regularly deflected from [[magnetic north]] over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by [[Balfour Stewart]] in 1882, and confirmed by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.

In 1852, astronomer and British major general [[Edward Sabine]] showed that the probability of the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of [[sunspots]], thus demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. In 1859, a great [[Solar storm of 1859|magnetic storm]] caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global [[telegraph]] operations. [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] correctly connected the storm with a [[solar flare]] that he had observed the day before in the vicinity of a large sunspot group—thus demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.

[[Kristian Birkeland]] explained the physics of aurora by creating artificial aurora in his laboratory and predicted the [[solar wind]]. The introduction of radio revealed that periods of extreme static or noise occurred. Severe [[radar jamming]] during a large solar event in 1942 led to the discovery of solar radio bursts (radio waves which cover a broad frequency range created by a [[solar flare]]), another aspect of space weather.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the 20th century the interest in space weather expanded as military and commercial systems came to depend on systems affected by space weather. [[Communications satellites]] are a vital part of global commerce. [[Weather satellite]] systems provide information about terrestrial weather. The signals from satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) are used in a wide variety of applications. Space weather phenomena can interfere with or damage these satellites or interfere with the radio signals with which they operate. Space weather phenomena can cause damaging surges in long distance [[Overhead power line|transmission lines]] and expose passengers and crew of aircraft travel to [[radiation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = Genene M | title = ''Integrating Space Weather and Meteorological Products for Aviation'', (2003) | url = | journal = Bull.

The [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) increased research into space weather. Ground-based data obtained during IGY demonstrated that the aurora occurred in an ''auroral oval'', a permanent region of luminescence 15 to 25 degrees in latitude from the magnetic poles and 5 to 20 degrees wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldstein | first1 = Y.

(Toronto: MacFarlane Walter &amp; Ross, 2001), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; regions of radiation particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. In January 1959, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[satellite]] [[Luna 1]] first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength.

In 1969, INJUN-5 (a.k.a. Explorer 40&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-066B NASA NSSDC INJUN-5 page]&lt;/ref&gt;) made the first direct observation of the electric field impressed on the Earth's high latitude [[ionosphere]] by the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;Cauffman, D., and D.

Zmuda and J. C. Armstrong, ''The Diurnal Flow Pattern of Field-Aligned Currents'', J. Geophys. Res., 79, 31, 4611pp, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The term space weather came into usage in the 1990s along with the belief that space's impact on human systems demanded a more coordinated research and application framework.&lt;ref name="nas1997"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space Weather: A Research Perspective {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12272|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24 |publisher=National Academy of Science |year=1997 |quote=Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems.

== US National Space Weather Program ==
The purpose of the US National Space Weather Program is to focus research on the needs of the affected commercial and military communities, to connect the research and user communities, to create coordination between operational data centers and to better define user community needs.

The concept was turned into an action plan in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |title=The National Space Weather Program: Strategic Plan, Implementation Plan and Space Weather Architecture Transition Plan and Report of the Assessment Committee for the NSWP |publisher=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417130810/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |archivedate=2003-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an implementation plan in 2002, an assessment in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|title = Report of the Assessment Committee for the National Space Weather Program|date = 2006|accessdate = July 24, 2015|website = |publisher = Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185726/http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|archivedate = March 3, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a revised strategic plan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2010 National Space Weather Program Strategic Plan|url = http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|website = www.ofcm.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140404153245/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|archivedate = 2014-04-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised action plan was scheduled to be released in 2011 followed by a revised implementation plan in 2012.

==Phenomena==
Within the [[solar system]], space weather is influenced by the [[solar wind]] and the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) carried by the solar wind [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A variety of physical phenomena are associated with space weather, including [[geomagnetic storm]]s and substorms, energization of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, ionospheric disturbances and [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of satellite-to-ground radio signals and long-range radar signals, [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetically induced current]]s at Earth's surface. [[Coronal mass ejection]]s and their associated [[shock wave]]s are also important drivers of space weather as they can compress the [[magnetosphere]] and trigger [[geomagnetic storm]]s. [[Solar energetic particles]] (SEP), accelerated by coronal mass ejections or [[solar flare]]s, are also an important driver of space weather as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft (e.g. [[Galaxy 15]] failure), and threaten the lives of [[astronaut]]s.

==Effects==

===Spacecraft electronics===
[[File:ExtremeEvent 20031026-00h 20031106-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-11 and GOES-12 monitored space weather conditions during the October 2003 solar activity.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"&gt;{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some spacecraft failures can be directly attributed to space weather; many more are thought to have a space weather component. For example, 46 of the 70 failures reported in 2003 occurred during the October 2003 geomagnetic storm. The two most common adverse space weather effects on spacecraft are [[radiation damage]] and [[spacecraft charging]].

Radiation (high energy particles) passes through the skin of the spacecraft and into the electronic components. In most cases the radiation causes an erroneous signal or changes one bit in memory of a spacecraft's electronics ([[single event upset]]s). In a few cases, the radiation destroys a section of the electronics ([[latchup|single-event latchup]]).

Spacecraft charging is the accumulation of an [[electrostatic charge]] on a non-conducting material on the spacecraft's surface by low energy particles. If enough charge is built up, a discharge (spark) occurs. This can cause an erroneous signal to be detected and acted on by the spacecraft computer. A recent study indicates that spacecraft charging is the predominant space weather effect on spacecraft in [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Ho-Sung |author2=J. Lee |author3=K.-S. Cho |author4=Y.-S. Kwak |author5=I.-H. Cho |author6=Y.-D. Park |author7=Y.-H. Kim |author8=[[Daniel N. Baker|D. N. Baker]] |author9=G. D. Reeves |author10=D.-K.

===Spacecraft orbit changes===
The orbits of spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) decay to lower and lower altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecraft's surface (''i.e. '', drag) and the outer layer of the Earth's atmosphere (a.k.a. the [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]]). Eventually, a LEO spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the Earth's surface. Many spacecraft launched in the past couple of decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits. The rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime, to direct the reentry towards a particular (marine) site, or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft. Such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit. A [[geomagnetic storm]] can cause an orbit change over a couple of days that otherwise would occur over a year or more. The [[geomagnetic storm]] adds heat to the thermosphere, causing the thermosphere to expand and rise, increasing the drag on spacecraft. The [[2009 satellite collision]] between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit. Iridium 33 had the capability to maneuver out of the path of Cosmos 2251 and could have evaded the crash, if a credible collision prediction had been available,

===Humans in space===
{{main article|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
The exposure of a human body to [[ionizing radiation]] has the same [[acute radiation syndrome|harmful effects]] whether the source of the radiation is a medical [[X-ray machine]], a [[nuclear power plant]] or radiation in space. The degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiation's [[energy density]]. The ever-present [[radiation belt]]s extend down to the altitude of manned spacecraft such as the [[International Space Station#Radiation|International Space Station]] (ISS) and the [[Space Shuttle]], but the amount of exposure is within the [[Spaceflight radiation carcinogenesis#Current Permissible Exposure Limits|acceptable lifetime exposure limit]] under normal conditions. During a major space weather event that includes an SEP burst, the flux can increase by orders of magnitude. Areas within ISS provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space station radiation shields 'disappointing' - New Scientist|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2956-space-station-radiation-shields-disappointing.html|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Space Shuttle]], such an event would have required immediate mission termination.

===Ground systems===
[[Image:SpaceWeather-artl.jpg|thumb|Art inspired from the concept of space weather]]

====Spacecraft signals====
The [[ionosphere]] bends radio waves in the same manner that water in a swimming pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The degree of distortion (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band (30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver may not be able to keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz (L1) and 1227.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) operated by the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major space weather event. Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.

===Long-distance radio signals===
Radio wave in the [[high frequency|HF]] band (3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) (also known as the [[shortwave]] band) are reflected by the ionosphere. Since the ground also reflects HF waves, a signal can be transmitted around the curvature of the Earth beyond the line of sight. During the 20th century, HF communications was the only method for a ship or aircraft far from land or a base station to communicate. The advent of systems such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] brought other methods of communications, but HF remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others. Space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter HF signals instead of reflecting them, preventing HF communications. At auroral and polar latitudes, small space weather events that occur frequently disrupt HF communications. At mid-latitudes, HF communications are disrupted by solar radio bursts, by X-rays from solar flares (which enhance and disturb the ionospheric D-layer) and by [[Total Electron Content|TEC]] enhancements and irregularities during major geomagnetic storms.

Trans[[polar route|polar airline route]]s are particularly sensitive to space weather, in part because [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] require reliable communication over the entire flight.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-42B, June 6, 2008, Extended Operations (ETOPS and Polar Operations)&lt;/ref&gt; Diverting such a flight is estimated to cost about $100,000.&lt;ref name="nap.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Aviation radiation environment.png|thumbnail|All passengers in commercial aircraft flying above 26,000 feet will typically experience some exposure in this aviation radiation environment.]]

===Humans in commercial aviation ===
The magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and [[solar energetic particles]] to polar latitudes, while high energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. These energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at mid-latitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities,&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-52, March 5, 1990, Radiation exposure of air carrier crew members&lt;/ref&gt; the aircraft's flight path is diverted.

While the most significant, but highly unlikely, health consequences to atmospheric radiation exposure include death from cancer due to long-term exposure, many lifestyle-degrading and career-impacting cancer forms can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.W., P. Goldhagen, V. Rafnsson, J.M. Clem, and G. De Angelis (2002), Overview of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) Research: SST-Present, COSPAR, Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, W. Atwell, P. Beck, E. Benton, K. Copeland, C. Dyer, B. Gersey, I. Getley, A. Hands, M. Holland, S. Hong, J. Hwang, B. Jones, K. Malone, M. M. Meier, C. Mertens, T. Phillips, K. Ryden, N. Schwadron, S. A. Wender, R. Wilkins, M. A. Xapsos, Advances in Atmospheric Radiation Measurements and Modeling Needed to Improve Air Safety, Space Weather, 13, 202-210 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A cancer diagnosis can have significant career impact for a commercial pilot. A cancer diagnosis can ground a pilot temporarily or permanently. International guidelines from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) have been developed to mitigate this statistical risk.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 1991. 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. ICRP Publication 60. Ann. ICRP 21 (1-3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2005. Low-dose Extrapolation of Radiation-related Cancer Risk. ICRP Publication 99. Ann. ICRP 35 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2007. The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiologi-cal Protection. ICRP Publication 103. Ann. ICRP 37 (2-4).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRP recommends effective dose limits of a 5-year average of 20 [[sievert|mSv]] per year with no more than 50&amp;nbsp;mSv in a single year for non-pregnant, occupationally exposed persons, and 1&amp;nbsp;mSv per year for the general public. Radiation dose limits are not engineering limits. In the U.S., they are treated as an upper limit of acceptability and not a regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;NCRP Report No. 116 - Limitation of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of the radiation environment at commercial aircraft altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,000&amp;nbsp;ft) have historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground. However, a system of real-time radiation measurements on-board aircraft has been developed through the NASA Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) program.&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, D. Bouwer, D. Smart, M. Shea, J. Bailey, L. Didkovsky, K. Judge, H. Garrett, W. Atwell, B. Gersey, R. Wilkins, D. Rice, R. Schunk, D. Bell, C. Mertens, X. Xu, M. Wiltberger, S. Wiley, E. Teets, B. Jones, S. Hong, K. Yoon, Global real-time dose measurements using the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) system, Space Weather, 14, 1053-1080 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~ARMAS/ ARMAS] has flown hundreds of flights since 2013, mostly on research aircraft, and sent the data to the ground through Iridium satellite links. The eventual goal of these types of measurements is to data assimilate them into physics-based global radiation models, e.g., NASA's Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System ([http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~nairas/index.html NAIRAS]), so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology.

===Ground-induced electric fields===

Plasma Sci., 28, 6, 1867-73, 2000, {{doi|10.1109/27.902215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding voltage differentials can [[Geomagnetically induced current|find their way into electric power grids through ground connections]], driving uncontrolled electric currents that interfere with grid operation, damage transformers, trip protective relays and sometimes cause blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;Extreme Space Weather: Impacts on Engineered Systems and Infrastructure, pp. 1-68.

Lloyd's of London, London, UK (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophysical exploration===
Air- and ship-borne [[aeromagnetic survey|magnetic surveys]] can be affected by rapid magnetic field variations during geomagnetic storms. Such storms cause data interpretation problems because the space-weather-related magnetic field changes are similar in magnitude to those of the sub-surface crustal magnetic field in the survey area. Accurate geomagnetic storm warnings, including an assessment of storm magnitude and duration allows for an economic use of survey equipment.

===Geophysics and hydrocarbon production===
For economic and other reasons, oil and gas production often involves [[directional drilling|horizontal drilling]] of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead. Accuracy requirements are strict, due to target size – reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across – and safety, because of the proximity of other boreholes. The most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive, since it can stop drilling for hours. An alternative is to use a magnetic survey, which enables [[MWD (measurement while drilling)|measurement while drilling (MWD)]]. Near real-time magnetic data can be used to correct drilling direction.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, T.D.G., Clarke, E. Space weather services for the offshore drilling industry, in: Proceedings of the ESA Space Weather Workshop, ESTEC, the Netherlands, 17–19 Dec, 2001, ESA WPP-194, 2001.; Reay et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Large-magnitude geomagnetic disturbances in the North Sea region: Statistics, causes, and forecasting, H.

Space Res. 37, 1169–117, {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2005.04.082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic data and space weather forecasts can help to clarify unknown sources of drilling error.

===Terrestrial weather===
The amount of energy entering the troposphere and stratosphere from space weather phenomena is trivial compared to the solar [[insolation]] in the visible and infra-red portions of the solar electromagnetic spectrum. However, some linkage between the 11-year sunspot cycle and the Earth's [[climate]] has been claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Variability of the solar cycle length during the past five centuries and the apparent association with terrestrial climate, K. Lassen and E. Friis-Christensen, 57, 8, pp. 835–845, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Maunder minimum]], a 70-year period almost devoid of sunspots, allegedly correlated to a cooler climate. One suggestion for the linkage between space and terrestrial weather is that changes in [[cosmic ray]] flux cause changes in the amount of cloud formation.&lt;ref&gt;What do we really know about the Sun-climate connection?, E. Friis-Christensen and H. Svensmark, Adv. Space Res., 20, 4/5, pp. 913–921, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is that variations in the EUV flux subtly influence existing drivers of the climate and tip the balance between [[El Niño]]/[[La Niña]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Amplifying the Pacific climate system response to a small 11-year solar cycle forcing, Meehl, G.A.; Arblaster, J.M.; Matthes, K.; Sassi, F.; van Loon, H., ''Science'', 325, 5944, 1114-18, 28 Aug. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, a linkage between space weather and the climate has not been demonstrated conclusively.

==Observation==
Observation of space weather is done both for scientific research and for applications. Scientific observation has evolved with the state of knowledge, while application-related observation expanded with the ability to exploit such data.

===Ground-based===
Space weather is monitored at ground level by observing changes in the Earth's magnetic field over periods of seconds to days, by observing the surface of the Sun and by observing radio noise created in the Sun's atmosphere.

The [[Wolf number|Sunspot Number]] (SSN) is the number of [[sunspot]]s on the Sun's photosphere in visible light on the side of the Sun visible to an Earth observer. The number and total area of sunspots are related to the brightness of the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) and X-ray portions of the [[sunlight|solar spectrum]] and to solar activity such as [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs).

10.7&amp;nbsp;cm radio flux (F10.7) is a measurement of RF emissions from the Sun and is approximately correlated with the solar EUV flux. Since this RF emission is easily obtained from the ground and EUV flux is not, this value has been measured and disseminated continuously since 1947. The world standard measurements are made by the [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory]] at Penticton, B.C., Canada and reported once a day at local noon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |title=Last 7 days of solar radio flux |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071524/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in solar flux units (10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Fundamental space weather monitoring data are provided by ground-based magnetometers and magnetic observatories. Magnetic storms were first discovered by ground-based measurement of occasional magnetic disturbance. Ground magnetometer data provide real-time situational awareness for post-event analysis. Magnetic observatories have been in continuous operations for decades to centuries, providing data to inform studies of long-term changes in space climatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Love, J.

[[Disturbance storm time index|Dst index]] is an estimate of the magnetic field change at the Earth's magnetic equator due to a ring of electric current at and just earthward of the [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin 40 |first1=Masahisa |last1=SUGIURA |first2=Toyohisa |last2=KAMEI|url = http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html|website = wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is based on data from four ground-based magnetic observatories between 21° and 33° magnetic latitude during a one-hour period. Stations closer to the magnetic equator are not used due to ionospheric effects. The Dst index is compiled and archived by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;[http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wdc/Sec3.html Geomagnetic Data Service] World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K-index|Kp/ap]] Index: 'a' is an index created from the geomagnetic disturbance at one mid-latitude (40° to 50° latitude) geomagnetic observatory during a 3-hour period. 'K' is the quasi-logarithmic counterpart of the 'a' index. Kp and ap are the average of K and an over 13 geomagnetic observatories to represent planetary-wide geomagnetic disturbances. The Kp/ap index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/kp-index Helmholtz Centre PotsdamGFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]&lt;/ref&gt; indicates both [[geomagnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s (auroral disturbance). Kp/ap is available from 1932 onward.

AE index is compiled from geomagnetic disturbances at 12 geomagnetic observatories in and near the auroral zones and is recorded at 1-minute intervals.&lt;ref name="kyoto" /&gt; The public AE index is available with a lag of two to three days that limits its utility for space weather applications. The AE index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic [[substorm]]s except during a major [[geomagnetic storm]] when the auroral zones expand equatorward from the observatories.

Radio noise bursts are reported by the Radio Solar Telescope Network to the U.S. Air Force and to NOAA. The radio bursts are associated with solar flare plasma that interacts with the ambient solar atmosphere.

The Sun's photosphere is observed continuously&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html List of solar observatories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410190312/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html |date=2011-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for activity that can be the precursors to solar flares and CMEs. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gong.nso.org Global Oscillation Network Group home page]&lt;/ref&gt; project monitors both the surface and the interior of the Sun by using [[helioseismology]], the study of sound waves propagating through the Sun and observed as ripples on the solar surface. GONG can detect sunspot groups on the far side of the Sun. This ability has recently been verified by visual observations from the [[STEREO]] spacecraft.

[[Neutron monitor]]s on the ground indirectly monitor cosmic rays from the Sun and galactic sources. When cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere, atomic interactions occur that cause a shower of lower energy particles to descend into the atmosphere and to ground level. The presence of cosmic rays in the near-Earth space environment can be detected by monitoring high energy neutrons at ground level. Small fluxes of cosmic rays are present continuously. Large fluxes are produced by the Sun during events related to energetic solar flares.

[[Total Electron Content]] (TEC) is a measure of the ionosphere over a given location. TEC is the number of electrons in a column one meter square from the base of the ionosphere (approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km altitude) to the top of the ionosphere (approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km altitude). Many TEC measurements are made by monitoring the two frequencies transmitted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] spacecraft. Presently GPS TEC is monitored and distributed in real time from more than 360 stations maintained by agencies in many countries.

Geoeffectiveness is a measure of how strongly space weather magnetic fields, such as coronal mass ejections, couple with the Earth's magnetic field. This is determined by the direction of the magnetic field held within the plasma that originates from the Sun. New techniques measuring [[Faraday effect|Faraday Rotation]] in radio waves are in development to measure field direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Sunveillance|url=http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=73|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric Science|url=http://www.haystack.mit.edu/mwa/Science%20Goal/Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric%20Science/solar.html|publisher=MIT Haystack Observatory|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E.|editor-last = Trümper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory]] series were among the first spacecraft with the mission of analyzing the space environment. Recent spacecraft include the NASA-ESA Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 into solar orbit and the [[Van Allen Probes]], launched in 2012 into a highly [[elliptical]] Earth-orbit. The two STEREO spacecraft drift away from the Earth by about 22° per year, one leading and the other trailing the Earth in its orbit. Together they compile information about the solar surface and atmosphere in three dimensions. The Van Allen probes record detailed information about the radiation belts, geomagnetic storms and the relationship between the two.

Some spacecraft with other primary missions have carried auxiliary instruments for solar observation. Among the earliest such spacecraft were the [[Applications Technology Satellite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA -  ATS|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/missions/ats.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ATS) series at GEO that were precursors to the modern [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) weather satellite and many communication satellites. The ATS spacecraft carried environmental particle sensors as auxiliary payloads and had their navigational magnetic field sensor used for sensing the environment.

Many of the early instruments were research spacecraft that were re-purposed for space weather applications. One of the first of these was the IMP-8 (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMP-8 Project Information|url = http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/imp8/project.html|website = spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It orbited the Earth at 35 Earth Radii and observed the solar wind for two-thirds of its 12-day orbits from 1973 to 2006. Since the solar wind carries disturbances that affect the magnetosphere and ionosphere, IMP-8 demonstrated the utility of continuous solar wind monitoring. IMP-8 was followed by [[International Cometary Explorer|ISEE-3]], which was placed near the {{L1}} [[Sun]]-[[Earth]] [[Lagrangian point]], 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles) and continuously monitored the solar wind from 1978 to 1982. The next spacecraft to monitor the solar wind at the {{L1}} point was [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]] from 1994 to 1998. After April 1998, the WIND spacecraft orbit was changed to circle the Earth and occasionally pass the {{L1}} point. The NASA [[Advanced Composition Explorer]] (ACE) has monitored the solar wind at the {{L1}} point from 1997 to present.

In addition to monitoring the solar wind, monitoring the Sun is important to space weather. Because the solar EUV cannot be monitored from the ground, the joint [[NASA]]-[[ESA]] [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) spacecraft was launched and has provided solar EUV images beginning in 1995. SOHO is a main source of near-real time solar data for both research and space weather prediction and inspired the [[STEREO]] mission. The [[Yohkoh]] spacecraft at LEO observed the Sun from 1991 to 2001 in the X-ray portion of the solar spectrum and was useful for both research and space weather prediction. Data from Yohkoh inspired the [[Solar X-ray Imager]] on GOES.

[[File:ExtremeEvent 19891018-00h 19891031-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-7 monitors space weather conditions during the October 1989 solar activity resulted in a Forbush Decrease, Ground Level Enhancements, and many satellite anomalies.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"/&gt;]]

Spacecraft with instruments whose primary purpose is to provide data for space weather predictions and applications include the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) series of spacecraft, the [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]] series, the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series, and the [[Meteosat]] series. The GOES spacecraft have carried an X-ray sensor (XRS) which measures the flux from the whole solar disk in two bands – 0.05 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm and 0.1 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;nm – since 1974, an X-ray imager (SXI) since 2004, a magnetometer which measures the distortions of the Earth’s magnetic field due to space weather, a whole disk [[extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] sensor since 2004, and particle sensors (EPS/HEPAD) which measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 50 keV to 500 MeV. Starting sometime after 2015, the GOES-R generation of GOES spacecraft will replace the SXI with a solar EUV image (SUVI) similar to the one on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[STEREO]] and the particle sensor will be augmented with a component to extend the energy range down to 30&amp;nbsp;eV.

The [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] (DSCOVR) satellite is a [[NOAA]] Earth observation and space weather satellite that launched in February 2015. Among its features is advance warning of coronal mass ejections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/nasa-set-to-launch-satellite-t/40450948 | title = NOAA's DSCOVR Satellite Launch Attempt Delayed by Technical Issues | first = Mark | last = Leberfinger | work = AccuWeather.com | publisher = AccuWeather, Inc. | date = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Space weather models are simulations of the space weather environment. Models use sets of mathematical equations to describe physical processes.

These models take a limited data set and attempt to describe all or part of the space weather environment in or to predict how weather evolves over time. Early models were heuristic; i.e''., '' they did not directly employ physics. These models take less resources than their more sophisticated descendants.

Later models use physics to account for as many phenomena as possible. No model can yet reliably predict the environment from the surface of the Sun to the bottom of the Earth's ionosphere. Space weather models differ from meteorological models in that the amount of input is vastly smaller.

A significant portion of space weather model research and development in the past two decades has been done as part of the [[outer space#Geospace|Geospace]] Environmental Model (GEM) program of the [[National Science Foundation]]. The two major modeling centers are the Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CSEM - Center for Space Environment Modeling|url = http://csem.engin.umich.edu/|website = csem.engin.umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CISM // Home|url = http://www.bu.edu/cism/|website = www.bu.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Community Coordinated Modeling Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title = NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCMC) at the NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] is a facility for coordinating the development and testing of research models, for improving and preparing models for use in space weather prediction and application.&lt;ref&gt;Wang-Sheeley-Arge-Enlil Cone Model Transitions to Operations, Pizzo, V., G. Millward, A. Parsons, D. Biesecker, S. Hill, and D. Odstrcil (2011), Space Weather, 9, S03004, {{doi|10.1029/2011SW000663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling techniques include (a) [[magnetohydrodynamics]], in which the environment is treated as a fluid, (b) particle in cell, in which non-fluid interactions are handled within a cell and then cells are connected to describe the environment, (c) first principles, in which physical processes are in balance (or equilibrium) with one another, (d) semi-static modeling, in which a statistical or empirical relationship is described, or a combination of multiple methods.

== Commercial space weather development ==
During the first decade of the 21st Century, a commercial sector emerged that engaged in space weather, serving agencies, commercial and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academies Press, "Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society," Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics (Heliophysics); Space Studies Board; Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board; Division of Earth and Physical Sciences; National Research Council {{ISBN|978-0-309-16428-3}}, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather providers are mostly small companies that provide space weather data, models, derivative products and service distribution.

The commercial sector includes scientific and engineering researchers as well as users. Activities are primarily directed toward the impacts of space weather upon technology. These include, for example: 
* Atmospheric drag on LEO satellites caused by energy inputs into the thermosphere from solar UV, FUV, [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]], [[EUV]], [[Extreme ultraviolet|XUV]] and X-ray photons as well as by charged particle precipitation and [[Joule heating]] at high latitudes; 
* Surface and internal charging from increased energetic particle fluxes, leading to effects such as discharges, single event upsets and latch-up, on LEO to GEO satellites; 
* Disrupted GPS signals caused by ionospheric scintillation leading to increased uncertainty in navigation systems such as aviation’s [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS);
* Lost HF, UHF and L-band radio communications due to ionosphere scintillation, solar flares and geomagnetic storms; 
* Increased radiation to human tissue and avionics from [[galactic cosmic rays]] and SEP, especially during large solar flares, at altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km;&lt;ref&gt;Tobiska, et al., Advances in atmospheric radiation measurements and modeling needed to improve international air safety, Space Weather Journal, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Increased inaccuracy in surveying and oil/gas exploration that uses the Earth’s main magnetic field when it is disturbed by geomagnetic storms;
* Loss of power transmission from GIC surges in the electrical power grid and transformer shutdowns during large geomagnetic storms. 
Many of these disturbances result in societal impacts that account for a significant part of the national GDP.

The concept of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone stems from the work of the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The establishment of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. The formation of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone would: encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products; support U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products; require U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists; promote U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services to international partners; designate U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as “Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone” activities; and track U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone could be far-reaching. U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products can prevent economic disruptions and loss-of-life from societal risks resulting from space weather and an innovation zone would encourage the research and investment needed for this success. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) would potentially build on that legacy.

=== American Commercial Space Weather Association ===
On April 29, 2010, the commercial space weather community created the American Commercial Space Weather Association ([http://acswa.us ACSWA]) an industry association. ACSWA promotes space weather risk mitigation for national infrastructure, economic strength and national security. It seeks to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACSWA Capabilities|url = http://www.acswa.us/capabilities.html|website = www.acswa.us|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* provide quality space weather data and services to help mitigate risks to technology;
* provide advisory services to government agencies;
* provide guidance on the best task division between commercial providers and government agencies;
* represent the interests of commercial providers;
* represent commercial capabilities in the national and international arena; 
* develop best-practices.

A summary of the broad technical capabilities in space weather that are available from the association can be found on their web site http://www.acswa.us.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">'''Stentato''' or '''stentando''' (the past participle and gerund of the [[Italian (language)|Italian]] verb ''[[wikt:stentare|stentare]]'' "to find it hard to do something, to have difficulty doing something") is a [[musical expression]] which means "labored, heavy, in a dragging manner, sluggish", or "strong and forced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/3344-stentando OnMusic Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge |last= |first= |year=1919 |publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp. |volume=v. 19 |page=644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is abbreviated "sten." or "stent." and is, for example, the direction given for the last 17 bars of the Sanctus of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] and also used by [[Ottorino Respighi]] in his composition [[Pini di Roma]].

==Limitations==
As with other methods, SWIFT may not be comprehensive and the approach has some limitations. In a healthcare context, SWIFT was found to reveal significant risks, but like similar methods (including healthcare failure mode and effects analysis) it may have limited validity when used in isolation.&lt;ref name="potts2014" /&gt;

{{see also|System integration testing}}

'''System testing''' is testing conducted on a complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified [[requirements]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

System testing takes, as its input, all of the integrated components that have passed [[integration testing]]. The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the units that are integrated together (called ''assemblages''). System testing seeks to detect defects both within the "inter-assemblages" and also within the system as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

System testing is performed on the entire system in the context of a [[Functional requirements|Functional Requirement]] Specification(s) (FRS) and/or a [[Requirements analysis|System Requirement]] Specification (SRS).  System testing tests not only the design, but also the behaviour and even the believed expectations of the customer.  It is also intended to test up to and beyond the bounds defined in the software/hardware requirements specification(s).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Approaches==
* [[Destructive testing]]: tests are carried out to the specimen's failure, in order to understand a specimen's performance or material behaviour under different loads.
* [[Nondestructive testing]]: analysis techniques to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.

==Subject-specific test methods==
===Software testing===
[[Software testing]] is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software product or service under test.&lt;ref name="Kaner 1"&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/ETatQAI.pdf | title = Exploratory Testing |authorlink=Cem Kaner | last = Kaner | first = Cem |conference=''Quality Assurance Institute Worldwide Annual Software Testing Conference'' | location = Orlando, FL | date = November 17, 2006 | access-date = November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test meets the requirements that guided its design and development, responds correctly to all kinds of inputs, performs its functions within an acceptable time, is sufficiently usable, can be installed and run in its intended environments, and achieves the general result its stakeholders desire. As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources.

===Mobile-device testing===
[[Mobile-device testing]] assures the quality of mobile devices, like mobile phones, PDAs, etc. The testing will be conducted on both hardware and software. And from the view of different procedures, the testing comprises R&amp;D testing, factory testing and certificate testing. Mobile-device testing involves a set of activities from monitoring and trouble shooting mobile application, content and services on real handsets. Testing includes verification and validation of hardware devices and software applications.

'''The Juice Media''' ('''TJM''') is an Australian film and media company, that produces contemporary political and social satire. They are known for their Internet series Honest Government Ads and Juice Rap News.

TJM has been at the centre of a number of political controversies including the use of the "Australien" logo that is at the heart of a Bill to change the Australian Criminal Code Act as well as the divisive Australia Day piracy video.

== History ==

TJM was founded by [[Giordano Nanni]], an Australian [[historian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|title=DR GIORDANO NANNI - The University of Melbourne|date=2012-09-11|access-date=2018-06-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911052814/https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person194914|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[author]], [[Satire|satirist]] and [[Video production|video producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://logancij.com/speaker/giordano/|title=Giordano Nanni|work=The Logan CIJ Symposium|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; TJM started publishing on [[YouTube|YouTube]] in May 2008 with the first episode of [[Juice Rap News]] premiering on 4 October 2009.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRw8GAAtm27q4R3Q0kst_g|title=thejuicemedia|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2016 Juice Media launched the Honest Government ad series with Visit Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejuicemedia.com/about/|title=About - The Juice Media|work=The Juice Media|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2017 TJM released the controversial ''Australia Day'' (Piracy parody).

== Controversy ==

=== Australien Coat of Harms ===
[[File:Australien Govt - Coat of Harms - by THEJUICEMEDIA.png|thumb|Australien Coat of Harms as created by The Juice Media]]The Australien Coat of Harms was created as the backdrop to the fictitious Department of Genuine Satire for the Honest Government Adverts. There are a number of notable differences between the fictitious Coat of Harms and the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Commonwealth Coat of Arms]] that it lampoons including:

* A stylised alien head replacing the Commonwealth star
* The heads of the emu and kangaroo have been replaced with surveillance cameras
* The bar under the star has been replaced with a buffering bar
* The 6 state emblems on the shield have been replaced with a pirate ship
* The "Australia" wording under the shield has been replaced with "Not the Real Logo"

In September 2017 TJM received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of the satirical logo no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public about the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/thejuicemedia/status/906104236789841920/photo/1|title=theJuice on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to [[Parliament of Australia|Australian parliament]] to amend the [[Criminal law of Australia|Criminal Code Act 1995]].

The summary for the Bill was stated as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to: introduce new offences for a person recklessly or intentionally representing themselves to be, or to be acting on behalf of, or with the authority of, a Commonwealth entity or service; and introduce a new injunction power to allow authorised persons to seek injunctive relief to prevent a person from engaging in conduct in contravention of the new offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5973|title=Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The case for the amendments to the Bill were presented in the Senate by the [[Attorney general|Attorney-General]] [[The Honourable|Hon.]] [[George Brandis]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=George Brandis on Genuine Satire|date=2017-11-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLzPuNL0BKU|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a number of public submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee overseeing the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/ImpersonatingaCommBody/Submissions|title=Submissions|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the submissions were pieces from [[Australian Lawyers for Human Rights]] and [[Electronic Frontiers Australia]] both of which expressed concerns with the Bill with regards to freedom of speech and lack of safeguards and ambiguous wording in the Bill that could result in legal action being taken against critics and satirists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=310dc8e6-72ba-4760-9f6e-4ac8ae2a2147&amp;subId=561090|title=Australian Lawyers for Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Australia|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/australian-government-wants-give-satire-boot|title=Australian Government Wants to Give Satire The Boot|last=Nazer|first=Daniel|date=2017-10-20|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alhr.org.au/2017-alhr-human-rights-report-card/|title=2017 ALHR Human Rights Report Card - ALHR|date=2018-01-11|work=ALHR|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''It is unfortunate that the Australian government cannot distinguish between impersonation and satire. But it is especially worrying because the government has proposed legislation that would impose jail terms for impersonation of a government agency. Some laws against impersonating government officials can be appropriate (Australia, like the U.S., is seeing telephone scams from fraudsters claiming to be tax officials). But the proposed legislation in Australia lacks sufficient safeguards. Moreover, the recent letter to Juice Media shows that the government may lack the judgment needed to apply the law fairly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171023/07223238458/australian-lawmakers-propose-outlawing-parody-having-sense-humor.shtml|title=Australian Lawmakers Propose Outlawing Parody, Having A Sense Of Humor|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by [[Adam Bandt|Adam Bandt]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] in a speech to parliament in which he addressed the topics of freedom of speech and the rights to "mercilessly troll government".&lt;ref name="thejuicemedia"/&gt;

[[Nick McKim|Senator Nick McKim]] is on record as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''Where does this leave satire in Australia? Does it mean that figures such as [[Shaun Micallef]], The Juice Media and [[The Chaser]] team, as well as upcoming comedians, will have to think twice before they crack jokes lest they find themselves on the stand or in the slammer? As the government's then Attorney-General put it, 'The test of what genuine satire is will be, as I said, up to the [[court]]s.' [[Law of Australia|Australian common law]] has never previously had to deal with defining genuine satire, meaning that satirists will be in the dark as to the potential limits of their jokes until a body of common law has been established''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/senate/?id=2018-05-10.187.1|title=Criminal Code Amendment...: 10 May 2018: Senate debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/billsdgs/5767580%22|title=ParlInfo - Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia Day (Piracy Parody) ===
On 24 January 2017 TJM released a [[parody]] of a well known [[Copy protection|anti-piracy]] ad, colloquially dubbed "[[You Wouldn't Steal a Car]]", called Australia Day (Piracy parody).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=thejuicemedia|title=Australia Day (Piracy parody)|date=2017-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytdM-x3cv4|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video compared the celebration of [[Australia Day]] (Jan 26), which marks the arrival of the [[First Fleet]],  to a number of infamous events in history. The events depicted include [[Nazism|Nazi's]] "[[Final Solution]]", dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Hiroshima]] and [[September 11 attacks|Sep 11 attacks on the Twin Towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4158072/Ad-compares-Australia-Day-September-11.html?ito=social-twitter_DailyMailAU|title=Ad compares Australia Day to celebrating September 11|last=|first=|date=|work=UK Daily Mail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/this-video-compares-the-settling-of-australia-to-911-hiroshi|title=This Video Compares Australian Settlement To 9/11, Hiroshima And The Holocaust|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was released as part of the Change the Date campaign (#[[changethedate]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2018/01-02/australia-dystopia/|title=Australia Dystopia|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for changing the date of Australia Day by [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]], [[Torres Strait Islands|Torres Straight]] Islander and wider community groups.&lt;blockquote&gt;''Many believe celebrating on January 26 is insensitive as the arrival of the First Fleet marked the beginning of a brutal history which saw mass killings of Indigenous Australians.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-25/invasion-day-video-compares-australia-day-to-september-11/8211630?pfmredir=sm|title='You wouldn't celebrate September 11': Ad compares Australia Day to tragic world events|date=2017-01-25|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This video incited a great deal of debate, especially in social media, with a lot of negative sentiments expressed especially at the comparison of Jan 26 to other historical dates:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I understand the sentiment, but these are really poor examples. Not one of these events resulted in the creation of a sustainable society/civilisation," Shaun Fielding said.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[National Australia Day Council]] said in response:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though 26 January marks this specific event, today Australia Day celebrations reflect contemporary Australia: our diverse society and landscape, our remarkable achievements and our bright future. It also is an opportunity to reflect on our nation's history, and to consider how we can make Australia an even better place in future," &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2017 the Australia Day celebrations in [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]] were cancelled and replaced with more culturally inclusive celebrations 2 days later on Jan 28. This was seen as a litmus test for the #changethedate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-24/fremantle-divided-over-cancellation-of-australia-day-festivities/8207954|title='An act of betrayal': City divided over Australia Day cancellation|date=2017-01-24|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internet based Australian satirical news show consisting of a rapped "news report" with [[social commentary]] using comical [[Rapping|rap lyrics]].

[[File:Honest Government Ads - Behind The Scenes.jpg|thumb|Behind the scenes with voice-actor Lucy Cahill at The Juice Media]]
The Honest Government Ads are filmed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are written by Giordano Nanni who creates the series in collaboration with Lucy Cahill. Actors appearing in the series are credited as Ellen Burbidge, Zoë Amanda Wilson and Matylda Buczko-Koren with Lucy Cahill also being credited with the voice overs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These videos are a satirical take on [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] advertising. Each video targets a current social or political issue and highlights potential consequences of the Government's position and policy on that issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/86230-new-crimes-impersonating-federal-agencies-poorly-drafted/|title=Critics say new crimes of 'impersonating' federal agencies are poorly drafted {{!}} The Mandarin|date=2017-11-22|work=The Mandarin|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"And an increasingly popular way of sharing the ‘honest truth' about political events is through satirical videos, something that The Juice Media does brilliantly. They bring attention to the ridiculousness of political and worldwide events, not only by making people laugh but by being blunt about what is going on and how people are being taken advantage of. Not everyone agrees with their left wing politics, but it gets people talking."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magnetofilms.co.uk/charity-video-with-bite/|title=Charity video with bite - using satire to provoke action|date=2018-01-10|work=Magneto Films|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:The Juice Media filming of Honest Government Ads.jpg|thumb|Filming Honest Government Ads with Ellen Burbidge]]In an [[Al Jazeera English]] article looking at Satire in the [[Donald Trump|Trump]] era Giordano Nanni was included in the discussion talking about the use of satire to help keep governments honest. 

As part of the Honest Government ad series TJM has published three ads which are mock tourism ads highlighting the history and ongoing effects of [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] in certain countries. These have been produced for [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

'''''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us''''' is a 1999 book about [[lesbian sexual practices]] by sex educator [[Felice Newman]].

== Overview ==
First published in 1999 by Cleis Press, ''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book'' was written to "offer information and encouragement for all women who desire women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-whole-lesbian-sex-book-felice-newman/1103671272|title=The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us {{!}} Barnes and Noble|last=|first=|date=|work=Cleis Press|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended audience includes lesbians, bisexuals, butch, femme, androgynous, and transgenders. The second edition was published October 5th, 2004 with an additional chapter, new research, an expanded resource guide, and extra illustrations.

== Topics ==
Topics include the importance of communication in any sexual relationship, how to communicate about lesbian sex, exploring personal desires and fantasies, how masturbation improves sex, how to achieve the preferred orgasm, where to find sex partners, expert advice on various lesbian sex techniques, and a guide to picking sex toys.

== Controversy ==
Two teenage brothers from [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], found the book in a [[public library]] and told their father, Earl Adams. The father complained to the library's director, Bentonville's [[mayor]], and to a local [[newspaper]]. He threatened to sue the library if the book was not removed. The [[Fox News Channel]] picked up the story in April 2007, which gave it and the book national attention.&lt;ref name=Ficera&gt;{{cite news

==In popular media==
In an episode of the cable TV show ''[[The L Word]]'', ''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book'' was given as a gift by somebody involved in a lesbian affair with the recipient, who suggested that they try everything in the book.&lt;ref&gt;''The L Word'' episode 4x05, "Lez Girls"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26239">'''Transcription activator-like effector nucleases''' ('''TALEN''') are [[restriction enzyme]]s that can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a [[TAL effector]] [[DNA-binding domain]] to a DNA cleavage domain (a [[nuclease]] which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations.&lt;ref name=Boch2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boch J | title = TALEs of genome targeting | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–6 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21301438 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in [[Genome editing|gene editing]] or for [[genome]] editing ''[[in situ]]'', a technique known as [[genome editing with engineered nucleases]]. Alongside [[zinc finger nucleases]] and [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]], TALEN is a prominent tool in the field of [[genome editing]].

==TALE DNA-binding domain==
[[TAL effector]]s are proteins that are secreted by ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' bacteria via their [[type three secretion system|type III secretion system]] when they [[plant pathology|infect plants]].&lt;ref name="Boch J, Bonas U. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boch J, Bonas U | title = Xanthomonas AvrBs3 family-type III effectors: discovery and function | journal = Annual Review of Phytopathology | volume = 48 | issue =  | pages = 419–36 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 19400638 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-phyto-080508-081936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA binding domain contains a repeated highly conserved 33–34 amino acid sequence with divergent 12th and 13th amino acids. These two positions, referred to as the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD), are highly variable and show a strong correlation with specific [[nucleotide]] recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boch J, Scholze H, Schornack S, Landgraf A, Hahn S, Kay S, Lahaye T, Nickstadt A, Bonas U | title = Breaking the code of DNA binding specificity of TAL-type III effectors | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5959 | pages = 1509–12 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19933107 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178811 | bibcode = 2009Sci...326.1509B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moscou MJ, Bogdanove AJ | title = A simple cipher governs DNA recognition by TAL effectors | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5959 | pages = 1501 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19933106 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178817 | bibcode = 2009Sci...326.1501M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This straightforward relationship between amino acid sequence and DNA recognition has allowed for the engineering of specific DNA-binding domains by selecting a combination of repeat segments containing the appropriate RVDs.&lt;ref name=Boch2011/&gt; Notably, slight changes in the RVD and the incorporation of "nonconventional" RVD sequences can improve targeting specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Juillerat A, Pessereau C, Dubois G, Guyot V, Maréchal A, Valton J, Daboussi F, Poirot L, Duclert A, Duchateau P | title = Optimized tuning of TALEN specificity using non-conventional RVDs | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 8150 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25632877 | pmc = 4311247 | doi = 10.1038/srep08150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FokI domain functions as a dimer, requiring two constructs with unique DNA binding domains for sites in the target genome with proper orientation and spacing.  Both the number of amino acid residues between the TALE DNA binding domain and the FokI cleavage domain and the number of bases between the two individual TALEN binding sites appear to be important parameters for achieving high levels of activity.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mussolino2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mussolino C, Morbitzer R, Lütge F, Dannemann N, Lahaye T, Cathomen T | title = A novel TALE nuclease scaffold enables high genome editing activity in combination with low toxicity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 21 | pages = 9283–93 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21813459 | pmc = 3241638 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering TALEN constructs==
The simple relationship between amino acid sequence and DNA recognition of the TALE binding domain allows for the efficient engineering of proteins.

A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have also been reported.&lt;ref name=Cermak2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2011/&gt;&lt;ref name = Morbitzer2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morbitzer R, Elsaesser J, Hausner J, Lahaye T | title = Assembly of custom TALE-type DNA binding domains by modular cloning | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 13 | pages = 5790–9 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21421566 | pmc = 3141260 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Li2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li T, Huang S, Zhao X, Wright DA, Carpenter S, Spalding MH, Weeks DP, Yang B | title = Modularly assembled designer TAL effector nucleases for targeted gene knockout and gene replacement in eukaryotes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 14 | pages = 6315–25 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21459844 | pmc = 3152341 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geissler2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geissler R, Scholze H, Hahn S, Streubel J, Bonas U, Behrens SE, Boch J | title = Transcriptional activators of human genes with programmable DNA-specificity | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e19509 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21625585 | pmc = 3098229 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0019509 | editor1-last = Shiu | editor1-first = Shin-Han }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber E, Gruetzner R, Werner S, Engler C, Marillonnet S | title = Assembly of designer TAL effectors by Golden Gate cloning | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e19722 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21625552 | pmc = 3098256 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0019722 | editor1-last = Bendahmane | editor1-first = Mohammed }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both methods offer a systematic approach to engineering DNA binding domains that is conceptually similar to the modular assembly method for generating [[zinc finger]] DNA recognition domains.

[[File:TALEN copy.svg|440px|thumb|Workflow of genome editing of Your Favorite Gene (YFG) using TALEN. The target sequence is identified, a corresponding TALEN sequence is engineered and inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is inserted into the target cell where it is translated to produce the functional TALEN, which enters the nucleus and binds and cleaves the target sequence. Depending on the application, this can be used to introduce an error (to knock out a target gene) or to introduce a new DNA sequence into the target gene.]]

==Transfection==
Once the TALEN constructs have been assembled, they are inserted into [[plasmid]]s; the target cells are then [[Transfection|transfected]] with the plasmids, and the gene products are [[Gene expression|expressed]] and enter the nucleus to access the genome. Alternatively, TALEN constructs can be delivered to the cells as mRNAs, which removes the possibility of genomic integration of the TALEN-expressing protein. Using an mRNA vector can also dramatically increase the level of homology directed repair (HDR) and the success of introgression during gene editing.

==Genome editing==

=== Mechanisms ===
TALEN can be used to edit genomes by inducing double-strand breaks (DSB), which cells respond to with repair mechanisms.

[[Non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) directly ligates DNA from either side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This repair mechanism induces errors in the genome via [[indel]]s (insertion or deletion), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;  Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems.  A simple heteroduplex cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple agarose gels or slab gel systems.

Alternatively, DNA can be introduced into a genome through NHEJ in the presence of exogenous double-stranded DNA fragments.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;

In theory, the genome-wide specificity of engineered TALEN fusions allows for correction of errors at individual genetic loci via homology-directed repair from a correct exogenous template.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;  In reality, however, the ''in situ'' application of TALEN is currently limited by the lack of an efficient delivery mechanism, unknown immunogenic factors, and uncertainty in the specificity of TALEN binding.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;

Another emerging application of TALEN is its ability to combine with other genome engineering tools, such as [[meganuclease]]s. The DNA binding region of a TAL effector can be combined with the cleavage domain of a meganuclease to create a hybrid architecture combining the ease of engineering and highly specific DNA binding activity of a TAL effector with the low site frequency and specificity of a meganuclease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boissel S, Jarjour J, Astrakhan A, Adey A, Gouble A, Duchateau P, Shendure J, Stoddard BL, Certo MT, Baker D, Scharenberg AM | title = megaTALs: a rare-cleaving nuclease architecture for therapeutic genome engineering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 2591–601 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24285304 | pmc = 3936731 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to other genome editing techniques TALEN falls in the middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]], TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides than it is to create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2014/march/pros-and-cons-of-znfs-talens-and-crispr-cas|title=Pros and Cons Of ZFNS, TALENS, AND CRISPR/CAS|last=|first=|date=March 2014|website=The Jackson Laboratory|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[CRISPR]] relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.

== TAL effector nuclease precision ==
The off-target activity of an active nuclease may lead to unwanted double-strand breaks and may consequently yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death.  Studies have been carried out to compare the relative nuclease-associated toxicity of available technologies.  Based on these studies &lt;ref name="Mussolino2011"/&gt; and the maximal theoretical distance between DNA binding and nuclease activity, TALEN constructs are believed to have the greatest precision of the currently available technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-New-Era-Precision-Gene-Editing-09Sept15.pdf|title = Boston Consulting Group - Report on Gene Editing Precision|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Boglioli|first = Elsy|last2 = Richard|first2 = Magali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit''' is a counter-argument to modern versions of the &lt;!--[surplus here?: [[William Paley|Paley]]-style --&gt; [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] for the [[existence of God]]. It was introduced by [[Richard Dawkins]] in chapter 4 of his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', "Why there almost certainly is no God".

The argument is a play on the notion of a "[[Junkyard tornado|tornado sweeping through a junkyard to assemble a Boeing 747]]" employed to decry [[abiogenesis]] and [[evolution]] as vastly unlikely and better explained by the existence of a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. According to Dawkins, this logic is self-defeating as the [[Theism|theist]] must now account for the god's existence and explain whether or how the god was created. In his view, if the existence of highly complex life on Earth is the equivalent of the implausible junkyard Boeing 747, the existence of a highly complex god is the "ultimate Boeing 747" that truly does require the seemingly impossible to explain its existence.

== Context and history ==
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|The "ultimate Boeing 747 gambit" was originally proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.]]
Richard Dawkins begins ''The God Delusion'' by making it clear that the God he talks about is the [[Abrahamic]] concept of a [[personal god]] who is susceptible to worship. He considers the existence of such an entity to be a scientific question, because a universe with such a god would be significantly different from a universe without one, and he says that the difference would be [[Empiricism|empirically]] discernible. Therefore, Dawkins concludes, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to the God hypothesis as to any other scientific question.

After discussing some of the most common arguments for the existence of God in chapter 3, Dawkins concludes that the [[argument from design]] is the most convincing. The extreme improbability of life and a universe capable of hosting it requires explanation, but Dawkins considers the God hypothesis inferior to [[evolution by natural selection]] as [[Evolution of biological complexity|an explanation for the complexity of life]]. As part of his efforts to refute [[intelligent design]], he redirects the [[Irreducible complexity|argument from complexity]] in order to show that God must have been designed by a superintelligent designer, then presents his argument for the improbability of God's existence.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arguing for Atheism |author=Michael Shermer |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/463 |volume=315 |issue=5811 |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |doi=10.1126/science.1138989 |pages=463 }} (also available via [http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 the second review here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210162827/http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 |date=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the "Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit". This is an allusion to the [[junkyard tornado]]. [[Astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]], who was a [[Darwinist]], [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] and advocate of the [[panspermia]] theory of life,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Collisions of debris as the vehicle for the distribution of biological material across space.&lt;/ref&gt; is reported as having stated that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="tgd113"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against empirically based theism date back at least as far as the eighteenth-century philosopher [[David Hume#Design argument|David Hume]], whose objection can be paraphrased as the question "[[Argument from design#Contradictory premises lead to an infinite regress|Who designed the designer?]]". According to philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], however –&amp;nbsp;one of Dawkins's fellow "[[Brights movement|brights]]"&amp;nbsp;– the innovation in Dawkins's argument is twofold: to show that where design fails to explain complexity, evolution by natural selection succeeds as the only workable solution; and to argue how this should illuminate the confusion surrounding the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The notion that "observations of the physical universe must be compatible with [[Consciousness|conscious]] and [[Sapience|sapient]] life that observes it" (see [[Anthropic principle]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dennett"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion |author=Daniel Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |journal=Free Inquiry |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=2006-10-16 |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/dawkinsreview.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dawkins's statement ==
&lt;!--This section heading linked below--&gt;

Dawkins summarizes his argument as follows;&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the references to "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|crane]]" and "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea#Skyhooks and cranes|skyhook]]" are to notions from Daniel Dennett's book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''.
{{Quotation |
# One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect, over the centuries, has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.
# The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made [[wikt:artefact|artefact&lt;!--UK SPELLING: please don't change (Dawkins is British)--&gt;]] such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, a spider or a person.
# The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable. We need a "crane", not a "skyhook"; for only a crane can do the business of working up gradually and plausibly from simplicity to otherwise improbable complexity.
# The most ingenious and powerful crane so far discovered is Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Darwin and his successors have shown how living creatures, with their spectacular statistical improbability and appearance of design, have evolved by slow, gradual degrees from simple beginnings. We can now safely say that the illusion of design in living creatures is just that{{spndash}}an illusion.
# We don't yet have an equivalent crane for physics. Some kind of multiverse theory could in principle do for physics the same explanatory work as Darwinism does for biology. This kind of explanation is superficially less satisfying than the biological version of Darwinism, because it makes heavier demands on luck. But the [[anthropic principle]] entitles us to postulate far more luck than our limited human intuition is comfortable with.
# We should not give up hope of a better crane arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology. But even in the absence of a strongly satisfying crane to match the biological one, the relatively weak cranes we have at present are, when abetted by the anthropic principle, self-evidently better than the self-defeating skyhook hypothesis of an intelligent designer.}}

A central thesis of the argument is that compared to supernatural abiogenesis, evolution by natural selection requires the supposition of fewer hypothetical processes; according to [[Occam's razor]], therefore, it is a better explanation. Dawkins cites a paragraph where [[Richard Swinburne]] agrees that a simpler explanation is better but reasons that theism is simpler because it only invokes a single &lt;!--[is "substance" sic?:]--&gt;substance (God) as a cause and maintainer of every other object. This cause is seen as [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and totally "free". Dawkins argues that an entity that monitors and controls every particle in the universe and listens to all thoughts and prayers cannot be simple. Its existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own. The theory of natural selection is much simpler –&amp;nbsp;and thus preferable&amp;nbsp;– than a theory of the existence of such a complex being.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins then turns to a discussion of [[Keith Ward]]'s views on [[divine simplicity]] to show the difficulty "the theological mind has in grasping where the complexity of life comes from." Dawkins writes that Ward is sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;eptical of [[Arthur Peacocke]]'s ideas that evolution is directed by other forces than only natural selection and that these processes may have a propensity toward increasing complexity. Dawkins says that this sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;epticism is justified, because complexity does not come from biased mutations. Dawkins writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Natural selection], as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. The theory of natural selection is genuinely simple. So is the origin from which it starts. That which it explains, on the other hand, is complex almost beyond telling: more complex than anything we can imagine, save a God capable of designing it.&lt;ref name="tgd151"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assessment and criticism ==

Theist authors have presented extensive opposition, most notably by theologian [[Alister McGrath]] (in ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]]'') and philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God Is Great, God Is Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX3tGSzi16AC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html |title=The Dawkins Confusion — Naturalism ad absurdum |work=Books &amp; Culture, a Christian Review |author=[[Alvin Plantinga]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

 --&gt; Another negative review, by biologist [[H. Allen Orr]], sparked heated debate, prompting, for example, the mathematician [[Norman Levitt]] to ask why theologians are assumed to have the exclusive right to write about who "rules" the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What a Friend We Have in Dawkins |author=Norman Levitt |work=eSkeptic |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-01-31.html |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] also took exception to Orr's review, leading to an exchange of open letters between himself and Orr.&lt;ref&gt;Full [http://www.edge.org/discourse/dennett_orr.html#dd exchange of open letters] at edge.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; The philosopher Sir [[Anthony Kenny]] also considers this argument to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], 2007 Presidential [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] Annual Lecture (published in ''Philosophy'' Volume 82 number 321 (July 2007), pp. 381-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; Cosmologist [[Stephen Barr]]&lt;ref name="Stephen M Barr 2003"&gt;Stephen M Barr (2003), ''Modern Physics and Ancient faith'' ({{ISBN|0-268-03471-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; responded as follows: "[[William Paley|Paley]] finds a [[Watchmaker analogy|watch and asks how]] such a thing could have come to be there by chance. Dawkins finds an immense automated factory that blindly constructs watches, and feels that he has completely answered Paley's point."&lt;ref&gt;Modern Physics and Ancient Faith Paperback – February 15, 2006 by Stephen M Barr&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplicity of God and materialist assumptions===
Both Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne raise the objection that God is not complex. Swinburne gives two reasons why a God that controls every particle can be simple: first, a person, as indicated by phenomena such as [[split-brain]]s, is not the same as their highly complex brain but "is something simpler" that can "control" that brain; and second, simplicity is a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality that is intrinsic]] to a hypothesis, not related to its empirical consequences.&lt;ref name="swinburne"/&gt;

Plantinga writes:
{{Quote
 | So first, according to classical theology, God is simple, not complex. More remarkable, perhaps, is that according to Dawkins's own definition of complexity, God is not complex. According to his definition (set out in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''), something is complex if it has parts that are "arranged in a way that is unlikely to have arisen by chance alone." But of course God is a spirit, not a material object at all, and hence has no parts. ''A fortiori'' (as philosophers like to say) God doesn't have parts arranged in ways unlikely to have arisen by chance. Therefore, given the definition of complexity Dawkins himself proposes, God is not complex."
}}
He continues:
{{Quote
 | "But second, suppose we concede, at least for purposes of argument, that God is complex. Perhaps we think the more a being knows, the more complex it is; God, being [[omniscient]], would then be highly complex. Given [[materialism]] and the idea that the ultimate objects in our universe are the elementary particles of physics, perhaps a being that knew a great deal would be improbable{{spndash}}how could those particles get arranged in such a way as to constitute a being with all that knowledge? Of course we aren't given materialism.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;
}}
In other words, Plantinga concludes that this argument, to be valid, would require materialism to be true; but, as materialism is not compatible with traditional theology,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} the argument [[Begging the question|begs the question]] by requiring its [[premise]] to assume God's non-existence.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;

In an extensive analysis published in ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'', Patrick Richmond suggests that "Dawkins is right to object to unexplained organised complexity in God" but that God is simply specified and lacks the sort of composition and limitations found in [physical] creatures; hence the theist can explain why nature exists without granting unexplained organised complexity or the extreme improbability of God.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Richmond, "Richard Dawkins's Darwinian Objection to Unexplained Complexity in God", ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'' Vol. 19 No. 2 (2007), pp. 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some respondents, such as [[Stephen Law]], have suggested that God is or would indeed be complex if responsible [[Creator deity|for creating]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustaining the universe]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fGJq04rUc ''The Strengths and Weaknesses of the God Delusion''] (YouTube).&lt;/ref&gt; God's omniscience would require the retention of and ability to use all knowledge. Concepts such as [[Kolmogorov complexity]] have also been used to argue that God is or would need to be complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omnisaffirmatioestnegatio.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/dawkins-and-the-ultimate-747-gambit/ ''Dawkins and the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of external explanations===
There are many variations on how to express this objection. [[William F. Vallicella]] holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when in search of an ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation.&lt;ref name="vallicella"&gt;[http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com/posts/1167878240.shtml Vallicella's discussion with] [[Erik Wielenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"&gt;[http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate The God Delusion Debate: Richard Dawkins vs John Lennox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625134059/http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate |date=25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Plantinga writes that when ''not'' in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over ''The God Delusion'', saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that you would still need to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt;

Alister McGrath suggests that the leap from the recognition of complexity to the assertion of improbability is problematic, as a [[theory of everything]] would be more complex than the theories it would replace, yet one would not conclude that it is less probable. Dawkins has responded to this point in his debate with Lennox and at other times, saying that while physics is hard to understand, fundamentally, unlike biology, it is simple.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt; McGrath then argues that probability is not relevant to the question of existence: life on earth is highly improbable and yet we exist. The important question in his view is not whether God is ''probable'', but whether God is ''actual''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dawkins Delusion?'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; In interviewing McGrath for ''The Root of All Evil'', Dawkins responds that the existence of life on Earth is indeed highly improbable, but this is exactly why a theory such as evolution is required to explain that improbability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6474278760369344626# Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews] (Google Video).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of God, Dawkins says, there is no such satisfactory explanation.

On the point of probability, Alvin Plantinga claims that if God is a [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]], as argued by classical theism, God is, by definition, maximally probable; thus an argument that there is no necessary being with the qualities attributed to God is required to demonstrate God's improbability.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Eric MacDonald has pointed out that theists assume the coherence of their position when they make arguments for God when, by Plantinga's standards, they would have to present an argument that the concept of God is not logically incoherent before discussing other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://choiceindying.com/2011/05/18/duking-it-out-over-the-god-delusion/ ''Duking it Out Over the God Delusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's objection would seem to apply to all atheist arguments that contend that God is improbable, such as evidential arguments about the [[problem of evil]] and the [[argument from nonbelief]]. But the reason why theists and atheists do not usually address this prior to making their arguments is because they want to go beyond merely discussing whether God is maximally probable or impossible.

===Dawkins's response to criticism in ''The God Delusion''===
Dawkins writes about his attendance at a conference in Cambridge sponsored by the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref name="tgd151"/&gt; where he challenged the theologians present to respond to the argument that a creator of a complex universe would have to be complex and improbable.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He reports the strongest response as the claim he was imposing a scientific [[epistemology]] on a question that lies beyond the realm of science. When theologians hold God to be simple, who is a scientist like Dawkins "to dictate to theologians that their God had to be complex?"&lt;ref name="tgd154"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins writes that he did not feel that those employing this "evasive" defence were being "wilfully dishonest", but that they were "defining themselves into an epistemological safe-zone where rational argument could not reach them because they had ''declared by fiat'' that it could not."&lt;ref name="tgd154"/&gt;

Theologians, Dawkins writes, demand that there be a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] named "God". Dawkins responds that it must have been a simple cause and contends that unless "God" is divested of its normal associations, it is not an appropriate name. Postulating a prime mover that is capable of indulging in intelligent design is, in Dawkins's opinion, "a total abdication of the responsibility to find an explanation"; instead, he seeks a "self-bootstrapping crane" ([[#Dawkins's statement|see above]]) that can "lift" the universe into more complex states. This, he states, does not necessitate a {{clarify-span|narrowly scientific|date=November 2014}} explanation, but does require a "crane" rather than a "skyhook" (''[[#Dawkins's statement|ibid.]]'') if it is to account for the complexity of the natural world.&lt;ref name="tgd155"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
