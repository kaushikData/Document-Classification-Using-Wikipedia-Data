'''Aldar Batorovich Tsydenzhapov''' ({{lang-ru|Алда́р Ба́торович Цыденжа́пов}}) was a [[conscription|conscript]] [[seaman]] of the destroyer [[:ru:Быстрый (эсминец, 1987)|''Bystry'']] of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Russian Pacific Fleet]] who was the only fatal victim of a fire that broke out on the destroyer on 28 September 2010.

==Biography==
Aldar Tsydenzhapov was born August 4, 1991, in [[Aginskoye, Zabaykalsky Krai|Aginskoye]], [[Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug]]. He was the youngest in the family, along with his twin sister Aruna, and had an older brother, Bulat, and sister, Irina.&lt;ref name="chita"&gt;[http://chita.rfn.ru/rnews.html?id=28710 В честь погибшего героя Алдара Цыденжапова назовут улицу] — «Россия», 06.10.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Bator Tsydenzhapov, is a retired law enforcement employee, and mother, Biligma Tsydenzhapova, is a kindergarten nurse. After graduating from the hometown middle school № 1 in 2009, Tsydenzhapov was called up to military service in November and transferred to the military unit № 40074 of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]], stationed in [[Fokino, Primorsky Krai]].&lt;ref name="baikal2"&gt;[http://www.baikal-daily.ru/news/20/15522/?sphrase_id=284495 Геройски погибший матрос из Агинского будет представлен к Ордену Мужества] — «Байкал-Daily», 05.10.2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aldar received this honor for an act of bravery committed on 28 September 2010. He  extinguished a fire that broke out on the destroyer "Bystry" and was the only fatal victim.
The fuel pipeline had burst in the engine room before the destroyer "Bystry" left the harbor, and fuel under high pressure surged into the engine room. There were five seamen at that moment. The fire broke out due to an unintentional spark, smoke engulfing the room. One of the mechanics on the engine room team, Aldar, responded first in the emergency situation. He rushed with a wrench to close the water supply to the boiler, thereby preventing potential disastrous explosion of the power station. The valve was located in the epicenter of the fire. He was badly burned and while beginning to lose consciousness he left engine room by himself.
He performed his duty in about 9 seconds under conditions in which a person can not do anything. 19 year old Aldar was severely burned and died 4 day later.
His act of bravery will forever be part of the history of the Russian Navy. He sacrificed himself in order to save the 300 members crew and the battleship. His name will forever be in the crew member list of the destroyer "Bystry" and his bed will be forever perfectly made and untouchable.

[[File:SFrancisOuroPreto-CCBY.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Church of the Third Order of St Francis in Ouro Preto. The façade is the work of Aleijadinho.]]

'''Aleijadinho''' (born '''Antônio Francisco Lisboa'''; 1730 or 1738 – November 18, 1814) was a [[Colonial Brazil]]-born [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[architect]], noted for his works on and in various [[Church (building)|churches]] of Brazil.

Born in Vila Rica (Rich Town), whose name was later changed to [[Ouro Preto]] (Black Gold), [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil, in 1738 (sometimes said to be in 1730) he was the son of Manuel Francisco da Costa Lisboa, a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] man and his [[Africa]]n slave, Isabel.  His father, a [[carpenter]], had immigrated to Brazil where his skills were so in demand that he appears to have been elevated to the position of architect. When Antônio was young his father married and he was raised in his father's home along with his half siblings. It was there he is presumed to have learned the fundamentals of [[sculpture]], [[architecture]] and the combination of the two. Antônio first appears as a day laborer working on the Church of Our Lady of Carmel in the town of Ouro Preto, a church designed by his father.

[[File:Aleijadinho3.jpg|thumb|250px|right|St. Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata, façade of the St Francis church of Ouro Preto.]] Within a very short time he had become a noted architect himself and had designed and constructed the [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|Chapel of the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi]] in Ouro Preto. He had also executed the carvings on the building, the most notable being a round [[bas-relief]] depicting [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] receiving the [[stigmata]].

In 1777 he began to show signs of a debilitating disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.starnews2001.com.br/biograficos.html |title=Rodrigo José Ferreira Bretas, "Traços Biográficos Relativo Ao Finado Antônio Francisco Lisboa, Distinto Escultor Mineiro Mais Conhecido Pelo Apelido De Aleijadinho." |access-date=2013-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616202233/http://www.starnews2001.com.br/biograficos.html |archive-date=2012-06-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; probably [[leprosy]] or possibly [[scleroderma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18854887 | volume=60 | title=[Could Aleijadinho have suffered from scleroderma] | journal=Reumatismo | pages=230–3 | last1 = Azevedo | first1 = VF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he received the name "'''o Aleijadinho'''", "The Little Cripple." Although disfigured and disabled, [[Brazilian folklore|popular belief holds]] that he continued sculpting with a chisel and hammer tied to his fingerless hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galeano|first=Eduardo|title=Open Veins of Latin America|year=1997|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-85345-991-0|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually he became more and more reclusive, working mostly at night. When he did go out in public, he would be carried through the streets in a covered [[palanquin]] by his slaves/assistants.

==The Twelve Prophets at Congonhas==
His crowning achievement was the [[Twelve Prophets of Aleijadinho|''Twelve Prophets'']] at the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos at [[Congonhas]].  A wealthy businessman, Feliciano Mendes, had built the church to fulfill a vow made while he was desperately ill.  Between 1800 and 1805 Aleijadinho sculpted the twelve [[soapstone]] figures by having his assistants strap his hammer and chisels to what remained of his hands, which did not at this point include fingers. Since he no longer had feet to stand on he had pads strapped to his knees up which he would climb the ladders needed to get him off the ground.  The Twelve Prophets are arranged around the [[courtyard]] and stairway in front of the church.

==The Passion Figures at Congonhas==
[[File:Aleijadinho- Pavilion, Congonhas.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Pavilion, Congonhas]]
At the bottom of the stairs is a long courtyard that is bounded by half a dozen pavilions.  In each of the pavilions is a scene from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. There are sixty-six life-sized figures carved in wood from 1780 to 1790, beginning with the Last Supper and ending with the Crucifixion. The main figures, [[Christ]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint James the Great|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], the Good and Bad thieves, [[Mary Magdalene]], and [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] are carved by Aleijadinho while the other figures, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers, on-lookers and lesser figures were carved by his assistants.  The figures were later painted by [[Manoel da Costa Ataíde]], who also painted (1828) the ceiling of Lisboa's [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|Church of Saint Francis of Assisi]] in Ouro Preto. One of the figures watching the [[crucifixion]] is believed to be a portrait (or [[self-portrait]]) of Aleijadinho.

Melo (see [[Aleijadinho#Sources|sources]]) writes that the prevailing religious ideals at that time were, "associated with the ideas of pain, acceptance of suffering and reflection on the passion of Christ through visual reminders of His wounds."

He died on November 18, 1814, and was buried in the Church of Our Lady of Conception of Antonio Dias under a wooden floor section with his name carved on it.

==Controversy==
'''Against:''' There is some debate as to whether Aleijadinho actually existed. The theory that Aleijadinho was a myth was proposed by [[Augusto de Lima, Jr.]], who suggested that Aleijadinho was invented by [[Rodrigo Bretas]] in his 1951 book "Traços biográficos de Antônio Francisco Lisboa". This theory relies on the notion that there were no references to Aleijadinho until this book was published.

Recently published research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=De Grammont
|first=Guiomar
|year=2008
|title=O Aleijadinho e o Aeroplano
|publisher=Editora Civilização Brasileira
|isbn=978-85-200-0826-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; further challenges the traditional biography of the artist. Faced with the lack of documentary evidence, the author identifies Antônio Francisco Lisboa as a poor sculptor in 18th century [[Ouro Preto|Vila Rica]] (Ouro Preto's original name), but not a victim of the deformities that would have earned him the nickname. His work, of much smaller scope than usually attributed, had to be confined to Ouro Preto and surrounding areas, where he lived all of his life. There is no evidence for his work as an architect and even his parentage is in doubt. Instead, [[Guiomar de Grammont]] proposes the figure of a talented maker of religious imagery, a trade possibly shared with other artisans in the same workshop. In her interpretation, the Aleijadinho myth was created by the [[Rodrigo Bretas]] biography and reinforced over time by modernist intellectuals who saw in this character a symbolic founder of an indigenous Brazilian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gonçalves Filho, Antonio. [http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20090104/not_imp302138,0.php "Aleijadinho, um Mito"], ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'', 2008-01-04. Retrieved on 2008-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supporting:''' Doubts about Aleijadinho's actual existence have been countered by evidence brought up by researcher Felicidade Patrocínio, who listed over 30 documented works, including the masterpieces on which his fame was built: the 12 apostles and the cycle of the Via Crucis at the Sanctuary of Matosinhos. Who else could have created them?&lt;ref&gt;Patrocínio, Felicidade. "A Presença Artística de Antônio Francisco Lisboa, o Aleijadinho".

Towards 1880, Anna Larroucau introduced in [[San Martín, Mendoza|San Martin]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], the first plants of [[grapevine]] of French origin, which she had brought from [[Bordeaux]], France. In all of Mendoza grapevines of Spanish or Italian origins were slowly replaced by these new ones of French origin, providing an improved performance and an optimization of wine.
On July 27, 1887 in [[San Martín, Mendoza|San Martin]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], she married Leopoldo Lucero Rincons, a famous farm and cousin of the governor of the neighbor Province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]], General Brigadier [[Pablo Lucero]]. The couple Lucero Larroucau will give rise to an important lineage in all of Argentina.
Towards 1900 Anna Larroucau, already widow, founded the First Company of Charity of San Martín, Mendoza. During decades she ran the association. Through this institution, she worked for the well-being and the education of childhood in that region of Argentina.

'''Augustine Birrell''' [[King's Counsel|KC]] (19 January 1850{{snd}}20 November 1933) was a British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician, who was [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] from 1907 to 1916. In this post, he was praised for enabling tenant farmers to own their property, and for extending university education for Catholics. But he was criticised for failing to take action against the rebels before the [[Easter Rising]], and resigned. A barrister by training, he was also an author, noted for humorous essays.

==Early life==
Birrell was born in [[Wavertree]], near [[Liverpool]], the son of The Rev. Charles Mitchell Birrell (1811-1880), a Scottish [[Baptist]] minister. He was educated at [[Amersham Hall]] school and at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] where he was made an Honorary [[Fellow]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BRL870A|name=Birrell, Augustine}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Sylvan Debating Club]] in 1872.  He started work in a solicitor's office in Liverpool&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Jackson, ''Augustine Birrell'' in Brack et al. (eds.) ''Dictionary of Liberal Biography''; Politico's, 1998 pp 42&lt;/ref&gt; but was [[called to the Bar]] in 1875, becoming a [[King's Counsel|KC]] in 1893 and a [[Bencher]] of the [[Inner Temple]] in 1903.&lt;ref name="Who was Who, OUP 2007"&gt;''Who was Who'', OUP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; From 1896 to 1899 he was Professor of Comparative Law at [[University College, London]].&lt;ref name=" b11"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Birrell, Augustine|volume=3|pages=989–990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''The Chief Secretary: Augustine Birrell in Ireland'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1969 pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 Birrell served as [[Lord Rector of Glasgow University]].&lt;ref name="Who was Who, OUP 2007"/&gt;

His first wife, Margaret Mirrielees, died in 1879, only a year after their marriage, and in 1888 he married Eleanor Tennyson, daughter of the poet [[Frederick Locker-Lampson]] and widow of Lionel Tennyson, son of the poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name=" b11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, one of whom, [[Francis Birrell|Frankie]] (1889–1935) was later a journalist and critic and associated with the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. Birrell found success as a writer with the publication of a volume of essays entitled ''Obiter Dicta'' in 1884. This was followed by a second series of ''Obiter Dicta'' in 1887 and ''Res Judicatae'' in 1892. These, despite their titles, were not concerned with law, but he also wrote books on [[copyright]] and on [[Trust law|trust]]s. Birrell wrote, and spoke, with a characteristic humour which became known as ''birrelling''.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into politics==
[[File:1895_Augustine_Birrell.jpg|thumb|right|Augustine Birrell c1895]] 
After unsuccessfully contesting parliamentary seats in [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool, Walton]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885]] and [[Widnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Widnes]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886]], Birrell was elected to parliament for [[West Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|West Fife]] at a by-election in 1889, as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]].&lt;ref name="Jackson43"&gt;Jackson, ''Augustine Birrell'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his seat in the general elections of 1892 and 1895, but in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|general election of 1900]] he stood in [[Manchester North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North East]] and was defeated. In 1903 he edited ''Eight Years of Tory Government'', a "handbook for the use of Liberals", which attacked the incumbent Conservative administration's record on issues such as housing and worker's compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Birrell|editor1-first=Augustine|title=Eight Years of Tory Government, 1895-1903|date=1903|publisher=The Liberal Publication Department|url=https://archive.org/stream/eightyearstoryg00birrgoog#page/n8/mode/2up|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was returned for [[Bristol North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol North]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]], in which the Liberals won a large majority, and was included in the cabinet of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] as [[President of the Board of Education]].&lt;ref name=" b11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1905, he was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27862 |date=8 December 1905 |page=8892 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Campbell-Bannerman, Birrell belonged to the [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] tradition of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Duncan|title=Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521530538|page=45|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XWGuS25msYC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell also belonged to a group called the "New Radicals" or "New Liberals", which also included [[H. H. Asquith]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|R. B. Haldane]] and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Day|first1=Alan|title=Reactions to Irish Nationalism, 1865-1914|date=1987|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0826421173|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuBNO4XIu9oC&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell introduced the Education Bill 1906, intended to address [[nonconformism|nonconformist]] grievances arising from the [[Education Act 1902]]. It passed the Liberal dominated [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] comfortably, but the [[House of Lords]], with a Conservative majority, amended it with wrecking amendments to such an extent that it undermined the liberal ethos of the bill. This use of wrecking amendments and dilatory parliamentary procedures concerning the education bill ushered in a period of political tension between the Commons and Lords which ultimately concluded with the Constitutional Crises of 1909-11 with the People's Budget. Birrell was the first victim of these tactics with the bill was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Havighurst, Alfred F., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Nhq1g1WYmEC&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Britain in Transition: The Twentieth Century]'', University of Chicago Press, 1985, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; With the bill defeated, it made it impossible for Birrell to continue in his post, and in January 1907 he was appointed [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], to replace [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] who had been made Ambassador to the United States. While serving in government, Birrell supported a number of progressive measures and proposals such as expanded housing provisions, land reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/articles/new-land-purchase-bill-before-house-of-commons |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919115300/http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/articles/new-land-purchase-bill-before-house-of-commons |archivedate=19 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and substantial increases in educational spending at both primary and secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/mar/02/education-provision-of-meals-bill#S4V0152P0_19060302_HOC_63 | title=EDUCATION (PROVISION OF MEALS) BILL. (Hansard, 2 March 1906)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birrell and Women's Suffrage==
Like many of his political colleagues and members of the general public, Birrell strongly disapproved of the [[Militant (word)|militancy]] and violence of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU; suffragettes). In November 1910, when walking alone from the House of Commons, he was set upon by a group of about twenty suffragettes who had recognised him. While he did not believe there was any serious attempt to injure him, in trying to escape he twisted his knee and "slipped the knee-cap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosen |first1=Andrew |title=Rise Up, Women!: The Militant Campaign of the Women's Social and Political Union, 1903-1914 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1136247545 |page=143 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5XurnRG_BAC&amp;pg=PA143 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. P. Scott]] wrote in his diary that Birrell feared he might require an operation to remove his knee-cap and joked that, if he did, he would remain 'a weak-kneed politician' to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Trevor |editor-last=Wilson |title=The Political Diaries of C P Scott: 1911–1928 |publisher=Collins|date=1970 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell was, however, described by the paper ''[[Votes for Women (newspaper)|Votes for Women]]'' as one of a number of "Suffragist members of the Cabinet" who met with a deputation from the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS), led by [[Millicent Fawcett]], on 8 August 1913, following a similar meeting by the NUWSS with Prime Minister Asquith on the same day. According to ''Votes for Women'', ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the ministers asked the deputation what kind of bill the NUWSS was looking for. Other ministers present included [[Lloyd George]], [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], [[Francis Dyke Acland]] and [[McKinnon Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002187/19130815/022/0004#|title=Deputation received by other ministers|pages=664–5|date=15 August 1913|work=Votes for Women|subscription=yes|access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chief Secretary for Ireland==
===Council Bill, Universities Bill and Land Bill===
[[File:Augustine Birrell Vanity Fair 18 January 1906.jpg|left|thumb|Birrell caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1906]]
Birrell's first [[Under-Secretary for Ireland|Under-Secretary]] and head of Irish Civil Service at [[Dublin Castle administration]] was Sir [[Antony MacDonnell]], who had worked successfully with a previous Chief Secretary, [[George Wyndham]], on the [[Irish Land Acts#Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act 1903|Land Purchase Act 1903]]. MacDonnell was a well known advocate for Home Rule. MacDonnell's proposals for what was called "[[devolution]]" – the transfer of local powers to Ireland under a central authority – adopted by the [[Irish Reform Association]]'s - had encountered strong opposition from [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], leading eventually to Wyndham's resignation. This proposal ultimately passed from Sir James Bryce with Birrell inheriting the bill. Birrell modified MacDonnell's proposal and on 7 May 1907 introduced the [[Irish Council Bill]]. The bill was initially welcomed by [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist]] leaders [[John Redmond]] and [[John Dillon]], and opposed, for different reasons, by unionists and by more radical nationalists who wanted nothing less than [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]] for Ireland. At a convention of the [[United Irish League]], opposition was so strong that Redmond changed his position; the convention rejected the bill and the government was unable to proceed with it.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell suffered further embarrassment when he sought to discontinue the use of the [[Irish Coercion Act|Irish Crimes Act 1887]], a coercive measure introduced by [[Arthur Balfour]] to deal with agrarian crime, only to be faced with an increase in cattle-driving.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; Another affair, in which Birrell was not directly involved but for which he had to take part of the blame, was the theft of the [[Irish Crown Jewels]] from [[Dublin Castle]] (where the Chief Secretary had his offices) in July 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Birrell had more success in areas such as Education and the Irish land question. His excellent relations with both Roman Catholic and Protestant church leaders such as Archbishop of Dublin [[William Walsh (archbishop of Dublin)|William Walsh]] ensured the successful passage of the Irish Universities Bill 1908, which established the [[National University of Ireland]] and [[Queen's University Belfast]] and dissolved the [[Royal University of Ireland]]. It solved the sectarian problem in higher education by dividing the Protestant and Catholic traditions into their own separate spheres and ensured Catholic, Nationalist scholars had access to university education.&lt;ref name="Jackson43"/&gt; Contemporaries also praised his achievement in carrying the ''Land Purchase (Ireland) Act (1909)'', which though falling far short in its financial provisions allowed for [[Eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]] of large areas of land for the relief of congestion, through a hostile House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 20–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Rule Bill===
[[File:Augustine Birrell - Project Gutenberg eText 13220.png|thumb|200px|right|Sketch of Augustine Birrell]]
After the passing, with the support of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the Lords to veto bills, Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] introduced the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] on 16 April 1912. The Unionists, led in Ireland by [[Edward Carson]] and in Britain by Tory leader [[Bonar Law]], formed a private army, the [[Ulster Volunteers]], to resist enforcement of the act,&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; and Carson proposed an amendment excluding [[Ulster]] from the scope of the bill. Birrell was opposed to the exclusion of any part of the country and when [[David Lloyd George]] proposed a compromise involving the exclusion of six of the nine counties of Ulster for a period of five to six years Birrell responded by offering his resignation. Historian [[Ronan Fanning]], in a newspaper article, has described him as "the arch hypocrite" because of his public criticisms of such exclusion proposals, but private acceptance of same.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan Fanning, [http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/why-commemorating-the-home-rule-bill-would-be-unwise-1.1898370 "Why commemorating the Home Rule Bill would be unwise"], ''Irish Times'', 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was rejected by both Unionists and Nationalists and Birrell stayed on.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by that stage Lloyd George had effectively replaced Birrell as the Liberal government's negotiator in the Home Rule discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Jalland, ''The liberals and Ireland: the Ulster question in British politics to 1914'', Harvester Press, Brighton, 1980, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The crisis continued through 1913 and into 1914. The bill was introduced for a third time in July 1914, this time along with an amending bill allowing for the exclusion of some of the Ulster counties,&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; but with the outbreak of [[World War I]] the bill was passed without further debate, with its implementation suspended until after the war. However, on the collapse of Asquith's Liberal-dominated government in May 1915 and its replacement with a coalition involving Carson, the implementation of Home Rule at any stage became moot.&lt;ref name="EB1922"&gt;{{Cite EB1922|title=Birrell, Augustine|volume=30|page=460|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri30chisrich#page/460/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War===
In the latter part of 1915 Birrell was one of those Liberal ministers (others being [[Reginald McKenna]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]), [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] ([[President of the Board of Trade]]) and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] ([[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]])) who were unhappy at the realignment of Britain’s war effort towards conscription, total war and a massive commitment of troops to the Western Front, as advocated by the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[Archibald Murray]]. However, none of these joined [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] ([[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]]) in resigning in protest at the conscription of bachelors, due to be [[Military Service Act 1916|enacted in January 1916]]. However, Birrell wrote to the Prime Minister (29 December) criticizing Murray and arguing that he and Runciman agreed that finance and strategic policy were more important than conscription. Conscription was only applied in Britain, not Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Guinn 1965 pp.126-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easter Rising===
A further threat to Birrell's administration had arisen with the formation in November 1913 of the [[Irish Volunteers]], ostensibly to safeguard Home rule but in fact, under the influence of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) aiming to break the union with Britain altogether. Feelings in nationalist Ireland were further aroused by the possibility of conscription. Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], Birrell's Under-Secretary since October 1914, told him in September 1915 that the [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Nationalist Party]] was losing ground in the country and that extreme nationalists, often referred to as ''Sinn Féiners'', were gaining support. Nathan took measures such as suppressing newspapers and forcing Irish Volunteer organisers to leave the country. The Irish Party leaders, Redmond and Dillon, cautioned against taking direct action against the 'Sinn Féiners' and the administration kept to that policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell himself felt that the danger of a bomb outrage was greater than that of an insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; His assessment was proved wrong when the [[Easter Rising]] began on 24 April 1916.

Birrell had spent Easter in London, where Nathan had telegraphed him with news of the capture and scuttling of the arms ship the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Sir [[Roger Casement]]. He had just sent approval for the arrest of the movement's leaders on Easter Monday morning when he was told by [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Viscount French]], Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Forces, that the Rising had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained contact with Nathan by telegraph and answered questions in Parliament on Tuesday and Wednesday, then travelled by destroyer to Dublin, arriving in the early hours of Thursday morning. From there he wrote to the Prime Minister, giving him his assessment of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, ''The Chief Secretary'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters he wrote that he 'couldn't go on'. On 1 May, the day after the Rising ended, Asquith accepted his resignation 'with infinite regret'.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1970, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; This regret was also felt by both Nationalist and Unionist politicians in Patliament. While some, such as [[Lawrence Ginnell]] celebrated his departure, both [[John Redmond]] and [[Sir Edward Carson]] praised the work Birrell completed during his time as chief secretary. Others, such as the Irish civil servant, Sir Henry Robinson, also praised the work Birrell completed and highlighted in his memoirs the number of Acts of Parliament Birrell was responsible for. However, The [[Royal Commission]] on the 1916 Rebellion (the [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Hardinge]] commission) was critical of Birrell and Nathan, in particular their failure to take action against the rebels in the weeks and months before the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle &amp; the 1916 Rising'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Birrell acknowledged in his memoirs that he did not stoutly defend himself in front of the commission. However, it should be noted that the commission did understand that Birrell was confined to London due to his cabinet and parliamentary duties between 1914 and 1916.

==Personal life==
[[File:Augustine Birrell; Katharine Frances Asquith (née Horner); Anthony Birrell by Lady Ottoline Morrell (borderless).jpg|right|thumb|Birrell with his son Anthony and Katharine Asquith]]
While Birrell's first phase as Chief Secretary was a clear success, the period from about 1912 onwards saw something of a decline in Birrell's career which was also mirrored in his domestic life. Birrell's 2nd wife Eleanor had been suffering from an inoperable brain tumour and this eventually caused her to lose her sanity. This affected Birrell deeply, privately and publicly, but he did not tell his political colleagues, who were simply given to understand that she did not care for social life. There were two sons of the marriage Francis and Anthony.

The quality of his public work deteriorated and as one historian has noted the severe personal strain must have been a contributory factor in "...the uncharacteristic combination of excessive zeal and indecision which marked [Birrell's] response to the Dublin industrial agitation of 1913".&lt;ref&gt;Pat Jalland, ''Augustine Birrell'' in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004–08&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Eleanor died in 1915 did Birrell begin to regain some of his old energy and effectiveness as a minister.

==Later life==
Birrell did not defend his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], nor did he ever return to Ireland. In 1929, he accepted an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, but storms in the Irish Sea prevented him from making the crossing and he had to receive his degree in absentia.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to literature with a further volume of essays and book reviews, ''More Obiter Dicta'' (1920) and a book on his father-in-law, [[Frederick Locker-Lampson]].&lt;ref name="EB1922"/&gt; He died in London on 20 November 1933, aged eighty-three. His autobiography, ''Things Past Redress'' was published posthumously.

'''Bruce Barrymore Halpenny''' (born 1937 in [[Caistor]], [[Lincolnshire]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[military historian]] and [[author]], specialising in [[airfield]]s and [[aircraft]], as well as ghost stories and mysteries.  He is also a [[Television presenter|broadcaster]]&lt;ref name="FT-21-1989"&gt;''Framlington Times'' - Journal of the [[390th Strategic Missile Wing|390th Bomb Group]] Memorial Air Museum – ISSUE 21, September, 1989 - page24&lt;/ref&gt; and [[games inventor]].

==Parents==
Halpenny's father was a Canadian [[First World War]] soldier who fought at [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], and his mother a British First World War munitions worker from [[Lincolnshire]]. Bruce is from Lincolnshire, England.&lt;ref name="FT-21-1989"/&gt;

==Military career==
Halpenny served in the [[Royal Air Force Police]] (RAFP) in specialist units, often overseas,&lt;ref name=NEP-28-03-1981&gt;''Wartime airfields live again ...''' - [[Nottingham Evening Post]] - 28 March 1981&lt;/ref&gt; but after being wounded, and instead of coming out of the RAF, he moved across to the RAF Police on Special Security Duties (Atomic &amp; Chemical Weapons), and was part of a special RAF [[military police]] unit on Special Duties and in the [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]] Division,&lt;ref name= "NEP-28-03-1981"/&gt; that was responsible for the protection of the nuclear weapons that the [[V bomber]]s were to use in time of [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Avro Vulcan Adventure'' - ANZIO - 2007 - {{ISBN|978-0-9547774-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
In the 1950s whilst in the Royal Air Force, he was wounded and had to undergo several operations, in which his life was in the balance as dedicated surgeons fought to not only save his hand and arm, but also his life.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  In rehabilitation, he started writing and research as a hobby, and though he stayed in the RAF and was to serve on Special Duties&lt;ref&gt;''Fame at last for old Myfanwy'' - [[Daily Mirror]] - Thursday, 12 April 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]] Division, his hobby turned into a profession in later years after leaving the forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Author wants to preserve airfield'' –[[The Press (York)|Yorkshire Evening Press]] – Saturday, 6 March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
In the early period of his writing career, he started out by writing love stories and cowboy stories for the American market under pen names.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Then, because of his specialist knowledge of the Royal Air Force, he focused on military history, especially RAF history of World War Two, often with deep insights, facts and personal human interest stories.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamburg Raid 1943'' – ''WAR monthly'' – September 1981 - pages 14–17&lt;/ref&gt;  At one time, he was writing articles for up to 14 military journals around the world, when he was approached by the publishers Patrick Stephens to do the Airfield books due to his vast knowledge and authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Military history===
When he researched the British RAF airfield histories, particularly those of [[London]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]], Halpenny found that [[public records]] held very little, if any, information at all, so he had to do all the research himself going back to the very beginning. This helped to unearth a rich source of information, which others have since used, but set Bruce Halpenny as an undisputed RAF expert.&lt;ref&gt;''Reaching for the skies'' – Lincolnshire Standard – Friday, 21 February 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  For his research on the airfields, Halpenny interviewed 1,400 people, researched records and letters, and travelled thousands of miles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Bruce sends airfield mayday'' – [[The Northern Echo]] – Friday, 5 March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  Such was Halpenny's dedication to the history of the airfields that he visited each and every airfield, (some of which he had prior knowledge of from his military days), to ensure accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;''Where war wings come home to roost'' – [[Nottingham Post|Evening Post]] – Wednesday, 6 May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

His books quickly became essential reference books for all aviation historians.&lt;ref&gt;''Recalling airfields in the bomber county'' – [[Lincolnshire Echo]] – Friday, 3 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all of the information was new, in the sense that it hadn't appeared in the dozens of books which had been written about the RAF, new too were the many photographs that were just a selection of the thousands he collected and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;''When Gable went to war – in Lincs.'' – [[Grimsby Telegraph|Grimsby Evening Telegraph]] – Wednesday, 8 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Such were his photographs and uniqueness, and the way that he used them, that in the opening chapters of his book ''Action Stations 2 Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands'', were a selection of control tower photos – this was the first time this had been done in any book.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Bookshelf'' – ''Action Stations 2 Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands'' – ''Air Pictorial'' – September 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also written various military themed books from such as ''English Electrical/BAC Lightning'' to Wartime Poems.&lt;ref&gt;''The aviators' timeless anthem'' – Peter Tory on Friday – [[Daily Express]] – Friday, 18 January 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft he has specialised in are the British jets, [[English Electric Lightning]], [[English Electric Canberra]] and [[Avro Vulcan]].

===Ghosts and mysteries===
Halpenny had been writing [[ghost story|ghost stories]] in the 1960s, and encountering ghost stories in his exhaustive research into airfield histories, when in 1984 he decided they should form the subject of a special book, and so started to add to, and research his 'ghost-mystery' files about abandoned airfields that murmur and whisper with ghosts.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghosts of the old airfields'' – [[Daily Mirror]] – Thursday, 16 August 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Halpenny had by 1984 become acknowledged as not only a respected [[British people|British]] [[military historian]], expert in [[airfield]] histories, but also the expert in RAF Ghosts, especially surrounding airfields.&lt;ref name=Titbits &gt;''Ghosts of War'' – by Ken Livemore - ''[[Titbits]]'' – Summer Special 1984, pages 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ghost Stations]] was born, and in 1986 the first book was published, and proved a best seller as it recounts how "headless airmen and other spectres have appeared in control towers and other Service buildings throughout the country".&lt;ref&gt;''BOOKS'' – ''Ghostly deeds'' – Steve Anderson – [[Hull Daily Mail]] – Friday, 14 November 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Such was demand that a second book entitled, ''Aaargh!'' was published with over 30 stories, one of which was ''The eerie mystery of Lightning 894''.&lt;ref&gt;''The eerie mystery of Lightning 894'' – [[Grimsby Telegraph|Grimsby Evening Telegraph]] – Friday, 9 September 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Aaargh!, was later to become ''Ghost Stations 2'', as more books later followed over the years, and became the cult series of ''[[Ghost stations|Ghost Stations]]'' books.

Halpenny's unique knowledge and position means he is also known for accessing and finding information generally closed to the general public and media, especially [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) material concerning UFOs.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmic Crashes'' (hardcover - {{ISBN|978-0-684-85829-6}}) by [[Nick Redfern|Nicholas Redfern]] ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]]) page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Halpenny has always maintained that all airfields are haunted.&lt;ref&gt;''Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore'' – [[Ghost Stations]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, he had uncovered a wealth of material about ghostly experiences on wartime airfields.&lt;ref name= "Titbits"/&gt;  "The evidence of ghosts keeps popping up and is so rich that it cannot be ignored," he said&lt;ref name= "Titbits"/&gt; and he has little doubt why airfields are such a magnet for ghosts, "You have to remember that 55,000 men of Bomber Command died while operating from Britain in World War Two, and almost all of them met a violent end, so it isn't surprising that dozens of earthbound spirits have been left behind."&lt;ref name= "Titbits"/&gt;

==Games inventor==
Halpenny is also a games inventor, and created [[The Great Train Robbery (board game)|The Great Train Robbery board game]] in the 1970s.  It was used as a prize on shows such as [[Tiswas]] and [[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anzio.co.uk/Anzio_board_games.html ANZIO Board Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charities, causes and animal rights==
Halpenny has always been vocal in his campaigns for numerous organisations and causes, especially concerning [[veteran]]s, [[war widow]]s, wounded and invalided servicemen &amp; women.  He has also helped schools&lt;ref name=LE-08-06-1981&gt;''School Action Stations'' - [[Lincolnshire Echo]] - Monday, 8 June 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and children's charities such as [[Mencap]], in campaigning and highlighting issues, and even in one case when he donated a vintage bottle of wine to help raise funds. The bottle was unique in that it was the last bottle remaining after the Nazis had plundered the cellars of families living in an Italian [[Abruzzo]] village in [[World War II]]. The author's uncle was a Canadian [[tank commander]] whose [[tank]] was the first to liberate the village, and was also the first tank to enter [[Ortona]] in the [[Battle of Ortona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abruzzo.tv.it/guerra_page.asp?ID=9 Regione Abruzzo. Servizio Sviluppo del Turismo - 1943/44: War in Abruzzo - Acknowledgements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055800/http://www.abruzzo.tv.it/guerra_page.asp?ID=9 |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bottle was given to the author, as he lived in Abruzzo&lt;ref name=LaSveglia-2-10-1971&gt;''Come la vedo io ... e grazie'' – ''La Sveglia'' - Periodico Indipendente Ortonese – ANNO XI - N. VIII - 2 Ottobre 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and his research work had taken to that area.&lt;ref name=LE-1987&gt;''Help us to uncork the wine mystery for Mencap fund'' – [[Lincolnshire Echo]] – Wednesday, 19 August 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Halpenny said on donating the bottle:&lt;ref name="LE-1987"/&gt;

{{quote|Because the bottle is unique, it seemed a waste to just drink it without using it to gain some benefit for others.}}

He has also long campaigned for the Government to do their part and preserve a 1939-45 War airfield in its original condition; to let future generations see how the RAF operated during those dark days.

{{quote|If something isn't done to preserve one of them soon, we'll get to the silly situation where one is built from scratch as a memorial to the RAF's effort in the last war.|Bruce Barrymore Halpenny&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

He has also long been a supporter for animal welfare, especially dogs and wolves, and is the president of the [[Wolf Preservation Foundation]].

{{contains Burmese text}}
'''Burmese names''' lack the serial structure of most modern names. The [[Bamars]] have no customary [[patronymic]] or [[matronymic]] system and thus there is no [[surname]] at all. In the [[culture of Myanmar]], people can change their name at will, often with no government oversight, to reflect a change in the course of their lives. Also, many Burmese names use an [[honorific]], given at some point in life, as an integral part of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/195802/burma-names "Burmese Names: A Guide". [[Mi Mi Khaing]]. ''The Atlantic''. February 1958]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional and Western-style names==
Burmese names were originally one syllable, as in the cases of [[U Nu]] and [[U Thant]] ("U" being an honorific). In the mid-20th century, many Burmese started using two syllables, albeit without any formal structure. In the late 1890s, British scholars observed that [[Rakhine people|Rakhines]] commonly adopted three-syllable names whereas Bamars were still using one or two at most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houghton|first=Bernard|date=July 1897|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|pages=454|jstor=25207880|title=The Arakanese Dialect of the Burman Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they become more familiar with Western culture, Burmese people are gradually increasing the number of syllables in their children's names, by use of various structures. Today, names with up to four syllables are common for males and up to five for females.

Scholars such as [[Thant Myint-U]] have argued that the rise of complex Burmese personal names resulted from the collapse of the Burmese monarchy, which ended the sophisticated system of Pali-Burmese styles, crown service and gentry titles, leaving the majority of Burmese with single-syllable names.&lt;ref name="tmu"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thant Myint-U|title=The Making of Modern Burma|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|pages=242|isbn=9780521799140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former titles, such as ''min'' ({{my|မင်း}}; "leader") were re-appropriated as part of personal names.&lt;ref name="tmu"/&gt;

For example, Burmese nationalist [[Aung San]]'s parents were named Pha ({{my|ဖာ}}) and Suu ({{my|စု}}), both of which are single-syllable names. His birth name was Htain Lin ({{my|ထိန်လင်း}}), but he changed his name to Aung San ({{my|အောင်ဆန်း}}) later in life. His child is named [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] ({{my|အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်}}). The first part of her name, "Aung San", is from her father's name at the time of her birth. "Suu" comes from her grandmother. "Kyi" comes from her mother, Khin Kyi ({{my|ခင်ကြည်}}). The addition of the father or mother's name in a person's name is now quite frequent, although it does not denote the development of a family name. Other nomenclature systems are used as well.

The use of the names of one's parents and relatives in personal names has been criticized as an un-Burmese adoption of [[seriality]], although it differs from historical Western practices.

[[Bamar people|Bamar]] names commonly include [[Pali]]-derived words combined with native [[Burmese language|Burmese]] words, including:

{{colbegin}}
*Male:
**''thura'' ({{my|သူရ}} "brave, gallant" from ''sūra'')
**''thiha'' ({{my|သီဟ}} "lion", from ''sīha'')
**''zeya'' ({{my|ဇေယျာ}} "victory", from ''jāya'')
**''wunna'' ({{my|ဝဏ္ဏ}} "gold", from ''vaṇṇa'')
*Female:
**''sanda'' ({{my|စန္ဒာ}} "moon", from ''canda'')
**''thanda'' ({{my|သန္တာ}} "coral", from ''santa'')
**''thiri'' ({{my|သီရိ}} "splendour", from ''siri'')
**''hayma'' ({{my|ဟေမာ}}, "forest", compare [[Himalayas]])
{{colend}}

Burmese people who marry foreigners or move to countries that use surnames may use their name as if part of it represented a [[family name]]. For example, Tun Myint's wife changed her last name to Myint, but Myint is part of his personal name.

==Honorifics==
{{See also|Burmese Buddhist titles}}
As above, honorifics supplement a given name, and can be the normal form of address used both in writing and in speech, especially with a name of one or two syllables. Widespread use of honorifics is found within all cultures in the Burmese region. Although some ethnic groups have special honorifics, these words are recognized and applied by other groups (rather than being translated).

For example, Aung San's parents are more generally known as U Pha and Daw Suu. These can be translated as "Mr. Pha" and "Ms. Suu" but are often used more informally.

Below are some common honorifics used in Burmese names:

==Indexing==
According to ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', Burmese names are [[Subject indexing|indexed]] by the first element unless this element is an honorific. Honorifics are mentioned after the other elements of the name, separated by a comma, or are not stated at all.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/CHIIndexingComplete.pdf Indexes: A Chapter from The Chicago Manual of Style]." [[the Chicago Manual of Style]]. Retrieved on December 23, 2014. p. 25 (PDF document p. 27/56).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astrology-based naming system==

Many [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Burmese Buddhists]] also use [[Burmese Zodiac|astrology]] (which is determined by the child's day of birth in the traditional eight-day calendar) to name their children. For instance, a Monday-born child may have a name beginning with the letter "k" ({{my|က}}). The following is a traditional chart that corresponds the day of birth with the first letter used in a child's name, although this naming scheme is not universally used today:

{|class="wikitable"
!Day !! Letters
|-
|Monday ({{my|တနင်္လာ}}) || {{my|က}} (ka), {{my|ခ}} (hka), {{my|ဂ}} (ga), {{my|ဃ}} (ga), {{my|င}} (nga)
|-
|Tuesday ({{my|အင်္ဂါ}}) || {{my|စ}} (sa), {{my|ဆ}} (sa), {{my|ဇ}} (za), {{my|ဈ}} (za), {{my|ည}} (nya)
|-
|Wednesday morning ({{my|ဗုဒ္ဓဟူး}}) || {{my|လ}} (la), {{my|ဝ}} (wa)
|-
|Wednesday afternoon ({{my|ရာဟု}}) || {{my|ယ}} (ya), {{my|ရ}} (ya, ra)
|-
|Thursday ({{my|ကြာသာပတေး}}) || {{my|ပ}} (pa), {{my|ဖ}} (hpa), {{my|ဗ}} (ba), {{my|ဘ}} (ba), {{my|မ}} (ma)
|-
|Friday ({{my|သောကြာ}}) || {{my|သ}} (tha), {{my|ဟ}} (ha)
|-
|Saturday ({{my|စနေ}}) || {{my|တ}} (ta), {{my|ထ}} (hta), {{my|ဒ}} (da), {{my|ဓ}} (da), {{my|န}} (na)

'''Chiang Kai-shek''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|ŋ|_|k|aɪ|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|k|,_|dʒ|i|ˈ|ɑː|ŋ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/chiang-kai-shek "Chiang Kai-shek"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Please do not add Chinese characters, the infobox is located above.--&gt;31 October 1887 – 5 April 1975), also known as  ''' [[Generalissimo]] Chiang ''' or '''Chiang Chungcheng''' and [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Chiang Chieh-shih''' or ''' Jiang Jieshi''', was a politician and military leader who served as the [[President of the Republic of China|leader of the Republic of China]] between 1928 and 1975, first in [[mainland China]] until 1949 and then in exile in [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. He was recognized by much of the world as the head of the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate government]] of China until the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Chiang was an influential member of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as a close ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s. Chiang became the [[Commandant]] of the Kuomintang's [[Whampoa Military Academy]] and took Sun's place as leader of the KMT following the [[Canton Coup]] in early 1926. Having neutralized the party's [[left wing]], Chiang then led Sun's long-postponed [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], conquering or reaching accommodations with China's [[Warlord Era|many warlords]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Zarrow |first = Peter Gue |year = 2005 |title = China in War and Revolution, 1895–1949 |pages = 230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928 to 1948, Chiang served as chairman of the [[Nationalist government|National Government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Chiang was [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], promoting [[traditional Chinese culture]] in the [[New Life Movement]]. Unable to maintain Sun's [[First United Front|good relations]] with the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), Chiang purged them in a [[Shanghai massacre|massacre at Shanghai]] and repressed uprisings at [[Guangzhou Uprising|Kwangtung]] ([[Guangdong|"Canton" region]]) and elsewhere.

At the onset of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which later became the Chinese theater of [[World War II]], Manchurian warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] kidnapped Chiang and obliged him to establish a [[Second United Front]] with the CCP. After the defeat of the Japanese, the American-sponsored [[Marshall Mission]], an attempt to negotiate a coalition government, failed in 1946. The [[Chinese Civil War]] resumed, with the CCP led by [[Mao Zedong]] defeating the KMT and declaring the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949. Chiang's government and army retreated to [[Taiwan]], where Chiang imposed [[martial law]] and [[Persecution|persecuted]] critics in a period known as the "[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]". After evacuating to Taiwan, Chiang's government continued to declare its intention to retake mainland China. Chiang ruled Taiwan securely as [[President of the Republic of China]] and General of the Kuomintang until his death in 1975, just one year before Mao's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Translation:Will of Chiang Kai-shek|Will of Chiang Kai-shek]] at Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Mao, Chiang is regarded as a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with playing a major part in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied victory of World War II]] and unifying the nation and a national figure of the Chinese resistance against Japan as well as his staunch [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. Detractors and critics denounce him as a [[dictator]] at the front of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[autocracy]] who suppressed and purged opponents and critics and [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrarily incarcerated]] those he deemed as opposing to the Kuomintang among others.

==Names==
Like many other Chinese historical figures, Chiang used several names throughout his life. That inscribed in the [[Chinese kin|genealogical records of his family]] is Jiang Zhoutai ({{zh|t=蔣周泰|w=''Chiang Chou-t‘ai''|c=|s=}}). This so-called "register name" (譜名) is the one under which his extended relatives knew him, and the one he used in formal occasions, such as when he got married. In deference to tradition, family members did not use the [[register name]] in conversation with people outside of the family. The concept of a "real" or original name is not as clear-cut in China as it is in the Western world.

In honor of tradition, Chinese families waited a number of years before officially naming their children. In the meantime, they used a "[[milk name]]" ({{Lang|zh|乳名}}), given to the infant shortly after his birth and known only to the close family, thus the actual name that Chiang received at birth was Jiang Ruiyuan ({{zh|t=蔣瑞元|w=''Chiang Jui-yuan''}}).

In 1903, the 16-year-old Chiang went to [[Ningbo]] to be a student, and he chose a "[[school name]]" ({{Lang|zh|學名}}). This was actually the formal name of a person, used by older people to address him, and the one he would use the most in the first decades of his life (as the person grew older, younger generations would have to use one of the [[courtesy name]]s instead). Colloquially, the school name is called "big name" ({{Lang-zh|c=大名|s=|t=}}), whereas the "milk name" is known as the "small name" ({{Lang-zh|c=小名|s=|t=}}). The school name that Chiang chose for himself was Zhiqing ({{zh|c=志清|w=Chi-ch‘ing}}, which means "purity of intentions"). For the next fifteen years or so, Chiang was known as Jiang Zhiqing ([[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chi-ch‘ing). This is the name under which [[Sun Yat-sen]] knew him when Chiang joined the republicans in [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] in the 1910s.

In 1912, when Jiang Zhiqing was in Japan, he started to use the name Chiang Kai-shek ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 蔣介石; [[Pinyin]]: {{Audio|Zh-Jiang_Jieshi.ogg|''Jiang Jieshi''}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Chiang Chieh-shih) as a [[pen name]] for the articles that he published in a Chinese magazine he founded: ''Voice of the Army'' ({{Lang-zh|c=軍聲|s=|t=}}). ''Jieshi'' is the [[Pinyin]] romanization of this name, based on [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], but the most recognized romanized rendering is ''Kai-shek'' which is in [[Cantonese|Cantonese romanization]]. As the republicans were based in Canton (a Cantonese speaking area, now commonly known as [[Guangdong]] province), Chiang became known by Westerners under the Cantonese romanization of his courtesy name, while the family name as known in English seems to be the Mandarin pronunciation of his Chinese family name, transliterated in [[Wade-Giles]].

"Kai-shek"/"Jieshi" soon became Chiang's [[courtesy name]] ({{Lang|zh|字}}). Some think the name was chosen from the classic Chinese book the ''[[I Ching]]''; "介于石", "[he who is] firm as a rock", is the beginning of line 2 of [[I Ching hexagram 16|Hexagram 16, "豫"]]. Others note that the first character of his courtesy name is also the first character of the courtesy name of his brother and other male relatives on the same generation line, while the second character of his courtesy name ''shi'' ({{Lang|zh|石}}—meaning "stone") suggests the second character of his "register name" ''tai'' ({{Lang|zh|泰}}—the famous [[Mount Tai]] of China). Courtesy names in China often bore a connection with the personal name of the person. As the courtesy name is the name used by people of the same generation to address the person, Chiang soon became known under this new name.

Sometime in 1917 or 1918, as Chiang became close to [[Sun Yat-sen]], he changed his name from Jiang Zhiqing to Jiang Zhongzheng ({{zh|c=蔣中正|w=''Chiang Chung-cheng''}}). By adopting the name Chung-cheng ("central uprightness"), he was choosing a name very similar to the name of Sun Yat-sen, who was (and still is) known among Chinese as Zhongshan ({{Lang|zh|中山}}—meaning "central mountain"), thus establishing a link between the two. The meaning of uprightness, rectitude, or orthodoxy, implied by his name, also positioned him as the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] heir of Sun Yat-sen and his ideas. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Communists always rejected the use of this name and it is not well known in [[mainland China]]. However, it was readily accepted by members of the [[Chinese Nationalist Party]] and is the name under which Chiang Kai-shek is still commonly known in Taiwan. Often the name is shortened to "Chung-cheng" only ("Zhongzheng" in [[Pinyin]]). Many public places in Taiwan are named [[Chungcheng]] after Chiang. For many years passengers arriving at the [[Chiang Kai-shek International Airport]] were greeted by signs in Chinese welcoming them to the "Chung Cheng International Airport". Similarly, the monument erected to Chiang's memory in Taipei, known in English as [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]], was literally named "Chung Cheng Memorial Hall" in Chinese. In Singapore, [[Chung Cheng High School (Main)|Chung Cheng High School]] was named after him.

His name is also written in Taiwan as "The Late President Lord Chiang" ({{Lang|zh|先總統　蔣公}}), where the one-character-wide space known as [[nuo tai]] shows respect, but this practice has lost some popularity. However, he is still known as ''Lord Chiang'' (蔣公) (without the title or space), along with the name Chiang Chung-cheng, in Taiwan.

{{anchor|Biography|History}}

== Early life ==
Chiang was born in [[Xikou, Fenghua|Xikou]], a town in [[Fenghua]], [[Zhejiang]], about {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} west of central [[Ningbo]]. His family's [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]]—a concept important in Chinese society—was Heqiao ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|和橋|鎮}}}}), a town in [[Yixing]], [[Jiangsu]], about {{convert|38|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} southwest of central [[Wuxi]] and {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the shores of [[Lake Tai]]. His father Jiang Zhaocong ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|蔣|肇|聰}}}}) and mother Wang Caiyu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|王|采|玉}}}}) were members of a prosperous family of salt merchants. Chiang lost his father when he was eight, and he wrote of his mother as the "embodiment of [[Confucianism|Confucian virtues]]".The young Chiang was inspired throughout his youth by the realisation that the reputation of an honored family rested upon his shoulders. He was a mischievous child, at only three years old he thrust a pair of chopsticks down his throat to see how far they would reach. They became stuck and were removed with great difficulty. Even at a young age he was interested in war, and directed mimic campaigns with a wooden sword and spear. As he grew older, Chiang became more aware of the issues that surrounded him and in his speech to the Kuomintang in 1945 said:

{{quote|As you all know I was an orphan boy in a poor family. Deprived of any protection after the death of her husband, my mother was exposed to the most ruthless exploitation by neighbouring ruffians and the local gentry. The efforts she made in fighting against the intrigues of these family intruders certainly endowed her child, brought up in such environment, with an indomitable spirit to fight for justice. I felt throughout my childhood that mother and I were fighting a helpless lone war. We were alone in a desert, no available or possible assistance could we look forward to. But our determination was never shaken, nor hope abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tong|first1=Hollington K.|title=Chiang Kai-Shek|date=1953|publisher=China Publishing Company|page=5|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Education in Japan==
Chiang grew up at a time in which military defeats, natural disasters, revolts, and the machinations{{POV statement|date=July 2018}} of the empress dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] had left the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-dominated [[Qing Empire]] destabilized and in debt. Successive demands of the [[Western powers]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] since the [[First Opium War|Opium War]] had left China owing millions of [[tael]]s of silver. During his first visits to Japan to pursue a military career in 1906, he describes having strong nationalistic feelings with a desire among other things to, "expel the Manchu Qing and to restore China".&lt;ref&gt;http://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/books/978-88-6969-127-0/978-88-6969-127-0-ch-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to pursue a military career. He began his military training at the [[Baoding Military Academy]] in 1906, the same year Japan left its bimetallic currency standard, devaluing its [[Japanese yen|yen]]. He left for [[Tokyo Shinbu Gakko]], a preparatory school for the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] intended for Chinese students, in 1907. There, he came under the influence of compatriots to support the revolutionary movement to overthrow the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] and to set up a [[Han Chinese|Han]]-dominated Chinese republic. He befriended fellow Zhejiangese [[Chen Qimei]], and in 1908 Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]], an important revolutionary brotherhood of the era. Finishing his schooling, Chiang served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from 1909 to 1911.

==Return to China==
After learning of the outbreak (October 1911) of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chiang returned to China in 1911, intending to fight as an artillery officer. He served in the revolutionary forces, leading a regiment in Shanghai under his friend and mentor [[Chen Qimei]], as one of Chen's chief lieutenants. In early 1912 a dispute arose between Chen and [[Tao Chen-chang]], an influential member of the Revolutionary Alliance who opposed both Sun Yat-sen and Chen. Tao sought to avoid escalating the quarrel by hiding in a hospital but Chiang discovered him there. Chen dispatched assassins. Chiang may not have taken part in the act, but would later assume responsibility to help Chen avoid trouble. Chen valued Chiang despite Chiang's already legendary temper, regarding such bellicosity as useful in a military leader.&lt;ref name="Taylor2009p24, 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp= 24, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Professor Pichon Loh reports that Chiang may have killed Tao in the hospital with a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Loh |first= Pichon |title = The Early Chiang Kai-shek |publisher= Columbia University Press |year= 1971 |page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=March 2018}}

Chiang's friendship with Chen Qimei signaled an association with Shanghai's criminal syndicate (the [[Green Gang]] headed by [[Du Yuesheng]] and Huang Jinrong). During Chiang's time in Shanghai, the British-administered [[Shanghai International Settlement]] police watched him and charged him with various felonies. These charges never resulted in a trial, and Chiang was never jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Loh 1971, pp. 20, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang became a founding member of the KMT after the success (February 1912) of the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]]. After the takeover of the Republican government by [[Yuan Shikai]] and the failed [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in 1913, Chiang, like his KMT comrades, divided his time between exile in Japan and the havens of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]]. In Shanghai, Chiang cultivated ties with the city's underworld gangs, which were dominated by the notorious Green Gang and its leader Du Yuesheng. On 18 May 1916, agents of Yuan Shikai assassinated Chen Qimei. Chiang then succeeded Chen as leader of the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]] in Shanghai. Sun Yat-sen's political career reached its lowest point during this time when most of his old Revolutionary Alliance comrades refused to join him in the exiled Chinese Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref name="Taylor2009p25-26"&gt;
{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|pp= 25–26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment of the Kuomintang==
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek-young.jpg|thumb|right|Chiang, early 1920s]]

In 1917, Sun Yat-sen moved his base of operations to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (now known as Guangzhou), and Chiang joined him in 1918. At this time Sun remained largely sidelined; and, without arms or money, was soon expelled from Kwangtung and exiled again to Shanghai. He was restored to Kwangtung with mercenary help in 1920. After returning to Kwangtung, a rift developed between Sun, who sought to militarily unify China under the KMT, and Guangdong Governor [[Chen Jiongming]], who wanted to [[Federalism in China|implement a federalist system]] with Guangdong as a model province. On 16 June 1922, [[Ye Ju]], a general of Chen's whom Sun had attempted to exile, led an assault of [[Guangzhou's Presidential Palace|Kwangtung's Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Chan |first=Anthony B. |title=Arming the Chinese: The Western Armaments Trade in Warlord China, 1920–1928 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |date=2010 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=T6eXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 106]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun had already fled to the naval yard{{sfnp|Hahn|1955||p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VPVCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 42]}} and boarded the SS&amp;nbsp;''Haiqi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dreyer |first=Edward L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YsWOAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=China at War, 1901–1941 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=1995 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YsWOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104 104]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Soong Ching-ling|his wife]] narrowly evaded [[Mortar (weapon)|shelling]] and rifle fire as she fled.{{sfnp|Pakula|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA95 95–97]}} They met on the [[SS Zhongshan|SS ''Yongfeng'']], where they were joined—as swiftly as he could return from [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he was ritually mourning his mother's death—by Chiang.&lt;ref name=bdrc&gt;{{citation |title=Biographical Dictionary of Republican China, ''Vol. III'' |at=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KWHREtBHNqYC&amp;pg=PA322 "Chiang Kai-shek", p. 322] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For about 50 days,&lt;ref name=soc/&gt; Chiang stayed with Sun, protecting and caring for him and earning his lasting trust. They abandoned their attacks on Chen on August 9, taking a British ship to [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]&lt;ref name=bdrc/&gt; and traveling to Shanghai by steamer.&lt;ref name=soc&gt;{{citation |title=Ships of China |p=115 |date=1988 |publisher=Jingdao Chuban Youxian Gongsi }}. {{zh icon}}{{nbsp}}&amp; {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun regained control of Kwangtung in early 1923, again with the help of mercenaries from [[Yunnan]] and from the [[Comintern]]. Undertaking a reform of the KMT, he established a revolutionary government aimed at unifying China under the KMT. That same year, Sun sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] political and military system. During his trip in Russia, Chiang met [[Leon Trotsky]] and other Soviet leaders, but quickly came to the conclusion that the Russian model of government was not suitable for China. Chiang later sent his eldest son, Ching-kuo, to study in Russia. After his father's split from the [[First United Front]] in 1927, Ching-kuo was forced to stay there, as a hostage, until 1937. Chiang wrote in his diary, "It is not worth it to sacrifice the interest of the country for the sake of my son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan |author=Jay Taylor |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page = 59 |isbn = 0-674-00287-3 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkREps9oGR4C&amp;pg=PA205 |title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost |first = Jonathan |last = Fenby |year=2005 |publisher = Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page=205 |isbn =0-7867-1484-0 |accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang even refused to negotiate a prisoner swap for his son in exchange for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZpVntUTZfkC&amp;pg=PA247 |title = The last empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the birth of modern China |first = Hannah |last = Pakula |year=2009 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=247|isbn=1-4391-4893-7 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attitude remained consistent, and he continued to maintain, by 1937, that "I would rather have no offspring than sacrifice our nation's interests." Chiang had absolutely no intention of ceasing the war against the Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA59 |title = The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan |first = Jay |last = Taylor |year=2000 |publisher = Harvard University Press |page=74 |isbn = 0-674-00287-3 |accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Kai-shek returned to Kwangtung and in 1924 was appointed [[Commandant]] of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] by Sun. Chiang resigned from the office for one month in disagreement with Sun's extremely close cooperation with the Comintern, but returned at Sun's demand. The early years at Whampoa allowed Chiang to cultivate a cadre of young officers loyal to both the KMT and himself.

Throughout his rise to power, Chiang also benefited from membership within the nationalist [[Tiandihui]] fraternity, to which Sun Yat-sen also belonged, and which remained a source of support during his leadership of the Kuomintang.

==Competition with Wang Jingwei==
[[File:Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|right|Chiang (right) together with [[Wang Jingwei]] (left), 1926]]

[[Sun Yat-sen]] died on 12 March 1925,&lt;ref name=sundeath&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eileen |first=Tamura |year=1998 |title=China: Understanding Its Past |page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a power vacuum in the [[Kuomintang]]. A contest ensued among [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Liao Zhongkai]], and [[Hu Hanmin]]. In August, Liao was assassinated and Hu arrested for his connections to the murderers. Wang Jingwei, who had succeeded Sun as chairman of the Kwangtung regime, seemed ascendant but was forced into exile by Chiang following the [[Canton Coup]]. The {{nowrap|SS ''Yongfeng''}}, renamed the [[SS Zhongshan|''Zhongshan'']] in Sun's honor, had appeared off [[Changzhou Island|Changzhou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Van de Ven |first=Hans |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC |title=War and Nationalism in China: 1925–1945 |series=''Studies in the Modern History of Asia'' |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |isbn=978-0415145718 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA101 101] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;—the location of the [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa Academy]]—on apparently falsified orders{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} and amid a series of unusual phone calls trying to ascertain Chiang's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Ah Xiang |contribution-url=http://www.republicanchina.org/Zhongshan-Warship-Incident.pdf |contribution=The ''Zhongshan'' Warship Incident |title=Tragedy of Chinese Revolution |date=1998 |p=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially considered fleeing Kwangtung and even booked passage on a Japanese steamer, but then decided to use his military connections to declare martial law on 20 March 1926, and crack down on Communist and Soviet influence over the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]], the military academy, and the party.{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} The right wing of the party supported him and [[Stalin]]—anxious to maintain Soviet influence in the area—had his lieutenants agree to Chiang's demands{{sfnp|Ah Xiang|1998|p=3}} regarding a reduced Communist presence in the KMT leadership in exchange for certain other concessions.{{sfnp|Van de Ven|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tx5H_DC5V-MC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}} The rapid replacement of leadership enabled Chiang to effectively end civilian oversight of the military after May 15, though his authority was somewhat limited{{sfnp|Ah Xiang|1998|p=3}} by the army's own regional composition and divided loyalties. On 5 June 1926, he was named [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]&lt;ref name="Taylor2009p57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on July 27, he finally launched Sun's long-delayed [[Northern Expedition]], aimed at conquering the northern warlords and bringing China together under the KMT.

The NRA branched into three divisions: to the west was the returned Wang Jingwei, who led a column to take [[Wuhan]]; [[Bai Chongxi]]'s column went east to take Shanghai; Chiang himself led in the middle route, planning to take [[Nanjing]] before pressing ahead to capture Beijing. However, in January 1927, Wang Jingwei and his KMT leftist allies took the city of Wuhan amid much popular mobilization and fanfare. Allied with a number of [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] and advised by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent [[Mikhail Borodin]], Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanjing in March (and briefly visited Shanghai, now under the control of his close ally Bai Chongxi), Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang's leftist elements, which he believed threatened his control of the KMT.

Now with an established national government in Nanjing, and supported by conservative allies including [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's expulsion of the Communists and their Soviet advisers led to the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Wang Jingwei's National Government was weak militarily, and was soon ended by Chiang with the support of a local warlord ([[Li Zongren]] of [[Guangxi]]). Eventually, Wang and his leftist party surrendered to Chiang and joined him in Nanjing. In the [[Central Plains War]], Beijing was taken on June, 1928, from an alliance of the warlords [[Feng Yuxiang]] and [[Yan Xishan]]. In December, the [[Manchuria]]n warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]] pledged allegiance to Chiang's government, completing Chiang's nominal unification of China and ending the [[Warlord Era]].

In 1927, when he was setting up the Nationalist government in Nanjing, he was preoccupied with "the elevation of our leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the rank of 'Father of our Chinese Republic'. Dr. Sun worked for 40 years to lead our people in the Nationalist cause, and we cannot allow any other personality to usurp this honored position". He asked [[Chen Guofu]] to purchase a photograph that had been taken in Japan around 1895 or 1898. It showed members of the Revive China Society with [[Yeung Kui-wan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|楊衢雲}} or {{lang|zh-Hans|杨衢云}}, [[pinyin]] Yáng Qúyún) as President, in the place of honor, and Sun, as secretary, on the back row, along with members of the Japanese Chapter of the Revive China Society. When told that it was not for sale, Chiang offered a million dollars to recover the photo and its negative. "The party must have this picture and the negative at any price. They must be destroyed as soon as possible. It would be embarrassing to have our Father of the Chinese Republic shown in a subordinate position".&lt;ref&gt;'"Chiang Kai-Shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju" by Ch'en Chieh-ju and George Chan, ed. by Lloyd E. Eastman, Westview Press, Boulder, 1993, pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang never obtained either the photo or its negative.

Chiang made great efforts to gain recognition as the official successor of Sun Yat-sen. In a pairing of great political significance, Chiang was Sun's brother-in-law: he had married [[Soong Mei-ling]], the younger sister of [[Soong Ching-ling]], Sun's widow, on 1 December 1927. Originally rebuffed in the early 1920s, Chiang managed to ingratiate himself to some degree with Soong Mei-ling's mother by first divorcing his wife and concubines and promising to sincerely study the precepts of [[Christianity]]. He read the copy of the Bible that May-ling had given him twice before making up his mind to become a Christian, and three years after his marriage he was baptized in the Soong's [[Methodist]] church. Although some observers felt that he adopted Christianity as a political move, studies of his recently opened diaries suggest that his faith was strong and sincere and that he felt that Christianity reinforced Confucian moral teachings.&lt;ref name="Taylor2009p91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reaching Beijing, Chiang paid homage to Sun Yat-sen and had his body moved to the new capital of Nanjing to be enshrined in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]].

==Rising power==
In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the "Red General".&lt;ref name="Hannah Pakula 2009 346"/&gt; Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang. At Moscow, Sun Yat-sen University portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls; and, in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and other Communist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA42 |title=The Generalissimo's Son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan |author = Jay Taylor |year=2000 |publisher = Harvard University Press |page=42 |isbn = 0-674-00287-3 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States consulate and other Westerners in Shanghai were concerned about the approach of "Red General" Chiang as his army was seizing control of large areas of the country in the Northern Expedition.&lt;ref name="The Generalissimo"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=03catqbPCmgC&amp;pg=PA602 |title = The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China, Volume 39 |author=Jay Taylor |year=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page = 602 |isbn = 0-674-03338-8 |accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wjCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA94|title=Moscow and Chinese Communists |author=Robert Carver North |year=1963 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=94 |isbn = 0-8047-0453-8 |accessdate = June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 1927, Chiang carried out [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|a purge]] of thousands of suspected Communists and dissidents in Shanghai, and began large-scale massacres across the country collectively known as the [[White Terror (mainland China)|"White Terror"]]. During April, more than {{formatnum:12000}} people were killed in Shanghai. The killings drove most Communists from urban cities and into the rural countryside, where the KMT was less powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Mayhew |first = Bradley |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IAe97m8sgw0C&amp;pg=PA51 |title = Shanghai |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |edition = 2nd |date = March 2004 |isbn = 978-1-74059-308-3 |accessdate = July 22, 2009 |page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people died across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns, executed by the KMT.

Having gained control of China, Chiang's party remained surrounded by "surrendered" warlords who remained relatively autonomous within their own regions. On 10 October 1928, Chiang was named director of the State Council, the equivalent to President of the country, in addition to his other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2009|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with his predecessor Sun Yat-sen, the Western media dubbed him "[[Generalissimo]]".&lt;ref name="Taylor2009p57"/&gt;

According to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s plans, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) was to rebuild China in three steps: [[Martial law|military rule]], political tutelage, and constitutional rule. The ultimate goal of the KMT revolution was democracy, which was not considered to be feasible in China's fragmented state. Since the KMT had completed the first step of revolution through seizure of power in 1928, Chiang's rule thus began a period of what his party considered to be "political tutelage" in Sun Yat-sen's name. During this so-called Republican Era, many features of a modern, functional Chinese state emerged and developed.

From 1928 to 1937, a time period known as known as the [[Nanjing decade]], some aspects of foreign [[imperialism]], [[Concessions in China|concessions]] and privileges{{clarify|date=August 2018}} in China were moderated through diplomacy. The government acted to modernize the legal and penal systems, attempted to stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in [[narcotic]]s, and augment industrial and agricultural production. Not all of these projects were successfully completed. Efforts were made towards improving education standards, and in an effort to unify Chinese society, the [[New Life Movement]] was launched to encourage [[Confucianism|Confucian]] moral values and personal discipline. ''[[Standard Chinese|Guoyu]]'' ("national language") was promoted as a [[Official language|standard tongue]], and the establishment of communications facilities (including radio) were used to encourage a sense of [[Chinese nationalism]] in a way that was not possible when the nation lacked an effective central government.

Any successes that the Nationalists did make, however, were met with constant political and military upheavals. While much of the urban areas were now under the control of the KMT, much of the countryside remained under the influence of weakened yet undefeated warlords and Communists. Chiang often resolved issues of warlord obstinacy through military action, but such action was costly in terms of men and material. The 1930 [[Central Plains War]] alone nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government and caused almost {{formatnum:250000}} casualties on both sides. In 1931, [[Hu Hanmin]], Chiang's old supporter, publicly voiced a popular concern that Chiang's position as both premier and president flew in the face of the democratic ideals of the Nationalist government. Chiang had Hu put under [[house arrest]], but he was released after national condemnation, after which he left Nanjing and supported a rival government in [[Guanzhou|Canton]]. The split resulted in a military conflict between Hu's Kwangtung government and Chiang's Nationalist government. Chiang only won the campaign against Hu after a shift in allegiance by the warlord [[Zhang Xueliang]], who had previously supported Hu Hanmin.

Throughout his rule, complete eradication of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] remained Chiang's dream. After assembling his forces in [[Kiangsi]], Chiang led his armies against the newly established [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]. With help from foreign military advisers, Chiang's [[Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet|Fifth Campaign]] finally surrounded the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] in 1934. The Communists, tipped off that a Nationalist offensive was imminent, retreated in the [[Long March]], during which [[Mao Zedong]] rose from a mere military official to the most influential leader of the Communist Party of China.

Chiang, as a nationalist and a Confucianist, was against the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Motivated by his sense of nationalism, he viewed some Western ideas as foreign, and he believed that the great introduction of Western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement promoted was not beneficial to China. He and Dr. Sun criticized the May Fourth intellectuals as corrupting the morals of China's youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |title=The May Fourth Movement in Shanghai: The Making of a Social Movement in Modern China |author=Joseph T.

Contrary to Communist propaganda that he was pro-capitalism, Chiang antagonized the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for the use of the government. Chiang confiscated the wealth of capitalists even while he denounced and fought against communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTv99LBYSL4C&amp;pg=PA58|title=Encyclopedia of modern dictators: from Napoleon to the present|author=Frank J.

Chiang continued the anti-capitalist ideology of Sun Yat-sen, directing Kuomintang media to openly attack capitalists and capitalism, while demanding [[Government-owned corporation|government controlled industry]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&amp;pg=PA264 |title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927–1937 |author=Parks M.

Chiang has often been interpreted as being pro-capitalist, but this conclusion may be problematic. Shanghai capitalists did briefly support him out of fear of communism in 1927, but this support eroded in 1928 when Chiang turned his tactics of intimidation on them. The relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Chinese capitalists remained poor throughout the period of his administration.&lt;ref name="capitalists" /&gt; Chiang blocked Chinese capitalists from gaining any political power or voice within his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. [[Green Gang|Gangster connections]] allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, successfully forcing capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expeditions.&lt;ref name="capitalists"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9nJF_19fnZ4C&amp;pg=PA264 |title=The Shanghai capitalists and the Nationalist government, 1927–1937|author=Parks M.

Chiang viewed Japan, America, the [[Soviet Union]], France and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as all being imperialists with nobody else's interests in mind but their own, seeing them as hypocritical to condemn each other for imperialism which they all practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzf5AAAAIAAJ|title=The life of Chiang Kai-shek|first=Shih-i|last=Hsiung|edition=|year=1948|publisher=Peter Davies|location=|page=211|isbn=|accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWlaMnvu6MC |title=Chiang Kai-shek: An Unauthorized Biography|first=Emily|last=Hahn|edition=|year=1955|publisher=Doubleday|location=|page=84|isbn= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He manipulated America, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union to regain lost territories for China as he viewed all the powers as imperialists trying to curtail and suppress China's power and national resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_eddVnC3paoC&amp;pg=PA177 |title=Chinese-Soviet Relations, 1937–1945 : The Diplomacy of Chinese Nationalism: The Diplomacy of Chinese Nationalism|author=School of Social Science Georgia Institute of Technology John W.

Regardless the Nationalist government of China has been accused of mass killings by Rummel, estimating the Nationalist government of China is responsible for between 6 and 18.5 million deaths.
He attributes this death toll to a few major causes, for example:&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web|last1=R.J.Rummel|title=CHINA'S BLOODY CENTURY|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First phase of the Chinese Civil War===
In [[Nanjing]], on April 1931, Chiang Kai-shek attended a national leadership conference with [[Zhang Xueliang]] and General [[Ma Fuxiang]], in which Chiang and Zhang dauntlessly upheld that Manchuria was part of China in the face of the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China|first=Jay|last=Taylor|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=03catqbPCmgC&amp;pg=PA93 |page=93 |isbn=0674033388 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, Chiang resigned as Chairman of the National Government. He returned shortly afterwards, adopting the slogan "first internal pacification, then external resistance". However, this policy of avoiding a frontal war against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] was widely unpopular. In 1932, while Chiang was seeking first to defeat the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], Japan launched an [[January 28 Incident|advance]] on Shanghai and bombarded [[Nanjing]]. This disrupted Chiang's [[Chinese Civil War|offensives against the Communists]] for a time, although it was the northern factions of [[Hu Hanmin]]'s [[Guangzhou|Kwangtung]] government (notably the [[19th Route Army]]) that primarily led the offensive against the Japanese during this skirmish. Brought into the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] immediately after the battle, the 19th Route Army's career under Chiang would be cut short after it was disbanded for demonstrating socialist tendencies.

In December 1936, Chiang flew to [[Xi'an]] to coordinate a major assault on the [[Red Army (China)|Red Army]] and the Communist Republic that had retreated into [[Yan'an]]. However, Chiang's allied commander [[Zhang Xueliang]], whose forces were used in his attack and whose homeland of [[Manchuria]] had been recently invaded by the Japanese, did not support the attack on the Communists. On December 12, Zhang and several other Nationalist generals headed by Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi kidnapped Chiang for two weeks in what is known as the [[Xi'an Incident]]. They forced Chiang into making a "[[Second United Front]]" with the Communists against Japan. After releasing Chiang and returning to Nanjing with him, Zhang was placed under house arrest and the generals who had assisted him were executed. Chiang's commitment to the Second United Front was nominal at best, and it was all but broken up in 1941.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
[[File:Liangyou 131 cover - Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|thumb|upright|After the breakout of the Second Sino-Japanese War, ''[[The Young Companion]]'' featured Chiang on its cover.]]

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in July 1937, and in August of that year Chiang sent {{formatnum:600000}} of his best-trained and equipped soldiers to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]]. With over 200,000 Chinese casualties, Chiang lost the political cream of his [[Whampoa Military Academy|Whampoa]]-trained officers. Although Chiang lost militarily, the battle dispelled Japanese claims that it could conquer China in three months and demonstrated to the Western powers that the Chinese would continue the fight. By December, the capital city of Nanjing had fallen to the Japanese resulting in the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Chiang moved the government inland, first to [[Wuhan]] and later to [[Chongqing]].

Having lost most of China's economic and industrial centers, Chiang withdrew into the hinterlands, stretching the Japanese supply lines and bogging down Japanese soldiers in the vast Chinese interior. As part of a policy of protracted resistance, Chiang authorized the use of [[Scorched earth#Second Sino-Japanese War|scorched earth]] tactics, resulting in many civilian deaths. During the Nationalists' retreat from [[Zhengzhou]], the dams around the city were deliberately destroyed by the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist army]] in order to delay the Japanese advance, killing 500,000 people in the subsequent [[1938 Yellow River flood]].

After heavy fighting, the Japanese occupied Wuhan in the fall of 1938 and the Nationalists retreated farther inland, to Chongqing. While en route to Chongqing, the Nationalist army intentionally started the [[1938 Changsha Fire|"fire of Changsha"]], as a part of the scorched earth policy. The fire destroyed much of the city, killed twenty thousand civilians, and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Due to an organizational error (it was claimed), the fire was begun without any warning to the residents of the city. The Nationalists eventually blamed three local commanders for the fire and executed them. Newspapers across China blamed the fire on (non-KMT) arsonists, but the blaze contributed to a nationwide loss of support for the KMT.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

In 1939 Muslim leaders [[Isa Yusuf Alptekin]] and Ma Fuliang were sent by Chiang to several Middle eastern countries, including [[Egypt]], Turkey, and [[Syria]], to gain support for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese War against Japan]], and to express his support for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC |title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn = 0-415-58264-4 |page=90|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese, controlling the puppet-state of [[Manchukuo]] and much of China's eastern seaboard, appointed [[Wang Jingwei]] as a [[Quisling]]-ruler of the occupied Chinese territories around Nanjing. Wang named himself President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the National Government (not the same 'National Government' as Chiang's), and led a surprisingly large{{Quantify|date=May 2010}} minority of anti-Chiang/anti-Communist Chinese against his old comrades. He died in 1944, within a year of the end of World War II.

The Hui Muslim [[Xidaotang]] sect pledged allegiance to the Kuomintang after their rise to power and Hui Muslim General [[Bai Chongxi]] acquainted Chiang Kaishek with the Xidaotang jiaozhu Ma Mingren in 1941 in [[Chongqing]].&lt;ref name="Lipman1998 1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Nzux7z6KAC&amp;pg=PA197|date=1 July 1998|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80055-4|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek went on tour in northwestern China in [[Xinjiang]], Gansu, [[Ningxia]], Shaanxi, and [[Qinghai]], where he met both Muslim Generals [[Ma Buqing]] and [[Ma Bufang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: He Who Has Reason|newspaper=TIME|date=Oct 5, 1942|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773741,00.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met the Muslim Generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Hongkui]] separately.

With the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the opening of the [[Pacific War]], China became one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]. During and after World War II, Chiang and his American-educated wife [[Soong Mei-ling]], known in the United States as "Madame Chiang", held the support of the [[China Lobby]] in the United States, which saw in them the hope of a Christian and democratic China. Chiang was even named the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in the China war zone. He was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777742,00.html?promoid=googlep | work=Time | title=BATTLE OF ASIA: Land of Three Rivers | date=May 4, 1942 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Joseph Stilwell]], an American military adviser to Chiang during World War II, strongly criticized Chiang and his generals for what he saw as their incompetence and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Command Problem, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the United States Army Air Corps commenced [[Operation Matterhorn]] in order to bomb Japan's steel industry from bases to be constructed in mainland China. This was meant to fulfill President Roosevelt's promise to Chiang Kai-shek to begin bombing operations against Japan by November 1944. However, Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates refused to take airbase construction seriously until enough capital had been delivered to permit embezzlement on a massive scale. Stilwell estimated that at least half of the $100&amp;nbsp;million spent on construction of airbases was embezzled by Nationalist party officials.&lt;ref name="wings11"&gt;{{cite episode|title=True Airpower|series=Wings: Clash of Wings|network=[[Discovery Channel]]|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang played the Soviets and Americans against each other during the war. He first told the Americans that they would be welcome in talks between the Soviet Union and China, then secretly told the Soviets that the Americans were unimportant and that their opinions would not be considered. Chiang also used American support and military power in China against the ambitions of the Soviet Union to dominate the talks, stopping the Soviets from taking full advantage of the situation in China with the threat of American military action against the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url  =https://books.google.com/books?id=x8b4an0T0twC&amp;pg=PA255 |title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost |author=Jonathan Fenby |year=2005|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page=256 |isbn = 0-7867-1484-0 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Indochina ===
U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], through General Stilwell, privately made it clear that they preferred that the French not reacquire [[French Indochina]] (modern day Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos) after the war was over. Roosevelt offered Chiang control of all of Indochina.

After the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General [[Lu Han (general)|Lu Han]] were sent by Chiang Kai-shek to northern Indochina (north of the 16th parallel) to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces there, and remained in Indochina until 1946, when the French returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF3MG43x--0C&amp;pg=PA30 |title=America's war in Vietnam: a short narrative history |author=Larry H.

===Ryukyus===
During the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943, Chiang said that Roosevelt asked him whether China would like to claim the [[Ryukyu Islands]] from Japan in addition to retaking Taiwan, the [[Penghu|Pescadores]], and Manchuria. Chiang claims that he said he was in favor of an international presence on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Relations of the United State: The Conferences at Cairo and Tehran, 1943'' [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?id=FRUS.FRUS1943CairoTehran p. 324] "Chinese Summary Record".&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. became the sole protector of the Ryukyus in 1945, and reverted it to the Japanese in 1972 while securing US military presence there.

====Treatment and use of Japanese soldiers====
[[File:Chiang Kai Shek and wife with Lieutenant General Stilwell.jpg|thumb|Chiang and his wife [[Soong Mei-ling]] sharing a laugh with [[Joseph Stilwell|U.S. Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell]], [[Burma]], April 1942]]

In 1945, when [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japan surrendered]], Chiang's [[Chongqing]] government was ill-equipped and ill-prepared to reassert its authority in formerly [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied China]], and it asked the Japanese to postpone their surrender until Kuomintang (KMT) authority could arrive to take over. American troops and weapons soon bolstered KMT forces, allowing them to reclaim cities. The countryside, however, remained largely under Communist control.

For over a year after the Japanese surrender, rumors circulated throughout China that the Japanese had entered into a secret agreement with Chiang, in which the Japanese would assist the Nationalists in fighting the Communists in exchange for the protection of Japanese persons and property there. Many top nationalist generals, including Chiang, had studied and trained in Japan before the Nationalists had returned to the mainland in the 1920s, and maintained close personal friendships with top Japanese officers. The Japanese general in charge of all forces in China, General [[Yasuji Okamura]], had personally trained officers who later became generals in Chiang's staff. Reportedly, General Okamura, before surrendering command of all Japanese military forces in Nanjing, offered Chiang control of all 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Japanese military and civilian support staff then present in China. Reportedly, Chiang seriously considered accepting this offer, but declined only in the knowledge that the United States would certainly be outraged by the gesture. Even so, armed Japanese troops remained in China well into 1947, with some noncommissioned officers finding their way into the Nationalist officer corps.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles.

Retrieved at: &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2055515&gt;. February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  That the Japanese in China came to regard Chiang as a magnanimous figure to whom many Japanese owed their lives and livelihoods was a fact attested by both Nationalist and Communist sources.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles.

==== Conditions during the Chinese Civil War ====
[[Odd Arne Westad|Westad]] says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, the United States encouraged peace talks between Chiang and Communist leader Mao Zedong in Chongqing. Due to concerns about widespread and well-documented corruption in Chiang's government throughout his rule, the U.S. government limited aid to Chiang for much of the period of 1946 to 1948, in the midst of fighting against the [[People's Liberation Army]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. Alleged infiltration of the U.S. government by Chinese Communist agents may have also played a role in the suspension of American aid.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, John Earl; Harvey Klehr, ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America'', New Haven: Yale University Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-300-08462-5}}, pp. 142–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's right-hand man, the secret police Chief [[Dai Li]], was both anti-American and anti-Communist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C |title = Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost |author=Jonathan Fenby |year=2005 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page=414 |isbn = 0-7867-1484-0|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dai ordered Kuomintang agents to spy on American officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgEPrlfvG4C |title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost |author=Jonathan Fenby |year=2005 |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers |page=413 |isbn = 0-7867-1484-0|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, Dai had been involved with the [[Blue Shirts Society]], a fascist-inspired paramilitary group within the Kuomintang, which wanted to expel Western and Japanese imperialists, crush the Communists, and eliminate [[feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&amp;pg=PA75|title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese secret service |author=Frederic E.

Although Chiang had achieved status abroad as a world leader, his government deteriorated as the result of corruption and inflation. In his diary on June 1948, Chiang wrote that the KMT had failed, not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hoover.org/research/chiang-kai-shek-and-struggle-china |title=HOOVER ARCHIVES: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China |last=Bethell |first=Tom |year=2007 |website=hoover.org |publisher=The Hoover Institution |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070730081935/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html
|archivedate={{date|2007-07-30|mdy}} |deadurl=no |accessdate={{date|2014-11-07|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had severely weakened the Nationalists, while the Communists were strengthened by their popular land-reform policies,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Huang, cong dalishi jiaodu du Jiang Jieshi riji (Reading Chiang Kai-shek's dairy from a macro-history perspective), Chinatimes Publishing Press, Taipei, 1994, pp. 441–43&lt;/ref&gt; and by a rural population that supported and trusted them. The Nationalists initially had superiority in arms and men, but their lack of popularity, infiltration by Communist agents, low morale, and disorganization soon allowed the Communists to gain the upper hand in the civil war.

==== Competition with Li Zongren ====
A new [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] was promulgated in 1947, and Chiang was elected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] as the first term [[President of the Republic of China]] on 20 May 1948. This marked the beginning of what was termed the "democratic constitutional government" period by the KMT political orthodoxy, but the Communists refused to recognize the new Constitution, and its government, as legitimate. Chiang resigned as President on 21 January 1949, as KMT forces suffered terrible losses and defections to the Communists. After Chiang's resignation the vice-president of the ROC, [[Li Zongren]], became China's acting president.

Shortly after Chiang's resignation the Communists halted their advances and attempted to negotiate the virtual surrender of the ROC. Li attempted to negotiate milder terms that would have ended the civil war, but without success. When it became clear that Li was unlikely to accept Mao's terms, the Communists issued an ultimatum in April 1949, warning that they would resume their attacks if Li did not agree within five days. Li refused.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. ''The Search for Modern China'', W.W. Norton and Company. 1999. {{ISBN|0-393-97351-4}}. p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

Li's attempts to carry out his policies faced varying degrees of opposition from Chiang's supporters, and were generally unsuccessful. Chiang especially antagonized Li by taking possession of (and moving to Taiwan) US$200&amp;nbsp;million of gold and US dollars belonging to the central government that Li desperately needed to cover the government's soaring expenses. When the Communists captured the Nationalist capital of Nanjing in April 1949, Li refused to accompany the central government as it fled to [[Guangdong]], instead expressing his dissatisfaction with Chiang by retiring to Guangxi.&lt;ref name="Gillin289"&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

The former warlord [[Yan Xishan]], who had fled to Nanjing only one month before, quickly insinuated himself within the Li-Chiang rivalry, attempting to have Li and Chiang reconcile their differences in the effort to resist the Communists. At Chiang's request Yan visited Li in order to convince Li not to withdraw from public life. Yan broke down in tears while talking of the loss of his home province of Shanxi to the Communists, and warned Li that the Nationalist cause was doomed unless Li went to Guangdong. Li agreed to return under the condition that Chiang surrender most of the gold and US dollars in his possession that belonged to the central government, and that Chiang stop overriding Li's authority. After Yan communicated these demands and Chiang agreed to comply with them, Li departed for Guangdong.&lt;ref name="Gillin289" /&gt;

In Guangdong, Li attempted to create a new government composed of both Chiang supporters and those opposed to Chiang. Li's first choice of premier was Chu Cheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang who had been virtually driven into exile due to his strong opposition to Chiang. After the Legislative Yuan rejected Chu, Li was obliged to choose Yan Xishan instead. By this time Yan was well known for his adaptability and Chiang welcomed his appointment.&lt;ref name="Gillin289" /&gt;

Conflict between Chiang and Li persisted. Although he had agreed to do so as a prerequisite of Li's return, Chiang refused to surrender more than a fraction of the wealth that he had sent to Taiwan. Without being backed by gold or foreign currency, the money issued by Li and Yan quickly declined in value until it became virtually worthless.&lt;ref name="Gillin290"&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not hold a formal executive position in the government, Chiang continued to issue orders to the army, and many officers continued to obey Chiang rather than Li. The inability of Li to coordinate KMT military forces led him to put into effect a plan of defense that he had contemplated in 1948. Instead of attempting to defend all of southern China, Li ordered what remained of the Nationalist armies to withdraw to Guangxi and Guangdong, hoping that he could concentrate all available defenses on this smaller, and more easily defensible, area. The object of Li's strategy was to maintain a foothold on the Chinese mainland in the hope that the United States would eventually be compelled to enter the war in China on the Nationalist side.&lt;ref name="Gillin290" /&gt;

==== Final Communist advance ====
Chiang opposed Li's plan of defense because it would have placed most of the troops still loyal to Chiang under the control of Li and Chiang's other opponents in the central government. To overcome Chiang's intransigence Li began ousting Chiang's supporters within the central government. Yan Xishan continued in his attempts to work with both sides, creating the impression among Li's supporters that he was a "stooge" of Chiang, while those who supported Chiang began to bitterly resent Yan for his willingness to work with Li. Because of the rivalry between Chiang and Li, Chiang refused to allow Nationalist troops loyal to him to aid in the defense of Kwangsi and Canton, with the result that Communist forces occupied Canton in October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, Donald G.  ''Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911–1949''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1967. p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

After Canton fell to the Communists, Chiang relocated the government to [[Chongqing|Chungking]], while Li effectively surrendered his powers and flew to New York for treatment of his chronic [[duodenum]] illness at the Hospital of [[Columbia University]]. Li visited the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], and denounced Chiang as a dictator and an usurper. Li vowed that he would "return to crush" Chiang once he returned to China. Li remained in exile, and did not return to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;"CHINA: Return of the Gimo".  ''Time Magazine''. Monday, Mar. 13, 1950. Retrieved at &lt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812143,00.html&gt; on May 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning of 10 December 1949, Communist troops laid siege to [[Chengdu|Chengtu]], the last KMT-controlled city in mainland China, where Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] directed the defense at the Chengtu Central Military Academy. Chiang Kai-shek, father and son, sang the Republic of China's national anthem while leaving the Academy all the way to the airfield.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The aircraft ''May-ling'' evacuated them to Taiwan on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek would never return to the mainland.

Chiang did not re-assume the presidency until 1 March 1950. On January 1952, Chiang commanded the [[Control Yuan]], now in Taiwan, to impeach Li in the "Case of Li Zongren's Failure to carry out Duties due to Illegal Conduct" (李宗仁違法失職案). Chiang relieved Li of the position as vice-president in the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] on March 1954.

{{See also|Republic of China Armed Forces|White Terror (Taiwan)}}

==== Preparations to retake the mainland ====
Chiang moved the government to [[Taipei]], Taiwan, where he resumed his duties as [[President of the Republic of China]] on 1 March 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2001/appendix1-1.htm#1950 ROC Chronology: Jan 1911&amp;nbsp;– Dec 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang was reelected by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] to be the President of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on 20 May 1954, and again in 1960, 1966, and 1972. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including the territories held by his government and the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]], as well as territory the latter ceded to foreign governments, such as [[Tuva]] and [[Outer Mongolia]]. In the context of the [[Cold War]], most of the Western world recognized this position and the ROC represented China [[China and the United Nations|in the United Nations]] and other international organizations until the 1970s.

During his presidency on Taiwan, Chiang continued making preparations in order to take back mainland China. He developed the ROC army in order to prepare for an invasion of the mainland, and to defend Taiwan in case of an attack by the Communist forces. He also financed armed groups in mainland China, such as Muslim soldiers of the ROC Army left in Yunnan under [[Li Mi (ROC general)|Li Mi]], who continued to fight. It was not until the 1980s that these troops were finally airlifted to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/chpt25-7.htm |title = Muslims in Taiwan |publisher = Government Information Office (ROC) |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070113214755/http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/2002/chpt25-7.htm |archivedate = 2007-01-13 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the Uyghur [[Yulbars Khan]] to Governor during the [[Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958)|Islamic insurgency on the mainland]] for resisting the Communists, even though the government had already evacuated to Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=yulbars%20calcutta%20%20taiwan |title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949 |author=Andrew D.

==== Regime ====
Despite the democratic constitution, the government under Chiang was a [[one-party state]], consisting almost completely of [[Mainlander (China)|mainlanders]]; the "[[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]" greatly enhanced executive powers, and the goal of [[Project National Glory|retaking mainland China]] allowed the KMT to maintain a monopoly on power and the prohibition of opposition parties. The government's official line for these martial law provisions stemmed from the claim that emergency provisions were necessary, since the Communists and KMT were still in a state of war. Seeking to promote [[Chinese nationalism]], Chiang's government actively ignored and suppressed local cultural expression, even forbidding the use of local languages in mass media broadcasts or during class sessions.

The first decades after the Nationalists moved the seat of government to the province of Taiwan are associated with the organized effort to resist Communism known as the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|"White Terror"]], during which about 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as "bandit spies" (匪諜), meaning spies for Chinese Communists, and punished as such.

Under Chiang, the government recognized limited civil and economic freedoms, property rights (personal{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and intellectual) and other liberties. Despite these restrictions, free debate within the confines of the legislature was permitted. Under the pretext that new elections could not be held in Communist-occupied constituencies, the National Assembly, [[Legislative Yuan]], and [[Control Yuan]] members held their posts indefinitely. The Temporary Provisions also allowed Chiang to remain as president beyond the two-term limit in the Constitution. He was reelected by the National Assembly as president four times—doing so in 1954, 1960, 1966, and 1972.

Believing that corruption and a lack of morals were key reasons that the KMT lost mainland China to the Communists, Chiang attempted to purge corruption by dismissing members of the KMT accused of graft. Some major figures in the previous mainland Chinese government, such as [[H. H. Kung]] and [[T. V. Soong]], exiled themselves to the United States. Although politically authoritarian and, to some extent, dominated by government-owned industries, Chiang's new Taiwanese state also encouraged economic development, especially in the export sector. A popular sweeping Land Reform Act, as well as American foreign aid during the 1950s, laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic success, becoming one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

After Chiang's death, the next president, Chiang's son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and Chiang Ching-kuo's successor, [[Lee Teng-hui]] a native Taiwanese, would, in the 1980s and 1990s, increase native Taiwanese representation in the government and loosen the many authoritarian controls of the early era of ROC control in Taiwan.

====Relationship with Japan====
In 1971, the Australian Opposition Leader [[Gough Whitlam]], who [[Australian federal election, 1972|became Prime Minister in 1972]] and [[Whitlam Government#Duumvirate|swiftly relocated the Australian mission from Taipei to Beijing]], visited Japan. After meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Eisaku Sato]], Whitlam observed that the reason Japan at that time was hesitant to withdraw recognition from the Nationalist government was "the presence of a treaty between the Japanese government and that of Chiang Kai-shek". Sato explained that the continued recognition of Japan towards the Nationalist government was due largely to the personal relationship that various members of the Japanese government felt towards Chiang. This relationship was rooted largely in the generous and lenient treatment of Japanese prisoners-of-war by the Nationalist government in the years immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, and was felt especially strongly as a bond of personal obligation by the most senior members then in power.&lt;ref name="Journal1"&gt;Gillin, Donald G. and Etter, Charles. "Staying On: Japanese Soldiers and Civilians in China, 1945–1948". ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 42, No. 3, May 1983. p. 516. {{jstor|2055515}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Japan recognized the People's Republic in 1972, shortly after [[Kakuei Tanaka]] succeeded Sato as Prime Minister of Japan, the memory of this relationship was strong enough to be reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' (15 April 1978) as a significant factor inhibiting trade between Japan and the mainland. There is speculation that a clash between Communist forces and a Japanese warship in 1978 was caused by Chinese anger after Prime Minister [[Takeo Fukuda]] attended Chiang's funeral. Historically, Japanese attempts to normalize their relationship with the People's Republic were met with accusations of ingratitude in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Journal1" /&gt;

====Relationship with the United States====
Chiang was suspicious that [[Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Operations|covert operatives of the United States]] plotted a [[Coup d'état|coup]] against him. In 1950, Chiang Ching-kuo became director of the [[secret police]] ([[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]]), which he remained until 1965. Chiang was also suspicious of politicians who were overly friendly to the United States, and considered them his enemies. In 1953, seven days after surviving an assassination attempt, [[Wu Kuo-chen]] lost his position as governor of Taiwan Province to [[Chiang Ching-kuo]]. After fleeing to United States the same year, he became a vocal critic of Chiang's family and government.&lt;ref name="Peter R. Moody 1977 302"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AW9yrtekFRkC&amp;pg=PA302 |title=Opposition and dissent in contemporary China |author=Peter R. Moody |year=1977 |publisher=Hoover Press |page=302 |isbn =0-8179-6771-0 |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Ching-kuo, educated in the Soviet Union, initiated [[Soviet military academies|Soviet-style military organization]] in the Republic of China Military. He reorganized and [[Sovietized]] the [[Political officer (military)|political officer corps]], and propagated [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang|Kuomintang ideology]] throughout the military. [[Sun Li-jen]], who was educated at the American [[Virginia Military Institute]], was opposed to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5R2fnVZXiwC&amp;pg=PA195 |title=The Generalissimo's son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the revolutions in China and Taiwan|author=Jay Taylor |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=195 |isbn =0-674-00287-3 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang Ching-kuo orchestrated the controversial court-martial and arrest of General [[Sun Li-jen]] in August 1955, for plotting a coup d'état with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) against his father Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The CIA allegedly wanted to help Sun take control of Taiwan and declare its independence.&lt;ref name="Peter R.

===Death===
{{See also|Cihu Mausoleum}}
[[File:CKS Memorial Square.jpg|thumb|Memorial Hall and Square in Taipei]]

In 1975, 26 years after Chiang came to Taiwan, he died in Taipei at the age of 87. He had suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[pneumonia]] in the foregoing months and died from [[renal failure]] aggravated with advanced cardiac malfunction on April 5.

A month of mourning was declared. Chinese music composer [[Hwang Yau-tai]] wrote the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song]]. In mainland China, however, Chiang's death was met with little apparent mourning and Communist state-run newspapers gave the brief headline "Chiang Kai-shek Has Died." Chiang's body was put in a copper coffin and temporarily interred at his favorite residence in [[Cihu Mausoleum|Cihu]], [[Daxi District|Daxi]], [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]]. When his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] died in 1988, he was entombed in a separate mausoleum in nearby [[Touliao Mausoleum|Touliao]] (頭寮). The hope was to have both buried at their birthplace in Fenghua if and when it was possible. In 2004, [[Chiang Fang-liang]], the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo, asked that both father and son be buried at [[Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery]] in [[Xizhi]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City). Chiang's ultimate funeral ceremony became a political battle between the wishes of the state and the wishes of his family.

Chiang was succeeded as President by [[Vice President of the Republic of China|Vice President]] [[Yen Chia-kan]] and as Kuomintang party ruler by his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], who retired Chiang Kai-shek's title of Director-General and instead assumed the position of Chairman. Yen's presidency was interim; Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]], became President after Yen's term ended three years later.

The Kuomintang used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies, and promoted [[Martyrdom in Chinese culture]]. Kuomintang ideology promoted the view that the souls of Party martyrs who died fighting for the Kuomintang, the revolution, and the party founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen were sent to heaven.

When the Northern Expedition was complete, Kuomintang Generals led by Chiang Kai-shek paid tribute to Dr. Sun's soul in heaven with a sacrificial ceremony at the Xiangshan Temple in Beijing in July 1928.

Chiang's legacy has been the target of heated debates because of the different views held about him. For some, Chiang was a national hero who led the victorious [[Northern Expedition]] against the [[Beiyang government|Beiyang Warlords]] in 1927, achieving [[Chinese reunification (1928)|Chinese unification]], and who subsequently led China to ultimate victory against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945. Some blamed him for not doing enough against the Japanese forces in the lead-up to, and during, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], preferring to withhold his armies for the fight against the Communists, or merely waiting and hoping that the United States would get involved. Some also see him as a champion of [[anti-Communism]], being a key figure during the formative years of the [[World Anti-Communist League]]. During the [[Cold War]], he was also seen as the leader who led [[Free area of the Republic of China|Free China]] and the bulwark against a possible Communist invasion. However, Chiang presided over purges, political authoritarianism, and graft during his tenure in mainland China, and ruled throughout a period of imposed [[martial law]]. His governments were accused of being corrupt even before he even took power in 1928. He also allied with known criminals like [[Du Yuesheng]] for political and financial gains. Some opponents charge that Chiang's efforts in developing Taiwan were mostly to make the island a strong base from which to one day return to mainland China, and that Chiang had little regard for the long-term prosperity and well-being of the [[Taiwanese people]].

Today, Chiang's popularity in Taiwan is divided along political lines, enjoying greater support among Kuomintang (KMT) supporters. He is generally unpopular among [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) voters and supporters who blame him for the thousands killed during the [[February 28 Incident]] and criticise his subsequent dictatorial rule.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Chiang Kai-shek’s former homes are open to tourists|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21730036-visitors-china-and-taiwan-have-very-different-views-late-dictator-chiang-kai-sheks-former|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sharp contrast to his son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], and to [[Sun Yat-sen]], his memory is rarely invoked by current political parties, including the Kuomintang.  In contrast, his image has been rehabilitated in contemporary Mainland China.  Until recently portrayed as a villain who fought against the "liberation" of China by the Communists, since the 2000s, he has been portrayed by the media in a neutral or slightly positive light as a Chinese nationalist who tried to bring about national unification and resisted the Japanese invasion during World War II.  This shift is largely in response to current political landscape of Taiwan, in relation to Chiang's commitment to a unified China and his stance against Taiwanese separatism during his rule of the island, along with the recent détente between the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chiang's KMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/03/assassinating-chiang-kai-shek-china-taiwan-japan-world-war-2/|title=Assassinating Chiang Kai-shek|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|date=3 September 2015|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to efforts to remove his public monuments in Taiwan, his ancestral home in Fenghua, Zhejiang on the Mainland has become a commemorative museum and major tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/8321/retake-the-mainland-chiang-kai-shek-bronze-marches-on-zhejiang-hometown|title='Retake the Mainland': Chiang Kai-shek bronze marches on Zhejiang hometown|last=Kilpatrick|first=Ryan|date=13 January 2015|website=That's Magazine|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Chiang was often perceived negatively as the one who lost China to the Communists. His constant demands for Western support and funding also earned him the nickname of "General Cash-My-Check". In the West he has been criticized for his poor military skills. He had a record of issuing unrealistic orders and persistently attempting to fight unwinnable battles, leading to the loss of his best troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fenby |first=Jonathan |title=History of Modern China |page = 279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been an attempt to find a more moderate interpretation of Chiang. Chiang is now increasingly perceived as a man simply overwhelmed by the events in China, having to fight simultaneously Communists, Japanese, and provincial warlords while having to reconstruct and unify the country. His sincere, albeit often unsuccessful attempts to build a more powerful nation have been noted by scholars such as [[Jonathan Fenby]] and [[Rana Mitter]]. Mitter has observed that, ironically, today's China is closer to Chiang's vision than to [[Mao Zedong]]'s. He argues that the Communists, since the 1980s, have essentially created the state envisioned by Chiang in the 1930s. Mitter concludes by writing that "one can imagine Chiang Kai-shek's ghost wandering round China today nodding in approval, while Mao's ghost follows behind him, moaning at the destruction of his vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mitter|first=Rana|title=Modern China|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liang Shuming]] opined that Chiang Kai-shek's "greatest contribution was to make the CCP successful. If he had been a bit more trustworthy, if his character was somewhat better, the CCP would have been unable to beat him".&lt;ref&gt;In an interview reported in "Has Man a Future?", p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Formosa Betrayed (film)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', one of the few American movies concerning the process of democratization in Taiwan, depicts Chiang Kai-shek as a brutal dictator, responsible for the execution of thousands of native Taiwanese during the days following the [[February 28 Incident]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In an [[arranged marriage]], Chiang was married to a fellow villager named [[Mao Fumei]]. While married to Mao, Chiang adopted two [[concubine]]s (concubinage was still a common practice for well-to-do, non-Christian males in China): he married Yao Yecheng (姚冶誠, 1889–1972) in 1912 and [[Chen Jieru]] (陳潔如, 1906–1971) in December 1921. While he was still living in Shanghai, Chiang and Yao adopted a son, [[Chiang Wei-kuo|Wei-kuo]]. Chen adopted a daughter in 1924, named Yaoguang (瑤光), who later adopted her mother's surname. Chen's autobiography refuted the idea that she was a concubine.&lt;ref name="CCJ93"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ch'en |first1=Chieh-ju |last2=Lee |first2=James |editor1-last=Eastman |editor1-first=Lloyd E. |date=1993 |title = Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past: The Memoir of His Second Wife, Ch'en Chieh-ju |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IDbvAzXCBH8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Westview Press |page= |isbn = 0-8133-1824-6 |accessdate = {{date|2014-11-10|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen claiming that, by the time she married Chiang, he had already divorced Yao, and that Chen was therefore his wife. Chiang and Mao had a son, [[Chiang Ching-kuo|Ching-kuo]].

According to the memoirs of Chen Jieru, Chiang's second wife, she contracted [[gonorrhea]] from Chiang soon after their marriage. He told her that he acquired this disease after separating from his first wife and living with his concubine Yao Yecheng, as well as with many other women he consorted with. His doctor explained to her that Chiang had sex with her before completing his treatment for the disease. As a result, both Chiang and Ch'en Chieh-ju believed they had become sterile, which would explain why he had only one child, by his first wife; however, a purported miscarriage by Soong Mei-ling in August 1928 would, if it actually occurred, cast serious doubt on whether this was true.&lt;ref name="The Generalissimo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Past''. pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family tree ===

The Xikou (Chikow) Chiangs were descended from Chiang Shih-chieh who during the 1600s (17th century) moved there from Fenghua district, whose ancestors in turn came to southeastern China's Zhejiang (Chekiang) province after moving out of Northern China in the 13th century AD.

== Religion and relationships with religious communities ==

Chiang personally dealt extensively with religions and power figures in China during his regime.

=== Religious views ===
Chiang Kai-shek was born and raised as a [[Buddhist]], but became a [[Methodist]] upon his marriage to his fourth wife, [[Soong Mei-ling]], due to pressure from her mother.&lt;ref name="Jay Taylor 2009 p. 2"&gt;Jay Taylor. ''The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-Shek and the Struggle for Modern China.'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,  2009) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Muslims ===
[[File:Chiang Kaishek with Muslim General Ma Fushou.jpg|thumb|Chiang Kai-shek with the Muslim General [[Ma Fushou]]]]

Chiang developed relationships with other generals. Chiang became a [[sworn brother]] of the Chinese Muslim general [[Ma Fuxiang]] and appointed him to high ranking positions.

When Chiang became President of China after the [[Northern Expedition]], he carved out [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]] out of Gansu province, and appointed Muslim generals as military governors of all three provinces: [[Ma Hongkui]], [[Ma Hongbin]], and [[Ma Qi]]. The three Muslim governors, known as [[Xibei San Ma]] (lit. "the three [[Ma clique|Mas]] of the [[Northwestern China|Northwest]]"), controlled armies composed entirely of Muslims. Chiang called on the three and their suboordinates to wage war against the Soviet peoples, Tibetans, Communists, and the Japanese. Chiang continued to appoint Muslims as governors of the three provinces, including [[Ma Lin (warlord)|Ma Lin]] and [[Ma Fushou]]. Chiang's appointments, the first time that Muslims had been appointed as governors of Gansu, increased the prestige of Muslim officials in northwestern China. The armies raised by this "Ma Clique", most notably their Muslim cavalry, were incorporated into the KMT army. Chiang appointed a Muslim general, [[Bai Chongxi]], as the Minister of National Defence of the Republic of China, which controlled the ROC military.

Chiang also supported the Muslim General Ma Zhongying, whom he had trained at [[Whampoa Military Academy]] during the [[Kumul Rebellion]], in a [[Jihad]] against [[Jin Shuren]], [[Sheng Shicai]], and the Soviet Union during the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]]. Chiang designated Ma's Muslim army as the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] and gave his troops [[Kuomintang]] flags and uniforms. Chiang then supported Muslim General Ma Hushan against [[Sheng Shicai]] and the Soviet Union in the [[Xinjiang War (1937)]]. All Muslim generals commissioned by Chiang in the National Revolutionary Army swore allegiance to him. Several, like [[Ma Shaowu]] and Ma Hushan were loyal to Chiang and Kuomintang hardliners.

The [[Ili Rebellion]] and [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]] plagued relations with the Soviet Union during Chiang's rule and caused trouble with the Uyghurs. During the Ili Rebellion and Peitashan incident, Chiang deployed [[Hui people|Hui]] troops against [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] mobs in Turfan, and against Soviet Russian and Mongols at Peitashan.

During Chiang's rule, attacks on foreigners by Kuomintang forces flared up in several incidents. One of these was the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] where a Muslim army loyal to the Kuomintang massacred 4,500 Uyghurs, and killed several British at the British consulate in Kashgar. The British were unable to retaliate.

[[Hu Songshan]], a Muslim Imam, backed Chiang Kai-shek's regime and gave prayers for his government. ROC flags were saluted by Muslims in Ningxia during prayer along with exhortations to nationalism during Chiang's rule. Chiang sent Muslim students abroad to study at places like [[Al Azhar]] and Muslim schools throughout China taught loyalty to his regime.

The Yuehua, a Chinese Muslim publication, quoted the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] to justify submitting to Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of China, and as justification for Jihad in the war against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MJzB6wrz6Q4C |title=Intellectuals in the modern Islamic world: transmission, transformation, communication |author1=Stéphane A.

The [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the Chiang government during Chiang's regime. Other Muslim sects, like the [[Xidaotang]] and Sufi brotherhoods like Jahriyya and Khuffiya were also supported by his regime. The Chinese Muslim Association, a pro-Kuomintang and anti-Communist organization, was set up by Muslims working in his regime. [[Salafism]] attempted to gain a foothold in China during his regime, but the Yihewani and Hanafi Sunni [[Gedimu]] denounced the Salafis as radicals, engaged in fights against them, and declared them heretics, forcing the Salafis to form a separate sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uHjR3yeIWzUC&amp;pg=PA127 |title = Muslim diversity: local Islam in global contexts |author = Leif O.

[[Ma Buqing]] was another Muslim General who fled to Taiwan along with Chiang. His government donated money to build the [[Taipei Grand Mosque]] on Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeimosque.org.tw/index.php?categoryid=9]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with Buddhists and Christians ===
Chiang had uneasy relations with the [[Tibetans]]. He fought against them in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], and he supported the Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]] in his war against Tibetan rebels in [[Qinghai]]. Chiang ordered Ma Bufang to prepare his Islamic army to invade [[Tibet]] several times, to deter [[Tibetan independence]], and threatened them with aerial bombardment.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} After the war, Chiang appointed Ma Bufang as ambassador to [[Saudi Arabia]].

Chiang incorporated [[Methodist]] values into the [[New Life Movement]] under the influence of his wife. Dancing and Western music were discouraged. In one incident, several youths splashed acid on people wearing Western clothing, although Chiang was not directly responsible for these incidents. Despite being a Methodist, he made reference to the [[Buddha]] in his diary, and encouraged the establishment of a Buddhist political party under Master [[Taixu]].

According to [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] some of their members travelled to [[Chonqqing]] and spoke to him personally while distributing their literature there during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/302013001#h=30:572-30:914]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizaphan Ntakirutimana''' (1924, in [[Kibuye, Rwanda]]&amp;nbsp;– January 22, 2007 in [[Arusha, Tanzania]]) was a pastor of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in [[Rwanda]] and was the first [[clergy]]man to be convicted for a role in the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].

In February 2003, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] found both Ntakirutimana and his son Dr. Gérard, a physician who had completed graduate work in the US prior to returning to Rwanda, guilty of [[genocide]] committed in [[Rwanda]] in 1994. The Tribunal found it proven beyond reasonable doubt that Ntakirutimana, himself belonging to the [[Hutu]] ethnicity, had transported armed attackers to the Mugonero complex, where they killed hundreds of [[Tutsi]] refugees. Ntakirutimana was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/20/rorycarroll1 Guilty of Murder] Retrieved August 10, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted on the basis of eyewitness accounts.  A number of the convictions were overturned on appeal but the sentence was unchanged. He was released on December 6, 2006 after serving 10 years under arrest or in prison, and died the following month.

A letter addressed to Ntakirutimana by Tutsi Seventh-day Adventist pastors, which he showed to author [[Philip Gourevitch]], provided the title for Gourevitch's 1998 book ''[[We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families]]''. The book accuses Ntakirutimana of complicity in the deaths of the refugees.

Elizaphan Ntakirutimana died on January 22, 2007, aged 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=82 ICTR Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">[[Image:EsopusTreaty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|First page of the 1665 treaty, prohibiting violence between "Christians" and "Indyans"]]
The '''Esopus tribe''' (pr. es-SOAP-es)&lt;ref&gt;considering the title of "An Agreement made between Richard Nicolls Esq. Governor under his Royal Highness the Duke of Yorke and the Sachems and People called the Sopes Indyans" from 1665, shown at right&lt;/ref&gt; was a tribe of [[Lenape]] (Delaware) [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were native to [[Upstate New York]], specifically the region of the [[Catskill Mountains]]. Their lands included modern-day [[Ulster County|Ulster]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties.

The tribe fought a series of conflicts against settlers from the [[New Netherland]] colony from September 1659 to September 1663, known as the [[Esopus Wars]], in and around [[Kingston, New York]].  At the conclusion of the conflict, the tribe sold large tracts of land to French [[Huguenot]] refugees in [[New Paltz, New York|New Paltz]] and other communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huguenotstreet.org/library_archives/exhibits_research/indian_affairs.php Eric Roth, "Relations between the Huguenots of New Paltz, N.Y. and the Esopus Indians"], Huguenot Historical Society, (10/8/1998, Revised 3/15/1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Descendants of the Esopus tribe now live on the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]] reservation in [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]] and among the [[Munsee]] Delaware of [[Ontario]], Canada.  Historians believe surviving Esopus joined with the [[Ramapough Mountain Indians]] of New Jersey following the wars, as well as some [[Wappinger]] people after [[Kieft's War]] in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Lenape — Archaeology, History, and Ethnography |author =Kraft, Herbert C.|year = 1986| page=241|publisher = New Jersey Historical Society | isbn = 0-911020-14-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco Ignacio Madero González''' ({{IPA-es|fɾanˈsisko igˈnasjo maˈðeɾo ɣonˈsales}}; 30 October 1873 – 22 February 1913) was a Mexican [[revolutionary]], writer and [[Public figure|statesman]] who served as the 33rd [[president of Mexico]] from 1911 until his assassination in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flores Rangel, Juan José. ''Historia de Mexico 2'', p. 86. Cengage Learning Editores, 2003, {{ISBN|970-686-185-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Ronald M. ''Latin American Political History'', p. 168. Westview Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8133-4341-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presidentes.mx/presidentes/francisco-i-madero|title=Francisco I. Madero - 38° Presidente de México|website=presidentes.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an advocate for [[social justice]] and democracy. Madero was notable for challenging Mexican President [[Porfirio Díaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Born into an extremely wealthy landowning family in northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio Díaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, 20th-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the Anti-Reelectionist Party (later the [[Progressive Constitutionalist Party (Mexico)|Progressive Constitutional Party]]) and urged Mexicans to rise up against Díaz, which ignited the Mexican Revolution in 1910.

Madero's candidacy against Díaz garnered widespread support in Mexico, since he was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose Díaz when it was dangerous to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested by the dictatorship shortly after being declared presidential candidate by his party, the opposition leader escaped from prison and launched the [[Plan of San Luis Potosí]] from the United States, in this manner beginning the Mexican Revolution.

Following the resignation of Díaz from the presidency on 25 May 1911 after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez]], Madero became the highest political leader of the country. Known as "Maderistas", Madero's followers referred to him as the "caudillo de la Revolución" (leader of the Revolution). He was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38. Despite his considerable popularity amongst the people, Madero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from remnants of the former regime.

In February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[José María Pino Suárez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Trágica''). The death of Madero and Pino Suárez led to a national and international outcry which eventually paved the way for the fall of the Huerta Dictatorship, the triumph of the Mexican Revolution and the establishment of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] under ''Maderista'' President [[Venustiano Carranza]].

==Family and early years, 1873–1903==
Madero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hernández and Mercedes González Treviño, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ygnacio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&amp;catid=3:revolucion&amp;Itemid=13|title=Revolución / Francisco I. Madero: con "I" de Ignacio, por Alejandro Rosas|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.bicentenario.gob.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His family has been described as one of the five wealthiest families in Mexico. His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, started as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from Texas during the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, he first married Rafaela Hernández Lombraña, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hernández. Alongside his brother in law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compañía Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&amp;nbsp;million U.S. dollars&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stanley R. ''Francisco I. Madero, Apostle of Democracy''. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). After widowing from his first wife, and having built his success, he remarried to doña Manuela de Farías Benavides, member of one of northern Mexico's most aristocratic families, daughter of don Juan Francisco de Farías, mayor of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. Evaristo Madero also served as governor of Coahuila from 1880 to 1884,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; during the four-year [[interregnum]] of Porfirio Díaz's rule, but was permanently sidelined from political office when Díaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. From both his wives, Evaristo Madero produced a total of 18 children, 14 of which would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican family with long-standing issues with the Díaz regime.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

Francisco and his brother [[Gustavo A. Madero]] attended the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Saltillo]], but his early Catholic education had little lasting impact. Instead, his father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. As a young man, Madero's father sent him to the [[HEC Paris|École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC). During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]]. He then attended high school at [[Culver Academies]]. Following business school, Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] ideas of [[Annie Besant]], which were prominent at nearby [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 247"&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, the 20-year-old Madero returned to Mexico and assumed management of the Madero family's [[hacienda]] at [[San Pedro, Coahuila]]. Well traveled and well educated, he was now in robust health.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 247"/&gt; He installed new irrigation, introduced American cotton, and built a soap factory and also an ice factory. He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Raúl, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mr and Mrs Francisco Indalecio Madero cph.3b47072.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco I. Madero with his wife, Sara Pérez]]
Already well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he built a personal fortune of 500,000{{what|date=June 2017}} by 1899.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 247"/&gt; The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed as someone who should be under the authority of his elders. As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1903, he married Sara Pérez, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; From all accounts it was a happy marriage, but they had no children.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Career==
===Introduction to politics, 1903–1908===
[[File:Benito Juarez Presidente.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Benito Juárez]] (1806–1872), President of Mexico 1858–1872. Madero founded the Benito Juárez Democratic Club in 1904. Madero believed that, as a [[mediumship|medium]], he was in contact with the [[spirit]] of Benito Juárez.]]
On 2 April 1903, [[Bernardo Reyes]], governor of [[Nuevo León]], violently crushed a political demonstration, an example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of president [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Raúl, he decided to act.&lt;ref&gt;Madero had another brother, also named Raúl, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of Raúl told him, "Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.&lt;/ref&gt; Madero founded the [[Benito Juárez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 249"&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the government of Porfirio Díaz. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Demócrata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', "The Fly"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio Díaz in the 1905 governmental elections. Díaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 249"/&gt;

===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement, 1908–1909===
[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1830–1915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]
In an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President Díaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.

Madero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Juárez himself.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, published in late 1908, was titled ''La sucesión presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man – Porfirio Díaz – for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio Díaz's political slogan had been "No Re-election". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio Díaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelección'' ("Valid Voting, No Re-election").  Porfirio Díaz could either run in a free election or retire.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Madero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property – often at a considerable loss – in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[José Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 253"&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serdán]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.&lt;ref&gt;LaFrance, David G. "Aquiles Serdán" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Madero traveled throughout Mexico giving anti-reelectionist speeches, and everywhere he went he was greeted by crowds of thousands.  His candidacy cost him financially, since he sold much of his property at a loss to back his campaign.&lt;ref name="Krauze, p. 253"/&gt;
[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|left|"Manifestación antireeleccionista" by [[José Guadalupe Posada]]]]
In spite of the attacks by Madero and his earlier statements to the contrary, Díaz ran for re-election. In a show of U.S. support, Díaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.&lt;ref name="Harris2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

On the day of the summit, [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the celebrated scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], discovered a man holding a concealed [[Protector Palm Pistol|palm pistol]] along the procession route and they disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.&lt;ref name="Harris2009"/&gt;

The Porfirian regime reacted to Madero by placing pressure on the Madero family's banking interests, and at one point even issued a warrant for Madero's arrest on the grounds of "unlawful transaction in rubber".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Madero was not arrested, though, apparently in part to the intervention of Díaz's finance minister, [[José Ives Limantour]], a friend of the Madero family.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1910, the Anti-Re-electionist Party met and selected Madero as their nominee for [[President of Mexico]].

During the convention, a meeting between Madero and Díaz was arranged by the governor of Veracruz, [[Teodoro Dehesa]] and took place in Díaz's residence on 16 April 1910. Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero's own in correspondence. A political solution and compromise might have been possible, with Madero withdrawing his candidacy.&lt;ref name="Ross, p. 100"&gt;Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear to Madero that Díaz was a decrepit old man, out of touch politically, and unaware of the extent of formal political opposition.&lt;ref name="Ross, p. 100"/&gt; The meeting was important for strengthening Madero's resolve that political compromise was not possible and he is quoted as saying "Porfirio is not an imposing chief. Nevertheless, it will be necessary to start a revolution to overthrow him. But who will crush it afterwards?"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Madero was worried that Porfirio Díaz would not willingly relinquish office, warned his supporters of the possibility of electoral fraud and proclaimed that "Force shall be met by force!"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the Mexican Revolution, 1910–1911===
[[File:Francisco I Madero campaigning.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Francisco I. Madero campaigns from the back of a railway car in 1910.]]
Madero campaigned across the country on a message of reform and met with numerous supporters. Resentful of the "peaceful invasion" from the United States "which came to control 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land," Mexico's poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zeit |first=Joshua |date=4 February 2017 |title=The Last Time the U.S. Invaded Mexico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/the-last-time-the-us-invaded-mexico-214738 |magazine=Politico Magazine |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in [[Monterrey]] and sent him to a prison in [[San Luis Potosí City|San Luis Potosí]]. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco Vázquez Gómez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held that gave Díaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.

Madero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 7 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. He was then smuggled across the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.

Madero set up shop in [[San Antonio]], Texas, and quickly issued his [[Plan of San Luis Potosí]], which had been written during his time in prison, partly with the help of [[Ramón López Velarde]]. The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the "illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of Díaz". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners.

The family drew on resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A. Madero]] hiring the law firm of Washington lawyer [[Sherburne Hopkins]], the "world's best rigger of Latin American revolutions" to foment support in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, John Jr. "The Mexican Revolution" in ''Mexico Since Independence''. Leslie Bethell, ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy to discredit Díaz with U.S. business and the U.S. government did meet some success, with Standard Oil engaging in talks with Gustavo Madero, but more importantly, the U.S. government "bent neutrality laws for the revolutionaries."&lt;ref&gt;Womack, "The Mexican Revolution", p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Senate held hearings in 1913 as to whether the U.S. had any role in fomenting revolution in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, Peter. ''The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1914: The Diplomacy of Anglo-American Conflict''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968, p. 77 citing United States, Congress, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations: Revolutions in Mexico, United States Senate, Sixty-Second Congress, Second Session pursuant to S. Res. 335...&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins gave testimony that "he did not believe that it cost the Maderos themselves more than $400,000 gold", with the aggregate cost being $1,500,000US.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, ''The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1914'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 1910, Madero arrived at the border and planned to meet up with 400 men raised by his uncle Catarino to launch an attack on Ciudad Porfirio Díaz (modern-day [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila]]). However, his uncle showed up late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Raúl (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.

In February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting (although this was later denied)&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Herald, Volume 33, Number 56, 26 November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[Máximo Castillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Máximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=Máximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Valdés|editor-first=Jesús Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].
[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|right|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]

On 1 April 1911, Porfirio Díaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President Díaz and Vice-President [[Ramón Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&amp;nbsp;– they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with Díaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Juárez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively and on 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez]] was signed.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez, Díaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with Díaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco León de la Barra]], taking over as interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.

This first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with Díaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting "''¡Viva Madero!''"

===Interim Presidency of Francisco León de la Barra, May–November 1911===
Although Madero had forced Porfirio Díaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, he pursued a moderate policy, leaving Francisco León de la Barra, one of Díaz's supporters, as president. He also left in place the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom Díaz had handpicked for the 1910 election.
[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco León de la Barra]] (1863–1939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]
Madero now called for the disbanding of all revolutionary forces, arguing that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the Díaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potosí would be carried out when Madero became president.

However, in Madero's absence, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] had appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the "[[Attila]] of the South". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federals moved violently into Yautepec de Zaragoza. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. However, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.

Before becoming president, Madero published another book, this one under the pseudonym of [[Bhima]] (one of Arjuna's brothers in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'') called a ''Spiritualist Manual''.

===Madero as president of Mexico, November 1911 – February 1913===
[[File:El presidente Francisco I. Madero y su estado mayor presidencial (c. 1911), de Agustín Víctor Casasola.tif|thumbnail|right|Madero and his presidential military staff, 1911]]
[[File:Bernardo Reyes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bernardo Reyes]] (1850–1913), whose brutality as [[Governor of Nuevo León]] in 1903 resulted in Madero's politicization, and who launched a rebellion against Madero in [[Nuevo León]] in December 1911.]]
Madero became president in November 1911, and, intending to reconcile the nation, appointed a cabinet which included many of Porfirio Díaz's supporters. However, Madero was unable to achieve the reconciliation he desired since conservative Porfirians had managed to get themselves organized during the interim presidency of Francisco León de la Barra and now mounted a sustained and effective opposition to Madero's reform program. Conservative Porfirians in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly reconciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms: thus, on 25 November 1911, [[Emiliano Zapata]] issued his [[Plan of Ayala]], denouncing Madero for being uninterested in pursuing land reform.

After years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to criticize Madero's performance as president harshly. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that "the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle."  Francisco Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship.

The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of three rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president:

(1) In December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio Díaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because Díaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo León]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes' rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo León]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].
[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850–1916), general who defeated the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912. Huerta quarreled with Madero over the insubordination of [[Pancho Villa]] and ultimately turned against Madero during the ''[[Decena trágica]]''.]]

(2) In March 1912, Madero's former general [[Pascual Orozco]], who was personally resentful of how Madero had treated him, launched a rebellion in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] with the financial backing of [[Luis Terrazas]], a former [[Governor of Chihuahua]] who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Madero despatched troops under General José González Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops.  General José González Salas committed suicide and [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.
[[File:Félix Díaz.JPG|thumb|right|120px|[[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]] (1868–1945), nephew of [[Porfirio Díaz]], who launched a rebellion against Madero in 1912.  Félix Díaz would later conspire with [[Victoriano Huerta]] during the ''[[Decena trágica]]''.]]
Relations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[División del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.

(3) In October 1912, [[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]] (nephew of Porfirio Díaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], "to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero." This rebellion was quickly crushed and Félix Díaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have Félix Díaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that Félix Díaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.

Besides managing rebellions, Madero did have a number of accomplishments during his presidency:

# He created the Department of Labor; introduced regulation of the labor practices in the textile industry; and oversaw the creation of the ''Casa del Obrero Mundial'' ("House of the World Worker"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] connections, that would play a major role in the subsequent Mexican labor movement.
# Although not as radical as the Zapatistas would have liked, Madero did introduce some agrarian reforms, such as a reorganization of rural credit and the creation of agricultural stations.
# He launched an infrastructure program, building schools, railroads, and new highways.
# He introduced new taxation on foreign oil companies.
# He launched a modest programme of school lunches for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Mexican History'' by Michael C. Meyer and William L. Sherman&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overthrow of Madero===
[[File:Ciudadela.png|thumb|250px|left|Citizens throng around The Citadel (''La ciudadela'') building during ''La decena tragica'' in 1913.]]
{{Main|La decena trágica}}

In early 1913, [[Victoriano Huerta]], the commander of the armed forces conspired with [[Félix Díaz (politician)|Félix Díaz]] (Porfirio Díaz's nephew), [[Bernardo Reyes]], and [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|US Ambassador]] [[Henry Lane Wilson]] against Madero, which culminated in a ten-day siege of La Ciudadela known as ''[[La decena tragica]]'' (the Tragic Ten Days). Madero accepted Huerta's "protection" from the Díaz/Reyes forces, only to be betrayed by Huerta and arrested. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'état on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascuráin]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.

==Death==
Following his enforced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[José María Pino Suárez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&amp;nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Suárez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Captain Francisco Cárdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]]. The journalists on foot were outdistanced by the motor vehicles, which were driven towards the penitentiary. The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Suárez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Captain Cárdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution! Mexico 1910–20'', pp. 142–143, 586 03669 5&lt;/ref&gt; This account was treated with general disbelief, although the American ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], a strong supporter of Huerta, reported to Washington that, "I am disposed to accept the (Huerta) government's version of the affair and consider it a closed incident".

President Madero, dead at 39, was buried quietly in the French cemetery of Mexico City. A series of contemporary photographs taken by Manuel Ramos show Maderos's coffin being carried from the penitentiary and placed on a special funeral tram car for transportation to the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.smu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/mex/id/138/rec/38|title=President Madero's coffin being placed in funeral car, Mexico City :: Mexico - Photographs, Manuscripts, and Imprints|website=digitalcollections.smu.edu|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only his close family were permitted to attend, leaving for Cuba immediately after. Ambassador Wilson was later dismissed from his position after US president Woodrow Wilson took office. Following Huerta's overthrow, Francisco Cárdenas fled to Guatemala where he committed suicide in 1920 after the new Mexican government had requested his extradition to stand trial for the murder of Madero.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Ronald.

==Memorials and references in popular culture==
On the morning of 8 December 1914, [[Pancho Villa|Francisco "Pancho" Villa]] declared that the street leading from the Zócalo in Mexico City towards the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] would be named after Madero. Still officially called [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue]], but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city. It was [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianised]] in 2009.

Mexican artist [[José Guadalupe Posada]] created an [[etching]] for a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/artgallery/exhibitions/2001/posada/Porfiriato/C50.html|title=C50 Calavera de D.

Madero appears in the films ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1934), ''[[Villa Rides]]'' (1968) and ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952).

In the novel ''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' (1996) by [[James Carlos Blake]], Madero is a major character.

== First president to fly in an airplane ==

President Madero has the unique distinction of being the first head of state in the world to ever fly in an airplane, which he did with the [[Wright Brothers]] in [[North Carolina]] on 30 November 1911. Despite the fact that [[Theodore Roosevelt]] beat him by a little over a year, Roosevelt was no longer president but was already succeeded by [[William H.

'''Frederick "Ted" William Holiday''' (1921–1979) was an English [[journalist]], [[Angling|angler]], [[cryptozoologist]] and wildlife specialist.

Motivated by the early 1930s media reports, Holiday would dedicate the rest of his life to investigating the [[Loch Ness monster]]. In the 1960s, Holiday became a member of the [[Loch Ness Investigation Bureau]]. After several hundred hours of watching the Loch, Holiday claims that he reported four unidentified sightings. In his 1968 book, ''The Great Orm of Loch Ness'', Holiday postulated that the creature in the Loch was an [[invertebrate]] creature similar in form to the extinct ''[[Tullimonstrum gregarium]]'', but vastly larger.

Holiday also claimed that he noticed several unusual coincidences, including camera malfunction during certain [[Nessie]] sightings. For example, in August 1968, even though there were several witnesses along the shore, "Nessie" chose to appear in one of the very few places that were obscured from the various cameras. Holiday reported, "The observers were watchful and keen but they had seen nothing. The phenomenon had concealed itself so there was nothing for them to see."

By 1972, Holiday modified his initial hypothesis that the Loch Ness monster was a literal physical animal. In his second book, ''The Dragon and the Disc'', Holiday postulates that there are certain commonalities between [[paranormal]] phenomena and certain reported sightings on the Loch. Holiday also believed that there is a relationship between ancient dragon legends and contemporary [[UFO]] phenomena. Though he maintained in the book that he still believed that the monster was an invertebrate animal, there was a paranormal aspect to it reminiscent of ancient [[Water Horse]] legends which he could not fully explain.

His final work, ''The Goblin Universe'', was published posthumously and includes an introduction by Colin Wilson.

'''Friedrich Kapp''' (13 April 1824 – 27 October 1884) was a [[German-American]] [[lawyer]], [[writer]], and politician. He was an outspoken opponent of [[Germany]]'s colonization fervor during his time as a [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal]] Reichstag deputy. This was exemplified in his speech to the annual [[Congress of German Economists]]. Kapp stressed both the unprofitability of colonies and their negative impact on Anglo-German relations.

==Biography==

===Family life===
Kapp was born in [[Hamm]], [[Province of Westphalia]], as the son of the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasialdirektor]] Friedrich Kapp (1792–1866). He was the nephew of educator and philosopher [[Ernst Kapp]] (1801–1896) and of [[Christian Kapp]] (1798–1874), a philosopher and politician from [[Baden]].

In [[New York (state)|New York]], he married Luise Engels, the daughter of General [[Friedrich Ludwig C. Engels]] (1790–1855), commander of [[Cologne]] (1847–1855). His son, [[Wolfgang Kapp]] (1858–1922), was the nominal leader of the [[Kapp Putsch]].

===Education in Heidelberg===
Kapp received his [[Abitur]] from Gymnasium “Hammonense”, the same educational institution where his father held the position of principal. Between 1842 and 1844, Kapp studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. There, at his uncle Christian Kapp's (1798–1874) house, he met the philosopher [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. Not only did they become close friends; Feuerbach's criticism of religion, which also strongly influenced [[Karl Marx]], had a great impact on Kapp's attitude towards life as well. Other acquaintances from his time as a student were [[Ludwig Bamberger]] (1823–1899), who would later become a [[banker]], the author [[Berthold Auerbach]] (1812–1882) of Heidelberg and the [[poet]] [[Bettina von Arnim]] (1785–1859) of [[Berlin]]. From 1844 on, Kapp studied at the [[University of Berlin]] and voluntarily served in the army for one year. In Berlin, he was already working as a journalist for the [[utopian socialist]] magazine called "Westfälisches Dampfboot" (''"Westfalian Steamboat"'').

===Judge in Hamm===
In 1845, he returned to his hometown [[Hamm]] to work as an intern at the highest  [[Court of Appeals|court of appeals]] in [[Westfalia]] and stayed there until 1848. In Hamm, he founded a reading circle where "leftwing [[Hegelian]] intellectuals read foreign newspapers, which were not affected by [[Prussia]]n [[censorship]], as well as the texts of the [[Young Hegelians]], and German and West European socialists." (Wehler)

During his time at the High Court of Appeal in Hamm, Kapp was anything but popular: The court's president could only grant him access to the assessor's exam under certain conditions.

===Journalist in Frankfurt===
The [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|uprisings of March 1848 in Germany]] prompted Kapp to go to [[Frankfurt]] to work as a [[journalist]].&lt;ref name="DAB"&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Kapp, Friedrich|year=1933 |author=Frank Monaghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, Christian Kapp, had become a member of the National Assembly in [[Paulskirche, Frankfurt|St. Paul’s Church]] over the intervening years. In Frankfurt, Kapp was also politically involved by working for the democratic-republican left. He became the first secretary of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]].

Kapp worked as a political journalist in Frankfurt, but due to his involvement in the September Rebellion he had to flee to [[Brussels]]. There he worked as a private teacher for the son of Russian writer [[Alexander Herzen]].

===Paris, Geneva and departure for the United States===
From Brussels, he went to [[Paris]] where he continued to work for Herzen and translated two of his employer's books. In July 1849, the French police forced Herzen and Kapp to leave Paris. Both of them went to [[Geneva]], where Kapp ran into an acquaintance of his, [[Ludwig Bamberger]]. In 1846 Kapp had first thought about emigrating to the USA, but not until he arrived in Geneva did he make the final decision to leave. He reached [[New York City]] in March 1850. Later, he married his fiancée Luise Engels, who had followed him to the [[United States]] soon afterwards.

===Journalist in New York===
In New York, Kapp joined the law firm of [[Franz Zitz|Zitz]], Kapp and [[Julius Fröbel|Froebel]].  Despite early successes, he found he had no liking for the law.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;
Starting in 1852, Kapp worked as a journalist for the newly founded "[[Atlantic Studies]]". Their aim was to correct overly enthusiastic reports on the U.S. being circulated in Germany and also to show the darker side of American reality. Having become an American citizen in 1855, he was a lawyer until 1870 and worked as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]] for the "Kölnische Zeitung", a newspaper in [[Cologne]], Germany. He also wrote for the early numbers of the ''Nation'' of New York.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt; From 1855, he was co-publisher of the "[[New Yorker Abend-Zeitung]]", a German newspaper in New York, and wrote several books about this flourishing country and the life of Germans in the United States. In politics, he associated with the [[Whig party (United States)|Whigs]].&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;

In contrast to many other [[German-American]]s, however, he always kept strong ties to his [[homeland]]. His loyalty towards Germany and his belief in a unified German state not only continued to dominate his own life but also the upbringing of his son Wolfgang.

===Activities against slavery in Florida===
In 1856, Kapp bought a house in [[Mansfield Square]] which was to become a popular location where the Germans of New York met to discuss literature and politics. After visiting [[Florida]] in 1852, he became a stout opponent of [[slavery]] in the [[Southern United States|southern states]] ([[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]). Thus, in 1854, he not only wrote a book on the history of [[slavery]] in the United States, but even became a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In 1856 and in 1860 he actively campaigned for this party in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. In 1860, he was even nominated as an [[US Presidential Electors|elector]] for [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Alongside [[Carl Schurz]], he was one of the most prominent activists to win German-Americans over to the Union cause.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;  In 1867, he became a member of the New York Board of Immigration. It was a position he held until he returned to Germany in 1870.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;

===Writing biographies of German immigrants in the U.S.===
As a political writer he can be regarded as a pioneer of German-American [[Auxiliary sciences of history|historical science]]. He described the effects of German immigration on both countries, wrote the biographies of the generals [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] (1858) and [[Johann de Kalb]] (1862), and explored various American topics from a German point of view. Being very aware of his German identity, he wanted to show Americans the significance of German influence on the US. In a similar manner, he tried to convince his home country of its capability to form a unified German nation, using the achievements of German emigrants as a role model. In 1855, he described the fairly poor living conditions of his fellow Germans in the [[Texas|Texan]] colony of the "Mainzer [[Adelsverein]]". While still in the United States, the [[University of Bonn]] conferred an [[honorary degree]] of [[philosophy]] on him on 4 August 1868.

===City representative of Berlin===
After a general [[amnesty]] had been granted to political opponents, Kapp returned to Germany in April 1870 at the urging of German friends. As early as 21 October of that year he had become a Prussian citizen again. As such he was quickly able to become a city representative of Berlin in [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto von Bismarck’s]] [[German Empire]] in 1871/1872. From 1872-1877 and from 1881 to his death he was a Member of Parliament for the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|German Reichstag]]. Apart from that he was also a representative of the [[Prussian Landtag|regional parliament of Prussia]] from 1874-1877. In Berlin he also continued his work as a political writer.

As Kapp had always been in favor of a German [[Free state (government)|Free State]], he now pushed for a vigorous policy of settlement in the East in order to stop Germans from emigrating. At the same time he was engaged in developing uniform regulations for the consular system as well as for all kinds of emigration questions.  His book ''Aus und über Amerika'' (Out of and about America) was published in Berlin in 1876.  Its realism and candid opinions earned it unfavorable reviews in the United States.&lt;ref name="DAB"/&gt;

===Writing for the history of the German book trade===
Fellow party member and Member of Parliament [[Eduard Brockhaus]] encouraged Kapp to write a book on the history of the [[Books in Germany|German book trade]] ("Geschichte des deutschen Buchhandels"). This was a very difficult task for Kapp, as it was not his area of expertise and there were insufficient published sources at the time. Therefore, Kapp first had to do intensive research in archives. To this end, Kapp visited the [[Plantin-Moretus Museum]] in [[Antwerpen]] in 1884, where he was able to study the "Grand Livre de Francfort", an important source about the book trade in general as well as the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]. When Kapp died in Berlin later that year, he had just finished four chapters and outlined several others. Nevertheless, he was mentioned as author of the first of a total of four volumes.

'''Georgios Papandreou''' ({{Lang-el|Γεώργιος Παπανδρέου}} ''Geórgios Papandréou''; 13 February 1888 &amp;ndash; 1 November 1968) was a [[Greece|Greek]] politician, the founder of the Papandreou [[political dynasty]]. He served three terms as [[prime minister of Greece]] (1944–1945, 1963, 1964–1965). He was also [[deputy prime minister]] from 1950–1952, in the governments of [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] and served numerous times as a cabinet minister, starting in 1923, in a political career that spanned more than five decades.&lt;ref&gt;David Wilsford, ed. ''Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary'' (Greenwood, 1995) pp 368-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born at [[Kalentzi]], in the [[Achaea]] region of the northern [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; He was the son of Father Andreas Papandreou, an Orthodox [[archpriest]] (protopresvyteros). He studied [[law]] in [[Athens]] and [[political science]] in [[Berlin]]. His political philosophy was heavily influenced by German [[social democracy]]. As a result, he was adamantly opposed to the monarchy and supported generous social policies, but he was also extremely [[anti-communist]] (and specifically against the [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]]'s policies in Greece). As a young man, he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal leader [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who made him governor of [[Chios]] after the [[Balkan War]] of 1912. One of his brothers, Nikos, was killed in the [[Battle of Kilkis-Lachanas]].

He married twice. His first wife was Sofia Mineyko, a [[Poles|Polish]] national, daughter of Zygmunt Mineyko and paternal granddaughter of Stanislaw Mineyko (1802 - 1857). Their son [[Andreas Papandreou]] was born in [[Chios]] in 1919. His second wife was the actress [[Cybele Andrianou]] and their son was named George Papandreou.

==Political career==
During [[National Schism|the political crisis]] surrounding [[Greece in World War I|Greece's entry]] into [[World War I]], Papandreou was one of Venizelos's closest supporters against the pro-German King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]. When Venizelos was forced to flee [[Athens]], Papandreou accompanied him to [[Crete]], and then went to Lesbos, where he mobilised anti-monarchist supporters in the islands and rallied support for Venizelos's insurgent [[Movement of National Defence|pro-Allied government in Thessaloniki]]. In 1921 he narrowly escaped assassination from royalist extremists.

In the [[Greek legislative election, 1920|1920 general election]], Papandreou unsuccessfully ran as an independent liberal in the [[Lesbos|Lesvos]] constituency. From January to October 1923, he served as [[Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction|interior minister]] in the cabinet of [[Stylianos Gonatas]]. In the December [[Greek legislative election, 1923|1923 elections]], he was elected as a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] member of parliament for Lesvos, and served as finance minister for just 11 days in June 1925, education minister in 1930&amp;ndash;1932 and transport minister in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who's Who in Greece|last = |first = |publisher = Athens News|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Athens|pages = 255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; As minister of education he reformed the Greek school system and built many schools for the children of refugees of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]]. In 1935, he set up the [[Democratic Socialist Party of Greece]]. A lifelong opponent of the Greek monarchy, he was exiled in 1936 by the Greek royalist dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]].

Following the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] in [[World War II]], he joined the predominantly Venizelist government-in-exile based in [[Egypt]]. With British support, King [[George II of Greece|George II]] appointed him as PM and under his premiership took place the [[Lebanon conference]] (May 1944) and later the [[Caserta agreement]] (September 1944), in an attempt to stop the crisis in Greece and the conflicts between [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and non-EAM forces, a prelude of the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]]. 

===Liberation of Greece and the ''Dekemvriana'' events===
[[File:Η ελληνική σημαία μεταφέρεται για να υψωθεί στην Ακρόπολη μετά την απελευθέρωση της Αθήνας, Οκτώβριος 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Papandreou and others on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] of Athens, after the liberation from the Axis powers.]]

After the evacuation of Greece from the Axis powers, he entered [[Athens]] (October 1944) as Prime Minister of the [[Greek government-in-exile]] with some units of the Greek army and the allied British. During the same month, he became prime minister in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Greek government of National Unity (1944) {{!}}Greek government of National Unity|el|3=Κυβέρνηση Γεωργίου Παπανδρέου Εθνικής Ενότητος 1944}}, which had succeed the Greek government-in-exile. He tried to normalize the highly polarized situation between the EAM and non-EAM forces, collaborating mainly with the General [[Ronald Scobie]], who was under treaty responsible for all the Allied forces.

Although he resigned in 1945, after the [[Dekemvriana]] events, he continued to hold high office. From 1946&amp;ndash;1952 he served as labor minister, supplies minister, education minister, finance minister and public order minister. In 1950&amp;ndash;1952, he was also [[deputy prime minister]].

The 1952&amp;ndash;1961 period was a very difficult one for Papandreou. The liberal political forces in Greece were gravely weakened by internal disputes and suffered electoral defeat from the conservatives. Papandreou continuously accused [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] for these maladies, considering his leadership dour and uninspiring.

===Founder of the Center Union and later confrontation with the Palace===
In 1961, Papandreou revived Greek liberalism by founding the [[Center Union]] Party, a confederation of old liberal Venizelists and dissatisfied conservatives. After the [[Greek legislative election, 1961|elections]] of "violence and fraud" of 1961, Papandreou declared a "[[Relentless Struggle]]" against the right-wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]]. Finally, his party won the [[Greek legislative election, 1963|elections]] of November 1963 and those of 1964, the second with a [[Greek legislative election, 1964|landslide majority]]. His progressive policies as premier aroused much opposition in conservative circles, as did the prominent role played by his son [[Andreas Papandreou]], whose policies were seen as being considerably left of center. Andreas disagreed with his father on many important issues, and developed a network of political organizations, the [[Democratic Leagues]] (''Dimokratikoi Syndesmoi'') to lobby for more progressive policies. He also managed to take control of the Center Union's youth organization, [[EDIN]].

Papandreou had opposed the [[Zürich and London Agreement]] which led to the foundation of the Republic of [[Cyprus]]. Following clashes between the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities, his government sent a [[Greek army]] division to the island.

King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] openly opposed Papandreou's government, and there were frequent ultra-rightist plots in the Army, which destabilised the government. Finally the King engineered a split in the Centre Union and in July 1965, in a crisis known as the ''[[Apostasia of 1965|apostasia]]'' or ''Iouliana,'' he dismissed the government following a dispute over control of the Ministry of Defence. 

After the April 1967 military coup by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Colonels' junta]] led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]], Papandreou was arrested. Papandreou died under house arrest in November 1968. His funeral became the occasion for a massive anti-dictatorship demonstration. He is interred at the [[First Cemetery of Athens]], alongside his son Andreas.

During the Junta and after his death he was often referred to affectionately as '''"ο Γέρος της δημοκρατίας" (''o Géros tis dimokratías'', ''the old man of democracy'')'''. Since his grandson [[George Papandreou|George A. Papandreou]] entered politics, most Greek writers use Γεώργιος (''Geórgios'') to refer to the grandfather and the less formal Γιώργος (''Giórgos'') to refer to the grandson.

==Decorations and awards==
In 1965, the [[University of Belgrade]] awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]].

Her father left the Royal Navy to manage a foundry in [[Birmingham]], England, and Googie was sent to a boarding school near [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=mcf/&gt;

==Acting career==
She began acting at the age of twelve. A student at the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts]], she was a dancer in a [[West End theatre|West End]] production when she was offered work as a film extra in [[Michael Powell]]'s ''[[The Girl in the Crowd]]'' (1935). She arrived on the set to find one of the major players in the production had been dismissed, and she was immediately asked to step into the role in her place.

During the 1930s, Withers was constantly in demand in lead roles in minor films and supporting roles in more prestigious productions.  She was in ''[[Windfall (1935 film)|Windfall]]'' (1935), and was an extra in Powell's ''[[The Girl in the Crowd]]'' (1935) but wound up playing the second female lead.

Powell used her a third time in ''[[The Love Test]]'' (1935) and she had the lead in ''[[All at Sea (1935 film)|All at Sea]]'' (1935). Withers supported in ''[[Dark World (1935 film)|Dark World]]'' (1935), ''[[King of Hearts (1936 film)|King of Hearts]]'' (1936), and ''[[Accused (1936 film)|Accused]]'' (1936). ''[[Her Last Affaire]]'' (1936) was her fourth film with Powell.

Withers followed it with ''[[She Knew What She Wanted]]'' (1936), ''[[Crown v. Stevens]]'' (1936) (directed by Powell), ''[[Crime Over London]]'' (1936), ''[[Pearls Bring Tears]]'' (1937), ''[[Action for Slander]]'' (1937), and ''[[Paradise for Two]]'' (1937).

She had the lead in ''[[You're the Doctor]]'' (1938) and was back to support for ''[[Kate Plus Ten (film)|Kate Plus Ten]]'' (1938). Her best known work of the period was as one of [[Margaret Lockwood]]'s friends in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938).

Withers kept in support roles in ''[[Paid in Error]]'' (1938) and ''[[Strange Boarders]]'' (1938). She was in a [[Will Hay]] film ''[[Convict 99]]'' (1938) and supported [[Jack Buchanan]] in ''[[The Gang's All Here (1939 film)|The Gang's All Here]]'' (1939). Then she appeared in crime films ''[[Murder in Soho]]'' (1939) and ''[[Dead Men are Dangerous]]'' (1939).

She was still supporting comics in ''[[Back-Room Boy]]'' (1942) with [[Arthur Askey]].

Among her successes of the 1940s, and a departure from her previous roles, was the [[Powell and Pressburger]] film ''[[One of Our Aircraft Is Missing]]'' (1942), a topical World War II drama in which she played a [[Dutch resistance]] fighter who helps British airmen return to safety from behind enemy lines.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|last=Arthur|first=Nigel|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/447446/index.html|title =...One of Our Aircraft is Missing (1942)| work =| publisher = BFI Screenonline|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Duane''' (February 6, 1733 – February 1, 1797) was an American lawyer, jurist, and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] leader from New York. He served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], a New York state senator, the 44th [[mayor of New York City]], the first post-colonial American mayor, and a [[United States District Court|U.S. District Judge]]. Duane was a signatory of both the [[Continental Association]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]].

== Early life==
James Duane was born on February 6, 1733, in New York City in the then [[Province of New York]]. His parents were Eva Benson and [[Anthony Duane]] (c. 1679–1747), a [[Protestant]] Irishman from [[County Galway]] in Ireland who first came to New York as an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] in 1698. By the time of his James' birth, Anthony had become a wealthy [[Anglo-Irish]] colonial settler.&lt;ref name=g221&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Like others of colonial background, Anthony considered himself merely settling from one part of the British Empire to another as a free subject. Consequently, he maintained strong allegiance to the crown throughout his life, values which he later passed on to his son. He met and courted Eva Benson, whose father, Dirck, was a local American merchant. In 1702 Anthony left the navy, settled in New York, and married Eva. They had two sons before her death. When Eva died, Anthony remarried, this time to Althea Ketaltas (Hettletas), the daughter of a wealthy Dutch merchant family.&lt;ref name="Duane finding aid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding aid to the Duane Family and Duanesburg Patent Land Papers, 1734–1835|url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc14786.htm|publisher=New York State Library|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony entered commerce and prospered, and the couple had a son, James.

Duane's mother, Althea, died in 1736, and his father married a third time in 1741 to Margaret Riken (Rycken),&lt;ref name="Duane finding aid" /&gt; the widow of Thomas Lynch of Flushing, New York. When Anthony died in 1747, James became the ward of American aristocrat [[Robert Livingston (1708-1790)|Robert Livingston]], who was known as the 3rd Lord of the Manor. He completed his early education at [[Livingston Manor]], then [[read law]] as a clerk in the offices of [[James Alexander (lawyer)|James Alexander]].

==Career==
He was admitted to the bar in 1754.&lt;ref name=encnyc&gt;Vorhees, David William. "Duane, James" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;  As a lawyer, Duane represented [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] in the very protracted legal action brought by heirs of [[Anneke Jans]], who claimed that they, and not the church, were the lawful owners of much of lower Manhattan, a tract which had been given to the church by the British crown.&lt;ref name=streetbook /&gt;  By the early 1770s, his practice earned him 1,400 pounds annually.&lt;ref name=g221 /&gt; At the height of his success, Duane had a house in Manhattan, one in the country, and an estate near [[Schenectady, New York]], of {{convert|36000|acre|ha}} and 253 tenants.&lt;ref name=g221 /&gt; He was a vestryman of Trinity Church, was appointed one of the church's nine trustees during a post-war crisis about the church's Tory-leanings,&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and was also  a trustee of [[Columbia University|Kings College]], the precursor to Columbia University.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;

Duane was Clerk of the Chancery Court of New York in 1762, acting provincial [[Attorney General]] in 1767&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; and Indian Commissioner for the [[Province of New York]] in 1774.

Sir James Duane did sign the articles of Confederation when he was mayor.
===American revolution===
Duane was a member of the ''[[Committee of Sixty]]'' that began the revolution in New York. He was made a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] in 1774 and was continuously re-appointed through 1784, although he missed some sessions due to other duties. Like many other Americans, he had inherited his forefathers' patriotism to the British crown as well as their instinctive jealousy for their own rights as Englishmen.

Duane was politically conservative.&lt;ref name=g221 /&gt; Until his marriage to Mary Livingston, he had been a member of [[James De Lancey (politician)|James De Lancey]]'s political faction.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; Like many men of the time, he distrusted the intelligence of common people, warning against the "mob rule" of a democratic republic.

Nevertheless, Duane wrestled with his allegiance to the British Empire and his desire to maintain and protect his ideals of English liberty and American self-government from what was perceived as encroachments upon their rights by an increasingly centralized imperial state. Thus, in the early Congress, he was one of the many who were most disposed to reconciliation with Britain. He supported the [[Galloway's Plan of Union|Galloway Plan of Union]] and opposed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. However, as the British government sent the largest combined navy and army force the British government had ever dispatched outside of Europe, he saw the futility of any further concord with the British government and advocated independence.

Nonetheless, because of his vacillation in contrast to more ardent independence-minded delegates, as well as his noted familial loyalty to New York, it was considered a better use of his talents working on the frontier against British agitation among the Indian tribes. Thus, in 1775 he represented Congress as an Indian Commissioner at [[Albany, New York]]. However, his local constituency later returned him to the new state constitutional convention from 1776-1777. Due to his excellent legal and political philosophical background, he served on the committee that drafted New York's constitution. Subsequently he was elected as a delegate by the State of New York to the Continental Congress. When the British [[History of New York City (1665–1783)|occupied New York]] in 1776, he was forced from his home. With the British Army forces quick on his tail and those of other American leaders, he withdrew his wife and family to the relative safety of her father's home at Livingston Manor. In 1778 he signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] in [[Philadelphia]]. He remained active as a political leader throughout the war and returned home to [[Gramercy Park]] in 1783, commenting that his home looked "as if they had been inhabited by wild beasts".&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Duane was a member of the [[Federalist Party]].&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt; He served in the New York State Senate from 1783 to 1790 and was appointed [[Mayor of New York]] by the Council of Appointment in 1784, serving until 1789.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;&lt;ref name=g267&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; As mayor, one of his first acts was to donate to the poor the money usually spent on entertainment for his Inauguration – about 20 guineas.&lt;ref name=g267 /&gt; During his time in office, he strove to help the city revive itself after the damage done by the war and the British occupation, but he was unable to maintain the city's status as the capital of the United States.&lt;ref name=encnyc /&gt;  As head of the Mayor's Court, he heard the case of ''[[Rutgers v. Waddington]]'', handing down a Solomonic decision which pleased neither party. After he was called before the State Assembly to explain his thinking, he was censured by that body.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785 Duane was one of 32 prominent New Yorkers who met to create the [[New York Manumission Society]], intended to put pressure on the state of New York to abolish slavery, as every state in the north had done except New York and New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows &amp; Wallace (1999), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

Duane was a delegate to the New York convention that ratified the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]].

On September 25, 1789, President [[George Washington|Washington]] named him the first judge of the [[United States District Court for the District of New York]], created by 1 Stat. 73. He was immediately confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] and received his commission the following day. [[Richard Varick]] followed him as mayor. Duane served on the Federal bench until March 17, 1794, when his health forced him to resign.

==Personal life==
On October 21, 1759, Duane married Mary Livingston (1738–1821),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderhamiltonexhibition.org/gallery/duane_mrsj.html|title=Gallery of Peers: Mrs. James Duane|year=2004|publisher=The [[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest living daughter of his former guardian [[Robert Livingston (1708-1790)|Robert]].&lt;ref name="Sewall Genealogy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewellgenealogy.com/p157.htm|title=Sewalls of Coventry: James Duane|last=Rees|first=John|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, after Mary's mother, Maria Thong (1711–1765) (the granddaughter of Gov.

Throughout his life, he had worked to establish his own estate, inherited from his father, and centered at [[Duanesburg, New York]].

'''Joseph Bonnell''' (August 4, 1802 – September 27, 1840) was a formally recognized hero of the [[Texas Revolution]]. He was a [[West Point]] graduate (Class of 1825) and a member of [[The Long Gray Line]] (a phrase used to describe all graduates and cadets of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York).

[[Image:Joseph-Bonnell-Mrkr 4151a.png|thumb|right|Joseph Bonnell Marker]]

==Formal recognition by Texas Legislature==
His heroism in support of the War for Texas Independence is acknowledged in Texas House of Representatives Resolution #615 "Paying tribute to the life of Lieutenant Joseph Bonnell, hero of the Texas Revolution, and commemorating the placement of a historical marker at his grave site", which was adopted on 3/17/2005 by the 79th Texas Legislature. The resolution reads in part: "...he successfully quelled an uprising...through a peaceful negotiation with Caddo Chief Cortes; his efforts helped enable General Sam Houston to focus the full strength of his army on defeating Mexican troops led by Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna at the famed Battle of San Jacinto, effectively securing the independence of the Republic of Texas."

==1835 Caddo Indian Treaty==
Joseph Bonnell, First Lieutenant, [[3d US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd Infantry Regiment]], US Army, Fort Jesup, [[Louisiana Territory|Louisiana]], was an official witness to the US and Caddo Indian Treaty of July 1, 1835 in which the [[Caddo Indians]] sold all of their lands in the United States to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;F. Todd Smith, The Caddo Indians, Texas A&amp;M Press, College Station, 1995, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Bonnell asked to read the treaty before the chiefs signed and was refused by the US Agent.&lt;ref&gt;F. Todd Smith, supra, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; After the signing, it was discovered that the US Agent had included a hidden provision by which associates of the US Agent were enriched.&lt;ref&gt;F. Todd Smith, supra, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Bonnell gave a deposition for the benefit of the Caddos which ultimately reached the US Supreme Court in US v. Brooks, 51 US 445 (1850).

==1835-1836 appointment and commission in Texas Army==
Bonnell’s integrity and character came to the attention of Major General [[Sam Houston]] of the [[Texas Army]] who asked Bonnell to be his Aide-de-Camp,&lt;ref&gt;Butler-Gunsaulus Collection, Box 2, Folder 48, Houston, Samuel to Joseph Bonnell, November 22, 1835, Special Collection Research Center, University of Chicago Library, 1100 E. 57th St., Chicago, IL 60637.&lt;/ref&gt; an appointment approved by the government of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Texas State Archives; John Holmes Jenkins, III, Papers of the Texas Revolution, 1835-1836, Presidial Press, Austin, 1973, Vol. 9, p. 385.

Bonnell is spelled “Bonnel” or “Bonnsl.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation in March/April 1836==
In March and April 1836, during the “[[Runaway Scrape]],” there were many reports of as many as 1,700 hostile Indians massing in East Texas.&lt;ref&gt;F. Todd Smith, supra, p. 128; John H. Reagan, “Expulsion of the Cherokees from East Texas,” Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Vol. 1, No. 1, July 1897, pp. 38-39; Texas State Archives, Biographical and Historical Files, Army Papers; United States and Mexico, 1828-1838, 25th Congress, 2nd Session, No. 351, House Documents, pages 775-779; John Holmes Jenkens, III, supra, Vol. 5, p. 17, Document 2261, Greenwood to President of Convention, March 7, 1836; Vol. 5, pp. 25-26, Document 2271, Franks to Convention, March 8, 1836; Vol. 5, p. 144, Document 2370, Raquet to Chairman, March 19, 1836; Vol. 5, p. 149, Document 2380, Mason to Nelson, March 20, 1836; Vol. 5, p. 153, Document 2388, A. Hotchkiss Report, San Augustine, March 21, 1836; Vol. 5, p. 429, Document 2703, Deposition of C. H. Sims, April 11, 1836; Vol. 5, pp. 429-430, Document 2703, Deposition of William Sims, April 11, 1836; and Vol. 5, p. 430, Document 2703, Deposition of M. B. Menard, April 11, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt; This threatened the security of General Houston’s Army and the settlers in Texas. On April 7, 1836, US Major General [[Edmund P. Gaines]], then commander of the southwest military division of the United States at Fort Jesup, Louisiana, ordered Bonnell to go into East Texas by himself to quell the Indian uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of April 7, 1836 from Major General Edmund Pendleton Gaines to 1st Lieutenant Joseph Bonnell, Letters sent by the Western Department, Volume 7, Record Group 393, Records of the U.S. Army Continental Commands, Part 1, Entry 5568, pages 278-279, Gaines to Bonnell, April 7, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;

==One tribal uprising - one infantry lieutenant==
Bonnell found the Indian villages empty except for women and children, the warriors having gone to the field. He finally located Caddo Chief Cortes and negotiated with him to have the warriors return to the villages in peace. Bonnell successfully completed his dangerous mission, which was of great benefit to General Houston and the Texas Army by allowing General Sam Houston to focus the full strength of his army on defeating Mexican troops led by [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] at the famed [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. Bonnell returned to Fort Jesup and wrote his report on April 20, 1836, the day before the Battle of San Jacinto.&lt;ref&gt;Report of Lieutenant Joseph Bonnell to Major General Edmund Pendleton Gaines, April 20, 1836, U.S. Serial Set, Microfiche 4904, United States and Mexico, 1828-1838, 25th Congress, 2nd Session, No. 332, House Documents, Volume 12, Number 351, Fiche 9, Document 351, pages 774-775. Entire paragraph is from this report.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonnell, Houston, and West Point graduates==
The sword carried by General Houston in the Battle of San Jacinto was given to him by his friend, Joseph Bonnell.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edward Lester, The Life of Sam Houston, J. C. Derby, publisher, 1855, page 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnell had been in West Point with Texas Army Lieutenant William S. Stilwell who was with the “Twin Sisters” artillery at the Battle of San Jacinto.&lt;ref&gt;The Register of Graduates of the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, published by the West Point Association of Graduates, 2005 (listing all graduates): Joseph Bonnell, Class of 1825, Cullum No. 418; William Shaler Stilwell, Class of 1827, Cullum No. 505. Stephen L. Moore, Eighteen Minutes, Republic of Texas Press, Dallas, 2004, page 263, 313, and 436: Lieutenant Stillwell was with one of the “Twin Sister” artillery pieces at the Battle of San Jacinto.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnell was also at West Point with [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], who later became Commanding General of the Texas Army and Secretary of War of the Republic of Texas when the new capital was built in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;The Register of Graduates of the United States Military Academy, supra: Albert Sidney Johnston, Class of 1826, Cullum No. 436. Bonnell was a Cadet Lieutenant while Johnston, in the class below Bonnell, was a Cadet Sergeant Major: USMA Post Orders, Vol. 3, 1823-1825, 1st Class Cadet Bonnell to Cadet Lieutenant; 2nd Class Cadet Johnston to Cadet Sergeant Major. Also see Charles P. Roland, Albert Sidney Johnston, University of Texas Press, Austin, 1964, 2nd Printing 1990, page 58, 82, and 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1836, three months after the Battle of San Jacinto, Sam Houston, Joseph Bonnell, and Albert Sidney Johnston were all in Nacogdoches, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Paul N. Spellman, Forgotten Texas Hero, Texas A&amp;M Press, College Station, 1999, page 23; [[Charles P. Roland]], supra, pages 54-55; John Holmes Jenkens, III, supra, Vol. 7, p. 484, Document 3738, Bonnell to Gaines, Nacogdoches, July 19, 1836; Vol. 8, p. 71, Document 3826, Menard to All, July 30, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1840 - end of life==
Captain Joseph Bonnell, US Army, died on September 27, 1840 at the home of his brother in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;North American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, PA, September 29, 1840, page 2. Bonnell had been granted a four month leave “for the benefit of his health” on July 16, 1840: Military Intelligence, Army and Navy Chronicle (1835-1842), July 16, 1840, 11, 3, American Periodical Series Online, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addendum==
It was Bonnell who discovered the plot of Manuel Flores to incite the tribes to war against Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fga03 Handbook of Texas, Gaines, Edmund Pendleton]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julio María Sosa Venturini''' (February 2, 1926 – November 26, 1964), usually referred to simply as '''Julio Sosa''' or '''El Varón del Tango''', was a [[Uruguay]]an [[tango (music)|tango]] singer.

==Biography==
Sosa was born in [[Las Piedras, Uruguay|Las Piedras]], a [[Canelones Department]] suburb of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. He moved to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], in 1949, where he became famous with the [[Orquesta Francini-Pontier]] the [[Orquesta típica]] formed by the violinist [[Enrique Mario Francini]] and the bandoneonist [[Armando Pontier]] . Working with numerous other orchestras, he was reunited with Pontier in 1955, with whom he recorded several best-selling albums on the [[RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] labels and became one of the most important tango singers in the genre's history.&lt;ref name=tango&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/spanish/creadores/jsosa.html TodoTango Biography:Julio Sosa {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Nora Ulfed in 1958 and had a daughter. His marriage ended in separation, however, and he settled into a relationship with Susana Merighi. His towering masculinity and reserved strength earned him the nickname ''El Varón del Tango'' ("The Man's Man of Tango"). Sosa also published a book of poetry, ''Dos horas antes del alba'' ("Two Hours Before the Dawn"), in 1960. Following his switch to [[Columbia Records]] in 1961, the Pontier orchestra incorporated a new [[bandoneon]]ist, [[Leopoldo Federico]], and the association helped make the group the most successful in its genre, at the time.&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

Sosa's fame acquainted him with [[sports car]]s as well. He had numerous accidents during the early 1960s, mostly as a result of speeding. He was behind the wheel of a [[DKW]] coupé when, in the early hours of November 25, 1964, he crashed at high speed into a traffic light on Buenos Aires' [[Figueroa Alcorta Avenue]], killing himself at age 38.&lt;ref name=tango/&gt;

{{Culture of Assam}}
'''Kalita''' is an ethnic group or a caste of [[Hindus]] belonging to the state of [[Assam]] in [[North East India]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} They commonly claim to belong to the [[Kshatriya]] caste.&lt;ref name="googlebook3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ic4UCdaxbHIC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=kalita++kshatriya+caste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZYI5VP_GOseiuQS144KABw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=kalita%20%20kshatriya%20caste&amp;f=false | title=Encyclopaedia of North-East India, Volume 1 | publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist | work=India, Northeastern | date=2007 | accessdate=12 October 2014 | author=Col Ved Prakash | page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of Kalita kingdom in very early times as well as during the 15th-16th century.&lt;ref name="googlebook4"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dpE5VMudGMWTuATx34H4Aw&amp;id=EE1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=kalita+rulers+in+assam&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=kalita | title=Assam-Bengal Relations from the Earliest Times to the Twelfth Century A.D | publisher=Spectrum Publications | work=Assam (India) | date=1988 | accessdate=12 October 2014 | author=Pratap Chandra Choudhury | pages=193, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historians like S.L.Barua, Kalitas started migrating from North and East India to Assam during the 11th century rule of Dharmapal.  &lt;ref&gt;''A Comprehensive History of Assam'' by S.L.Barua, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

According to "[[Purana]] Tradition", the Kalitas are considered as pure [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]].&lt;ref name="gbookA1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_PpdZosif4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=kalita++kshatriya+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ziBJVIrPLKapmgWm9ILABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kalita%20%20kshatriya%20origin&amp;f=false | title=Social and Cultural History of Ancient India | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | work=Hindu civilization | date=1998 | accessdate=24 October 2014 | author=Manilal Bose | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Aryan descent theories endorse the arrival of the Kalitas "before the rise of the existing professional castes", the Kalitas generally claim to belong to the [[Kshatriya]] caste, and call themselves ''kulalupta'',&lt;ref name="googlebook3"/&gt; ''kula'' meaning caste and ''lupta'' meaning gone ("lost caste") in the context of the legend that the Kalitas "were Ksatriyas who fled from the wrath of [[Parasurama]] who was determined to exterminate the Ksatriyas. But this seems to be a false [[etymology]]."&lt;ref name="sharma2005discovery1"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=S. K. Sharma |editor2=U. Sharma |title=Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, Religion, Politics, Sociology, Science, Education and Economy. North-East India.

The Kalitas in Assam are considered next only to the [[Brahmin]]s in the caste-hierarchy.&lt;ref name="contemporaryPol"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Shiri Ram Bakshi |editor2=Sita Ram Sharma |editor3=S. Gajrani |title=Contemporary Political Leadership in India: Sharad Pawar, the Maratha legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1i51KFUyzIC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=kalitas+are+kayasthas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw5MVMgMgePwBYuLgpAG&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=kalitas%20are%20kayasthas&amp;f=false |publisher=APH Publishing|year=1998|isbn=978-81-76480-08-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="googlebook1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FH4Bb7dD4qYC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=kalita+caste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T345VKiDL8WJuASz7YDwCQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kalita%20caste&amp;f=false | title=Bamboo: The Wonderful Grass | publisher=APH Publishing | date=2008 | accessdate=12 October 2014 | author=G.K.

Having mingled with local population, they still preserve certain elements of Aryan culture even after localizing their culture to some extent.&lt;ref name="googlebook1" /&gt;

Dr. [[Biraja Sankar Guha|B.S. Guha]] has found similarities between some surnames of "Alpine [[Nagar Brahmin]]s" of Gujarat with those of North East India, as referred in the Nidhanpur land grants of Kamarupa King Bhaskaravarman (6th century A.D.) such as ''Datta, Dhara, Deva, Nandi, Sena, and Vasu,'' etc. and connects them with the ''Kalitas'' of Assam.&lt;ref name=pdeka&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DPWGpVvBvx8C&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=kalitas%20%2B%20Nagar%20Brahmins%20%2B%20Nidhanpur&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=kalitas%20+%20Nagar%20Brahmins%20+%20Nidhanpur&amp;f=false ''The great Indian corridor in the east''] by Phani Deka&lt;/ref&gt; Again, historian [[Kanaklal Barua]] mentions these surnames while referring to the [[Nidhanpur copperplate inscription|Nidhanpur inscription]] and says that these surnames "now belong almost exclusively to the [[Bengali Kayastha]]s".&lt;ref name="sharma2005discovery2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=S. K. Sharma |editor2=U. Sharma |title=Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, Religion, Politics, Sociology, Science, Education and Economy. North-East India. Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUozqyA2e90C |publisher=Mittal Publications|year=2005|isbn=978-81-83-24035-2|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few scholars including [[Kaliram Medhi|K.R. Medhi]], [[Kanaklal Barua|K.L. Barua]], P.C. Choudhuri, [[Maheswar Neog|M. Neog]], B. K. Kakati made speculations by drawing the references of ''Greek'' records, words like ''Kakatiai, Kalaiai, Kaltis, Koudontai, Kudutai, Gurucharitis'' and few early religious literatures to establish the ''Kalitas'' through materials not based on ethnology or anthropology. Some even tried to relate ''Kalitas'' to [[Narakasura|Naraka]]-[[Bhagadatta]].&lt;ref name=pdeka/&gt;

==Social life==
Mirroring the history of Assam, the Kalitas were peasants, though during the rule of the Ahom dynasty they also proved their might and capabilities as soldiers, generals, administrators, envoys, and judges.

The Ahom [[paik]] system surnames of Bora, [[Hazarika]], [[Saikia]], Kakoti, [[Barua]], Rajkhowa, and Phukan can all be found amongst the Kalitas of Assam, which signify that they served the Ahom monarchy. Bora was the leader of 20 paiks (or foot soldiers), Saikia that of 100 paiks and Hazarika that of 1000 paiks. The [[Barua]]s led 3000 men, similar to the Rajkhowas. Phukans formed the uppermost layers of the Ahom military and judicio-administrative structure, subservient to the Ahom [[Borphukan]]s and [[Borbarua]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Assam'' by Sir Edward Gait, page 248–250&lt;/ref&gt; Phukans and Baruah are found in the [[Assamese Brahmins|Brahmins]], Ahoms and Kalitas of Assam alike. Besides this, Bora, Baruah and Saikia are equally found in the [[Sutiya people|Sutiya community]] while Hazarika, Rajkhowa are found amongst the [[Ahom people|Ahoms]].Certain posts like "Boiragi" or envoys to neighbouring kingdoms such as the [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintias]] (presently in [[Meghalaya]]), the [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari]]s (Assam), and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Sultanate in [[Bengal]], were given to Kalitas in preference to Ahoms.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Assam'' by Sir Edward Gait, page 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Martín Fierro Award is presented annually by the [[Asociación de Periodistas de la Televisión y Radiofonía Argentina]] (APTRA) ({{lang-es|Association of journalists of Argentine television and radio}}).&lt;ref name="gaucho"/&gt; It is given to honor an Argentine individual with an outstanding career in the media of Argentina or a recent production of outstanding quality. APTRA described the standard as "the best among the best".&lt;ref name="gaucho"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/subnotas/10509-3309-2008-07-02.html|title= Historia de un gaucho de oro|trans-title= History of a golden gaucho|language= Spanish|author= |date= July 2, 2008|work= |publisher= Página 12|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first awarded in 1992 at the [[Martín Fierro Awards]] ceremony for works from 1991. It is a special award, unrelated to the regular ones, which are distributed in categories. A second award, the Platinum Martín Fierro Award, is selected by public poll among the previous recipients of the Golden award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1161615-que-programa-o-figura-consideras-que-merece-el-martin-fierro-de-platino|title= ¿Qué programa o figura considerás que merece el Martín Fierro de Platino?|trans-title= Which program or figure do you think deserves the Platinum Martín Fierro Award?|language= Spanish|author= |date= |work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second award was created in 2009 for works from 2008, but there was no Platinum award for the 2013 ceremony.&lt;ref name="graduados" /&gt; The awards for the [[cable television]] were split in 2016 to their own ceremony, with its own Golden Martín Fierro.&lt;ref name="Castro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1937298-martin-fierro-de-cable-2016-el-oro-fue-para-nelson-castro|title= Martín Fierro de Cable 2016: el Oro fue para Nelson Castro|trans-title= Cable Martín Fierro 2016: the Gold was for Nelson Castro|language= Spanish|author= |date= September 13, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The talk show ''[[Fax (Argentine TV show)|Fax]]'' was the first recipient of the award,&lt;ref name="diez" /&gt; and, as of 2017, ''[[El Marginal]]'' is the most recent.&lt;ref name="marginal"/&gt; No recipient has received the award twice, but [[Nicolás Repetto (TV host)|Nicolás Repetto]], host of ''Fax'',  received a personal one in 2000.&lt;ref name="Repetto" /&gt; [[Facundo Arana]], [[Julio Chávez]], [[Mercedes Morán]], [[Celeste Cid]], [[Nancy Dupláa]], [[Pablo Echarri]], [[Diego Peretti]] and [[Gabriela Toscano]] have been lead actors of different works of fiction that received the award.

==Winners==
In the following table, the years are listed per [[APTRA]] convention, and generally correspond to the year when the productions were aired. The Martín Fierro award ceremonies are always held the following year. The ceremonies have no nominees for the Golden award, which is announced at the end once all the regular awards have been received. The award may be given to either a person with an outstanding career or recent production of outstanding quality. When the award is received by a production, the ''Starring'' column lists the people that worked in it, such as TV hosts or lead actors. The ''TV channel / Radio station'' column lists either the channel or station that aired the production, or the channel or station where the person worked at the year of the award.

Evenings he would attach himself to a group of young, poverty-stricken Wagnerian enthusiasts and over a cup of coffee help wage the abstract battles of the music-dramatist's political and ethical doctrines. Of these sage utterances one the young musicians adopted unanimously was the proposal to regenerate mankind through strict, vegetarian diet. Perhaps the cost of meat-dishes had as much to do with this resolution as the realization that carnivorous humanity was going to the dogs. [...] Although two years had passed since those unforgettable meatless meetings of the young Wagnerians in Vienna, Mahler was in Olmuetz still a vegetarian, claiming bitterly that he went to the restaurant to starve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gabriel Engel |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300041H.html |title=Gustav Mahler, Song Symphonist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter III}} |group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref| "Keussler is also already here.

[[File:Tursiops truncatus 01-cropped.jpg|thumb|A Dolphin]] '''Marine mammal training''' is the training and caring for marine life such as, [[dolphins]], [[killer whales]], [[sea lions]], [[walruses]], and other marine mammals. It is also a duty of the trainer to do mental and physical exercises to keep the animal healthy and happy. {{according to whom |date = October 2012}}

==Methodology==
The trainers train these animals by using a [[positive reinforcement]] method called [[operant conditioning]]. There are five steps needed to become a dolphin trainer: earn a high school [[diploma]], considering volunteering, earn a degree, obtain an [[internship]], and become SCUBA certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Dolphin Trainer: Step by Step Career Guide|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Dolphin_Trainer_Step-by-Step_Career_Guide.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most marine mammal trainers earn their degree in [[marine biology]], [[psychology]], and/or animal behavior. Even though a formal education is very important, it is even more important to get a hands on experience with a senior team member and learning and becoming familiar with the animals behaviors. Training marine life is a very big task and takes a lot of responsibility. Many people have an unrealistic view on what training these mammals is actually like. Trainers duties include an enormous amount of cleaning, preparing food, feeding, training, writing records, performing in shows, and public education and interaction.

Reinforcers are one of the great ways trainers communicate with animals. The reinforcers let the animal know when they have done the desired behavior you wanted them to achieve. Trainers need to make sure they reinforce the animal directly after they have successfully done the behavior and not wait too late. If the reinforcer is too late, by even a few seconds, then the animal can start an undesired behavior. The trainer needs to create signals so the animal knows they have done the correct behavior. When training a new behavior it is important to teach in small steps. By training in small steps, you can train an animal to do complex behaviors. This step-by-step learning experience is called shaping. Trainers create different signals for the animals for different behaviors. This helps let the animal know the correct behavior to perform. If an animal does not respond to a signal or responds with an undesired behavior then the trainer normally will remain motionless and wait three seconds before trying the signal again. This three second pause is referred to as the Least Reinforcing Stimulus, or LRS. It is like a short "time-out" for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Marine Mammals|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mb/dolphins/TrainingMarineMam.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trainers try not to force a situation and never punish an animal for not doing a behavior correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Mammal Training at Seaworld|url=http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/training/mmtrain.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine trainer salary==
A study done by [http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_trainingcareers.php dolphins.org] states that the average salary for an entry level trainer is between $18,000-$20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Careers|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_trainingcareers.php|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ranges from facility to facility but this is the average. California, Florida, and New York are the three highest states with available animal trainer job positions. Since there are few marine parks and aquariums that open each year the demand for marine mammal trainers is very competitive. Marine mammal trainers can work in [[aquariums]], [[zoos]], non-profit environmental advocacy organizations, eco-tourism companies, university research laboratories, industrial research centers, private companies, and government research laboratories or marine stations. Since marine mammal trainers tend to be secure in their position and close to the animals they work with, the job turnover rate is low. Once people secure a job in this field, they tend to stay for life

==Schooling for Marine Mammal Training==
Here are some great schools for marine mammal training, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[University of California Santa Cruz]], [[California State University]], [[Cornell University]], [[University of Delaware]], [[Duke University]], [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], [[University of Maine]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin Research Center|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_schools.php|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these schools provide an extensive schooling program with field experiences integrated with classroom and laboratory courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/marine_biology/default.htm|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a bachelor's degree is not mandatory for this career it is more beneficial to have at least a 4-year degree. If a bachelor's degree is not acquired then all of the certifications, volunteering, and qualifications are still needed to become a marine mammal trainer.

Dolphin Research Center Training Institute, established in 2012 as the College for Marine Mammal Professions, DRCTI offers an accelerated Occupational Associates Degree in Marine Mammal Behavior, Care and Training that can be attained in 36 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphins.org/visit_cmmp.php|title=Page not found - Dolphin Research Center|website=Dolphin Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional short and long-term educational opportunities can be found here. http://marinemammaltrainer.com/dolphin-training-schools/

==International Marine Animal Trainers' Association==
The International Marine Animal Trainers' Association (known as IMATA), was created in 1972. IMATA was created for communication, professionalism, and cooperation between those who serve for the marine life. This helps network and exchange ideas between marine animal trainers internationally. IMATA is dedicated to providing and advancing the most professional, effective, and humane care of marine animals in all habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMATA|url=http://www.imata.org/|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMATA's responsibilities are for striving to continue the existence of oceanaria, aquaria, and laboratories housing marine animals. There are four rules for the Code of Professional Ethics. Each member is committed to:

# Exercising the highest levels of respect and humaneness for all animals.
# Exercising professional integrity in representing ourselves as members of the marine animal community, as representatives of the facilities we serve, or as members of this Association.
# Fostering respect, understanding, and cooperation among fellow members and others associated with the zoological community in general and the marine animal community in particular.
# Contributing to the promotion of public and professional interest in IMATA and accepting the obligations of membership as required to the best of our abilities.

'''Martin Edward Schottenheimer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɒ|t|ən|h|aɪ|m|ər}}; born September 23, 1943) is a former [[professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[American football]] player and coach who served as a head coach in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for 21 seasons. He was the head coach of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] for 10 seasons, the [[Cleveland Browns]] for five seasons, the [[San Diego Chargers]] for five seasons, and the [[Washington Redskins]] for one season. Sixth in all-time wins at 205 and fifth in regular season wins at 200, Schottenheimer has the most wins of a head coach to not reach a championship in the NFL. After coaching in the NFL, he won a [[2011 UFL Championship Game|2011 championship]] in his one season with the [[Virginia Destroyers]] of the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]] (UFL).

Schottenheimer's tenure as an NFL head coach was marked by consistent regular season success and postseason struggles. Over the course of over two decades, he went 14 seasons before posting a losing record and had only two seasons with more losses than wins. However, Schottenheimer won only five of 18 postseason games he appeared in and never advanced beyond the conference championship round of the playoffs. At the conclusion of his NFL career, Schottenheimer held a playoff winning percentage of .278, a stark contrast to his .613 regular season winning percentage. He is the only coach in NFL history with at least 200 wins who has a losing playoff record and the only eligible NFL coach with at least 200 regular season wins who has not been inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

==Early life and playing career==
Schottenheimer was born in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Schottenheimer__Marty.html Schottenheimer, Martin (Marty)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515213835/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Schottenheimer__Marty.html |date=2013-05-15 }}. Pennsylvania Center for the Book. Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended high school at Fort Cherry High School in [[McDonald, Pennsylvania]]. After attending the University of Pittsburgh, Schottenheimer, a linebacker, was selected in the fourth round of the [[1965 NFL Draft]] by the [[Baltimore Colts]] and in the seventh round of the 1965 [[American Football League]] draft by the [[Buffalo Bills]]. He signed with the Bills and spent the next four (1965, 1966, 1967, and 1968) seasons with Buffalo, including the Bills' 1965 [[Professional American football championship games|AFL Championship]] season, when he was selected to the [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Team]]. Schottenheimer was still with the team during the 1969 preseason and intercepted two passes in a game against the [[Houston Oilers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130203060042/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082703/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time between the 1969 preseason and regular season, Schottenheimer was sent to the [[Boston Patriots]] and spent the next two seasons with the Pats.  He was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 1971 but was traded again to the Colts before the beginning of the [[1971 NFL season|1971 season]]. He retired from football in 1971 and spent the next several years working in the real estate industry. Schottenheimer credits his professional playing career as being his inspiration for coaching.

Schottenheimer came out of retirement in 1974 to sign with the [[Portland Storm]] of the [[World Football League]] as a player-coach. He injured his shoulder prior to the start of the season, but stayed on with the Storm as their linebackers coach.

==Coaching career==
Schottenheimer's professional coaching career began in 1974 when he became linebackers coach for the [[Portland Storm]] of the [[World Football League]]. In 1975, he was hired as a linebackers coach for the NFL's [[New York Giants]] and in 1977 became [[defensive coordinator]]. Schottenheimer spent 1978 and 1979 as the linebackers coach for the NFL's [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref name="Chargers bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty Schottenheimer|url=http://www.chargers.com/team/coaches/marty-schottenheimer.htm|publisher=San Diego Chargers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124130240/http://www.chargers.com/team/coaches/marty-schottenheimer.htm|archivedate=January 24, 2007|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleveland Browns===
In 1980, he was hired as the defensive coordinator for the [[Cleveland Browns]]. On October 22, [[1984 Cleveland Browns season|1984]], Schottenheimer replaced [[Sam Rutigliano]] as Browns head coach, after an October 7 game against the [[New England Patriots]] that bore an eerie resemblance to Cleveland's 1980 playoff loss to the Raiders, known as [[Red Right 88]]. The Browns were down 17–16 in the fourth quarter, and lost on an interception in New England's end zone as time expired.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=278}} Chants of "Goodbye Sam" rung out from the stands after the New England game. Browns' owner [[Art Modell]] called the play-calling "inexcusable" and fired Rutigliano two weeks later.&lt;ref name="Rutigliano on hot seat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Russ|title=Rutigliano's control is key to his destiny|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=October 14, 1984|page=2–B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1–7 Browns then went 4–4 under Schottenheimer to finish the season with a 5–11 record.

The selection of [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] in 1985's [[supplemental draft]] ushered in a new, largely successful era for Cleveland. With Schottenheimer, Kosar and a cast of talented players on offense and defense, the team reached greater heights than Rutigliano and former quarterback [[Brian Sipe]] ever did. Though they became consistent playoff contenders in this era, the Browns did not reach the Super Bowl, falling one win short three times in the late 1980s.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=299–300}}

While not stellar, the Browns' record won first place in a weak AFC Central in 1985, and the team looked poised to shock the heavily favored Miami Dolphins in a divisional playoff game on January 4, 1986.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=56}} Cleveland surged to a 21–3 halftime lead, and it took a spirited second-half comeback by [[Dan Marino]] and the Dolphins to win it 24–21 and end the Browns' season.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=58–62}} Despite the loss, many people expected Cleveland to be back the following year. "The Browns' days, the good days, are here and ahead of us", radio personality Pete Franklin said.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=62}}

Despite a tumultuous off season, 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854&amp;nbsp;yards to a corps of receivers that included [[Brian Brennan]], Newsome and rookie [[Webster Slaughter]].{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=93, 95, 98}} On defense, cornerbacks [[Frank Minnifield]] and Hanford Dixon emerged as one of the NFL's premiere pass-defending duos.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=28–29}} After a slow start, the Browns rose to the top of the divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at [[Three Rivers Stadium]].{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=73, 79, 93}} A 12–4 record earned Cleveland home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=89}} The Browns' first opponents in the 1986 playoffs were the New York Jets. Kicker [[Mark Moseley]] made a field goal and won the game for the Browns 23–20. It was the team's first playoff victory in 17 years.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=109}} The following week, the Browns matched up against the [[Denver Broncos]] in the AFC Championship game in Cleveland.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=116}} Denver got out to an early lead, but Cleveland tied the game and then went ahead 20–13 in the fourth quarter.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=116, 118–119}} After the ensuing kickoff, the Broncos were pinned at their own 2-yard line with 5:32 remaining. Denver quarterback [[John Elway]] then engineered a 98-yard drive for a touchdown with the cold, whipping wind in his face.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=121–127}} "[[The Drive]]", as the series came to be known, tied the score and sent the game into overtime. Cleveland received the ball first in the [[sudden death (sport)|sudden-death period]] but was stopped by the Denver defense. On Denver's first possession, Elway again led the Broncos on a long drive ending with a [[Rich Karlis]] field goal that sailed just inside the left upright and won the game.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=128–130}} The drive that tied the game has since come to be seen as one of the best in playoff history, and is remembered by Cleveland fans as a historic meltdown.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=131–132}}

Although downtrodden by 1986's playoff defeat, Cleveland continued to win the following season.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=132}} The Browns finished with a 10–5 record in 1987 and won the AFC Central for the third year in a row.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=92}} In the divisional playoff round, the Browns faced the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and won 38–21.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=166–167}} The win set up a rematch with the Broncos in the AFC Championship in Denver.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=169}} The Broncos held a 21–3 lead at halftime, but a pair of rushing touchdowns and another by receiver [[Reggie Langhorne]] brought Cleveland to within seven points.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=173–177}} Cleveland scored again in the fourth quarter, but the Broncos went ahead again by seven points on a touchdown with four minutes left.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=178–179}} After Denver's kickoff, Kosar and the offense reached the Broncos' eight-yard line with 1:12 remaining.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=180}} Kosar handed the ball to Earnest Byner on a second down. Byner ran left and broke inside with a clear path to the end zone, but was stripped by Denver's [[Jeremiah Castille]] just before crossing the goal line. The Broncos ran down the clock before intentionally taking a [[Safety (American and Canadian football score)|safety]] and winning 38–33.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=181–183}} "[[The Fumble]]" quickly entered the lexicon of the Browns' modern-era disappointment, just as The Drive had a year before.{{sfn|Henkel|2005|p=92}}

The 1988 season was marred by injuries to the Browns' quarterbacks. But despite the rotating cast of quarterbacks, Cleveland managed to finish with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs as a wild-card team.{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=211, 215–218}} Cleveland met the Houston Oilers in the wild-card playoff round at home, and soon found themselves attempting to win with third-string quarterback [[Mike Pagel]] after an injury to second stringer [[Don Strock]].  Pagel put up a valiant effort, but the team lost the game 24–23.{{sfn|Knight|2006|p=226}} Four days after the Oilers loss, Schottenheimer and Modell announced that the coach would leave the team by mutual consent. Modell felt hiring an offensive coordinator was necessary to keep pace with the Oilers and the Bengals, a pair of divisional opponents then on the rise, but Schottenheimer said it "became evident that some of the differences we had, we weren't going to be able to resolve."{{sfn|Knight|2006|pp=228–229}}&lt;ref name="Schottenheimer leaves Browns"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melvin|first=Chuck|title=Schottenheimer Leaves Cleveland|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=December 28, 1988|agency=Associated Press|page=1–C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schottenheimer remained with the Browns until 1988, amassing a 44–27 (.620) regular-season record and a 2–4 (.333) mark in the playoffs, including four playoff appearances, three [[AFC Central]] Division titles, and two trips to the [[AFC Championship Game]] (both against the [[Denver Broncos]]).&lt;ref name="Chargers bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pfr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marty Schottenheimer coaching record|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/SchoMa0.htm|website=pro-football-reference.com|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City Chiefs===
[[Kansas City Chiefs]]' general manager [[Carl Peterson]] named Schottenheimer head coach on January 24, 1989.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/90s/ Kansas City Chiefs History 1990's] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610154419/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/90s/ |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Schottenheimer's Chiefs got out of the starting gate quickly, winning three of their first four games. The club then struggled, splitting its next six contests. In an inspiring [[Veterans Day]] performance against  [[1990 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]], the Seahawks miraculously won, 17–16. That loss brought on the furious stretch run which saw the club record victories in six of its last seven outings. The Chiefs clinched their first post-season berth since 1986 with a 24–21 win at San Diego and finished the year at 11–5, marking the franchise's best finish since 1969. The Chiefs suffered a heart-breaking, 17–16 loss at Miami on January 5, 1991 in an AFC Wild Card Game.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

A 27–21 victory against the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in the 1991 regular season finale gave the Chiefs the right to host the Raiders just six days later in the inaugural post-season game in Arrowhead's history, and the Chiefs' first home playoff game in 20 years. Thanks to six Los Angeles turnovers, the Chiefs registered their first post-season victory since [[Super Bowl IV]] with a 10–6 win in an AFC Wild Card Game on December 28. The following week, the Chiefs lost a 37–14 decision at Buffalo on January 5, 1992 in an AFC Divisional Playoff match-up as the Buffalo Bills' dynamic offense proved to be too much for the Chiefs.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

The Chiefs got off to a 3–1 start in 1992, but was faced with a 4–4 record at the season's midpoint. Despite four consecutive victories, the club's post-season hopes still came down to the season's final contest. Owning a 9–6 record and needing one more victory to secure a playoff berth, the Chiefs defense tallied three touchdowns, as Kansas City claimed a 42–20 win against Denver to finish the season at 10–6. Despite the big win against the [[1992 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], the Chiefs made a quick exit from the playoffs as quarterback [[Dave Krieg]] was sacked 7 times in a 17–0 AFC Wild Card loss against the [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] on January 2, 1993.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

The Chiefs spent the 1993 off-season installing the "[[West Coast offense]]" under the direction of new offensive coordinator [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]], who at one time served as quarterbacks coach to [[Joe Montana]] in San Francisco. On April 20, the Chiefs traded for Joe Montana, who directed the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories in the previous decade. On June 9, the club signed unrestricted free agent running back [[Marcus Allen]], who had spent 11 seasons playing against the Chiefs as a member of the rival Raiders. Montana and Allen made their debuts in a 27–3 win against the [[1993 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on September 5, marking Montana's first Opening Day appearance since 1990. Before taking the field in a Sunday night contest at [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on December 26, the team learned it had clinched its first AFC West title since 1971 thanks to a [[1993 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] loss earlier in the day. The team finished the season with an 11–5 regular season record, marking the club's fourth consecutive year with a double-digit victory tally.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

Kansas City got its first true taste of "Montana Magic" as the Hall of Fame passer engineered a brilliant comeback in a 27–24 overtime win in an AFC Wild Card thriller against the [[1993 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] on January 8, 1994. Next, the Chiefs traveled to the [[Astrodome]] to face the red-hot [[1993 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]], who had won 11 straight games to conclude the regular season. The heavily favored Oilers opened up a 13–7 lead in the fourth quarter, but once again, Montana conjured a comeback, guiding the club to a 28–20 victory. The Chiefs playoff journey ended as the club made its initial [[AFC Championship Game]] appearance against the [[1993 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] on January 23. Montana was knocked out of the contest early in the second half as Buffalo claimed its record fourth straight AFC title by a score of 30–13.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

After starting the 1994 season 3–0, the Chiefs dropped back-to-back games before snapping an 11-game losing streak against [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at Mile High Stadium on October 17 in a memorable Monday night contest. The Chiefs found themselves at 8–7 faced with a do-or-die regular season finale against the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]]. At 9–7, Kansas City qualified for the playoffs for a fifth straight season. However, the Chiefs made a rapid departure from the playoffs in Montana's final professional contest at Miami on [[New Year's Eve]]. Montana and Dolphins' quarterback [[Dan Marino]] conducted a masterful first-half duel that ended deadlocked at 17–17, but [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] eventually prevailed by a 27–17 count.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

Montana announced his retirement from football after 16 years in the NFL on April 18, 1995 and [[Steve Bono]] was promoted to the starting job. Immediately, the media predicted much gloom and doom for the 1995 Chiefs under Bono, leading Schottenheimer to quip during training camp that his club had been picked "sixth in a five-team division". Led by Bono, who merited a Pro Bowl berth, Kansas City posted an NFL-best 13–3 record with unblemished 8–0 marks in the AFC West and at Arrowhead. The Chiefs led the NFL in rushing offense (138.9 ypg), scoring defense (15.1 ppg) and turnover ratio (+12). A 24–3 win at Arizona on October 1 featured a surreal, 76-yard TD run on a bootleg by Bono as the Chiefs initiated a seven-game winning streak, the franchise's longest since 1969. Kansas City clinched a division title with a 29–23 victory at [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on December 3 en route to a franchise-best 13–3 regular season record and a team-record sixth consecutive postseason berth. The Chiefs were represented by seven players in the Pro Bowl, more than any other AFC team. In the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the underdog [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] on January 7, a blustery afternoon with the temperature at 11 degrees and a wind chill of −9. Three interceptions and three missed field goals from placekicker [[Lin Elliot]] contributed to the 10–7 loss at Arrowhead.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

Kansas City entered the 1996 campaign with essentially the same lineup as the club boasted in 1995 and were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' along with Green Bay as pre-season Super Bowl favorites. The club started the season with a 4–0 record for the first time in team history, but the season's lofty expectations came crashing down as the squad lost three of its next four games. A three-game winning streak, including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl champion]] [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], put the club back in post-season contention at 8–3. Needing just one more win to qualify for the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped their next two games: a 24–19 loss against [[1996 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]] and a 20–9 loss to the [[1996 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]]. The Chiefs finished with a 9–7 record, missing the postseason for the first time since 1989 after the AFC's final Wild Card spot went to the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], who won a tiebreaker with Kansas City.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

Kansas City dramatically retooled its roster in 1997, beginning with the signing of free agent quarterback [[Elvis Grbac]] on March 17. In addition to Grbac, the Chiefs lineup featured 11 new starters. All the new faces quickly formed a cohesive unit as the Chiefs posted a 13–3 record, an 8–0 Arrowhead record and their second AFC West title in three years. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring defense, allowing a mere 14.5 points per game. The 232 total points permitted by the Chiefs in 1997 were the lowest tally ever allowed in a 16-game season in team history. Kansas City also broke a 63-year-old mark owned by the [[1934 Detroit Lions season|1934 Detroit Lions]] by not permitting a second-half TD in 10 consecutive games. Grbac returned for the regular season finale against [[1997 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] on December 21 as the squad finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history. The Chiefs' 13–3 record gave them home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs. However, their playoff run was short-lived, as Kansas City lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 14–10 in the Divisional round.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

The following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7–9 in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching ("[[Martyball]]"), and resigned following the 1998 season.&lt;ref name="Chiefs History 1990's"/&gt;

Schottenheimer spent a total of 10 seasons as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, from 1989 to 1998 recording a 101–58–1 regular season record (.634) and had three division titles, seven playoff appearances, and a trip to the AFC Championship game in 1993, losing to the [[Buffalo Bills]].

===Washington Redskins===
After working as a football analyst for [[ESPN]] from 1999 to 2000, Schottenheimer was hired as head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] for the 2001 season.&lt;ref name="Chargers bio"/&gt; Schottenheimer's Redskins became the first team in NFL history to win five consecutive games immediately after losing its first five games. One of the Redskins loses was a 13–45 loss to Schottenheimer's former team, the Chiefs. The Redskins won eight of their final eleven games to narrowly miss the post season.  Despite this, in a controversial move, [[Daniel Snyder]], the owner of the Redskins, fired Schottenheimer on January 13, 2002 after just one 8–8 season to make room for former [[University of Florida]] head coach [[Steve Spurrier]].

===San Diego Chargers===
The [[San Diego Chargers]] hired Schottenheimer as their 13th head coach on January 29, 2002. Schottenheimer posted a 47–33 record (.588) with the Chargers. His success didn't come immediately, as the team posted a 4–12 record in 2003, thereby "earning" the first overall pick in the draft. He was named NFL Coach of the Year for the [[2004 NFL season]] after the Chargers went 12–4 and won the [[AFC West]]. Schottenheimer led the team to two playoff appearances, his 12th and 13th as a head coach. However, both appearances resulted in disappointing losses; to the underdog [[New York Jets]] in overtime in [[2004–05 NFL playoffs#AFC: New York Jets 20, San Diego Chargers 17 (OT)|2005]], and to the [[New England Patriots]] in [[2006–07 NFL playoffs#AFC: New England Patriots 24, San Diego Chargers 21|2007]], bringing his playoff record to 5–13.
[[File:Marty Schottenheimer Chargers.jpg|thumb|270px|Schottenheimer with a Chargers fan during his tenure as San Diego's coach.]]

Schottenheimer was abruptly fired by San Diego on February 12, 2007. Reasons for his firing include a strained relationship with general manager [[A.J. Smith]], which reached a breaking point when four assistants ([[Cam Cameron]], [[Wade Phillips]], [[Rob Chudzinski]] and [[Greg Manusky]]) left for positions with other teams. These coaches all left to pursue higher-level opportunities with other teams, which cannot be prevented by the team they are leaving under NFL rules; two of them became head coaches, instead of merely making a lateral move to the same position with another team.

Jim Trotter, of the ''[[San Diego Union Tribune]]'', also believes that Schottenheimer's insistence that his brother, [[Kurt Schottenheimer]], replace Phillips as the defensive coordinator further strained the relationship between team president [[Dean Spanos]] and Schottenheimer. Spanos had always been against the idea of allowing relatives to be on the same coaching staff, even though Schottenheimer's son Brian was the Chargers' quarterbacks coach. Schottenheimer even went as far to book a flight to San Diego for his brother, Kurt, against Spanos's wishes. This act of defiance increased the gap between Spanos and Schottenheimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070218/news_lz1s18martys.html |title=Marty's escape route | work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Spanos released a statement saying "Our fans deserve to know what changed for me over the last month. When I decided to move ahead with Marty Schottenheimer in mid-January, I did so with the expectation that the core of his fine coaching staff would remain intact. Unfortunately, that did not prove to be the case, and the process of dealing with these coaching changes convinced me that we simply could not move forward with such dysfunction between our head coach and general manager. In short, this entire process over the last month convinced me beyond any doubt that I had to act to change this untenable situation and create an environment where everyone at Charger Park would be pulling in the same direction and working at a championship level. I expect exactly that from our entire Charger organization in 2007."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20070212-1816-statement.html |title=San Diego Chargers&amp;nbsp;– Statement from Chargers president Dean Spanos |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schottenheimer was still owed $4 million for the final year of his contract, as the firing was "without cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acee |first=Kevin |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20070213-9999-1n13marty.html |title=&gt; San Diego Chargers&amp;nbsp;– Chargers give Schottenheimer the ax |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schottenheimer was replaced as San Diego head coach by [[Norv Turner]]—coincidentally the last full-time head coach the Redskins had before Schottenheimer's arrival. Following the Chargers' subsequent 1–3 start the next season, fans at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] voiced their displeasure with the firing by chanting "Marty! Marty! Marty!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20071001-9999-1s1magee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Schottenheimer's NFL coaching career, 17 coaches have been hired by teams that previously employed him, and all but the Chargers have a losing record in their post-Schottenheimer eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000120665/article/the-marty-schottenheimer-effect|title=The Marty Schottenheimer Effect|work=[[National Football League]]|date=2013-01-02|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia Destroyers (UFL) ===
[[File:Marty Schottenheimer 2011.jpg|thumb|270px|Schottenheimer holding the 2011 UFL Championship following the Destroyers' win over Las Vegas.]]

In March 2011, the [[Virginia Destroyers]] hired Schottenheimer to be their first head coach and general manager, at the age of 67.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamptonroads.com/2011/03/schottenheimer-officially-named-virginias-ufl-coach&lt;/ref&gt; In order to lure Schottenheimer to the Destroyers, league majority owner [[William Hambrecht]] personally guaranteed he would pay Schottenheimer's $1.1 million salary for the eight-game season.&lt;ref name=martysues&gt;Harris, Joe (October 18, 2012). [http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/18/51404.htm Marty Schottenheimer Sues UFL Founder]. ''Courthouse News Service''. Retrieved October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He led the Destroyers to a 4–1 record in the shortened 2011 regular season, earning a playoff berth with home-field advantage in his first season. Schottenheimer's efforts earned him the 2011 United Football League Coach of the Year award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4309038&lt;/ref&gt; His starting running back, [[Dominic Rhodes]], was also named the MVP of the 2011 UFL season.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamptonroads.com/2011/10/more-championship-play-destroyers&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2011, the Virginia Destroyers derailed the two-time defending UFL Champion [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] 17–3 in the [[2011 UFL Championship Game]] at the [[Virginia Beach Sportsplex]]. It was Schottenheimer's first ever championship as a coach.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/united-football-league/story/_/id/7133522/virginia-destroyers-ufl-give-marty-schottenheimer-first-pro-title&lt;/ref&gt;

Schottenheimer abruptly resigned from the Destroyers shortly before the 2012 season, citing discomfort over unspecified issues facing the team that season and the failure of the team to meet also-unspecified conditions for his return.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Tom (September 20, 2012). [http://hamptonroads.com/2012/09/coach-i-wont-go-deep-reasons-leaving-destroyers Coach: I won't go 'deep into' reasons for leaving Destroyers]. ''The Virginian-Pilot''. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Schottenheimer later sued Hambrecht after not receiving any of the money he was owed.&lt;ref name=martysues/&gt; He received a settlement of approximately $800,000 in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Kasler"&gt;Dale Kasler, [http://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article54798225.html Ex-NFL coach fighting owners of defunct Sacramento team over $1 million in back pay], ''Sacramento Bee'' (January 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television work===
Soon after being replaced in 2007 as head coach of the [[San Diego Chargers]], he was hired by [[ESPN]] to work as an NFL Insider on the network, returning to a role he had served in between his coaching stints with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and the [[Washington Redskins]]. He has recently{{when|date=October 2017}} been seen on ''[[SportsCenter]]'' and ''[[NFL Live]]''.

==Personal life==
Schottenheimer has been married to his wife, Pat, since 1968. They live on [[Lake Norman]] in North Carolina. They have two children, a daughter, Kristen and a son, [[Brian Schottenheimer|Brian]], who is the [[Offensive coordinator]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Marty's younger brother [[Kurt Schottenheimer|Kurt]] was also a coach in the NFL.

In 2011, Schottenheimer was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. By the time the diagnosis was announced publicly in 2016, it had progressed slowly and he still maintained much of his memory and function, and he was about to begin experimental treatment to slow the progression of the disease even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland/post/_/id/2310/alzheimers-disease-wont-prevent-marty-schottenheimer-from-attending-30th-reunion-of-browns-1986-season|title=Alzheimer's disease won’t prevent Marty Schottenheimer from attending 30th reunion of Browns 1986 season|last=Grossi|first=Tony|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schottenheimer coaching tree==
Schottenheimer was heavily influenced by [[Lou Saban]], his first professional head coach in the American Football League. In turn, several current NFL Head Coaches trace their lineage back to Marty Schottenheimer on his [[Coaching tree]]:

[[File:Schottenheimer Coaching Tree.svg]]

Schottenheimer gave many head coaches their first coaching jobs. All of these coaches have coached under Schottenheimer:
*[[Bill Cowher]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (1992–2006)
*[[Gunther Cunningham]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]]
*[[Tony Dungy]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] (1996–2001), and [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2002–2008)
*[[Lindy Infante]], [[Green Bay Packers]] (1988–1991), and [[Indianapolis Colts]] (1996–1997)
*[[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], [[Green Bay Packers]] (2006-2018)
*[[Herman Edwards]], [[New York Jets]]; [[Kansas City Chiefs]]
*[[Cam Cameron]], [[Miami Dolphins]] (2007)
*[[Wade Phillips]], [[New Orleans Saints]]; [[Denver Broncos]]; [[Buffalo Bills]]; [[Atlanta Falcons]]; [[Dallas Cowboys]]; [[Houston Texans]]
*[[Bruce Arians]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] (2013-2017)
*[[Tony Sparano]], [[Miami Dolphins]]
*[[Kurt Schottenheimer]], [[Virginia Destroyers]]
*[[Dale Lindsey]], [[San Diego Toreros football|University of San Diego]] (2013-present)

Schottenheimer's son [[Brian Schottenheimer|Brian]] has served as a coach for multiple NFL and college teams since 1997. His longest tenure was with the [[New York Jets]], as their [[offensive coordinator]] from 2006 through 2011. In January 2018, the Seattle Seahawks announced that they had hired Brian as their offensive coordinator.

Schottenheimer's younger brother [[Kurt Schottenheimer|Kurt]] coached for multiple professional and college teams. His first position was as [[defensive coordinator]] for [[William Paterson University]] in 1974; he then coached for a total of 12 different teams from 1978 through 2012. He most recently served as Marty's successor as head coach with the [[Virginia Destroyers]] of the now defunct [[United Football League (2009–)|UFL]] (this is not reflected in the above tree, which shows only NFL-based relationships).

'''Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani''' (born 8 February 1983) is a [[British Muslims|British Muslim]] [[social entrepreneur]] and activist, who is currently the Director of [[Sufra NW London]]. He is known for his extensive work in founding charitable organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sufra-nwlondon.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Annual-Report-2013-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sufra Annual Report 2013-2014 |publisher=Sufra-nwlondon.org.uk |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamdami is an advocate on youth issues, particularly those affecting young people from minority communities and has stated he combines his experience from everything he's done to challenge cultural taboos around social issues and empower young people to play an active role in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansaryouth.org.uk/category/profiles-legends |title=AYP |publisher=Ansaryouth.org.uk |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2001-2004: Muslim Youth Helpline===
Mohammed began his career in the voluntary sector at the age of 18 years whilst studying for his [[A-levels]], when he founded the award-winning charity [[Muslim Youth Helpline]] in February 2001. This is today considered the Muslim community's premier youth counselling service in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salaam.co.uk/muslimsinbritain/?p=1925salaam.co.uk/MohammedSadiqMamdani |title=Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani – Salaam.co.uk &amp;#124; Muslims in Britain |publisher=Salaam.co.uk |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at college that Mohammed first realised the extent of isolation that today's young Muslims experience; while problems such as drug misuse, depression and sexuality are issues common among many young people, he believed that young Muslims often need advice that takes into account broader religious and social contexts, which is why he created the helpline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/may/25/10 |title=Emerging activists case study: Mohammed Mamdani &amp;#124; Society |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After helping to secure its financial base, Mamadani retired as a trustee of MYH to take up fresh challenges: he became a [[trustee]] of the Foundation for Social Entrepreneurs, a charity that promotes [[social entrepreneurship]] by offering financial awards and support packages to individuals with creative ideas for achieving social objectives.&lt;ref name="salaam1925"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salaam.co.uk/muslimsinbritain/?p=1925 |title=Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani – Salaam.co.uk &amp;#124; Muslims in Britain |publisher=Salaam.co.uk |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005-2010: Ansar Youth Project and Queen's Crescent Community Association===
4 years after Muslim Youth Helpline, Mamdani set up Ansar Youth Project, a community based model in faith and culturally sensitive youth-work as a response to the [[7/7 London bombings]]. He had been the Head of Operations of Ansar Youth Project until 2009. Also, between 2005-2007 Mohammed was appointed to the [[Board of Trustees]] for [[UnLtd]], the Foundation of Social Entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unltd.org.uk/?s=Mohammed+Sadiq+Mamdani |title=You searched for Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani |publisher=UnLtd |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2010, Mamdani was employed as a [[BUILDING MANAGER|Capacity Building Manager]] and Head of Youth Services at Queen's Crescent Community Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qcca.org.uk/AboutQCCA.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213021833/http://www.qcca.org.uk/AboutQCCA.htm |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamdani joined QCCA in an effort to increase his experience and knowledge on how to run charitable organisations, primarily those who support disadvantaged people. He wanted to set up organisations which tackle [[homelessness]], [[food poverty in the United Kingdom]], [[debt]] amongst other communal problems. Mamdani used his knowledge from QCCA to set up the initial charitable trust; [[Al-Mizan]] during the summer of 2011. Mamdani left QCCA in October 2011 to work closely with his newly found charity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/reg/join-pprofile?_ed=0_0dpSzn-5ElkAYW7bjGuTU5HofbVm2Y-mf9zhkbvzZaNfMC3CR4emtpH-OZIHJf_RGhZwsTROQCfB26a1b9ONfh&amp;trk=pprof-0-ts-view_full-0] {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011-2012: Al-Mizan Charitable Trust===
[[File:MohammedMamdaniApril2014.jpg|thumb|left]]
Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani, founded [[Al-Mizan Charitable Trust]] in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSM (LinkedIn profile)|url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mohammed-sadiq-mamdani/34/66b/820 |publisher=LinkedIn.com|year=2013|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the UK's first Muslim grant-funder that supports individuals living in poverty, regardless of their faith or cultural background. Every month, the Trust receives more than 40 applications for financial support, of which only half of eligible applications can be supported with a grant or interest-free loan of up to £500.

Although the Trust prioritises applications which provide long-term benefit, rising poverty and unemployment has forced the charity to consider funding more and more applications for basic household and subsistence costs. The fundraising appeals are run in partnership with grassroots organisations, so that the packs reach the people who need them the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Mizan Charitable Trust on CharityChoiceUK|url=http://www.charitychoice.co.uk/al-mizan-charitable-trust-32942|publisher=LinkedIn.com|year=2012|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–present: Sufra===
[[File:SufraNWLondon.jpg|thumb|''[[Sufra]]'']]
[[Sufra]] was in talks by Mamdani back in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani on LinkedIn|url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mohammed-sadiq-mamdani/34/66b/820 |publisher=LinkedIn.com|year=2013|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it wasn't pushed into establishment until late 2012, until eventually it was officially founded in April 2013. Sufra is an Arabic term meaning "Come to the table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufra translated (from google)|url=https://translate.google.co.uk/?hl=en-GB#ar/en/%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A9|publisher=Google|year=2014|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the charity was to provide local people with food and even basic necessities and toiletries. [[Sufra]] was marketed as a Community [[Food Bank]] &amp; Kitchen, which aims to support disadvantaged families suffering food poverty in the local area. Sufra quickly became noted for being the first Muslim run charities that supports all backgrounds and ethnicities in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almizantrust.org.uk/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Almizantrust.org.uk |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufra began to run Food Academies in 2014, also becoming a local community centre aiming to bring the community together by running food academies and teaching people to cook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neilthewriter.co.uk/brent-sufra-mohammed-mamdani/ |title="I became part of his story" – Neil Baker |publisher=Neilthewriter.co.uk |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim was to train young people between the ages of 16–25 years in basic cookery skills. Over 5 weeks and 10 intensive sessions it hopes to teach people to cook 10 home-cooked meals, understand nutrition and how to maintain a healthy diet. In addition to this, they run a master-chef competition and learn to manage weekly budgets with an accredited qualification, which can be used to apply for an apprenticeship or employment in the catering industry. Mamdani has stated that Sufra has been his most hardest challenges yet but believes there is still more to achieve from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sufra-nwlondon.org.uk/services/food-academy/ |title=Food Academy |publisher=Sufra NW London |date=20 June 2014 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Mamdani's enrolled for [[Richmond upon Thames College]] in September 1999, located in South London from where he proceeded to Oxford to study Arabic and Persian with Islamic Studies. He took a year out from his undergraduate studies at Oxford University to pilot the [[Muslim Youth Helpline]] service. Mohammed graduated from [[St. John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], Oxford in 2009. He studied towards a Master's in Arabic and Islamic Studies from [[School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)|SOAS]], University of London a year after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almizantrust.org.uk/Staff/staff-and-volunteers |title=Staff &amp; Volunteers &amp;#124; Staff |publisher=Almizantrust.org.uk |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
His awards include Volunteer of the Year from BT &amp; the Telephone Helplines Association (2003), Whitbread Youth Achievers Award (2004) and CSV Year of the Volunteer Medal for Innovation (2005). His citation for the Whitbread award noted, "Mohammed is an inspirational example of what young volunteers can do in their communities, through determination and commitment. This is a project that is making a real difference to hundreds of lives."&lt;ref name="salaam1925"/&gt; Mamdani was added to [[The Independent]]s "Good List" of 50 people in 2006, where [[Paul Vallely]] was involved in the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5304736.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Newspaper announces 'Good List' |publisher=BBC News |date=1 September 2006 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Mamdani was one of 67 who had been awarded the [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax]] Giving Extra Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halifaxcommunities.co.uk/england/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210111936/http://www.halifaxcommunities.co.uk/england/ |archivedate=10 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; As well as receiving this reward, [[Sufra]] was entitled to receive £300 in bonus bond vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lorraine King |url=http://www.kilburntimes.co.uk/news/founder_of_sufra_food_bank_in_brent_wins_halifax_giving_extra_award_1_3949277 |title=Founder of Sufra Food Bank in Brent wins Halifax Giving Extra Award |newspaper=[[Kilburn Times]] |date=2 June 2017 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morgan ap Maredudd''' sometimes referred to as “Morgan the Rebel” (flourished 1270-1316), rebel, of [[Glamorgan]].
==Life==
He was the son of [[Maredudd ap Gruffudd]] (c.1234-c.1275) the last Welsh lord of [[Caerleon]] of Machen, and Maud, daughter of Cadwallon.

Owing to grievances against the de Clares, when his family was deprived of its estates by [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester]], he claimed to be at war only against the lords of [[Glamorgan]].
During 1283, he supported the rebellion of [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]], [[prince of Wales]].
He was the leader of the Glamorgan insurgents during the rising of [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] in 1294-5; under his leadership, the Welsh captured castles at [[Kenfig]], [[Llangybi, Monmouthshire|Llangibby]], and Morlais.
Morgan submitted to king [[Edward I]] and in 1297,{{sfn|Lloyd|1894}} he became an esquire of Edward's household and his agent in south Wales.
==Family==
His daughter, Angharad, married [[Llewelyn ap Ifor]], Lord of St. Clere.

Gwala was assassinated on the 26 June 2013 after unnamed gunmen opened fire and he was shot 12 times.

The movement says Nkululeko Gwala was assassinated for exposing corruption in Cato Crest and that the community knows the identity of the gunman who they say also killed housing activist Thembinkosi Qumbelo.

'''Peter Klashorst''' (also ''Peter van de Klashorst'') (born 11 February 1957) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]], and [[photographer]].

==Biography==

Klashorst was born in Santpoort and graduated cum laude from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam in the early nineteen eighties. During this period a new art movement arose in Europe, namely "The New Wild Ones". Klashorst became one of its leading personalities. In 1983 he received a prestigious Dutch Royal award (Koninklijke Subsidie voor de Vrije Schilderkunst) from [[Queen Beatrix]].

In 1987 Klashorst was one of the initiators of "After Nature", an international art collective that aimed at reinventing painting and bringing art back to society and taking it out of the official highbrow art world. Famous and notorious for their joint performances on streets and in nightclubs,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} they toured the world and were a notorious phenomenon of their time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The collective “After Nature”, including co-founders Klashorst and the artists [[Roberto Cabot]], [[George Dokoupil]] and [[Ernst Voss]], opposed the prevailing non-figurative style and was interested in just painting what they saw.

During this period Klashorst could often be found in New York’s East Village art scene where he showed his work in galleries at Manhattan’s Lower East Side, for instance the Daniel Newburg Gallery and the International With Monument Gallery. He hang out with Robert Mapplethorpe and Jeff Koons still in the beginning of his career.

Tired and disillusioned with the whole commercial art world and all the time consuming networking in expensive restaurants, he started travelling to distant places without an art market or top galleries. Just as his heroes the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the painter [[Paul Gauguin]] he went to Africa full of romantic ideas, but of course the harsh reality of the African city life is no picnic. During this time he exhibited in the National Museum of Kenya and gave lectures and workshops to local artists and street kids, but was also arrested and imprisoned a few times for his uncompromising sculptures and paintings.

Klashorst has been living all over the place but never left his beloved place at the Spuistraat in Amsterdam. He has been working at lot from Cities as Bangkok, Mombasa and [[Phnom Penh]]. In 2011 he did one of his last self organised shows at the [[Tuol Sleng]], S21 the former Khmer Rouge prison (Cambodia). In honour of the victims of the [[Khmer Rouge]]’s terror and genocide that took place from 1975 to 1979 in Cambodia, Peter Klashorst created an impressive and sometimes very confronting set of around 50 paintings.
 
The show got world wide attention ([[The New York Times]] and Herald Tribune).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/opinion/23iht-edbrady23.html|title=The Walking Dead|date=23 April 2011|work=International Herald Tribune|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
"People in the West often believe that these events of brutal oppression only happened in the past. But even right now, in the so-called civilized western world, innocent people from poor countries are put behind bars. Authorities in the rich countries arrest them, take their pictures, interrogate them and prepare dossiers, just to deport them as illegal immigrants and send them back after months in jail. That is also an issue that fuelled this work, and makes this exhibition not only a tribute to those who died at S-21, but also to those innocent people who are suffering in prisons all over the world right now and are unable to be free in this world that God created for all of us", says Klashorst.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Personal life==

In 2014 he was diagnosed with [[HIV]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://revu.nl/artikel/interview-klashorst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/kunstenaar-peter-klashorst-met-tbc-en-hiv-opgenomen-in-cambodjaans-ziekenhuis-~beb77778/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Nahum''' is an English art dealer, author, lecturer and journalist who is known for his many appearances on the long running [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', on which he appeared from 1981 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/antiquesuk/aboutseries/appraisers/nahum.html | title=Retired Site &amp;#124; PBS Programs &amp;#124; PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered a long lost [[Richard Dadd]] watercolour on the show which was subsequently sold to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3673781/Richard-Dadd-madness-and-beauty.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Richard Dadd: madness and beauty | first=Jennifer | last=Higgie | date=31 May 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nahum was educated at [[Sherborne School]] and began his career at Peter Wilson's [[Sotheby's]] in 1966. During his 17 years with the company he initiated the Victorian Painting Department at the newly opened Sotheby's [[Belgravia]] in 1971 and was head of the British Painting Department (1840 to Contemporary) until his departure in 1984. He was also a Senior Director sitting on the chairman's committee and advisor to the [[British Rail]] [[Pension Fund]] on Victorian Paintings.&lt;ref name=Roadshow&gt;{{cite book|date= 2005|author=David Battie and Fiona Malcolm|isbn=978-1-84533-060-6|title=The Antiques Roadshow|publisher=Mitchell Beazley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Sotheby's in 1984 to open his own gallery, The [[Leicester Galleries]],{{#tag:ref|He acquired the name in 1984 of the [[Leicester Galleries]] founded in 1902 and first located off of [[Leicester Square]]. It held its last show in 1975.|group="nb"}} in [[St James's, London]], specialising in paintings, drawings and sculptures of the highest quality from the 19th and 20th centuries. He now works independently, actively buying and selling and is currently adviser to major private collections and museums throughout the world, signatory on authentication certificates for Victorian paintings sold to Japan and official valuer for the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment of the Government of Australia. He also acts as a celebrity auctioneer for many charities. He is a television personality, academic, lecturer, author, frame designer and frequent lender of paintings to international exhibitions.

Nahum created the trading website onlinegalleries.com for the art and antique dealers around the world, all members of C.I.N.O.A. and their own national trade associations. This gives the dealers a trading platform and a chance to display their wares in their own purpose-built websites and galleries, and gives the public the opportunity to buy with confidence.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Public appearances==
From 1981 to 2002 Peter Nahum was a regular contributor to the BBC's Antiques Roadshow rediscovering [[Richard Dadd]]'s lost watercolour ''Artists Halt in the Desert'' in 1987, which was later sold to the [[British Museum]] and an album of Filipino landscapes sold in 1995 for £240,000.

He has also appeared on Breakfast Television, The City Program and Signals and on Sixty Minutes, to name a few, as well as various radio talk shows.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In this respect he has appeared in  ''The Artful Codgers'' made for BBC Four in November 2007 It was Peter Nahum who first reported the Greenhalgh family to the police with full evidence in 1984, although it took another 16 years to convict them.

'''Sir Philip Magnus, 1st Baronet''' (7 October 1842 – 29 August 1933) was a British educational reformer and politician, who represented the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University constituency]] as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Unionist]] from 1906 to 1922. He had previously been appointed director of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], from where he helped oversee the creation of a modern system of technical education in the United Kingdom. He was married to the writer and teacher [[Katie Magnus]], and was father of the publisher [[Laurie Magnus]]. Laurie predeceased him, and on Philip's death in 1933 he was succeeded in the baronetcy by Laurie's eldest son [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip]].

==Biography==
After studying at [[University College School]] and [[University College London]], where he took [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class honours]] in both arts and science, Magnus chose to take up a religious career. An active member of the [[Reform Judaism (United Kingdom)|Reform Judaism in Britain]], he spent three years studying at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] in Berlin and returned to London to take up a post as assistant rabbi at the [[West London Synagogue]] in 1866.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;Bailey (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as rabbi, Magnus supplemented his income by teaching private students, which grew steadily into a regular occupation. He held a lectureship at Stockwell teacher training college, taught at University College London, and examined prospective teachers for the [[College of Preceptors]]. In 1880, he finally left his rabbinical work to become director of the newly formed [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. He oversaw the rapid growth of the institute, focusing his attentions on the technical education departments, of which he became Superintendent in 1888; he would hold this post until retiring in 1915.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004; Who Was Who"&gt;Bailey (2004); ''Who Was Who''&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the Institute, Magnus was influential in setting national education policy; he sat on the [[Samuelson Commission]] (the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction) of 1884, and for his work here was knighted in 1886.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The Commission's report led to the [[Technical Instruction Act 1889]], which supported local authorities in creating technical schools around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical colleges and further education: Science and Art Department|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/technical-further-education.htm|publisher=[[The National Archives (UK)]]|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged the reform of primary and secondary state education in London, and helped oversee the merger of the City and Guilds Institute into the newly formed [[Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]], he was elected to Parliament as a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]], representing the [[London University (UK Parliament constituency)|London University constituency]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; He narrowly defeated Sir [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], a prominent Cambridge physiologist, by twenty-four votes. Foster was a Liberal, who on his initial election had joined the Liberal Unionists and supported [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Salisbury's]] Conservative government; however, he later [[crossed the floor]] to rejoin the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], in large part due to his opposition to the [[Education Act 1902|1902 educational reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Romano (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Magnus was re-elected in 1910, and on the demise of the Liberal Unionists in 1912 joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He held the seat in 1918 – where he defeated [[Sidney Webb]] – but did not seek re-election in 1922.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

In retirement, he continued to sit as a member of the Senate of the University of London, and chaired the council of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. He was a governor of the [[Northampton Institute]] and [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]], and a vice-president of the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]], the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]], and [[Jews' College]].&lt;ref name="Bailey 2004; Who Was Who"/&gt; In 1917, he co-founded the anti-Zionist [[League of British Jews]].

'''Princess Alexandrine Irene of Prussia''' (7 April 1915 – 2 October 1980) was the eldest daughter and fifth child of [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince]], and [[Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]].  Her grandparents were [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] and his wife [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein]], and [[Frederick Francis III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia]].  Alexandrine was a member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]].

=== Early life ===
Alexandrine was born at the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince's Palace) in Berlin.  Her middle name of Irene (Greek for "peace") was likely given due to her birth during the second year of [[World War I]].  She followed older brothers [[Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (1906–1940)|Wilhelm]], [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia|Louis Ferdinand]], [[Prince Hubertus of Prussia|Hubertus]], and [[Prince Frederick of Prussia (1911–1966)|Frederick]].  Alexandrine's only sister, Cecilie, was born in 1917.  Alexandrine known by the nickname of "Adini" within her family.

It became clear shortly after Alexandrine's birth that she was affected with [[Down Syndrome]].  Unlike other royal children with special needs, Alexandrine was not hidden away.  She appeared in official family photographs and at events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Gareth|title=The Emperors: How Europe's Rulers Were Destroyed by the First World War|date=August 6, 2014|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited,|pages=30|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was cared for primarily by her nurse, Selma Boese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussen.de/de/geschichte/kronprinz_wilhelm/kinder/alexandrine.html|website=Preussen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, Alexandrine attended the Trüpersche Sonderschule, a school dedicated to the education of young women with special needs.

Alexandrine was confirmed along with her sister Cecilie in October 1934.

=== Later Life and Death ===
Alexandrine lived most of her later life in Bavaria, first in [[Pöcking]] and later near [[Lake Starnberg]].  She was visited there regularly by her family, particularly her brother Louis Ferdinand.

Alexandrine died in 1980 and is buried near her parents and brother Frederick at [[Hohenzollern Castle]].

'''Roderick Sprague III''' (February 18, 1933 &amp;ndash; August 20, 2012)&lt;ref name=lmtobit&gt;{{cite news | url = http://lmtribune.com/obituaries/article_87ded672-2179-52f3-aad5-bd40a3d2828c.html?mode=story | title = Obituaries: Dr. Roderick Sprague III | newspaper = Lewiston Tribune | date = August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[anthropologist]], ethnohistorian and historical [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], and the Emeritus Director of the Laboratory of Anthropology at the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]], where he taught for thirty years.  He had extensive experience in environmental impact research, trade beads, aboriginal burial customs, and the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] area.

In addition to his work in the traditional anthropological fields, he also collaborated with Professor [[Grover Krantz]] in an attempt to apply scientific reasoning to the study of [[Sasquatch]].

==Education==
Sprague received both his bachelor's and master's degrees in [[anthropology]] from [[Washington State University]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], serving in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in between.  He received his Ph.D in 1967 from the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].

As a graduate student in 1964 at Washington State University, he was the field supervisor of a dig at the Palus burial site in [[Lyons Ferry, Washington]] when one of only a few known Jefferson [[Indian Peace Medal|Peace Medals]] was discovered.

Additionally, his dissertation, "Aboriginal burial practices in the plateau region of North America" (1967) is considered one of the best writings on the topic.

==Career==
Sprague’s career was varied and took him in different directions.  He conducted excavations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[Alaska]], and the [[Canadian Maritime]] on [[Prince Edward Island]]; and research in the [[American Southwest]] and [[Inner Mongolia]].  Much of his research was on burial practices and historical archaeology, with a special interest in glass and ceramic trade beads and buttons.  He conducted burial research at the request of ten different American Indian tribal governments.  Sprague was an early advocate of the importance of [[art repatriation|repatriation]] in archaeological and anthropological excavations, long before the enactment of the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20060530-1339-wst-remainsreburial.html “American Indian remains scheduled for ritual reburial”], ‘’[[San Diego Union Tribune]]’’, 2006-05-30, Retrieved on 2008-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprague served many roles in the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]]: on the Board of Directors from 1970–71, secretary-treasurer from 1971–1974, member of the Editorial Advisory Board since 1977, Book Review Editor from 1977 to 1997, Archivist from 1987 to 1998, as President in 1976 and 1990 and as Parliamentarian from 1984 to 2008.

He was a Professor of Anthropology at the University of Idaho in Moscow for thirty years, until his retirement in 1997.

Sprague, along with Dr. Deward E. Walker, founded the scholarly journal Northwest Anthropological Research Notes in 1966, called the Journal of Northwest Anthropology since 2001.

==Awards==
Sprague was the first member of [[Society for Historical Archaeology|The Society for Historical Archaeology]] to be awarded both the [[J. C. Harrington Award|J. C. Harrington Medal in Historical Archaeology]] and the Carol Ruppe Distinguished Service Award.&lt;ref&gt;Society for Historical Archaeology. [http://www.sha.org/about/awards.htm “Awards of the Society for Historical Archaeology”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531154331/http://www.sha.org/about/awards.htm |date=2009-05-31 }}, ‘’[[Society for Historical Archaeology]]’’, Retrieved on 2008-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In retirement, Sprague lived in Moscow with his wife Linda, who also holds degrees in anthropology. He had four adult children: Roderick IV, Katherine, Frederick, and Alexander Sprague.

The term '''Samsui women''' ({{zh|s=三水妇女|t=三水婦女|p=sān shuǐ fù nǚ|labels=no}}) broadly refers to a group of Chinese immigrants who came to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]] between the 1920s and 1940s in search of construction and industrial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thulaja|first=Naidu Ratnala|title=Samsui women|url=http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_795_2005-01-18.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]]|date=1999-04-17|accessdate=2008-04-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421012259/http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_795_2005-01-18.html|archivedate=2008-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hard work contributed to the development of the [[Straits Settlements]], both as colonies and later as the new nations of [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]. Samsui women did manual labour similar to [[coolie]]s but were more independent.

==History==
Around 3,000 Samsui women are believed to have moved to Singapore from China between 1934 and 1938. This migration continued until 1949 when emigration from China was declared illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Samsui women of today |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/The+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20080115-45004.html |accessdate=2 August 2018 |publisher=[[AsiaOne]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsui women mainly came from [[Sanshui District|Sanshui (Samsui)]] in [[Guangdong|Guangdong (Kwangtung) Province]], but also from [[Shunde District|Shunde]] and [[Dongguan]].&lt;ref name="majie"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-11-29_160454.html | title=Majie | publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]] | date=2013-11-28 | accessdate=2015-06-19 | last=Koh | first=Jaime}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of them were [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], while the rest were [[Hakka people|Hakka]].

In Chinese, these women are referred to as ''Hong Tou Jin'' ({{zh|s=红头巾|t=紅頭巾|p=hóng tóu jīn|labels=no}}), which means "red [[Kerchief|bandana]]", because of the red cloth hats they wore at work.

==Jobs==
Coming to Singapore as cheap labourers between the 1920s and 1940s, Samsui women worked mainly in the construction industry and other industries that required hard labour. They also worked as [[domestic servant]]s.&lt;ref name="majie" /&gt; They had a reputation of rejecting jobs involving drug (particularly [[opium]]) peddling, prostitution, or other vices, even if that meant living in poverty. Their contributions to housing construction and as well as labour at hawker centres have been invaluable to Singapore's early development.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Social interactions==
Before arriving in Singapore, most Samsui women took vows never to marry, although there have been known exceptions. They lived in cramped conditions with other Samsui women, helping out each other and forming tightly united cliques.

Samsui women also remained in touch with their relatives back home in China, communicating with them frequently through letters. Occasionally, they would send money to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Current status==
There are fewer than a hundred Samsui women left in Singapore today, all of them in their 80s and 90s. Organisations exist to raise awareness of these women's achievements and contributions to Singapore's development, and their current state. Some of these organisations also strive to provide free travel for the women back to China to visit their relatives before they die. One such organisation was the Sam Shui Wai Kuan Association that took care of the needs of Samsui women.

==Portrayal in media==
The travails of the Samsui women were portrayed in ''[[Samsui Women (TV series)|Samsui Women]]'', a television drama series produced by [[Singapore Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1986, which has widely been considered as one of the best dramas Singapore has produced over the years. There was also a theatrical play by The Finger Players, called "Samsui Women: One Brick at a Time", held at the [[Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samsui Women: One Brick at a time|url=https://www.esplanade.com/festivals-and-series/feed-your-imagination-fyi/2015/samsui-women-one-brick-at-a-time-02-aug|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel James Seymour''' (March 28, 1860&amp;nbsp;– April 12, 1956) was the last surviving person who had been in [[Ford's Theatre]] the night of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865. He was from [[Maryland]] and lived in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]. Seymour, a carpenter and contractor, lived most of his later life in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. He died April 12, 1956, at the home of his daughter in Arlington, Virginia, survived by five children, 13 grandchildren and 35 great-grandchildren. He was buried at Baltimore's [[Loudon Park Cemetery]].

==Witness to Lincoln assassination==
[[File:Lincoln Assassination Eyewitness (February 9, 1956).ogg|thumb|Seymour on ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' in 1956.]]
On April 14, 1865, when he was five years old, Seymour's [[godparent|godmother]] (the wife of his father's employer) took him to see ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., where they sat in the [[balcony]] across the theater from the presidential box.&lt;ref name="seymour"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19540207&amp;id=wHUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5624,3979599 |title=I Saw Lincoln Shot |date= February 7, 1954 |accessdate=October 18, 2012|department= ''[[The American Weekly]]'' |work= [[Milwaukee Sentinel]] |first1=Samuel J.|last1=Seymour |first2= Frances Spatz |last2= Leighton |page= 2 |via= [[Google News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He saw Lincoln come into the box, waving and smiling. Later, "All of a sudden a shot rang out{{nbsp}}... and someone in the President's box screamed. I saw Lincoln slumped forward in his seat." Seymour watched [[John Wilkes Booth]] jump from the box to the stage. He remembers that, not understanding what had happened to Lincoln, he was very concerned for Booth, who broke his leg in the jump.&lt;ref name="seymour"/&gt;

In 1954, Seymour gave his account of the assassination to biographer Frances Spatz Leighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19540207&amp;id=wHUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5624,3979599|title=The Milwaukee Sentinel - Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''I've Got a Secret'' appearance==
Two months before his death, Seymour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2012/10/man_who_witnessed_lincolns_assassin.php|title=Man Who Witnessed Lincoln's Assassination Was on a Game Show in 1956|author=Benjamin R. Freed|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=DCist}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared on the February 9, 1956, broadcast of the [[CBS]] TV [[panel show]] ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. After arriving in New York City he suffered a fall, which left him with a large swollen knot above his right eye. Host [[Garry Moore]], after bringing Seymour on stage, explained that he and the show's producers had urged Seymour to forgo his appearance; that Seymour's doctor had left the choice up to his patient; and that Seymour very much wanted to go on.

During the game, Seymour was first questioned by panelist [[Bill Cullen]], who quickly surmised from Seymour's age that his secret was somehow connected with the [[American Civil War]], then correctly guessed that it had political significance and involved a political figure. [[Jayne Meadows]] then guessed that the political figure was Lincoln, and finally that Seymour had witnessed Lincoln's assassination.  Because Seymour smoked a pipe rather than cigarettes, the show's sponsor, [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] gave him a can of [[Prince Albert (tobacco)|Prince Albert]] pipe tobacco instead of the usual prize of a carton of [[Winston cigarettes]].

'''''Immram Brain (maic Febail)''''' ''(The Voyage of Bran [son of Febail])'' is a medieval Irish narrative.
==Sources==
The content derives from [[Irish mythology]], but was written in the 8th century. Some Irish tale-lists categorise the tale as an ''[[Echtra]]'' ("Adventure"), but it contains the essential elements of an [[Immram]], or "Voyage". It may have influenced the later story of [[Saint Brendan]]'s voyage. The concept of "voyage" has been widely used across the world in that time. While this specific set comes from Ireland, it can be compared with Classical sources such as the [[Odyssey]] and the [[Aeneid]],  some Scandinavian tales as well as other [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] tales told on what is now the United Kingdom, particularly those preserved from Wales ([[Y Mabinogion]] and Brittany including [[Tristan and Yseult]]. In one rendition, this text has been recorded by Seamus Mac Mathuna.

==Synopsis==
Bran mac Febail (modern spelling: Bran mac Feabhail) embarks upon a quest to the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]]. One day while Bran is walking, he hears beautiful music, so beautiful, in fact, that it lulls him to sleep. Upon awakening, he sees a beautiful [[Silver Branch|silver branch in white bloom]] in front of him. He returns to his royal house, and while his company is there, an Otherworld woman appears, and sings to him a poem about the land where the branch had grown. In the song, she identifies the branch to be from an apple tree in Emain, another part of Ireland. In this Otherworld, it is always summer, there is no want of food or water, no sickness or despair ever touches the perfect people, and there is no unhappiness or "no rough or harsh voice." She tells Bran to voyage to the Land of Women across the sea, and the next day he gathers a company of nine men to do so. Each of his foster brothers were put in charge of a group of three men.

After two days, he sees a man on a chariot speeding towards him. The man is [[Manannan mac Lir]], and he tells Bran that he is not sailing upon the ocean, but upon a flowery plain. He also reveals to Bran that there are many men riding in chariots, but that they are invisible. He tells Bran of how he is to beget his son in Ireland, and that his son will become a great warrior. He follows by prophesying the life of the boy and how Manannan mac Lir will be a teacher and a father to him.

Bran leaves [[Manannan mac Lir]], and comes to the Isle of Joy. All the people upon the Isle of Joy laugh and stare at him, but will not answer his calls. When Bran sends a man ashore to see what the matter is, the man starts to laugh and gape just like the others. Bran leaves him and sails farther.

He then reaches the Land of Women, but is hesitant to go ashore. However, the leader of the women throws a magical clew (ball of yarn) at him which sticks to his hand. She then pulls the boat to shore, and each man pairs off with a woman, Bran with the leader. There were three times nine "couches" available for all of them.

For what seems to be one year, although it is in actuality many more, the men feast happily in the Land of Women until Nechtan Mac Collbran feels homesickness stir within him. The leader of the women is reluctant to let them go, and warns them not to step upon the shores of Ireland and to get back the man they left on the Island of Joy.

Bran and his company sail back to Ireland. The people that have gathered on the shores to meet him do not recognize his name except in their legends. Nechtan Mac Collbran, upset, jumps off the boat onto the land. Immediately, Nechtan Mac Collbran turns to ashes.

Bran and his company relate the rest of their story to the Irish, and then sail across the sea, never to be seen again.

==Historical notes==
''The Voyage of Bran'' was first written down in the late 7th century to early 8th century.

The poem shares similar themes and elements with other Irish immrama, such as ''The Voyage of Brendan'' and ''The Voyage of Mael Duin'', both written in early to mid-900.  For example, Bran, Brendan and Mael Duin each encounter a holy island where the inhabitants live quiet, blissful lives. Bran is told of a tree with holy birds that all sing at the same time, which is similar to what Brendan encounters in his voyage. The stories are also similar in that at one point, one of the travellers is exorcised or left behind on an island, either by free will or as punishment for a sin.

''The Voyage of Bran'' may also be compared to the Welsh text ''Branwen Daughter of Llŷr'' from the ''Mabinogi''.  The parallels are not along the lines of plot, as with ''The Voyage of Brendan'' and ''The Voyage of Mael Duin'', but rather in the names of characters.  As Patrick K. Ford&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Patrick K. (ed. and tr.). "Branwen Daughter of Llŷr." ''The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; writes, both the title character Branwen and her brother Bendigeidfran’s names include the element ''bran'' (the ''-fran'' of ''Bendigeidfran'' is a mutated form), connecting them with the Bran from ''The Voyage of Bran''.  Along with their brother Manawydan, Branwen and Bendigeidfran are the children of Llŷr, the Welsh word for ‘sea,’ and cognate with the Irish word ''lir'' in Manannan mac Lir.

Structurally, ''The Voyage of Bran'' is a combination of poetry and prose, with many short stanzas punctuated by longer, prose narration. These prose narrations are known as Narrative Envelopes.

==Parallels with The Voyage of Máel Dúin==

The Voyage of Bran has many parallels to ''[[The Voyage of Mael Dúin|The Voyage of Máel Dúin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oskamp|first1=HPA|title=The Voyage of Máel Dúin|date=1970|publisher=Wolters-Noordhoff Publishing|location=Groningen|pages=101-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mac Mathúna|first1=Séamus|title=Immram Brain - Bran's Journey into the Land of the Women|date=1985|publisher=Max Niemeyer Verlag|location=Tübingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  In paragraph 61, Bran and company visit the "Island of Joy." After being sent by Bran to investigate the island, one of Bran's men will not speak to the crew, only gaping at them, just like the inhabitants of the island. The man is then abandoned and left on the island. Similarly in chapter 31, of The Voyage of Máel Dúin, one of Máel Dúin's men is sent to investigate, cannot stop laughing , loses the ability to recognize his crew, and is eventually left behind.
*  In paragraph 62, Bran and company reach the "Island of Women." There, they are welcomed by many women, fed well, and one of the women uses a ball of yarn in order to magically ensnare Bran. In chapter 28 of The Voyage of Máel Dúin, the crew reaches an island that is home to seventeen women, who are hospitable to them. When they try to leave, one of the women throws a ball of yarn that magically clings to Diurán's hand.
*  In paragraph 65, one of Bran's men jumps from the coracle after having been magically at sea for hundreds of years. Upon touching dry soil, he is turned into ash. In chapter 11 of The Voyage of Máel Dúin, one of the foster brothers tries to steal a necklet and is burnt to ash by a magical cat.

'''Theophylact''' or '''Theophylaktos''' ({{lang-el|Θεοφύλακτος}}; {{circa|793}} – 15 January 849) was the eldest son of the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Michael I Rhangabe]] ({{reign|811|813}}) and grandson, on his mother's side, of [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}). He was junior co-emperor alongside his father for the duration of the latter's reign, and was [[tonsure]]d, [[castration|castrated]], and exiled to [[Yassıada|Plate Island]] after his overthrow, under the [[monastic name]] '''Eustratius'''.

==Biography==
Theophylact was born to [[Michael Rhangabe]] and [[Prokopia]] {{circa|793}}. He was the couple's oldest child, but the list of his siblings given in the [[hagiography]] of [[Patriarch Ignatius I of Constantinople]], who was Theophylact's youngest brother, is unclear on whether he was the eldest child or was born after his oldest sister Georgo.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"&gt;{{harvnb|PmbZ|pp=684–685}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after his paternal grandfather, the ''[[droungarios]]'' of the ''[[Dodecanese#Name|Dodekanesos]]'' [[Theophylact Rhangabe]], who had participated in a failed [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to wrest the throne from Empress-regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 780.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=60–61, 405 (note #163)}} Nevertheless his maternal grandfather, the emperor [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}), rose to become [[General Logothete]] (finance minister) under Empress Irene before eventually deposing her in October 802.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=128–129}}

Following the death of Nikephoros in the [[Battle of Pliska]] on 26 July 811 and the crippling of his only son and heir [[Staurakios]] in the same battle, on 2 October the [[Byzantine Senate]] and the ''[[tagma (military)|tagmata]]'' guard units acclaimed Nikephoros's son-in-law Michael Rhangabe as emperor and forced Staurakios to abdicate.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=173–177}} Michael immediately set about to consolidate his rule, distributing lavish gifts, crowning his wife as ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' on 12 October, and finally, crowning Theophylact – then aged eighteen – as co-emperor in the [[Hagia Sophia]] on Christmas Day, 25 December 811.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=177–179}} At about the same time, Michael sent an embassy under Bishop [[Michael of Synnada]] to the [[Francia|Frankish]] court, which among other issues raised the prospect of an imperial marriage between Theophylact and one of [[Charlemagne]]'s daughters. Despite a warm reception at [[Aachen]] and the ratification of a [[Pax Nicephori|peace treaty]] between the two realms, Charlemagne, perhaps wary after the repeated failures of successive efforts to that effect over the previous decades, hesitated to agree to such a match.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=179, 182}}

Nothing further is known of Theophylact until 11 July 813, when Michael, faced with a military revolt under [[Leo the Armenian]], abdicated the throne. Michael and his family sought refuge in the [[Church of the Virgin of the Pharos]], where they were [[tonsure]]d as monks and nuns. Michael and his sons were [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|castrated]] to make them incapable of claiming the throne in the future, and exiled to [[Yassıada|Plate]], one of the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]] (though the later historians [[John Skylitzes]] and [[Zonaras]] mention the island of [[Prote]] instead). Leo accorded them an annual stipend.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=188–189}} According to [[Theophanes Continuatus]] Theophylact, who adopted the [[monastic name]] Eustratius (Εὐστράτιος), died five years after his father, on 15 January 849, and was buried alongside him in a church on Plate Island.&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt; Theophanes Continuatus also reports that his body (or perhaps that of his father) was later transferred by his brother, Patriarch Ignatios, to the monastery known as "''tou Satyrou''".&lt;ref name="PmbZ"/&gt;

'''Tomás Bairéad''' (1893–1973) was an Irish author and nationalist. Born in Galway, his father was called Michael Barrett and his mother Mary McDonough. He had two sisters and one brother. He was a member of the Moycullen group of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1916 and soon after became an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteer. He was also a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|IRB]] and [[Sinn Féin]]. He was part of a group of Volunteers who were involved in the burning of the RIC Barracks in Rosmuc in 1920. He began his journalistic career with the Galway Express, a weekly republican paper. In 1922 he would join the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', writing on politics, and would later become the newspaper's editor in 1945. While working for the ''Independent'' he was presented the Irish Academy of Letters Award (1938). Bairéad also invented his own Irish shorthand. His close friend, [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], urged him to leave the IRA to focus on his writings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm] Bairéad at Ricorso&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Thomas Barrett (1893–1973), An Bairéadach, or Tomás Bairéad, as he was also known, was a journalist and Irish language author.
He was born in on 7 July 1893 in Ballydotia, [[Moycullen]], County [[Galway]]. He married Ellen Maher (1903–1947) from Clonard, county [[Westmeath]] in [[Body of Christ|Corpus Christi]] Church, St Martin's (Maiden Lane), London on 25 June 1930. Ellen's father, James was also a farmer. They had two daughters, Treasa, a nurse, and Maura, a librarian.

He was a fine athlete and sportsman, and as a young man played [[gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] with his native parish team. When he was barely 17 years of age, Bairéad was involved in castle rustling. The cattle, in the ownership of the landlord George Burke, were driven from Burke's land at Cnoc a' tSean Bhaile. Bairéad's involvement in this activity was in reaction to the eviction of a number of his neighbours by the landlord, and resulted in him spending some time in gaol. Bairéad was primarily self-educated.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://gccapps.galwaycoco.ie/ArchivedDocuments/Bair%C3%A9ad,%20Thomas,%20Papers,%201820-1973,%20GP2/Descriptive%20List,%20Tomas%20Bair%C3%A9ad%20Papers,%20GP2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and career==
Bairéad was a member of the Moycullen group of the [[Irish Volunteers]] (Óglaigh na h-Éireann) in 1916. He was a member of the IRB and Sinn Féin, and administered the IRB oath to new members. He was friendly with [[Liam Mellows]] and Proinsias Ó hEidhin, and others who were leaders of the 1916 [[Rebellion]] in county Galway. He was one of a group of Volunteers involved in the burning of the RIC Barracks in Rosmuc in 1920. For these and other republican activities he spent sometime in Galway Gaol.

Bairead commenced his journalistic career with the Galway Express, a weekly republican paper, in 1917. When paper's printing press was destroyed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]], and [[Black and Tans]] in 1920, he transferred to the Connacht Tribune. During this period he had an address at 5 Nuns' Island, Galway.

He was appointed to the staff of the [[Irish Independent]] on 18 September 1922. In 1945 he became responsible for the Irish language page. In 1930 he purchased the family home, 3 Beechmount Villas, [[Glasnevin]], Dublin, where he lived until he retired to Moycullen in 1948. While with the Independent he travelled to and reported on various Celtic Congresses held in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]], and in 1943 he reported on [[Éamon de Valera]]'s general election campaign.

He wrote extensively during the 1930s and 1940s. His first collection of short-stories, Cumhacht na Cinneamhna, was published by [[An Gúm]] in 1936. The collection received very positive reviews, with the Connacht Tribune writing, 'In originality, technique and language, those stories probably surpass anything of their kind published in Irish', and 'It will not be surprising if a few of those stories find their way among the classics', while the [[Irish Times]] wrote, "While the language is rich, idiomatic and adequate, the stories themselves could well be the authentic work of a novelist in any language'. Bairéad was awarded the O'Growney Award by the Irish Academy of Letters for this collection in 1937.

His next collection An Geall a Briseadh followed shortly afterwards, again published by An Gúm. This was a collection of short stories and sketches dealing mainly with scenes and events familiar to Bairéad in his native countryside. This book also received positive reviews, such as one writing that Bairéad "is undoubtedly a discovery and a decided addition to the ranks of Gaelic writers". For this collection he was awarded the Douglas Hyde Literary Fund('Ciste an Chraoibhin Aoibhin'), in 1938 for the best original work in the Irish language. The book was placed on the syllabus for the [[Matriculation]] (University entrance examination) in 1940, and later the [[Department of Education]] included it on the school syllabus for 1953–1954.

His next accomplishment Cruithneacht agus Ceannabháin, a collection of 13 short stories, was published by Talbot Press in 1940. In 1949, Ór na hAithinne was published.

His last great work, Gan Baisteadh, which is semi-autobiographical, contained 33 chapters each telling a different story. This was published by Sáirseal agus Dill in 1969.

In 1973 As an nGéibheann was published. This was a collection of the correspondence between Tomás and [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]], during Máirtín's time in prison.

Bairéad also received awards for other short stories, such as Second Prize in Class 4, Irish, Short Story for his entry 'Ruaidhri Ruadh, an Stiléara', in the Tailteann Literary Competitions in 1931, and an Oireachtas Certificate for first prize for the short story, 'Duais an Mhaolánaigh' in 1951. Bairéad's daughter, Treasa (the donor of the collection) also has in her possession a medal inscribed as follows, 'Aonach Tailteann 1932 (an Bhainnriogain Tailte).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.iar.ie/Archive.shtml?IE+GCCA%2FGP2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in 1916 Easter Rising==
Tomás Bairéad's main involvement in the [[1916 Easter Rising]] was through the form of newspapers. His newspaper clippings include details of events in the [[Moycullen]] area during the Easter week of 1916, and also includes references to the 1919 local election. As well as those it also includes a transcript of the Irish Republican Brotherhood's oath. The collection is full with names associated with [[Irish republicanism]] and [[Irish politics]], such as [[Liam Mellows]], Seán McDermot, [[Éamon de Valera]], and [[Jack Lynch]]. The letters from Bairéad's friend Morchadh Ó Dabhorionn, are fascinating as they reveal something resembling that of the loneliness of an [[Irish emigrant]]. The quote states "…nearer to me than Érin go Brac with all its faults and shortcoming, it is to me the greatest and is closest to my heart. It was too bad that fate made me leave there for as you have said more than once before it was there that I did belong"&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

'''Winker Watson''' is a British comic strip, created by Eric Roberts, which ran in the British comic book magazine ''[[The Dandy]]'' for almost half a century. It debuted in 1961 and only terminated its run in 2007. It was revived in 2012.

==Concept==

Winker first appeared in the 1961 Dandy Book (published September 1960), and then appeared in the weekly Dandy on 1 April 1961 in issue Number 1010, and was quickly established as a character of great wit and appeal. Probably modeled on the [[Greyfriars School|Greyfriars]] stories and on [[Harry Wharton]], Winker is a pupil of the Third Form of Greytowers [[Boarding school|Boarding School]], he is known as the "wangler" of the school, constantly playing tricks and avoiding unpleasant school activities, much to the chagrin of his teacher Mr Clarence Creep (known to the boys as ''Creepy''). Creep also has a sister called Agnes, who runs the nearby Trinity Hall Girls School, constructed in 1989 after the previous one burnt down. Around that area there also seems to be a St Jennifer's School for Girls, though this may just be a continuity error. Greytowers is next door to a [[police]] training school, although this was later reportedly abandoned and derelict.

Winker Watson is a rare breed for a kids comic, as his stories are often continuous from issue to issue, including the long-running saga of his uncle Arnold arriving as [[Physical Training]] instructor and Winker's endless attempts to get rid of him. There was also the long-running story dealing with the unjust [[expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] of Winker's younger brother Wally, and the elder sibling's attempts to keep him in the school until the end of term so their parents would know nothing until he had been exonerated. A third example is that of Mr Creep's own secret stowaway; the teacher's good-for-nothing twin brother John, who was on the run and needed somewhere to stay, forced his brother to let him hide in his own quarters within the school. Other storylines involved Slasher Scragg (a delinquent boy recruited by the school staff and posing as a pupil to act as their spy on Winker's activities) and 'the phantom of Greytowers' (an elusive figure causing trouble for which Winker and his friends often got the blame; it turned out to be a teenage boy in hiding after escaping from a young offenders' institute). The early 90s saw perhaps the most bizarre running story of the strip's history, as Greytowers was invaded by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], who used mind control powers to take over several characters and tried to cast the school adrift in space, until Winker used the aliens' allergy to [[pig swill]] to defeat them. Stories throughout 2003 and 2004 were reworkings of 1970s scripts concerning Winker's schemes to foil the plans of Robin Boodle, a consistently annoying rich boy, and who had been renamed Darby Doshman (in the late 1980s, there was a similar reworking in which the rich boy became [[Jonathan Ross|Jonathan Dosh]]).  At the same time, [[Classics from the Comics]] was reprinting the Robin Boodle strips, sometimes in the same week. An old days storyline of a circus moving in next to the school was also redone, although it is unknown if any specific strips were reworked.

Winker's best pal is a lad called Tim Trott (nicknamed "Trotty" by Winker), though, apart from Winker's other friends Sally and Sandy, no other characters have emerged with any great regularity, despite the number of boys within the school. The [[headmaster]] has made frequent appearances, but mainly with Creep rather than any of the boys. Also occasionally seen is the school cook, nicknamed Cookie.  In the late-1970s and early-1980s, Winker have frequent run-ins with three [[Sixth form|Sixth Formers]] called The Hoods.  They dressed in long white coats and masks similar to the ones used by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] to hide their identities.  They would steal and play tricks on the lower years and occasionally beat up Winker and his friends.  As they were older and bigger than the third form boys, Winker would have to use his wits rather than his fists to fight against them. Though Winker often got into trouble, he always managed to wangle his way out of getting caned, well almost. Just the once he did get "six".

Comparisons with [[Just William (book series)|Just William]] are inevitable, including the fact that Winker is always in Form 3, no matter how much time passes, and stories often involve ends and beginnings of new school terms.

==History==

The strip was drawn by Eric Roberts until his death in 1982. Afterwards, the strip ran mostly as reprints for the rest of the decade (though [[Tom Williams (British cartoonist)|Tom Williams]] and [[Evi De Bono]] drew strips for the Dandy annuals), until [[Terry Bave]] took over. For the first few years he drew in the style of Roberts (though his style was still fairly noticeable), but as the 90s progressed his style became more and more noticeable. He was drawing the strip in his own style. Bave continued drawing it until 2002, when [[Stevie White]] took over, producing the strip regularly until 2007, with further appearances in the 2012 Annual. [[Wilbur Dawbarn]] took over from the 2013 Annual, with an ironic, tongue-in-cheek take on the character.

==In popular culture==

The strip also has been a target of [[satire]] with wordplay by [[alternative comedy|alternative comedians]] and other, involving phrases such as "[[Masturbation|Wanker]] Watson", and playing on the perception of boarding schools being full of sexually frustrated teenage aristocrats. For instance, ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' comic ran a parody strip called Wanker Watson. There is also a British [[racehorse]] called Winker Watson after the character.

'''Zāl''' /zɒl/ ({{lang-fa|زال}}), alternate spelling '''Zaul''', is a legendary [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] king from [[Sistan]],{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} and is recognized as one of the greatest warriors of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' epic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Olga M.|title=Poet and hero in the Persian Book of kings|publisher=Cornell University Press|page= 76|year=1994|edition=Digitized May 14, 2008|isbn=0-8014-2780-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSFkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Zal%22,+Book+of+Kings&amp;dq=%22Zal%22,+Book+o+Kings&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} He is the father of the equally legendary Iranian hero, [[Rostam]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}}

==Background==
Zāl came from a family whose members were legendary warriors, who – for generations – served in the Persian army as great generals. His father, [[Sām]] and, later, his son, Rostam were also great heroes of Persia.

Zāl was born with white hair.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Because of this, his parents called him Zāl. In the [[Persian language]], ''zal'' refers to those who have [[albinism]].{{sfn|Kia|2016|page=68}} Zāl was the son of [[Sām]] and the grandson of [[Nariman (father of Sām)|Nariman]], both heroes of ancient Persia and protectors of "Motherland Iran" (''Iran-zamin''). Because of his defect, Zāl was rejected by his father, who blamed the evil spirit, [[Ahriman]], for the appearance of his son.{{sfn|Kia|2016|page=68}}{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Zāl was abandoned when only an infant in the [[Alborz Mountains|Alborz Mountain]], which has the highest geographic peak in [[Iran]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}}{{sfn|Kia|2016|page=68}} The mythical [[simurgh]] (a very large and wise bird which darkens the sky when flying, said to be related to the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) found the baby and took him to her nest.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Then after a time, passing caravans saw a noble young man, his chest a mountain of silver, his waist a reed, in the bird's nest. Rumor of this remarkable presence finally reached Sam, who was encouraged by his wise men to hasten to the scene. There, looking up, he saw his son, but when he tried to climb toward him, he could find no way to the lofty perch. He then prayed to God, asking forgiveness and help. When the simurgh saw Sam, she knew that he had come for her charge. The devoted bird gave the youth a plume, saying: "Burn this if ever you have need of me, and may your heart never forget your nurse, whose heart breaks for love of you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of All Nations|publisher=Original from the University of Michigan|year=1864|edition=Digitized Nov 23, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0dizX_yVCj0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FML"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Donna|title=Folklore, Myths, and Legends: A World Perspective|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|page=536|chapter=page 116-118|isbn=0-8442-5780-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TdKE_Qgl28C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Zal%22,+Persian+warrior&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F4dXApOC8P&amp;sig=861exUo59OoEJzoUlgKF6v12Xhc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c6O8SdWxJonYsAOk4-VG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reed|first=Elizabeth Armstrong|title=Persian Literature: Ancient and Modern|publisher=S.

The mighty and wise simurgh gave Zāl these three feathers to burn when in trouble. She would appear as soon as the feathers were lit.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PL2"/&gt;

==Zal and Rudabeh==
[[File:Zal meets Rudaba.jpg|thumb|Zal meets [[Rudabeh]].]]

After reuniting with his son, Sam made every effort to redress past wrongs. [[Manuchehr]], too, gave the young man due regard. When Sam went off to wage war in [[Mazandaran (Shahnameh)|Mazandaran]], Zal, recommended by the elders, was given Sam's kingdom.

Setting forth on a royal progress to view his eastern provinces, Zal at every stage held court and called for wine, harp, and minstrelsy. In [[Kabul]], [[Mehrab Kaboli|Mehrab]], a vassal king descended from the evil [[Zahhak]], paid homage with gifts of horses and slaves.

Learning of [[Rudabeh]], Mehrab's beautiful daughter, Zal lost his heart in love.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} But the affair was to progress slowly. Once even, Zal came near Rudabeh's palace where Rudabeh gave her tresses to Zal as a rope. However, he had brought his own, with which he scaled the walls. In a heat of passion, the lovers made love to each other and Rudabeh conceived. When her father came to know about this, he was outraged.

[[File:Zal marries Rudaba.jpg|thumb|Zal's marriage ceremony]]
Zal rightly feared that his father and Manuchehr would disapprove his marrying a descendant of Zahhak, and while Mehrab generally approved of the young prince, some of Zal's actions made him bristle. Zal accordingly wrote a letter to his father and requested him to agree to his marriage, reminding him of the oath he had made to fulfill all his wishes.

Sam and the Mubeds, knowing that Rudabeh's father, chief of Kabul, was Babylonian from the family of Zahhak, did not approve of the marriage.

Finally, the ruler Sam referred the question to astrologers, to know whether the marriage between Zal and Rudabeh would be prosperous or not. He was informed that the offspring of Zal and Rudabeh would be the conqueror of the world. When Zal arrived at the court of Manuchehr, he was instructed by the Emperor to showcase his skills. Zal was asked highly difficult questions and riddles by the emperor's wisest men, which Zal proceeded to answer correctly.

The emperor then held a tournament for Zal to prove himself against the royal warriors. Zal proved himself unparalleled in marksmanship (archery) and in fighting from horseback. The great warrior hurled his [[javelin]] with such strength that he was able to impale three shields at once. Finally Zal succeeded in defeating Menuchehr's warriors and lifted an enemy warrior off his horse with complete ease. Impressed, Menuchehr gave his approval of Zal and Rudabeh's marriage.

The marriage was celebrated in Kabul, where Zal and Rudabeh had first met each other.

After a while, the marriage of Zal and Rudabeh was celebrated in Kabul, where they first met each other. [[Rostam]], the great Persian hero, was born from their wedlock.

Zal used one of the feathers he received from the simurgh when his wife Rudabeh was in a difficult labour, and it looked like she would lose her life as well as the unborn baby. The simurgh appeared and instructed him to run a feather across his wife's belly like a knife. That is how Rostam was born.&lt;ref name="PL2"/&gt;

==Later life==
Zal brought up and trained Rostam. He had another son with Rudabeh, named Zawara.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} He sent Rostam on many campaigns. Zal later ruled [[Zabulistan]] and served as a general and advisor to the king. He became famous for his military victories against the [[Turanians]] and against many barbarians.

Zal lived for more than three centuries, outliving his wife, Rudabeh. He sired a son, Shagad, with a servant woman. Although he was warned by counsellors that the child was evil, Zal refused to abandon, lest he commit the same mistake his father, Sam, did.

When Esfandiyar challenged Rostam, Zal warned his son not to fight, as he was aware that Esfandiyar's murderer would be doomed. When Rostam returned, grieveously wounded, Zal healed him and summoned the Simurgh, to find out a way to defeat Esfandiyar.

Later, Zal lived to see his sons kill each other, and the fall of his family. Esfandiyar's son, Bahman, avenged his father's death by invading Zabulistan.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Zal was too old to fight, and Bahman threw the ageing king in prison, and took his treasures.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Bahman then however released him after own uncle, Pashotan, intervened on Zal's behalf.{{sfn|Shahbazi|Cristoforetti|2009}} Bahman later withdrew to Iran, and Zal once again ruled as king. The great king died later of natural causes, and his dynasty splintered.
