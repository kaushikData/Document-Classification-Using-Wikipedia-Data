'''ADMAR''' – stays for the German wording '''Abgesetzte Darstellung von MADAP Radar data''' and was the predecessor product of [[CIMACT]]. 

== Definition ==
The [[EUROCONTROL]] software product ADMAR did combine and merge several [[Secondary surveillance radar| civilian surveillance- and military sensor]] data sources with [[Flight plan]] data sources. After data correlation it was able to provide a [[Recognized Air Picture|Recognised Air Picture (RAP)]]. It could be operated on [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] hardware or special [[Information Technology|IT]]. 

== History ==
ADMAR was developed on the basis of ADKAR and GAME footing on the special Agreement of [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|MOD Germany]] ({{lang|de|BMVg}}  – A/13/D/HG/82, April 18, 1983) in cooperation with EUROCONTROL. It has been operational since 1983 and was used by the [[German Air Force]] exclusively. Since 2003 it became of interest for other European countries, [[NATO]] and security related authorities and organisations as well. ''ADMAR 2000'' was the final software release.   

Remark:
*MADAP - Maastricht Automatic Data Processing system
*ADKAR - Abgesetzte Darstellung von KARLDAP Radar-Daten
*KARLDAP - Karlsruhe Automatic Data Processing system
*GAME - GEADGE / ADKAR Message Exchange
*GEADGE - German Air Defence Ground Environment

== Utilisation ==
In Germany the utilisation of ADMAR was as follows:
* Stationary Control and Reporting Centre (CRC), TACCS
* Operation Centre National Air Defence (de: Nationales Lage- und Führungszentrum für Sicherheit im Luftraum - NLFZ SiLuRa) 
* General Air Force Office (de: Luftwaffenamt)

'''ANSI/ISA-95''', or '''ISA-95''' as it is more commonly referred, is an [[international standard]] from the [[International Society of Automation]] for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. This standard has been developed for global manufacturers. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.

The objectives of ISA-95 are to provide consistent terminology that is a foundation for supplier and manufacturer communications, provide consistent information models, and to provide consistent operations models which is a foundation for clarifying application functionality and how information is to be used.

There are 5 parts of the ISA-95 standard.

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.01-2000, Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 1: Models and Terminology''' consists of standard terminology and  object models, which can be used to decide which information should be exchanged.

The models help define boundaries between the enterprise systems and the control systems. They help address questions like which tasks can be executed by which function and what information must be exchanged between applications. Here is a [http://www.isa.org/uploadedImages/Content/Standards_and_Publications/ISA_Publications/InTech_Magazine/Issues/2001/October/20011048.gif graphical representation of the Functional enterprise-control model].

'''ISA-95 Models'''

*Functional Data Flow Model
**Manufacturing Functions
**Data Flows
*Object Models
**Objects
**Object Relationships
**Object Attributes
*Operations Activity Models
**Operations Elements: PO, MO, QO, IO
**Operations Data Flow Model
***Operations Functions
***Operations Flows

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.02-2001, Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 2: Object Model Attributes''' consists of attributes for every object that is defined in part 1. The objects and attributes of Part 2 can be used for the exchange of information between different systems, but these objects and attributes can also be used as the basis for relational databases.

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.03-2005, Enterprise-Control System Integration, Part 3: Models of [[Manufacturing Operations Management]]''' focuses on the functions and activities at level 3 (Production / MES layer). It provides guidelines for describing and comparing  the production levels of different sites in a standardized way.

'''ISA-95.04 Object Models &amp; Attributes Part 4 of ISA-95: "Object models and attributes for Manufacturing Operations Management"''' 
The SP95 committee is yet developing part 4 of ISA-95, which is entitled "Object Models and Attributes of Manufacturing Operations Management". This technical specification defines object models that determine which information is exchanged between MES activities (which are defined in part 3 by ISA-95). The models and attributes from part 4 are the basis for the design and the implementation of interface standards and make sure of a flexible lapse of the cooperation and information-exchange between the different MES activities.

'''ISA-95.05 B2M Transactions Part 5 of ISA-95: "Business to manufacturing transactions"''' Also part 5 of ISA-95 is yet in development. This technical specification defines operation between office and production automations-systems, which can be used together with the object models out part 1 &amp; 2. The operations connect and organise the production objects and activities that are defined through earlier parts of the standard. Such operations take place on all levels within a business, but the focus of this technical specification lies on the interface between enterprise- and control systems. On the basis of models, the operation will be described and becomes the operation processing logically explained.

Within production areas activities are executed and information is passed back and forth. The standard provides reference models for production activities, quality activities, maintenance activities and inventory activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7755">'''Anthropogenic metabolism''', also referred to as 'metabolism of the anthroposphere', is a term used in [[industrial ecology]], [[material flow analysis]], and [[waste management]] to describe the material and energy turnover of human society. It emerges from the application of [[systems thinking]] to the industrial and other man-made activities and it is a central concept of [[sustainable development]]. In modern societies, the bulk of anthropogenic (man-made) material flows is related to one of the following activities: [[sanitation]], [[transportation]], habitation, and [[communication]], which were "of little metabolic significance in prehistoric times".&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul H. Brunner|Brunner Paul H.]] and Rechberger H. (2002)  [http://www.iwa.tuwien.ac.at/htmd2264/publikat/aws-publikationen/Publikationen/2001/Anthropogenic%20Metabolism%20and%20Environmental%20Legacies.pdf Anthropogenic Metabolism and Environmental Legacies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217050150/http://www.iwa.tuwien.ac.at/htmd2264/publikat/aws-publikationen/Publikationen/2001/Anthropogenic%20Metabolism%20and%20Environmental%20Legacies.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} in ''Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change'' ({{ISBN|0-471-97796-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Global man-made stocks of steel in buildings, infrastructure, and vehicles, for example, amount to about 25 Gigatonnes (more than three tonnes per person), a figure that is surpassed only by construction materials such as concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, D.B., et al. 2013. Carbon emissions of infrastructure development. Environmental Science and Technology. 47(20) 11739-11746.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainable development is closely linked to the design of a sustainable anthropogenic metabolism, which will entail substantial changes in the energy and material turnover of the different human activities. Anthropogenic metabolism can be seen as synonymous to social or [[social metabolism|socioeconomic metabolism]]. It comprises both [[industrial metabolism]] and [[urban metabolism]].

==Negative effects==
In layman's terms, anthropogenic metabolism indicates the human impact on the world by the modern industrialized world. Much of these impacts include [[waste management]], our [[ecological footprint]], water footprints, and [[flow analysis]] (i.e., the rate at which we deplete the energy around us). Most anthropogenic metabolism happens in developed countries. According to Rosales, "Economic growth is at present the main cause of increased climate change, and climate change is a main mechanism of [[biodiversity loss]]; because of this, economic growth is a major catalyst of biodiversity loss."&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2008). Economic Growth, Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss: Distributive Justice for the Global North and South. Conservation Biology, 22(6), 1409-1417.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[water footprint]] is the amount of water that each of us use in our daily lives. Most of the world's water is salt water which we cannot use in our food or water supplies. Therefore, the freshwater sources that were once plentiful are now being diminished due to anthropogenic metabolism of the growing population. The water footprint encompasses how much [[fresh water]] is needed for each consumer’s needs. According to J. Allan, "there is a huge impact of water use on stores of surface and [[groundwater]] and on flows to which [[water]] is returned after use. These impacts are shown to be particularly high for manufacturing industries. For example, that there are less than 10 economies worldwide that have a significant water surplus, but that these economies have successfully met, or have the potential to meet, the water deficits of the other 190 economies. Consumers enjoy the delusion of food and water security provided by [[virtual water]] trade.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, J. (2009). Virtual Water in the Real World. Conservation Biology, 23(5), 1331-1332.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the ecological footprint is a more economical and land-focused way of looking at human impact. Developed countries tend to have higher ecological footprints, which do not strictly correspond to a country's total population. According to research by Dias de Oliveira, Vaughan and Rykiel, "The Ecological Footprint...is an accounting tool based on two fundamental concepts, [[sustainability]] and [[carrying capacity]]. It makes it possible to estimate the [[resource consumption]] and waste assimilation requirements of a defined [[human population]] or economy sector in terms of corresponding productive land area.&lt;ref&gt;Dias de Oliveira, M. E., Vaughan, B. E., &amp; Rykiel, E. (2005). Ethanol as Fuel: Energy, Carbon Dioxide Balances, and Ecological Footprint. Bioscience, 55(7), 593-602.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the major cycles that humans can contribute to that cause a major impact on [[climate change]] is the [[nitrogen cycle]]. This comes from nitrogen fertilizers that us humans are using. Gruber and Galloway have researched, "The massive acceleration of the nitrogen cycle caused by the production and industrial use of artificial [[nitrogen]] fertilizers worldwide has led to a range of environmental problems. Most important is how the availability of nitrogen will affect the capacity of Earth's biosphere to continue absorbing [[carbon]] from the [[atmosphere]] and to thereby continue helping to mitigate climate change."&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, N. Galloway, J.N. (2008). An Earth-system perspective of the global nitrogen cycle. Nature, 451, 293-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The carbon cycle is another major contributor to climate change primarily from anthropogenic metabolism. A few examples of how humans contribute to the carbon in the atmosphere is by burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. By taking a close look at the carbon cycle Peng, Thomas and Tian have discovered that, "It is recognized that human activities, such as [[fossil fuel]] burning, land-use change, and forest harvesting at a large scale, have resulted in the increase of [[greenhouse gases]] in the atmosphere since the onset of the [[industrial revolution]]. The increasing amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly [[CO2]] in the atmosphere, is believed to have induced climate change and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Peng, Y., Thomas, S. C., &amp; Tian, D. (2008). Forest management and soil respiration: Implications for carbon sequestration. Environmental Reviews, 1693-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many things that are going to be affected by climate change instead of just humans, the animals are going to suffer as well. There is a forecast for extinctions of species because of their habitats being affected. An example of this is marine animals. There are major impacts on the marine systems as a result of anthropogenic metabolism, according to Blaustein, the dramatic findings indicate that "every square kilometer [is] affected by some anthropogenic driver of ecological change".&lt;ref&gt;Blaustein, R. (2008). Global Human Impacts. Bioscience, 58(4), 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative effects of anthropogenic metabolism are seen through the water footprint, ecological footprint, [[carbon cycle]], the nitrogen cycle, studies on the marine ecosystem that show major impacts by humans and developed countries which include more industries thus more anthropogenic metabolism.

[[File:Biomagnification.svg|thumb|In biomagnification the concentration of the persistent toxins (crosses) increases higher up the food chain.]]
[[File:Bio-magnification in a pond ecosystem.svg|thumb|In this scenario, a pond has been intoxicated and as we go further into the food chain the toxin concentration increases causing the top consumer to eventually live off intoxication.]]
'''Biomagnification''', also known as '''bioamplification''' or '''biological magnification''', is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic [[chemical substance|chemical]], in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of tolerant organisms at successively higher levels in a [[food chain]]. This increase can occur as a result of:
* Persistence – where the substance cannot be broken down by environmental processes
* [[Food chain]] [[bioenergetics|energetics]] – where the substance's concentration increases progressively as it moves up a food chain 
* Low or non-existent rate of internal degradation or excretion of the substance – often due to water-insolubility

[[File:The build up of toxins in a food chain.svg|thumb|Biomagnification is the build up of toxins in a food chain. The DDT concentration is in parts per million. As the trophic level increases in a food chain, the amount of toxic build up increases. The x's represent the amount of toxic build up accumulating as the trophic level increases. Toxins build up in organism's fat and tissue. Predators accumulate higher toxins than prey. ]]
Biological magnification often refers to the process whereby certain substances such as pesticides or heavy metals work their way into lakes, rivers and the ocean, and then move up the [[food chain]] in progressively greater concentrations as they are incorporated into the diet of aquatic organisms such as [[zooplankton]], which in turn are eaten perhaps by fish, which then may be eaten by bigger fish, large birds, animals, or humans. The substances become increasingly concentrated in tissues or internal organs as they move up the chain. Bioaccumulants are substances that increase in concentration in living organisms as they take in '''contaminated air, water, or food''' because the substances are very slowly metabolized or excreted.

==Processes==
Although sometimes used interchangeably with "[[bioaccumulation]]", an important distinction is drawn between the two, and with bioconcentration.
* '''Bioaccumulation''' occurs ''within'' a [[trophic level]], and is the increase in the concentration of a substance in certain tissues of organisms' bodies due to absorption from food and the environment.
* '''[[Bioconcentration]]''' is defined as occurring when uptake from the water is greater than excretion.&lt;ref&gt;Landrum, PF and SW Fisher, 1999. Influence of lipids on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of organic contaminants in aquatic organisms. Chapter 9 in MT Arts and BC Wainman. Lipids in fresh water ecosystems. Springer Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation occur within an organism, and biomagnification occurs across trophic (food chain) levels.

[[Biodilution]] is also a process that occurs to all trophic levels in an aquatic environment; it is the opposite of biomagnification, thus when a pollutant gets smaller in concentration as it progresses up a food web.

[[Lipid]], ([[lipophilic]]) or fat soluble substances cannot be diluted, broken down, or excreted in [[urine]], a water-based medium, and so accumulate in [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of an organism, if the organism lacks [[enzyme]]s to degrade them. When eaten by another organism, fats are absorbed in the gut, carrying the substance, which then accumulates in the fats of the predator. Since at each level of the food chain there is a lot of energy loss, a predator must consume many prey, including all of their lipophilic substances.

For example, though [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is only present in small amounts in [[seawater]], it is absorbed by algae (generally as [[methylmercury]]). Methyl-mercury is the most harmful variation of mercury. It is efficiently absorbed, but only very slowly excreted by organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, M., S. N. Luoma, and A. R Stewart. 2005. Trophic transfer of metals along freshwater food webs: Evidence of cadmium biomagnification in nature. Limnol. Oceanogr. 50 (5): 1511-1519.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration result in buildup in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels: [[zooplankton]], small [[nekton]], larger fish, etc. Anything which eats these fish also consumes the higher level of mercury the fish have accumulated. This process explains why predatory fish such as [[swordfish]] and [[shark]]s or birds like [[osprey]] and [[eagle]]s have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone. For example, herring contains mercury at approximately 0.01 parts per million (ppm) and shark contains mercury at greater than 1 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). 1997. Mercury Study Report to Congress. Vol. IV: An Assessment of Exposure to Mercury in the United States . EPA-452/R-97-006. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards and Office of Research and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT is thought to biomagnify and biomagnification is one of the most significant reasons it was deemed harmful to the environment by the [[EPA]] and other organizations. DDT is stored in the fat of animals and takes many years to break down, and as the fat is consumed by predators, the amounts of DDT biomagnify. DDT is now a banned substance in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210501/http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/ddt-ban-takes-effect |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
In a review of a large number of studies, Suedel et al.&lt;ref&gt;Suedel, B.C., Boraczek, J.A., Peddicord, R.K., Clifford, P.A. and Dillon, T.M., 1994. Trophic transfer and biomagnification potential of contaminants in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology 136: 21–89.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that although biomagnification is probably more limited in occurrence than previously thought, there is good evidence that [[DDT]], [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[toxaphene]], and the organic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]] do biomagnify in nature. For other contaminants, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation account for their high concentrations in organism tissues. More recently, Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray, J.S., 2002. Biomagnification in marine systems: the perspective of an ecologist. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 45: 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt; reached a similar substances remaining in the organisms and not being diluted to non-threatening concentrations. The success of top predatory-bird recovery ([[bald eagle]]s, [[peregrine falcon]]s) in North America following the ban on DDT use in agriculture is testament to the importance of biomagnification.

== Substances that biomagnify ==
There are two main groups of substances that biomagnify. Both are lipophilic and not easily degraded. Novel organic substances are not easily degraded because organisms lack previous exposure and have thus not [[evolved]] specific detoxification and excretion mechanisms, as there has been no selection pressure from them. These substances are consequently known as "[[persistent organic pollutant]]s" or POPs.

Metals are not degradable because they are elements. Organisms, particularly those subject to naturally high levels of exposure to metals, have mechanisms to sequester and excrete metals. Problems arise when organisms are exposed to higher concentrations than usual, which they cannot excrete rapidly enough to prevent damage. Some persistent [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] are especially dangerous and harmful to the organism's reproductive system.

'''Bookmarking''' (also "'''gene bookmarking'''" or "'''mitotic bookmarking'''") refers to a potential mechanism of transmission of gene expression programs through cell division.

During [[mitosis]], [[gene transcription]] is silenced and most [[transcription factors]] are removed from [[chromatin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 16188444| year = 2005| author1 = Sarge| first1 = K. D.| title = Gene bookmarking: Keeping the pages open| journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences| volume = 30| issue = 11| pages = 605–10| last2 = Park-Sarge| first2 = O. K.| doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 7553870| year = 1995| author1 = Martínez-Balbás| first1 = M.

K.| last4 = Ozato| first4 = K| last5 = Wu| first5 = C| doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term bookmarking compares transcription to reading from a book. The pause in transcription during mitosis is like closing the book. "Molecular bookmarks" are the factors that allow transcription to resume in an orderly fashion in newborn cells following mitosis (when the book is re-opened).

Bookmarks fulfill the following criteria:

* at some point prior to the onset of [[mitosis]], the [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]] of genes that exist in a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]-competent state become "marked" in some way,
* this "mark" persists both during and after [[mitosis]], and
* the marking transmits gene expression memory by preventing the mitotic compaction of DNA at this locus, or by facilitating reassembly of transcription complexes on the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], or both.

==Bookmarking as selective maintenance of an open chromatin state==
The term bookmarking was originally coined to describe the non-compaction of some [[gene promoter]]s during [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 9619097| year = 1998| author1 = John| first1 = S| title = Bookmarking genes for activation in condensed mitotic chromosomes| journal = BioEssays| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 275–9| last2 = Workman| first2 = J.

A.| doi = 10.1101/gr.180646.114}}&lt;/ref&gt; While gene promoters tend to be better preserved than distal regulatory elements, substantial variation exists at individual sites.

==Bookmarking by DNA methylation, histone post-translation modification, and histone variants==
Some patterns of [[histone]] modification and the presence of some histone variants on DNA remain unchanged during mitosis and have the potential to act as bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23246430| year = 2013| author1 = Wang| first1 = F| title = Histone modifications and mitosis: Countermarks, landmarks, and bookmarks| journal = Trends in Cell Biology| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages = 175–84| last2 = Higgins| first2 = J.

The '''Chapman–Jouguet condition''' holds approximately in [[detonation]] waves in [[high explosive]]s. It states that the detonation propagates at a [[velocity]] at which the reacting gases just reach [[sonic velocity]] (in the frame of the leading [[shock wave]]) as the reaction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=Paul W. |title=Explosives Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=1996 |isbn=0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Wildon |last1=Fickett |first2=William C. |last2=Davis |title=Detonation |publisher=U.

In more detail (in the ZND model) in the frame of the leading shock of the detonation wave, gases enter at supersonic velocity and are compressed through the shock to a high-density, subsonic flow. This sudden change in pressure initiates the chemical (or sometimes, as in [[steam explosion]]s, physical) energy release. The energy release re-accelerates the flow back to the local speed of sound. It can be shown fairly simply, from the one-dimensional gas equations for steady flow, that the reaction must cease at the sonic ("CJ") plane, or there would be discontinuously large pressure [[gradient]]s at that point.

The sonic plane forms a so-called choke point that enables the lead shock, and reaction zone, to travel at a constant velocity, undisturbed by the expansion of gases in the [[rarefaction]] region beyond the CJ plane.

This simple one-dimensional model is quite successful in explaining detonations. However, observations of the structure of real chemical detonations show a complex three-dimensional structure, with parts of the wave traveling faster than average, and others slower.  Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

The '''Rayleigh line''' equation and the '''Hugoniot curve''' equation obtained from the [[Rankine–Hugoniot conditions#Simplified Rankine-Hugoniot relations|Rankine–Hugoniot relations]] for an [[ideal gas]], with the assumption of constant specific heat and constant molecular weight, respectively are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\frac{\tilde p-1}{\tilde v-1} = -\mu \\
\tilde p = &amp;\frac{[2\alpha + (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]-\tilde v}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] and

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{p_2}{p_1},\quad \tilde v = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}, \quad \alpha = \frac{q\rho_1}{p_1}, \quad \mu = \frac{m^2}{p_1\rho_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the subscript 1 and 2 identifies flow properties (pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) upstream and downstream of the wave and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the constant mass flux and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat released in the wave. The slopes of Rayleigh line and Hugoniot curve are

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d\tilde p}{d\tilde v} &amp;= \frac{\tilde p-1}{\tilde v -1}, \\
\frac{d\tilde p}{d\tilde v} &amp;= -\frac{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde p+1}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

At the Chapman-Jouguet point, both slopes are equal, leading the condition that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{\tilde v}{(\gamma+1)\tilde v-\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this back into the Rayleigh equation, we find 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \gamma\frac{\tilde p}{\tilde v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of mass flux &lt;math&gt;m\equiv \rho_1 u_1=\rho_2 u_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; denotes the flow velocity, we find

:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{u_2}{c_2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mach number]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]], in other words, downstream flow is sonic with respect to the Chapman-Jouguet wave. Explicit expression for the variables can be derived,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tilde p_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \alpha(\gamma-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\},  \\
\tilde v_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \frac{\alpha(\gamma-1)}{\gamma}\left\{1\mp\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}, \\
\mu_{\pm} &amp;= \gamma + \alpha(\gamma^2-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The upper sign applies for the '''Upper Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[detonation]]) and the lower sign applies for the '''Lower Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[deflagration]]). Similarly, the upstream Mach number can be found from

:&lt;math&gt;M_{1\pm} = \left[1+\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2} \pm \left[\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the temperature ratio &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=T_2/T_1&lt;/math&gt; can be found from the relation &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=\tilde p\tilde v&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">In [[rhetoric]], a '''climax''' ({{lang-grc-gre|κλῖμαξ}}, ''klîmax'', &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"staircase" or "ladder") is a [[figure of speech]] in which [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, or [[clause]]s are arranged in order of increasing importance.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 57&lt;br&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smyth | first = Herbert Weir | year = 1920 | title = Greek Grammar | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge MA | isbn = 0-674-36250-0 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its use with clauses, it is also sometimes known as '''[[auxesis (rhetoric)|auxesis]]''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"growth").&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
==Usage==
Climax is frequently used in [[persuasion]] (particularly [[advertising]]) to create [[false dilemma]]s and to focus attention on the positive aspects of the subject at hand. The initial inferior options make the final term seem still better by comparison than it would appear in isolation: "X is good, Y is better, Z is best" is a standard format. It can also be used in reverse to make the initial term seem better by comparison: "A isn't perfect but B is worse and C is worst."&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm|title=Auxesis|website=changingminds.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://changingminds.org/techniques/language/figures_speech/auxesis.htm 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Rather use?: &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/|title=How to Use the Simple Power of Contrast to Become More Persuasive - Copyblogger|date=2007-04-30|work=Copyblogger|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-use-the-simple-power-of-contrast-to-become-a-more-persuasive-online-marketer/ 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticlimax==
An '''anticlimax''' or '''anti-climax''' is an abrupt descent (either deliberate or unintended) on the part of a speaker or writer from the dignity of idea which he appeared to be aiming at,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=P.G. |last=Wodehouse |title=Much Obliged, Jeeves }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a relative term, anticlimax requires a greater or lesser climax to precede it in order to have proper effect. An anticlimax can be intentionally employed only for a jocular or satiric purpose. It frequently partakes of the nature of [[antithesis]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=123}} as in:

:"Die and endow a ''college'' or a ''cat''."

[[File:Concordia Univesity Texas Entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance]]
'''Concordia University Texas''' is a [[Private university|private]], [[coeducational]] institution of [[liberal arts]] and [[sciences]] located in northwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. The university offers [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]] and online degrees as well as an Adult Degree Program for part-time and returning students.

Concordia University Texas is affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and is a member of the [[Concordia University System]], the nine-member association of LCMS colleges and universities. As a Lutheran university, Concordia's stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|url=http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/univservices/report/section%203.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527133142/http://www.concordia.edu/sitefiles/w3/Univservices/Report/Section%203.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-27|publisher=Concordia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; mission is to develop [[Christian]] leaders.

==History==
[[File:Kilianhall.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Historic Kilian Hall]]
Concordia was founded in 1926 as '''Lutheran Concordia College of Texas''', a four-year [[high school]] that prepared young men for careers in ministry and teaching. The school opened with 26 students on its original site along East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]]) on the then northern outskirts of Austin, Texas. In 1929, a two-story classroom building, later called the Music Building, and still later known as College Central, was built.

Concordia was founded by members of [[Wends of Texas|Texas's Wendish]] immigrant community. The original main building, Kilian Hall, is named for the Wend [[John Kilian]], founder of the first Texas Lutheran church associated with the LCMS and leader of a large group of [[Sorbs|Wends]] (also called Sorbs) who settled in the [[Serbin, Texas|Serbin]] area. Today, between 10 and 15 percent of Concordia's faculty, staff and students are of Wendish heritage.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s many buildings were added to the campus, such as Hirschi Memorial Library in 1949 and Kramer Hall, the college's first fully air-conditioned classroom building, in 1950, but dedicated on February 25, 1951. Also in 1951, Concordia started using a two-year [[junior college]] curriculum.

[[File:Concordiaoldfacultypic.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old photograph of Concordia faculty in front of Kilian Hall]]
Building developments on campus continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The campus built its chapel, named Birkmann Memorial Chapel, in 1952. Texas Hall, which housed dining services and faculty offices was dedicated in 1953. Studtmann Hall, an all-girl's dormitory opened in 1955. The first Beto Hall on the Concordia campus was built in 1969 and housed science labs. In the early 21st century, this building was converted into the school's mail services facility.

In 1955 Concordia admitted women as students for the first time and the institution changed its name to '''Concordia Lutheran College''' in 1965. In 1969, the four-year high school program was disbanded and Concordia’s curriculum expanded to four years after receiving permission to award Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1980.

Concordia joined the [[Concordia University System]] (CUS) in 1993. The CUS represents the ten colleges and universities run by the LCMS. In 1995, under the leadership of President Rev. Dr. David Zersen, the name of the institution was changed to '''Concordia University at Austin'''. The Accelerated Degree Program (ADP), with sites in Austin, [[Ft. Worth]], [[Houston]], and [[San Antonio]], within the College of Adult Education, was launched in 1995 to offer working adults the opportunity to earn a degree. Harms Hall, a dormitory, opened in January 2000 more than doubling campus resident capacity.The first Graduate program was developed during this period.

In 2002, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, a former fighter pilot and Colonel in the United States Air Force was named President of the university.

In 2007, Concordia University at Austin changed its name to '''Concordia University Texas'''.

In August 2008, Concordia University relocated its primary campus, moving onto more than {{convert|389|acre|ha}} in Northwest Austin. The city of Austin allowed the demolition of the former campus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/agenda/2007/hlc_032607.htm Historic Landmark Commission Regular Meeting March 26, 2007 - 7:00 PM]." ''City of Austin''. Accessed September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A developer bought the space with plans to construct a mixed-use development; however, the developer filed for bankruptcy in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427155030/http://www.kvue.com/news/local/stories/042508kvueConcordia2-cb.9c7a4fb2.html |archivedate=2008-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:449487|title=Developing Stories|author=|date=|website=austinchronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new campus was dedicated on October 26, 2008.

==New campus==
In 2005, the Board of Regents approved the relocation of the Concordia University Texas campus. Since its founding the school had occupied a {{convert|23|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus near downtown Austin. The new campus is located in northwest Austin on {{convert|384|acre|ha}} of land. Construction began in the spring of 2007, and the new campus opened in September 2008.

The site for Concordia's new campus is the former [[Schlumberger]] Austin Systems Center. The site, formerly an R&amp;D facility, had six buildings connected by covered walkways and encircled by a nature trail. The six buildings, named by letter A-F, while extensively renovated, retained their basic design and features, including solid oak trim, large windows, sky lights and atria.

Three new structures were built prior to occupation of the new Concordia campus: student housing, a fieldhouse and a front entry/guard house. In addition to the new structures, 600 additional parking spaces and new roads were built to handle the increased traffic on the campus. In 2014, Concordia broke ground on a state-of-the-art softball field that was completed in 2016.

The campus includes a {{convert|250|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[nature preserve]] that has springs and wetlands, caves, dense trees and wildlife. A 10-A federal permit is required and only one other higher education institution carries one. The inclusion of the nature preserve allows Concordia to devote time to urban [[environmentalism]] in the Austin community. The Concordia University Nature Preserve is part of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a system of preserves in western [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] that provides habitat for a number of rare and endangered plant and animal species such the [[Golden-cheeked warbler]] and [[Black-capped vireo]], two rare species of [[songbird]]s that breed in [[Central Texas]].

In 2013, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, announced his retirement from Concordia University Texas. In 2014 Former Dean of the College of Business, Dr. Don Christian was named Chief Executive Officer.

Concordia is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] Commission on Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318185250/http://www.sacscoc.org/ |archivedate=2008-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==
Some of the many clubs and organizations that students participate in are: Concordia University Texas Collegiate [[DECA (organization)|DECA]], Concordia Outdoor Ministry, Service-Learning, Missions Club, Communication Club, Student Government &amp; Leadership Association (SGLA), Concordia Youth Ministry Team (CYMT), [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], Helping Hands, History Club, Preseminarians of CTX, Society for Human Resource Management, Psychology Book Club, Kinesiology Club, Financial Management Association, Education Club, Directors of Christian Education Club, Biology Club, Behavioral Sciences Club, Association of Computing Machinery, Academic Advising Consultants, Model Organization of American States (MOAS), Moot Court, and the Spirit Squad. The school newspaper, ''The Mullet'', was first published in 2006, and in 2013 was renamed ''The Spin''. ''The Spin'' is published once a month during the semester.

==Athletics==
The Concordia mascot is the '''Tornados''' and the school colors are purple and gold. Concordia's intercollegiate athletic teams participate in [[NCAA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] competition within the [[American Southwest Conference]]. They do not award athletic scholarships per Division III rules. The athletic programs at Concordia are: baseball, softball, men's basketball, women's basketball, cross country, golf, [[Concordia Tornados men's soccer|men's soccer]], [[Concordia Tornados women's soccer|women's soccer]], track and field, volleyball, tennis and athletic training.

In spring 2011, "Purple Out" events were started to encourage students, staff, and the community to support athletics. On designated "Purple Out" days, everyone is encouraged to wear purple and those attending a sporting event receive purple "Tornado Towels".

In 2011-2012, Concordia Texas experienced its most successful year athletically. This was accomplished by winning ASC Championships in Women's Cross Country, Women's Basketball, and Men's Baseball (second consecutive championship).

There were four athletic facilities on the old campus and one off-campus. On Campus: Fascholz-Keller Field (baseball), Bartholomew Park (softball), Pharr Tennis Center, Woltman Gymnasium. Off-campus: St. Francis School (soccer). Currently, men's and women's soccer play at St. Stephen's Episcopal School. Recently, the Concordia University soccer teams have been seen playing at Monroe Stadium at nearby Vandegrift High school.

=== Basketball ===
In the 2011-2012 season, the Concordia University Texas' women's basketball team won the American Southwest Conference.

The Concordia Men's basketball team has been coached by Stanley Bonewitz Jr. since 2004. He is a former [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech basketball]] standout. As a player, he was named Texas "Mr. Basketball" in 1995&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=46 |title=Concordia University Coaching Staff - Basketball |work=CTX.edu |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204627/http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=46 |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Stanley Bonewitz Sr., recently retired as a state-championship winning coach at East Central High School in San Antonio.

=== Baseball ===
The Concordia Men's baseball team is coached by former major leaguer Tommy Boggs. Coach Boggs led the team to victory in 2011 as the ASC Conference Champions, and later to the NCAA championship tournament where they fell two games short of advancing to the College World Series. In 2012, the team recorded its best record ever and swept the ASC conference tournament to win the Conference title outright for a second consecutive year. Prior to Boggs' tenure, Mike Gardner was head coach since 1998. He retired at the end of the 2009 season as the winningest coach in school baseball history and led the team to its only appearance in the College World Series in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/2002_Division_III_College_World_Series|title=2002 Division III College World Series - BR Bullpen|website=www.baseball-reference.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mike"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=44 |title=Concordia University Coaching Staff - Baseball |work=CTX.edu |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812204831/http://athletics.concordia.edu/athletics.cfm?page_ID=44 |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornado field debuted on the new campus in February 2011 and was dedicated in April 2011. It is home to Tornado Baseball.

=== Other sports ===
Chris Randle became the first student athlete from Concordia to qualify for the NCAA track and field championship tournament. His {{convert|6|ft|7|in|cm|adj=on}} high jump earned him a sixth-place finish in the tournament. Randle's participation marked the first time in school history that Concordia was represented at the NCAA Division III Championships in two sports during the same academic year, as the baseball team won the ASC title and won two games over nationally ranked opponents – Linfield and Redlands – at the West Regional.

In 2009 Concordia inducted its first ever Hall of Fame class, including the 2002 baseball team that played for the NCAA Division III College World Series and Atlanta Braves reliever [[Scott Linebrink]].

In 2011, three more members were inducted: Kenneth DeBord '02, basketball; Lisa Hintz '88, volleyball &amp; basketball and Linda Lowery, who served stints as the Athletic Director, volleyball coach and men's and women's golf coach from 1980-2008.

==Alumni==

'''Criminal investigation''' is an [[applied science]] that involves the study of facts, used to identify, locate and prove the [[guilt (law)|guilt]] of an accused criminal. A complete criminal investigation can include [[Search and seizure|searching]], [[interview]]s, [[interrogation]]s, [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] collection and preservation and various methods of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (Sixth Edition). Charles E. O'Hara and Gregory L. O'Hara; 1994; {{ISBN|0-398-05889-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day criminal investigations commonly employ many modern scientific techniques known collectively as [[forensic science]].

Criminal investigation is an ancient science that may have roots as far back as c. 1700 BCE in the writings of the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. In the code it is suggested that both the accuser and the accused had the right to present evidence they collected.&lt;ref&gt;Victimology:Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr,Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era criminal investigations are most often done by government [[Police|police forces]]. [[Private investigator]]s are also commonly hired to complete or assist in criminal investigations.

An early recorded professional criminal investigator was the English [[constable]]. Around 1250 CE it was recorded that the constable was to "...record...matters of fact, not matters of judgment and law."&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Bratton (1968). Bracton On the Laws and Customs of England; volume 4 pg 136. Cambridge, MS: Belknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation priority bias problems and proposed solutions ==
After observing recent changes in the demographic composition of particular crimes during higher priority of their investigation, such as the increase of the percentage of women convicted for joining and fighting for [[terrorism|terrorist]] organizations from a very low percentage (similar to those of murder and rape) to almost as many women as men (women in the 40-50 percent range in some jurisdictions) as the priority of investigating terror crimes increased, certain criminologists are expressing the notion that there may be more crimes that would change their demographics if they got higher priority. These criminologists theorize that in the case of limited budgets, criminal investigators rely on profiled and statistical likelihood of particular groups of people being convicted for the type of crimes that are being investigated, and ignore complaints that are filed about people that they consider less likely to commit the crimes or give the tracking or individual matching to the evidence lower priority. According to the hypotheses, even a minimal or nonexistent difference in the likelihood of committing crimes can be hidden behind a difference of a factor by many multiples in the likelihood of being convicted due to [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] in the statistics. These criminologists feel that criminals who are not getting caught due to being profiled as unlikely offenders are a major problem. Some of these criminologists propose an increased number of police officers. Others argue that investigations of the evidence are more expensive than police patrols and that not all crimes can be investigated, suggesting that profiling of [[criminal psychology]] should be replaced with randomized priorities of individual suspects within similar types of crime. The latter criminologists also argue that such randomization would not only fight hidden crimes by exposing the currently unsuspected criminals to the risk of being punished, but also that the abolition of profiling by forensic psychology and forensic psychiatry would be a monetary saving that could be used for investigation of technical evidence, tracking of criminals who are hiding and other investigation work that can reduce the need to ignore complaints for budget reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Morality, Rationality and Efficiency: New Perspectives on Socio-economics", 2016 by Richard M.

'''Developmental dysfluency''' is considered a normal part of childhood development. About twenty-five percent of children experience some loss in fluency.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of developmental dysfluency include the repetition of sounds or pauses between words. These symptoms have generally been noted within youngsters from 18 months to 5 years of age. This may persist for weeks or months but eventually disappears due to the maturation of the child's nervous system.

ex.: "Daddy, I was, I was, um, um, I was..."

Instances like the aforementioned example indicate that the child is learning to use language. On the other hand, children with [[stutter|stuttering disorder]], will likely repeat sounds or one-syllable words three or more times. They may also prolong sounds for two or more seconds. In comparison, stuttering can be seen as a process where a word appears to become "stuck," and the person may grimace, jerk the head or neck as he struggles to overcome the stutter.

Children with normal dysfluency tend to have stuttering difficulties that come and go. Generally this is during [[preschool]] years and the problem normally ceases altogether by the time a child starts school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48701">[[Image:DOG Jimbo.jpg|thumb|In a typical digital on screen graphic, the station's logo appears in a corner of the screen.]]

A '''digital on-screen graphic''' (originally known as '''digitally originated graphic''', and known in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[New Zealand]] by the acronym '''DOG'''; in the [[United States|US]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]] and [[Australia]]  as a '''bug'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aurora.tv/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Aurora-Program-Supplier-Pack-0912.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or '''network bug''') is a watermark-like station [[logo]] that most television broadcasters overlay over a portion of the screen area of their programs to identify the channel. They are thus a form of permanent visual [[station identification]], increasing [[brand recognition]] and asserting ownership of the video signal. In some cases, the graphic also shows the name of the current program. Some [[television network]]s use an on-screen graphic to advertise upcoming programs (usually programs scheduled later the same day, but also for "significant" upcoming programs as much as a week in advance).

The graphic identifies the source of programming, even if it has been [[time shifting|time-shifted]]&amp;mdash;that is, recorded to [[videotape]], [[DVD]], or a digital [[personal video recorder]] such as [[TiVo]]. Many of these technologies allow viewers to skip or omit traditional between-programming station identification; thus the use of a DOG enables the station or network to enforce brand identification even when standard commercials are skipped.

DOG watermarking also helps minimize off-the-air [[copyright infringement]] (for example, the distribution of a current series' episodes on DVD): the watermarked content is easily differentiated from "official" DVD releases, and can help law-enforcement efforts by identifying not only the station an illegally copied broadcast was captured from, but usually the actual date of the broadcast as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Graphics may be used to identify if the correct subscription is being used for a type of venue. For example, showing [[Sky Sports]] within a pub requires a more expensive subscription; a channel authorized under this subscription adds a [[pint glass]] graphic to the bottom of the screen for inspectors to see. The graphic changes at certain times, making it harder to counterfeit.  

==Usage==
Many news broadcasters also place a clock alongside their bug. In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], DOGs may also include the show's [[Television content rating systems|parental guideline rating]].  In Australia, this is known as a Program Return Graphic (PRG). It has become common to place text above the station's logo advertising other programs on the network.

In many countries, some TV networks put "live" in the bottom of the DOG to advise viewers that the program is live, as opposed to a repeat.

During televised sports events, a DOG may also display a few game-related statistics such as the current score. This has led many people in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] to refer to it as a '''[[score bug]]'''.

===Arab world===
Arabic TV logos are placed in the top-right and top-left except for Al-Jazeera, whose logo appears on the bottom-right of the screen. Some of the Arabian TV stations hide their logos during commercial breaks and promos/trailers, such as [[Dubai TV]], [[Dubai One]], Funoon, the Egyptian [[CBC (Egypt)|CBC]] and Nile TV networks, ART Hekayat, ART Hekayat 2, Iqraa and [[Al-Jazeera]].

===Argentina===
Beginning in the late 1990s, almost all television stations in Argentina had their logos being shown on the top-right of the screen. When [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]] relaunched in 2002 to replace Azul Televisión, its logo was shown on the bottom-left of the screen. After intense criticism, Canal 9 moved its logo to the top-right of the screen of which most Argentine broadcasters had almost always followed.

===Australia===
Australia first introduced the digital on-screen graphic in the early 1990s. The [[Seven Network]] was the first metropolitan network to broadcast digital on-screen graphics on all of their programs, following The [[Nine Network]] in mid-to-late 2002 later [[Network Ten]] in 2004. DOGs in Australia most commonly appear in the bottom-right hand corner of the screen, but sports orientated content that uses the network's sports brand (e.g. Seven Network and [[Seven Sport]]) generally appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. [[10 Boss|One]] originally placed its DOG in the top-right hand corner of the screen due to it being a sports orientated channel at the time, but after the 2011 rebrand to allow a wide range of content to be broadcast, the channel's DOG was moved to the bottom-right hand corner of the screen. The [[ABC Me|ABC3]] and [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] channels originally placed their DOGs in the top-left hand corner of the screen, but have since moved them down to the bottom-right hand corner as of late 2013. [[Datacasting|Datacasting channels]] and [[Shopping channel|home shopping channels]] show their DOGs in the top-right hand corner of the screen.

DOGs are generally shown in a semi-transparent format, but are shown opaque during in-programme advertisements that take place at the very bottom of the screen. News services have their own DOGs placed where their network's DOG would normally be, but are only shown in an opaque format. News services generally show footage that was captured by another network (usually for sporting stories), but the semi-transparent DOG of the original network is still shown. [[Current affairs (news format)|Current affairs]] programmes and other news programmes that are produced by the network generally show their own opaque DOG at the bottom-left hand corner of the screen, opposite to their network's semi-transparent DOG which still appears (e.g. [[Nine Network]] and [[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]).

Australian TV networks hide all of their DOGs during advertisement breaks. They only reappear during the promotion for a programme that will be shown on the station and are not shown during any other advertisement material.

At times, networks will superimpose a semi-transparent watermark immediately adjacent to their DOG to advertise an upcoming special event that the network will be broadcasting (e.g. [[Network Ten]] superimposed an advertisement for the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics]] on their primary channel (Ten), [[10 Boss]], and [[10 Peach]] as they were to be the Australian broadcaster of the event), or to advertise a popular upcoming programme.

In addition, during ABC's [[ABC News Breakfast]], Seven's [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]] and 10 Peach's [[Toasted TV]] (except Weekends), a digital clock appears on the bottom right-hand corner of the screen while Nine's [[Today (Australian TV program)|Today Show]] and Ten's [[Studio 10]] appears on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

Currently now ABC, Seven, Nine and Ten are on the bottom-right hand corner while SBS is on the top-right hand corner.

===Austria===
[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Austrian public broadcasting agency, introduced digital on-screen graphics in 1992 on both television channels operated back then. Before, only the abbreviation "ORF" was shown randomly for several minutes during the programming in the top right corner of the screen, styled in a simple white sans-serif typeface. Nowadays, all Austrian television channels, both public and private, are required by law to display a digital on-screen graphic continuously in order to enable channel identification. However, during commercial and continuity breaks, it is forbidden to show digital on-screen graphics, to allow a further distinction between paid commercials or station announcements and programming content.

The position on the screen varies between the top left and the top right corner: for instance, public broadcaster ORF shows the digital on-screen graphics on ORF eins (first channel) in the top left corner, on ORF 2 (second channel) in the top right corner and on ORF III (third channel) again in the top left corner. Commercial broadcaster [[ATV (Austria)|ATV]] places the graphic in the top right corner on its main channel and in the top left corner on its additional channel ATV II. Most other commercial channels show their digital on-screen graphics in the top right corner of the screen.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, digital on-screen graphics were introduced in the mid-1990s and are always used by all channels ([[Free-to-air|free]] and [[Pay television|pay]]). In most free-to-air channels, the logos are located on the bottom-right hand corner of the screen (except for [[RedeTV!]], [[TV Gazeta]], and [[Rede Bandeirantes]], whose logos are placed on the top right corner of the screen, and [[GloboNews]], which is located in the top left corner of the screen (and on the bottom left corner of the screen during reports)) and in all free channels they are usually transparent, but if some program or event is being broadcast live or exclusive or if some archived footage is shown, they become colorful.  In some pay channels, the logos appear even in [[commercial break]]s, but they become transparent in this situation.

===Canada===
[[Image:Sequence01.jpg|right|thumb|[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] places their opaque logo over [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s on-screen graphic during ''[[American Idol]]''.]]
[[Image:DOG Jimbo Global.png|right|thumb|A simulation of how a Canadian TV network could place their logo if a US network's logo is already present.]]

Logo bugs are used by Canadian broadcasters in a nearly identical fashion to U.S. broadcasters. However, a complication emerges when Canadian broadcasters [[simulcast]] U.S. programming (a frequent practice among broadcast television networks, intended to invoke the [[simultaneous substitution]] rules requiring TV providers to substitute the feeds of U.S. broadcast channels with those of local, Canadian broadcast channel, if they are airing identically-scheduled programming). While recorded programs can be delivered to the broadcaster by their distributor and played out locally (without depending on taking a feed from a U.S. network), live programs may not always have a clean feed available that is free of the U.S. network's bugs and imaging, necessitating the use of a dirty feed from the network instead.

In these scenarios, some channels—including, most frequently, CTV and [[CTV Two]], as well as its [[Bell Media]] sister channels—covered the U.S. network's bug with their own, opaque logo. However, Bell has since ceased this practice, and the majority of broadcasters "co-brand" the dirty feed by placing their own bug in a different corner of the screen than the U.S. logo.

===Chile===
Chilean television stations started showing the logos permanently in the 1990s. During that time, logos were placed in the bottom-right of the screen. [[La Red (Chilean TV channel)|La Red]] was the first television broadcaster to move their logo to the top of the screen, in 1997, due to the logo change, the logo was placed at the top-left, and later due to the same reason, moved to the top-right until now. Other broadcasters, such as [[Mega (Chilean television channel)|Mega]], which its logo being originally shown on the bottom-left of the screen, moved to the top-right of the screen due to similar reasons; [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], in a similar manner, moved its logo from the bottom-right to the top-right corner in 2002. [[Chilevisión]] has continued to have its logo being shown on the bottom-right of the screen until 2007, when it moved to the top-right of the screen, of which other television channels in Chile had followed in the previous years.

===China===
TV stations in mainland China always place their logo (usually semi-transparent and sometimes animated) in the top-left corner of the screen in full colour or grey-scale, regardless of the content being broadcast (programme or advertisements); although in some rare cases, the DOG may be placed elsewhere to avoid covering the score bug during the broadcast of a sport event.

===Finland===
[[Nelonen]] was the first channel in Finland to use the DOG, from its start in June 1997. [[MTV3]] started to use DOG in the beginning of 1998, and [[Yle]] introduced DOGs in its two channels in August 1998. The DOGs moved from the top right corner to the top left corner on Yle's channels on 5 March 2012 when the company's new corporate logo was taken into use.

===France===
[[La Cinq]] was the first channel in France to use the DOG when it launched in February 1986; it remained on the bottom-right corner until the channel ceased operations in April 1992. After the first private channels launched between 1986 and 1990, DOGs began to be used on the public television channels operated by [[France Télévisions]] and [[TF1]], where they were placed on the top-right corner.

Currently, the DOGs of TF1 and all channels of France Télévisions are placed on the top-right corner, while those of [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]] and [[W9 (TV channel)|W9]] are placed on the top-left corner.  During programming blocks aimed at children, TF1 and international channel TV5 uses another DOG.

=== Germany ===
In the 1980s, public broadcasters started to randomly show logos during programs to prevent video piracy, following the lead of Italian broadcasters [[RAI]] and [[Canale 5]]. After the first private stations emerged in 1984, permanently showing their logo most times, the public broadcasters soon followed.
Today practically all TV stations show their logo during the programs and often these are an integral part of their design using fluent [[motion graphic]] animations to make the transition between programs, previews and advertising, as well as displaying additional information such as teletext numbers or the name of the following program.
Most logos are transparent during programming though some channels do not. (e.g. [[kabel eins]] uses a bright orange coloured logo.)
Also the majority of the channels show their logo in either the top-left or top-right corner of the picture though there are exceptions (e.g. [[RTL II]] in the bottom-right or [[N24 (Germany)|N24]] logo in the bottom-left and date and time in the top-right).

===Greece===
On all Greek network television networks, DOGs appear on the top-left hand corner of the screen. Since 1997, almost all television stations in Greece do not remove their logos during advertisement, although in channels such as [[Skai TV]] the logo becomes transparent.

===Hungary===
Hungarian DOGs was first introduced in MTV's channels ([[M1 (Hungary)|TV1]], [[M2 (TV channel)|TV2]] - not to be confused with the independent channel of the [[TV2 (Hungary)|same name]]) from the late 80's to the early 90's, but it was very rare.

TV2 was the first network to always display its DOG, which was a quarter-circle generated by a video super-imposer connected through the video-casette recorder. It started in 1992 and ceased in 1994.

Most DOGs are semi-transparent, but some including [[ATV (Hungary)|ATV]], [[HírTV]], and [[Echo TV]] have opaque DOGs.

These logos may be at any corner of the screen.

Age ratings have been included since 2001 onwards at the bottom of the screen as well as at the start of the program, but some channels dislike the requirement and use a different age rating system instead (mostly the Romanian ones) or none at all.

Many channels hide their logos in commercial breaks, but some (such as the independent TV2 and its sisters) include them during ads.

===Ireland===
The Irish language channel [[TnaG]] first used their bug during simulcast of [[QVC]] and their coverage of the [[Oireachtas]] (Irish Parliament). In 1998 [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] launch as Ireland's first commercial operator and the first Irish channel to permanently use a bug in the left hand corner of the screen. In 1999 TnaG re-branded as [[TG4]] and began showing their logo during all programmes. In 2002 [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] introduced their bug however it would only appear for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show and it was there to classify the suitability of the content of the show, in 2004 the bug became a permanent part of the on screen presentation for both [[RTÉ One]] and [[RTÉ Two]]. RTÉ's classification guide also appears for twenty seconds at the beginning of each show. RTÉ's, TG4's and [[Setanta Ireland]]'s bugs appear in the upper right hand corner of the screen, while TV3's bugs appeared in the bottom right hand corner of the screen between the early 2000s and the channel's rebranding as [[Virgin Media One]] in August 2018 (when its bug was moved to the top right hand corner). RTÉ does not use their bug during news or current affairs programming. The now-defunct Channel 6 also displayed a bug during its two years on the air.  The new digital services from RTÉ also display bugs on [[RTÉjr]], [[RTÉ Two]] HD and [[RTÉ One|RTÉ One+1]]. Bugs are also used to tell viewers when shows are live or when they are replays. RTÉ use the word "replay" during repeats of live programming while TV3 advised viewers "Text &amp; Comment Lines are Closed", Setanta replaced the word "Ireland" with the word "live" to advise viewers that they are watching live events rather than repeats and TG4 places the Irish word "beo" (live) below the number '4' in their logo during live programming. RTÉ refer to DOGs as "bugs". In Northern Ireland UTV began displaying their bug in the late 2000s. All of the community and local channels in Ireland display a bug. All bugs also display 888 for subtitles.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, channel watermarks more often appear on the top left or the top right since Israeli cable and satellite based services often have the channel description and programming (OSD) on the bottom of the screen. In ad breaks, it is required to replace the channel watermark with a special symbol - often on the other edge of the screen - indicating there are ads at the moment.

===Indonesia===
Indonesian TV DOGs have been used since 1983. At that time, [[TVRI]] was Indonesia's only television channel. When [[RCTI]] began broadcasting in 1989, the DOG began to be used at the same time. The usage of logo differs by channel, appearing in either the top-left hand (for example, channels owned by [[Media Nusantara Citra]] such as RCTI, [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]] and [[MNCTV]], as well as [[Indosiar]]) or the top-right hand corners (such as [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]], [[antv]] and the channels of [[Trans Corp]] like [[Trans TV]] and [[Trans7]]). Logos of television channels may or may not have moved their logos to the other part of the screen, such as TVRI was the first to move theirs to the bottom-right hand corner in 1999 (the year the network changed its logo, used until 2001), and followed by [[MetroTV]] in 2010, while Indosiar's DOGs have been always on the top-left since it began broadcasting in 1995. SCTV, while using the text logo at the start of broadcast, did not began to use their own logo on screen until 1994.

Unlike Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, since 2004, most Indonesian TV networks never leave their logos during commercial breaks, instead, the logo becomes transparent (before 2004, logos were removed during commercial breaks). For the station identification, the logo will remain on-screen, but sometimes it will disappear prior to the identification.

===Italy===
In Italy, channel watermark usage is different for every television network. [[RAI]] at the end of 1970s, introduced its first watermark, to minimize copyright infringement by private channels. The bug "jumped" around the four corners of the image. At the end of 1987, the bug added the number of the station, until 2010 in letters and from 2010 in numbers.  
Nowadays RAI logos are always on the top right corner of the screen.  On the SD feeds of RAI channels that have an HD feed, the HD channel number is posted below the channel's bug.  [[Mediaset]] bugs are on the bottom-right from beginning, but during some shows or sport events, they can be moved on the top right.  

DOGs are not removed during commercial breaks, with an exception of some channels like [[Disney Channel Italy|Disney Channel]].

===Japan===
On all Japanese network television key stations and their affiliates, DOGs appear on the top-right hand corner of the screen. In addition, during some programs, a digital clock appears on the top-left corner of the screen. The digital clock had been in place on all programs prior to the introduction of DOGs; the first DOGs were introduced in 1999 on the [[NHK BS1|NHK's satellite services]], before expanding to terrestrial television with the start of digital broadcasting in that country between 2003 and 2006.

===Mexico===
In Mexico [[Canal Once (Mexico)|Once TV]] and [[Canal 22|XEIMT-TV]] was the first channels to use their logos permanently in the top-right of the screen since 1997. The channels of [[Televisa]] and [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|TV Azteca]] did not start use logos permanently until 2000 and 2004, respectively, in their channels.

===Morocco===
Morocco's TV networks usually display their DOGs permanently, notably the [[SNRT]] and [[2M TV]]. The exception to this is [[Medi 1 TV]], as of now being the only Moroccan TV channel so far to hide its DOG during commercial breaks.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand introduced the digital on-screen graphics in 2001, starting with TV3 and FOUR. New Zealand FTA now placed their logos on the bottom right hand corner, with the exception of [[Maori Television]] and as of 9 February 2017, [[Three (New Zealand)|TV3]]. TV One had the logo on the top right hand corner until the switch to the bottom right hand corner on 1 July 2013. TV2 usually had the logo from the top right hand corner until New Year's Day 2012 when they switched it to the bottom right hand corner. [[Prime Television New Zealand]] now placed their logo on the bottom right hand corner as of March 2016.

===Philippines===
[[GMA Network]] first introduced DOGs in 1995, as the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] had implemented a television content rating system from November that year. Most stations do not display DOGs during commercial breaks, except [[Net 25]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (since 2012), and some cable channels, which display DOGs all the time. The DOGs can most often be seen in the upper-right corner, aligned with the TV content rating logo, but on several cable channels they are placed in the upper-left or bottom-right corners. Formerly, [[ABS-CBN]] removed the DOG and rating 3 minutes before commercial breaks, however from 2000 these are now removed 10 seconds beforehand.  ABS-CBN and GMA previously did not use DOGs during their newscasts but started doing so in 2012.  ABS-CBN and its sister channel S&amp;A append the word HD to their respective HD feeds' DOGs and place the DOGs outside the 4:3 safe zone.

Satellite pay-TV provider Cignal also appends its DOG to the channels it carries.  Hence, those who view channels through Cignal will see its DOG.  

The network logo and the [[MTRCB]] rating of the program (green 'G', blue 'PG' and red 'SPG') are shown 1 to 5 seconds after the start of the program. Hashtags, promotions and announcements are also shown in the middle of the program. All DOGs appear in a solid color.

===Poland===
Virtually all Polish TV channels show their logos in the corner of the screen during all programming, and have done so since the early 1990s. The two [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] channels first introduced them as a test in 1991 and then permanently in early 1993. Various positions of the logo were tested, before settling on the top-right corner on 19 April 1993. [[Polsat]], the first commercial Polish-language broadcaster, launched initially on satellite on 5 December 1992, with a DOG in the top-left corner from the beginning.

Nowadays, most channels, including the major networks such as [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]], [[Polsat]] (since 28 February 2005) and [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]], show their logos in the top-right corner of the screen. Top-left corner is also a common location, used by [[TTV (Poland)|TTV]] and several cable and satellite channels. News-oriented channels such as [[TVP Info]] and [[TVN24]] that display [[news ticker]]s at the bottom of the screen most of the time, usually integrate their DOGs in the ticker design, typically in the bottom-left corner. Few minor cable and satellite channels show their logos in the bottom-right corner. Most broadcasters remove their DOGs during commercial breaks, although the practice is not universal. Some channels, including most basic [[free-to-air]] ones, use alternate logos containing the "HD" branding for their [[HDTV]] feeds. This may be related to the fact that [[Television in Poland#Terrestrial|Polish digital terrestrial TV lineup]] consists almost entirely of [[SDTV]] streams, with HDTV available through cable and satellite.

Since 15 August 2005, all broadcasters licensed in Poland are also required to display the [[Television content rating system#Poland|age rating]] at all times, during all programming except news, sports and advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20051301089|title=Rozporządzenie Krajowej Rady Radiofonii i Telewizji z dnia 23 czerwca 2005 r.}} 23 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but has been criticised by viewers for exaggeration of age rating to +12 in case of animated or family movies on some TV channels, mainly from [[TVN (Poland)|TVN]] and [[Polsat]], and also on talent show with participation of children (e.g. [[The Voice Kids (Polish TV series)|The Voice Kids]]), for pathologizing of system and for [[screen burn-in]]. It is usually shown in the top-left corner, opposite the channel logo. However, Polish broadcasts of international cable networks (such as [[Discovery Channel Poland|Discovery Channel]], [[HBO (international)|HBO]], etc.) usually operate under foreign licenses and are legally treated as rebroadcasts of foreign channels. As such, they don't need to follow this requirement and may use a different rating system instead.

===Portugal===
[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] introduced DOGs in the late 1980s, when it was the only broadcaster in Portugal that operated two television channels. Initially, the logos were placed on the top-right corner, but in 1991 they were moved permanently to the top-left corner, to allow television ratings to be shown in the top-right corner. Until 2004 and [[RTP1]]'s rebranding, their DOGs were placed on the bottom-left corner during newscasts. On some programs or live sport broadcasting{{clarify|date=May 2018}}, DOGs are placed in the top-right corner. Logos are removed during advertising breaks and trailers. For subtitle information, on [[RTP1]] and [[RTP2]] a number such as 884, 885, 886, 887 or 888 is placed near the logo; in other cases ''Direto'' (Live) is sometimes used instead of a number (some programmes use neither numbers nor ''Direto'' (Live), ''Gravado'' (Recorded) or ''Repetição'' (Repetition)).

DOGs of privately owned channels were introduced in the mid-1990s. Initially, the logo of [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]] was placed in the bottom left corner during only some of its programmes; in the mid-2000s the logo was moved into the top left corner, and has been shown across all programmes since then. The two Brazilian-owned television services ([[Globo (Portugal)|Globo]] and [[RecordTV Europa]]) have their DOGs placed in the bottom-right corner.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, television channels usually have watermarks, which are usually placed in the top-right or top-left corner of the screen (one notable exception is [[NTV (Russia)|HTB]], which places it logo on the bottom-left corner). In some channels the watermark becomes half-transparent on ad breaks, but on main channels such as Channel One or Russia-1 they never disappear nor become half-transparent. Channel One was the first channel to have introduced their watermark in 1992 and by 1993 watermarks appeared on other channels.

===Serbia===
The Serbian national television RTS began showing logos in the early 1990s. Their logo was sometimes turned on manually during certain broadcasts but shortly afterwards remained permanently on-screen. One could notice how they were manually controlled, as the "logo-free" time during the begin of a program varied. Until around 1994–1995 their logos were opaque black and white, presumably due to being inserted into the analog CVBS signal just before being broadcast instead of an analog YUV, RGB or digital SDI signal, while in the mid-1990s they upgraded to colorized but still opaque logos. RTS's predecessor RTB (Radio Television of Belgrade) had DOGs of varying sizes, but rather than being introduced one after another they appear to have been used simultaneously at different broadcast sites. At least three different sizes and styles of their opaque black-and-white logo are known today.  On the satellite channel "RTS-SAT", Latin letters were used, but after the destruction of RTS headquarters in 1999 during a NATO air strike, it could be noticed how the logo appeared to have been quickly re-drawn and was being inserted by different equipment as it varied in shape and size, presumably because of the original equipment used to insert it being destroyed. Today RTS has the same opaque color logo from 1999 on RTS-SAT and new translucent logos were introduced in the 2000s for the analog terrestrial programs. Old logos remain on most archived recordings presumably due to lack of a cleanfeed archiving policy in the past, as can be seen in the "Trezor" historical series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbLujWaoJl0]

Most local and regional stations and some national commercial broadcasters (Pink from 2001–present, as of September 2012, when the national news start at 18:30, clock disappears up until the end of its morning program, B92 from 2004 to 2011, Avala from 2007 until 2011) in Serbia along with station logo also show a digital clock below the logo.

===Singapore===
Singaporean televisions began showing the channel logos during television programs in 1994. The first one was [[Mediacorp Channel 5|Channel 5]] then, [[Mediacorp TV12|Channel 12]] and lastly [[Mediacorp Channel 8|Channel 8]]. The television stations show the logo in full-color, and are usually shown in the top right of the screen. Also, since around 2004, logos of Mediacorp television channels also include the parent company's logo, and this expanded in 2005, with [[Mediacorp Channel U|Channel U]] became a part of Mediacorp.

Like its neighbouring country, Malaysia, Singaporean channels remove the channel logos during commercial breaks except for Channel NewsAsia, whose DOG is integrated into the ticker which remains on the screen during breaks.

===Spain===
[[Televisión Española|TVE]] introduced DOGs in 1985 on [[TVE1]] and [[TVE2]]. The DOG of TVE1 was all white until 1991, when the number 1 was changed from white to blue.  It remained so until 2003.

[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]], [[Telecinco]] and [[Canal+]] were the first channels to use DOGs from their launch, with the DOGs placed in the top-left and bottom-left corners. In 1992, Antena 3 and Telecinco repositioned their DOGs in the bottom-right, making it the same as TVE.

[[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], an Autonomical Channel of Catalonia, used DOGs from 1990, earlier shown only alongside [[Clock ident|clock indents]], and from 1994 until 1999, showed DOGs throughout broadcasting. From 1990 the DOG was removed during advertisements.  In 1999, the DOG was removed during the clock.

Currently, almost all channels in Spain use DOGs, with the DOGs are shown in the top or bottom-right of the screen, except [[13-TV]], [[Telemadrid]], and [[Disney Channel (Spain)|Disney Channel]], that uses DOGs on the top-left and bottom-left, respectively.  Most DOGs are removed during advertisements, trade test transmissions or when a program is not aired. An exception to this is [[Intereconomía TV|Intereconomia]]. [[3/24|Canal 3/24]] did not remove their DOG during advertisements between 2011 and 2014.

===Thailand===
Thailand introduced DOGs in 1991. Thai TV logos are in full-color, and the logos are removed during commercial breaks, trade test transmissions,  transitions between programs and when a Thai Royal Family member is shown during the broadcast. All Thai television stations show the logos in the top-right of the screen.

During the mourning period after the [[Death and funeral of Bhumibol Adulyadej|death of Bhumibol Adulyadej]] all television stations aired black-and-white, monochrome DOGs and showed the logo on the bottom-right of the screen for a period of a hundred days until 21 January 2017. After the period ended, all television stations reverted DOGs back to regular color scheme but remained on showing the logo on the bottom-right of the screen (except during foreign  sports programming and some foreign series and domestic sports programming on some channels, when television stations still show the logos on the top-right corner of the screen).

===Turkey===
In Turkey, screen graphics, bugs, or DOGs are known as screen badges. On analogue/digital television, screen badges were introduced to TRT1 in 1996 and some private channels had screen badges beginning in the mid-1990s. Beginning January 1, 2000, all television channels at the time had screen badges usually located in the top right hand of the screen. However on January 1, 2010, One got a new theme package and the screen badge was moved down to the bottom right hand of the screen. All of the TRT channels' screen badges were on the bottom right of the screen by the end of 2010.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, DOGs most commonly appear in the top-left hand corner on British channels. DOGs were first used on [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]] systems in their early days, when broadcasts were unmarked. [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] was the first to use DOGs on an analogue terrestrial channel in 1997. The DOG was originally very bright and noticeable, and was soon toned down. Channel 5 said that the DOG was used to assist viewers in tuning to the new channel once its test transmissions had ceased. Following the rebrand to "five" in 2002 the DOG disappeared until late 2007.

There have been two known predecessors to the digital on-screen graphic on British television, namely a small white outline rectangle that was broadcast on the screen throughout [[ITV (network)|ITV]]'s broadcast of the documentary ''Life by Misadventure: A Film about the Seriously Burned'' on 7 September 1973 to warn people that may be uncomfortable with its content,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/9185882/Channel_4_and_the_Red_Triangle_A_Case_Study_in_Film_Curation_and_Censorship_on_Television&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly, [[Channel 4]]'s infamous [[Red triangle (Channel 4)|red triangle]] symbol, which was applied in the corner of the screen throughout a series of controversial late-night art films broadcast 1986–87, in addition to an [[television ident|ident]] before the films began, again in both cases to warn viewers of the content.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/9185882/Channel_4_and_the_Red_Triangle_A_Case_Study_in_Film_Curation_and_Censorship_on_Television&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] initially introduced a DOG on each of its digital-only channels. In October 1998, it added DOGs to [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] but following a large number of complaints they were removed just two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://625.uk.com/dogwatch/#choice DOG Watch!: Hello BBC Three (Goodbye Choice)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a BBC TWO DOG was used during the overnight [[BBC Learning Zone]] strand. The DOGs for the other channels appear at the top left-hand corner on other channels except [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] (which is bottom left and forms part of integrated information graphics) and its international counterpart, [[BBC World News]].  The BBC News Channel's DOG does not appear when it airs Breakfast. Whilst [[BBC Four]] and [[BBC Parliament]] have static DOGs, the ones on [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] alongside other channels such as [[Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] feature moving elements. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] uses DOGs on all its channels, as do its counterparts [[STV (TV network)|STV]] in central and northern [[Scotland]], [[Orkney Islands]] and [[Shetland Islands]], and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] in Northern Ireland.  Although BBC One and BBC Two currently do not feature their own channel-specific DOGs, a generic BBC logo appears on the top left-hand corner of their iPlayer feeds as is the case with other BBC channels.  This generic BBC DOG also appears on catch-up or on-demand programmes on the iPlayer.

The logos on channels such as [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (excluding [[STV (TV network)|STV]]), [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], [[E4 (channel)|E4]], [[E!]], [[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney XD]], [[Sky Arts|Sky Arts 1 and 2]], [[Sky1]], [[Sky2]], [[Sky Sports]], [[History (UK TV channel)|History]], and [[More4]] are almost transparent, whereas others like those on [[Comedy Central (UK)|Comedy Central]], [[Disney Junior]], some [[UKTV]] channels, [[CITV]], [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]], [[CBeebies]], the Discovery channels, [[Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nick Jr.]], [[Nicktoons (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nicktoons]], [[Boomerang (UK &amp; Ireland)|Boomerang]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK)|Nickelodeon]] are bright and noticeable. [[Sky Movies]] and [[Film4]] do not use DOGs, but [[Channel 4]] (starting in July 2017), [[Channel 4 HD#Channel 4 HD|Channel 4 HD]] and the timeshift channel Channel 4+1 all do. Some stations display their on-screen graphics permanently. The [[UKTV]] are an example that remove them during commercials and trailers, with some Sky channels removing them altogether at certain times into a programme. In addition to a fixed (sometimes animated) motif, [[MTV UK|MTV]] includes the programme title in the top-right hand corner. During [[widescreen]] programmes, the DOGs on most channels including ITV, BBC Three, BBC Four, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, CITV, CBBC, CBeebies, [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]], and [[4Music]] stay in the far corner of the screen, it is now rare for a channel to place their DOG in a 4:3 "[[title safe]] area".{{when|date=July 2018}}

On digital systems such as [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], where stations have a set [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] number and a name displayed across the bottom of the screen when changing channel, DOGs have been deemed unnecessary by some users. Despite this, broadcasters persist with the practice. In response to negative feedback, the BBC has responded, "We believe it is important to ensure that viewers can quickly identify when they are watching a BBC service."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/content/issue/_issue_dogs/ BBC Complaints: Digital on-screen graphics]&lt;/ref&gt; It reinforced this position in both 2008 and 2009 following continual complaints to its ''[[Points of View (TV series)|Points of View]]'' programme, citing channel identification as the sole reason for the policy.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Points of View'', 11 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Points of View'', 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In its website FAQs, Five's stated reason for its use of a DOG is that "the vast majority of channels carry them, most permanently and virtually every channel at some point has one during the day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.five.tv/aboutfive/contact/faq/#dog five.tv: About Five]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 21 October 2008, the BBC announced that it was removing the DOG from BBC HD for all films and most dramas, acknowledging that there was an "irritation factor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a133304/bbc-tones-down-hd-channel-logo.html|title=BBC tones down HD channel logo|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the DOG came back when [[BBC One|BBC One HD]] launched in 2010. As of 2016, neither BBC One HD nor BBC Two HD was using a DOG. More recent additions are graphics which appear near the end of a programme to tell the viewer what's up next, despite this information being available at a touch of a button on digital TV. Many viewers also find this practice annoying, distracting and unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguide/columnists/story/0,,2077719,00.html|title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn|first=Charlie|last=Brooker|work=the Guardian|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6924316/How-low-will-TV-companies-stoop-to-stop-us-reaching-for-the-remote.html|title=How low will TV companies stoop to stop us reaching for the remote?|date=2 January 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8642854.stm|title=BBC News - Doctor Who fans angered by trailer for Over the Rainbow|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first logo bug appeared in the 1970's on cable networks and local TV stations. It was often displayed on the bottom of the screen for 5 to 10 seconds. It was usually displayed once per hour, or every 10 or 15 minutes during a program. One of the popular title generator machines during that time was made by "Chryron". But other brands were also used. The first transparent logo bug to be displayed throughout an entire show appeared on [[CBS Evening News]] in 1990.  It was part of the redesign of the news broadcast done by branding design firm Novocom. The reason for its introduction was so that business professionals traveling within the US would know which channel [[CBS News]] was on since it varied in different areas. Later it was adopted by [[CBS]] on every program. Since then, the use of digital on-screen bugs among cable and [[broadcast networks]] became standardized with the bug usually placed on the lower right hand corner of the screen, with the notable exception being during the [[broadcasting of sports events]] (where logo bugs have largely been placed in the top-right), and on most NBCUniversal networks (including [[NBC]]), where its standard bug was moved to the bottom left during prime time programming in 2006. During sports broadcasts, ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' introduced a permanent box at the top left-hand side of the screen showing the score of the game, along with the network's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commarts.com/features/fifty-years-of-tv-graphics|title=Communication Arts - Fifty Years of TV Graphics|work=commarts.com|accessdate= 3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "big four" networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]) began using on-screen bugs in September 1993 with the bug removed during commercial breaks. Other major networks such as [[PBS]] and [[The CW]] also use logo bugs in the same manner. They are usually monochrome to minimize distraction, while some cable networks ([[The History Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]], and [[CNBC]]) decided to use solid, full-color bugs at all times. Broadcast stations and networks typically only use solid, full color bugs during local newscasts, newscasts, and sports broadcasts; at other times the bug is switched to the transparent, gray variant. Also, broadcast channels typically show their local affiliate's [[call sign]] and/or the channel number on the screen bugs during local newscasts and in some cases [[syndicated programming]].  First-run syndicated programmes often display their own bug in addition to the bug of the station they are running on.  Meanwhile, network-based programming (including [[prime time]] programs and national newscasts) is typically shown with only the network's bug for most of the broadcast (although an automated system may allow a local bug to be overlaid onto network programming for a few seconds after the start of a programme or a commercial break).

Before the 2009 digital television transition, early [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasts often used bugs placed outside the 4:3 safe zone (sometimes with special "HD" branding) to distinguish them from the standard definition broadcast. By the late-2000s, due to networks switching to a singular HD feed downconverted for SD (assuming that the SD feed will be center-cut from the HD feed, or using [[Active Format Description]] (AFD) metadata to specify the framing format) as their network feed rather than distinct feeds for both formats, most broadcast networks dropped HD-specific logo bugs and used bugs in the 4:3 safe zone for all viewers, regardless of feed. However, by 2018, the majority of logo bugs and on-air presentation has been oriented towards 16:9 framing.

The use of bugs to announce upcoming programs with text advertisements is also particularly prevalent among some broadcast stations during prime time programs and many cable TV networks; they usually appear when a program resumes after a [[commercial break]], to inform the viewer of the next scheduled program, a new episode of a program later the same day, or a "significant" broadcast in the near future.  Since the mid-2000s, some stations and networks showed their websites alongside their bugs, especially during newscasts.  National morning shows like Today and Good Morning America have also showed their specific websites rather than their network's main website in addition to the bug that shows their programme.  Beginning in 2010, some networks began to display show-specific [[hashtag]]s alongside their bugs, which encourage viewers to discuss and interact with the program online via [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.linkbird.com/en/online-marketing/the-ultimate-guide-on-how-to-maximize-the-new-twitter-features/ |title=The Ultimate Guide on How to Maximize The New Twitter Features |first=Al |last=Gomez |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=Link Bird }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
Vietnamese TV stations started showing their digital on-screen graphical DOGs since year 1995. Logos are not removed during commercial breaks, but remained in full-color, unlike their counterparts in Indonesia. A digital clock and programme name may also be shown. Some cable channels show its cable provider logo and its logo. For example, VTV Cable's channels has the logo of the cable provider on the top-left, and the channel logo on the top-right.

==Connections with sponsor tags==
Another graphic on television usually connected with sports (particularly in North America, though not in Europe) is the sponsor tag. It shows the logos of certain sponsors, accompanied by some background relevant to the game, the network logo, announcement and music of some kind.

==Usage in [[ham radio]] and TV==
In most countries, the ham station is required to periodically identify their amateur-TV transmission. Such stations frequently overlay their callsign on the signal instead of placing a card in the background. Most hams use homebuilt devices or old consumer character generators to generate such identifications rather than using graphical super imposes of high cost to do so. Only rarely one can see real graphics, as the callsign is usually written in the "OSD font".

==Live DOGs by hobbyists==
One of the easiest and most sought-after devices used to generate DOGs by hobbyists is the 1980s vintage Sony XV-T500 video superimposer. This device can luma-key a signal, capture a still frame into memory and then overlay the [[Keying (graphics)|keyed]] graphic in one of eight colors onto any CVBS signal. Another method commonly used by hobbyists and even low-budgeted TV stations in former times was [[Amiga]] computers with [[genlock]] interfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42748">'''Dosage compensation''' is the process by which organisms equalize the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different [[sexes]] are often characterized by different types and numbers of [[sex chromosome]]s. In order to neutralize the large difference in [[gene dosage]] produced by differing numbers of sex chromosomes among the sexes, various [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary branches]] have acquired various methods to equalize [[gene expression]] among the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of [[genes]], different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual ''gene'' is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the ''expression'' from each gene. For example, in [[humans]], females (XX) silence the transcription of one [[X chromosome]] of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.&lt;ref name= "Brockdorff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brockdorff |first1=N.|last2= Turner |first2=B.M. | year = 2015 | title = Dosage compensation in mammals | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = a019406 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a019406|pmc=4355265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main mechanisms of achieving dosage compensation which are widely documented in the literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Mus musculus]]''; this is called [[X-inactivation]]), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory research setting. A summary of these forms of dosage compensation is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of dosage compensation, which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and [[monotreme]] species).

[[File:Summary of dosage compensation.png|thumb|Three main mechanisms of dosage compensation observed in common model eukaryotic organisms.]]

== Random inactivation of one ♀ X ==

One logical way to equalize gene expression amongst males and females that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression of one of the X chromosomes in an XX, or female, [[homogametic]] individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice.&lt;ref name="Brockdorff"/&gt;

The evidence for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists’ understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, [[Murray Barr]] and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of “nucleolar satellites,&lt;ref name= "Barr"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barr |first1=M.L.|author-link1=Murray Barr|last2=Bertram |first2= E.G. | year = 1949 | title = A morphological distinction between [[neurones]] of the male and female, and the behaviour of the nucleolar satellite during accelerated nucleoprotein synthesis | journal = Nature | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 676–677 | doi=10.1038/163676a0 | pmid=18120749}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they observed were present in the mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed [[heterochromatin]], but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.

Then, in 1959 [[Susumu Ohno]] proved that these satellite-like structures found exclusively in female cells were actually derived from female X chromosomes.&lt;ref name= "Ohno"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ohno|first1= Susumu|author-link1=Susumu Ohno | year = 1959 | title = Sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes | journal = Teratology | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 111 | doi = 10.1002/tera.1420040116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called these structures [[Barr bodies]] after one of the investigators who originally documented their existence. Ohno’s studies of Barr bodies in female mammals with multiple X chromosomes revealed that such females used Barr bodies to inactivate all but one of their X chromosomes. Thus, Ohno described the “n-1” rule to predict the number of Barr bodies in a female with n number of X chromosomes in her karyotype.&lt;ref name="Ohno"/&gt;

Simultaneously, [[Mary F. Lyon]] began investigating manipulations of X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately linked to the X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying,&lt;ref name= "Lyon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyon|first1= M.F.|author-link1=Mary F. Lyon | year = 1961 | title = Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (''Mus musculus'' L.) | journal = Nature | volume = 190 | issue = | pages = 372–373 | doi=10.1038/190372a0 | pmid=13764598}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explained the [[heterogeneous]] fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as [[X-inactivation]], and is sometimes referred to as “lyonization”.&lt;ref name="Brockdorff"/&gt; This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of [[tortoiseshell cat]]s. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell.&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahn|first1= J.|last2= Lee|first2= J. | year = 2008 | title = X chromosome: X inactivation | journal = Nature Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.

Compounding on Lyon’s discoveries, in 1962 [[Ernest Beutler]] used female [[fibroblast]] cell lineages grown in culture to demonstrate the heritability of lyonization or random X-inactivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= = Beutler|first1= Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Beutler|last2= Yeh |first2=Mary |last3=Fairbanks|first3= Virgil F. | year = 1962 | title = The normal human female as a mosaic of X-chromosome activity: studies using the gene for g-6-pd-deficiency as a marker | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 9–16 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.48.1.9 | pmid=13868717 | pmc=285481}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing the differential expression of two existing, viable alleles for the X-linked enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) gene, Beutler observed that the inactivation of the gene was heritable across passaged generations of the cells.&lt;ref name="Beutler, E 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beutler|first1= Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Beutler | year = 2008 | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: a historical perspective | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 16–24 | doi=10.1182/blood-2007-04-077412 | pmid=18156501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern of dosage compensation, caused by random X-inactivation, is regulated across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, at the beginning of most female mammal development, both X chromosomes are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X.&lt;ref name="Beutler, E 2008"/&gt; In [[germ cells]], inactivated X chromosomes are then once again activated to ensure their expression in [[gametes]] produced by female mammals.&lt;ref name="Brockdorff" /&gt;

Thus, dosage compensation in mammals is largely achieved through the silencing of one of two female X chromosomes via X-inactivation. This process involves [[histone]] tail modifications, DNA [[methylation]] patterns, and reorganization of large-scale [[chromatin]] structure encoded by the X-ist gene.&lt;ref name="Brockdorff" /&gt; In spite of these extensive modifications, not all genes along the X chromosome are subject to X-inactivation; active expression at some loci is required for [[homologous recombination]] with the pseudo-autosomal region ([[Pseudoautosomal region|PAR]]) of the [[Y chromosome]] during meiosis.&lt;ref name="Veitia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Veitia|first1=RA|last2=Veyrunes|first2=F|last3=Bottani|first3=S|last4=Birchler|first4=JA|title=X chromosome inactivation and active X upregulation in therian mammals: facts, questions, and hypotheses|journal=Journal of Molecular Cell Biology|date=February 2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjv001|pmid=25564545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 10-25% of human X chromosome genes,&lt;ref name="Carrel and Willard"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carrel |first1=L.|last2= Willard|first2= H.F. | year = 2005 | title = X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7031| pages = 400–4 | doi=10.1038/nature03479 | pmid=15772666}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3-7% of mouse X chromosome genes &lt;ref name="Berletch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berletch|first1=JB|last2=Ma|first2=W|last3=Yang|first3=F|last4=Shendure|first4=J|last5=Noble|first5=WS|last6=Disteche|first6=CM|last7=Deng|first7=X|title=Escape from X inactivation varies in mouse tissues|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=March 2015|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e1005079|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005079|pmid=25785854|pmc=4364777}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside of the PARs show weak expression from the inactive X chromosome.

== Two-fold increased transcription of a single ♂ X ==

Another mechanism common for achieving equal X-related genetic expression between males and females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, heterogametic male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in homogametic females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref name="Lucchesi, J.C. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Lucchesi|first1= J.C.|last2= Kuroda|first2= M.I. | year = 2015 | title = Dosage compensation in ''Drosophila'' | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume =  7| issue = | page =  a019398| doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a019398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of dosage compensation actually originated from an understanding of organisms in which males upregulated X-linked genes two-fold, and was much later extended to account for the observation of the once mysterious Barr bodies. As early as 1932, [[H.J. Muller]] carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an X-linked gene. Muller introduced a [[mutant]] gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase “dosage compensation” to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization.&lt;ref name="Muller"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller|first1= HJ | year = 1932 | title = Further studies on the nature and causes of gene mutations | journal = Proc 6th Int Congr Genet | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 213–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these advances, it was not until Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann performed more advanced [[autoradiography]] experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee"&gt;{{cite journal | author = |last1=Mukherjee |first1=A.S.|last2= Beermann|first2= W. | year = 1965 | title = Synthesis of [[ribonucleic acid]] by the X-chromosomes of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and the problem of dosage compensation | journal = Nature | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 785–786 |pmid=5885936| doi=10.1038/207785a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of [3H]uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of [3H]uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of [[RNA synthesis]] in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized dosage compensation.

In the case of two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome. It is common in such organisms for the Y chromosome to be necessary for male [[fertility]], but not for it to play an explicit role in [[sexual differentiation in humans|sex determination]].&lt;ref name="Lucchesi JC 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucchesi|first1=John C.|last2=Manning|first2=Jerry E.|title=Gene dosage compensation in ''Drosophila melanogaster''|journal=Advances in Genetics|date=1987|volume=24|pages=371–429|doi=10.1016/S0065-2660(08)60013-9|pmid=3124533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sass"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sass G.L., Pannuti A., Lucchesi J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Male-specific lethal complex of ''Drosophila'' targets activated regions of the X chromosome for chromatin remodeling |journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 8287–8291 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1332749100| pmc = 166221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Drosophila'', for example, the sex lethal (SXL) gene acts as a key regulator of sexual differentiation and maturation in [[Somatic cell|somatic tissue]]; in XX animals, [[SXL]] is activated to repress increased transcription, while in XY animals SXL is inactive and allows male development to proceed via increased transcription of the single X.&lt;ref name="Sass"/&gt; Several binding sites exist on the ''Drosophila'' X chromosome for the dosage compensation complex (DCC), a ribonucleoprotein complex; these binding sites have varying levels of affinity, presumably for varying expression of specific genes.&lt;ref name= "Dahlsveen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dahlsveen|first1=IK|last2=Gilfillan|first2=GD|last3=Shelest|first3=VI|last4=Lamm|first4=R|last5=Becker|first5=PB|title=Targeting determinants of dosage compensation in ''Drosophila''|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=February 2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e5|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020005|pmid=16462942|pmc=1359073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Male Specific Lethal complex, composed of protein and RNA binds and selectively modifies hundreds of X-linked genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhou Qi | year = 2013 | title = The epigenome of evolving ''Drosophila'' neo-sex chromosomes: dosage compensation and heterochromatin formation | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001711 | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 11| pages = 1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal | author = Deng Xinxian, Meller Victoria H | year = 2009 | title = Molecularly severe roX1 mutations contribute to dosage compensation in ''Drosophila'' | journal = Genesis | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 49–54 | doi=10.1002/dvg.20463| pmc = 5029428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing their transcription to levels comparable to female ''D. melanogaster''.

In organisms that use this method of dosage compensation, the presence of one or more X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal.&lt;ref name="Lucchesi JC 1987"/&gt; Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="Lucchesi JC 1987"/&gt; SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male ''Drosophila''. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2).&lt;ref name= "Larschan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larschan|first1=E|last2=Alekseyenko|first2=AA|last3=Gortchakov|first3=AA|last4=Peng|first4=S|last5=Li|first5=B|last6=Yang|first6=P|last7=Workman|first7=JL|last8=Park|first8=PJ|last9=Kuroda|first9=MI|title=MSL complex is attracted to genes marked by H3K36 trimethylation using a sequence-independent mechanism|journal=Molecular Cell|date=12 October 2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=121–33|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2007.08.011|pmid=17936709}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex.&lt;ref name="Meller" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meller|first1=VH|last2=Rattner|first2=BP|title=The roX genes encode redundant male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting of the MSL complex.|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=1 March 2002|volume=21|issue=5|pages=1084–91|doi=10.1093/emboj/21.5.1084|pmid=11867536|pmc=125901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin.&lt;ref name="Maenner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maenner|first1=S|last2=Müller|first2=M|last3=Fröhlich|first3=J|last4=Langer|first4=D|last5=Becker|first5=PB|title=ATP-dependent roX RNA remodeling by the helicase maleless enables specific association of MSL proteins|journal=Molecular Cell|date=25 July 2013|volume=51|issue=2|pages=174–84|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2013.06.011|pmid=23870143}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread along the length of the [[chromosome]] and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications.

== Decreased transcription of both hermaphroditic Xs by half ==

Other species that do not follow the previously discussed conventions of XX females and XY males must find alternative ways to equalize X-linked gene expression among differing sexes. For example, in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' (or ''C. elegans''), sex is determined by the [[ratio]] of X chromosomes relative to autosomes;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer BJ. 1997. Sex determination and X chromosome dosage compensation. In ''C. elegans'' II (ed. Riddle DL, et al.), pp. 209–240. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; worms with two X chromosomes (XX worms) develop as [[hermaphrodites]], whereas those with only one X chromosome (XO worms) develop as males.&lt;ref name="Meyer BJ 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meyer|first1= BJ|author-link1=Barbara J.

However, as is the case with the previously discussed mechanisms of dosage compensation, failure to express X-linked genes appropriately can still be lethal.&lt;ref name="Nigon" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Nigon V | year = 1951 | title = Polyploidie experimentale chez un nematode libre, ''Rhaditis elegans'' Maupas | url = | journal = Bulletin Biologique de la France et de la Belgique | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 187–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this XX/XO sex determination system, gene expression on the X chromosome is equalized by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half.&lt;ref name="Meyer BJ 2000"/&gt; In these XX organisms, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes to allow for this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex,&lt;ref name="Csankovski" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Csankovszki|first1=G|last2=Collette|first2=K|last3=Spahl|first3=K|last4=Carey|first4=J|last5=Snyder|first5=M|last6=Petty|first6=E|last7=Patel|first7=U|last8=Tabuchi|first8=T|last9=Liu|first9=H|last10=McLeod|first10=I|last11=Thompson|first11=J|last12=Sarkeshik|first12=A|last13=Yates|first13=J|last14=Meyer|first14=BJ|author-link14=Barbara J.

This complex is crucial to the condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that dosage compensation in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex in its ability to condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenmann|first1=David M.|title=Wnt signaling|journal=WormBook|date=25 June 2005|doi=10.1895/wormbook.1.7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the DCC in this form of dosage compensation was postulated by [[Barbara J.

In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.

Though all of the above mentioned XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation.&lt;ref name="Gladden" /&gt; This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target.&lt;ref name="Gladden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skipper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicoll" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicoll M, Akerib CC, Meyer BJ | year = 1997 | title = X-chromosome-counting mechanisms that determine nematode sex | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = | pages = 200–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an additive effect on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant dosage compensation mechanics.&lt;ref name="Gladden" /&gt; This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and dosage compensation fate. Thus, in this model organism, the achieved level of X-chromosome expression is directly correlated to the activation of multiple XSEs that ultimately function to repress xol-1 expression in a developing worm embryo. A summary of this ''C. elegans'' mechanism of dosage compensation is illustrated below.

==Other species-specific methods==

The '''ZZ/ZW sex system''' is used by most birds, as well as some reptiles and insects. In this system the Z is the larger chromosome so the males (ZZ) must silence some genetic material to compensate for the female’s (ZW) smaller W chromosome. Instead of silencing the entire chromosome as humans do, male chickens (the model ZZ organism) seem to engage in selective Z silencing, in which they silence only certain genes on the extra Z chromosome.&lt;ref name="Yukiko" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuroda|first1=Y|last2=Arai|first2=N|last3=Arita|first3=M|last4=Teranishi|first4=M|last5=Hori|first5=T|last6=Harata|first6=M|last7=Mizuno|first7=S|title=Absence of Z-chromosome inactivation for five genes in male chickens.|journal=Chromosome Research|date=2001|volume=9|issue=6|pages=457–68|pmid=11592480| doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McQueen Heather ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Dosage compensation in birds | journal = Current Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 253–257 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00070-7 | pmid=11592480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, male chickens express an average of 1.4-1.6 of the Z chromosome DNA expressed by female chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ellegren Hans ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = Faced with inequality: chicken do not have a general dosage compensation of sex-linked genes | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 40 | doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-40 | pmid=17883843 | pmc=2099419}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Z chromosome expression of male zebra finches and chickens is higher than the autosomal expression rates, whereas X chromosome expression in female humans is equal to autosomal expression rates,&lt;ref name="Itoh"/&gt; illustrating clearly that both male chickens and male zebra finches practice incomplete silencing. Few other ZZ/ZW Systems have been analyzed as thoroughly as the chicken; however a recent study on silkworms &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zha Xingfu ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Dosage analysis of Z chromosome genes using microarray in silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' | journal = Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 5–6| pages = 315–321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed similar levels of unequal compensation across male Z chromosomes. Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes.

In chickens, most of the dosage compensated genes exist on the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melamed|first1=E|last2=Arnold|first2=AP|title=Regional differences in dosage compensation on the chicken Z chromosome|journal=Genome Biology|date=2007|volume=8|issue=9|pages=R202|doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r202|pmid=17900367|pmc=2375040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===

The sex chromosomes of birds evolved separately from those of mammals and share very little sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the XY chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Fridolfssen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fridolfsson|first1=AK|last2=Cheng|first2=H|last3=Copeland|first3=NG|last4=Jenkins|first4=NA|last5=Liu|first5=HC|last6=Raudsepp|first6=T|last7=Woodage|first7=T|last8=Chowdhary|first8=B|last9=Halverson|first9=J|last10=Ellegren|first10=H|title=Evolution of the avian sex chromosomes from an ancestral pair of autosomes|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=7 July 1998|volume=95|issue=14|pages=8147–52|pmid=9653155|pmc=20944|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8147}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of ''Drosophila''. However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome.&lt;ref name="Cock" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Cock A.G. | year = 1964 | title = Dosage compensation and sex-chromatin in non-mammals | journal = Genet Res Camb | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 354–365 | doi=10.1017/s0016672300034807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as “less effective” at dosage compensation than mammals.&lt;ref name="Itoh" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Itoh|first1=Y|last2=Melamed|first2=E|last3=Yang|first3=X|last4=Kampf|first4=K|last5=Wang|first5=S|last6=Yehya|first6=N|last7=Van Nas|first7=A|last8=Replogle|first8=K|last9=Band|first9=MR| last10=Clayton|first10=DF|last11=Schadt|first11=EE|last12=Lusis|first12=AJ|last13=Arnold|first13=AP|title=Dosage compensation is less effective in birds than in mammals|journal=Journal of Biology |date=2007|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1186/jbiol53|pmid=17352797|pmc=2373894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms.&lt;ref name="McQueen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McQueen|first1=HA|last2=McBride|first2=D|last3=Miele|first3=G|last4=Bird|first4=AP|last5=Clinton|first5=M|title=Dosage compensation in birds|journal=Current Biology|date=20 February 2001|volume=11|issue=4|pages=253–7|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00070-7|pmid=11250153}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.&lt;ref name="McQueen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieb" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Lieb J.D., Albrecht M.R., Chuan P., Meyer B.J. | year = 1998 | title = MIX-1: an essential component of the ''C. elegans'' mitotic machinery executes X chromosome dosage compensation | journal = Cell | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 265–277 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.

While the [[epigenetic]] mechanisms behind dosage compensation in birds are poorly understood, especially in comparison to the well-studied mechanisms of dosage compensation in humans and ''Drosophila'', several recent studies have revealed promising sequences. One example is MHM (male hypermethylated) RNA, an Xist-like long noncoding RNA that is expressed only in female chickens (ZW). It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of dosage compensation because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melamed Esther, Arnold Arthur | year = 2009 | title = The role of LINEs and CpG islands in dosage compensation on the chicken Z chromosome | journal = Chromosome Research | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 727–736 | doi=10.1007/s10577-009-9068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes dosage compensation, however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM [[locus (genetics)|locus]] has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a dosage compensation mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and [[autosomes]] in the heterogametic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Some inconvenient truths about sex chromosome dosage compensation and the potential role of sexual conflict|journal = Evolution|date = 2011-08-01|issn = 1558-5646|pages = 2133–2144|volume = 65|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01316.x|language = en|first = Judith E.|last = Mank|first2 = David J.|last2 = Hosken|first3 = Nina|last3 = Wedell|pmid=21790564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to mammals, chickens seem to use [[CpG islands]] (segments of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine that are more readily methylated and silenced than other DNA segments) to regulate gene expression. One study found that [[CpG islands]] were found primarily in compensated areas of the Z chromosome—areas that are differentially expressed in male and female chickens. Thus it is likely that these CpG islands are locations where genes on the male Z chromosome are methylated and silenced, but which stay functional on the female Z chromosome.

=== Monotremes ===

 [[File:platypus.jpg|thumbnail|right|Platypus, a type of monotreme]]
'''[[Monotremes]]''' are a class of basal mammals that also lay eggs.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth" &gt;{{cite journal | author = Charlesworth D., Charlesworth B., Marais G., Charlesworth B., Marais G., Marais G. | year = 2005 | title = Steps in the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes | journal = Heredity | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 118–128 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800697}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an order of mammals that includes platypuses and four species of echidna, all of which are egg-laying mammals. While monotremes use an XX/XY system, unlike other mammals, monotremes have more than two sex chromosomes. The male short-beaked echidna, for example, has nine sex chromosomes—5 Xs and 4 Ys, and the male platypus has 5 Xs and 5 Ys.

Platypuses are a monotreme species whose mechanism of sex determination has been extensively studied. There is some contention in academia about the evolutionary origin and the proper [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of platypuses. A recent study&lt;ref name="Deakin" /&gt; revealed that four platypus X chromosomes, as well as a Y chromosome, are homologous to some regions on the avian Z chromosome. Specifically, platypus X1 shares homology with the chicken Z chromosome, and both share homology with the human chromosome 9. This homology is important when considering the mechanism of dosage compensation in monotremes. In 50% of female platypus cells, only one of the alleles on these X chromosomes is expressed while in the remaining 50% multiple alleles are expressed. This, combined with the portions that are homologous to chicken Z and human 9 chromosomes imply that this level of incomplete silencing may be the ancestral form of dosage compensation.

Regardless of their ambiguous evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an [[XY sex-determination system]], with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex.&lt;ref name="Grützner" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grützner|first1=F|last2=Graves|first2=JA|title=A platypus' eye view of the mammalian genome|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=December 2004|volume=14|issue=6|pages=642–9|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2004.09.006|pmid=15531159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes),&lt;ref name="Deakin" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=JE|last2=Hore|first2=TA|last3=Koina|first3=E|last4=Marshall Graves|first4=JA|title=The status of dosage compensation in the multiple X chromosomes of the platypus|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=25 July 2008|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e1000140|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000140|pmid=18654631|pmc=2453332}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated.&lt;ref name="Deakin" /&gt; Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles.&lt;ref name="Deakin" /&gt; This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene,&lt;ref name="Deakin" /&gt; alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.

=== Plants ===

In addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. ''Silene latifolia'' plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meadows|first1=R|title=Sex chromosome equality in plants|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2012|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1001312|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001312|pmid=22529748|pmc=3328425}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown male ''S. latifolia'' expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the ''S. latifolia'' did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, it has been suggested that ''S. latiforia'' and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either [[aneuploidy]] or [[polyploid]]y. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.

An '''eyespot''' (sometimes '''ocellus''') is an [[eye]]-like marking. They are found in butterflies, reptiles, cats, birds and fish.

Eyespots may be a form of [[mimicry]] in which a spot on the body of an animal resembles an eye of a different animal to deceive potential predator or prey species; a form of [[automimicry|self-mimicry]], to draw a predator's attention away from the most vulnerable body parts; or to appear as an inedible or dangerous animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyespots may play a role in intraspecies communication or courtship; the best-known example is probably the eyespots on a [[peacock]]'s display feathers.

Eyespots are not necessarily [[adaptation (biology)|adaptations]], but may in some cases be [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]], accidental artefacts of [[pattern formation]].

The [[morphogenesis]] of eyespots is controlled by a small number of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|genes active in embryonic development]] of a wide range of animals, including [[Engrailed (gene)|Engrailed]], [[Distal-less]], [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], and the [[Notch signaling pathway]].

The eye-like markings in some [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], like the ''[[Bicyclus anynana]],'' and certain other insects, as well as the [[sunbittern]] (a [[bird]]) do not seem to serve only a [[mimic]]ry function. In some other cases, the [[evolution]]ary function of such spots is also not understood. There is evidence that eyespots in butterflies are [[antipredator adaptation]]s, either in [[deimatic display]]s to distract, startle or scare off predators, or to deflect attacks away from vital body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3034 |author=Vallin, A., S.

Some species of caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths ([[Sphingidae]]), have eyespots on their anterior abdominal segments. When alarmed, they retract the head and the thoracic segments into the body, leaving the apparently threatening large eyes at the front of the visible part of the body.&lt;ref name=Stevens2005/&gt;

Many butterflies such as the blues ([[Lycaenidae]]) have filamentous "tails" at the ends of their wings and nearby patterns of markings on the wings, which combine to create a "false head". This [[automimicry]] misdirects predators such as birds and jumping spiders ([[Salticidae]]). Spectacular examples occur in the [[Theclinae|hairstreak]] butterflies; when perching on a twig or flower, they commonly do so upside down and shift their rear wings repeatedly, causing antenna-like movements of the "tails" on their wings. Studies of rear-wing damage support the hypothesis that this strategy is effective in deflecting attacks from the insect's head.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Sourakov (2013): Two heads are better than one: false head allows Calycopis cecrops (Lycaenidae) to escape predation by a Jumping Spider, Phidippus pulcherrimus (Salticidae), Journal of Natural History, 47:15-16, 1047-1054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Robert K.

Some reptiles, such as the [[sand lizard]] of Europe, have eyespots; in the sand lizard's case, there is a row of spots along the back, and a row on each side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reptile ID guide|url=http://www.arguk.org/advice-and-guidance/|publisher=Amphibian and Reptile Group|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===

Male [[bird]]s of some species, such as the [[peacock]], have conspicuous eyespots in their plumage, used to signal their quality to [[sexual selection|sexually selecting]] females. The number of eyespots in a peacock's train predicts his mating success; when a peacock's train is experimentally pruned, females lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrie |first=Marion |last2=Halliday |first2=T. |last3=Sanders |first3=C. |year=1991 |title=Peahens prefer peacocks with elaborate trains |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=41 |pages=323–331 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80484-1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petrie |first=M. |year=1992 |title= Peacocks with low mating success are more likely to suffer predation |journal=Animal Behaviour |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(92)90072-H |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232545934_Peacocks_with_low_mating_success_are_more_likely_to_suffer_predation |volume=44 |pages=585–586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several species of [[pygmy owl]] bear false eyes on the back of the head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Northern Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium californicum) | url=http://www.owlinstitute.org/northern-pygmy-owl.html | publisher=Owl Research Institute | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cats===

Some members of the cat family [[Felidae]], such as the [[serval]], and [[leopard]], have ocelli, white circular markings on the backs of the ears. Ocelli serve social functions, such as signaling to kittens, and communicating the cat's mental state to [[conspecific]]s in the gloom of dense forest or in tall grass.&lt;ref name=sandiego&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-leopard.html |title=Animal bytes: Leopard |publisher=Zoological Society of San Diego |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===
{{see also|Underwater camouflage}}

Some fish have eyespots. The [[foureye butterflyfish]] gets its name from a large and conspicuous eyespot on each side of the body near the tail. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]{{FishBase_species |genus=Chaetodon |species=capistratus |year=2009 |month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may deceive [[predator]]s into attacking the tail rather than the more vulnerable head, and about the fish's likely direction of travel: in other words, the eyespot is an example of [[self-mimicry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Cott|Cott, Hugh]] (1940). ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals''. Oxford University Press. p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, many juvenile fish display eyespots that disappear during their adult phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bos, A.R. |date=March 2016 |title=Soft corals provide microhabitat for camouflaged juveniles of the Blackspotted wrasse ''Macropharyngodon meleagris'' (Labridae) |journal=Marine Biodiversity |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=299–301 |doi=10.1007/s12526-015-0332-x |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272417078_Soft_corals_provide_microhabitat_for_camouflaged_juveniles_of_the_Blackspotted_wrasse_Macropharyngodon_meleagris_%28Labridae%29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphogenesis==
[[File:Butterflywiki.jpg|thumb|225px|Plan of a typical butterfly, showing the [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] foci on the wings that create eyespots]]
{{further|Morphogenesis}}

Butterfly eyespots are formed during [[embryogenesis]] as a result of a [[morphogenetic]] signaling center or organizer, called the focus. This induces neighboring cells to produce specific pigments which pattern the eyespot.&lt;ref name=Breakfield&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Breakfield, M.P. |author2=Gates, J. |author3=Keys, D. |author4=Kesbeke, F. |author5=Wijngaarden, J.P. |author6=Monteiro, A. |author7=French, V. |author8=Carroll, S.B. | title=Development, plasticity and evolution of butterfly eyespot patterns | journal=Nature | volume=384 | issue=6606 | pages=236–242 |date=November 1996 | pmid=12809139 | doi=10.1038/384236a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keys&gt;{{cite journal | author=Keys, D.N., Lewis, D.L., Selegue, J.E., Pearson, B.J., Goodrich, L.V., Johnson R.L., Gates, J., Scott, M.P., Carroll, S.B.  | title=Recruitment of a hedgehog Regulatory Circuit in Butterfly Eyespot Evolution | journal=Science | volume=283 | issue=5401 | pages=532–534 |date=January 1999 | pmid=9915699 | doi=10.1126/science.283.5401.532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{cite journal |author1=French, V. |author2=Breakfield, P.M. | title=The development of eyespot patterns on butterfly wings: morphogen sources or sinks? | journal=Development | volume=116 | pages=103–109 |date=September 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early experiments on eyespot morphogenesis used [[cautery]] on the butterfly wing eyespot foci to demonstrate that a long range signaling mechanism or morphogen gradient controlled eyespot formation in both space and time.&lt;ref name= French/&gt; The findings cannot be explained by a simple source/diffusion model,&lt;ref name= French/&gt; but could be explained by either 1) A source/threshold model, in which the focus creates the morphogen, or 2) the sink model, in which the focus generates a gradient by removing a morphogen which was created elsewhere.&lt;ref name= French/&gt; Several genes involved in eyespot formation have been identified that can fit into these models, but only two of them have been functionally tested. These genes are the [[transcription factor]] Distalless (Dll) and the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] (a signaling substance that binds a [[cell surface receptor]]) Hedgehog (Hh).&lt;ref name=Monteiro&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monteiro |first1=Antonia |title=Origin, Development, and Evolution of Butterfly Eyespots |journal=Annu. Rev. Entomol. |date=2015 |volume=60 |pages=253–271 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-010814-020942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfly eyespot morphology appears to be the result of the evolution of an altered version of the [[regulatory circuit]] which patterns the wings of other insects. This rogue regulatory circuit is able to pattern both the anterior and posterior eyespots independent of the usual anterior/posterior wing compartmentalization restrictions seen in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila]]''.&lt;ref name=Keys/&gt;&lt;ref name=French/&gt; The altered regulatory circuit redeploys early developmental signaling sources, like the canonical [[hedgehog (gene)|hedgehog]] (Hh) pathway, [[Distal-less]] (Dll), and [[engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] (En), breaking the anterior/posterior compartmentalization restrictions through increased localized levels of Hh signaling.&lt;ref name= Breakfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keys/&gt;&lt;ref name=French/&gt; In turn, this raises expression of its receptor [[Patched]] (Ptc) and transcription factor.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; Normally, in  ''[[Drosophila]]'', engrailed acts in the posterior compartment to restrict Ptc and ''[[Cubitus interruptus]]'' (Ci) expression to the anterior compartment by repressing transcription of Ci, thereby preventing Ptc expression.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt; From the perspective of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], understanding the redeployment and [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] of existing regulatory mechanisms in butterfly eyespot locus development has given more insight into a fundamental mechanism for the [[evolution]] of novel structures.&lt;ref name=Breakfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keys/&gt;

===Distal-less===
{{further|Distal-less}}

The Distal-less gene is present in almost all eyespot organizers, making it an ideal candidate to carry out major functions of eyespot formation. During the wing imaginal disc development Dll, has two expression domains separated by a temporal component. First Dll is expressed in a group of cells in the center of what will become the focus and eventually the eyespot. This expression starts during the middle of the fifth [[instar]] [[larva]] and lasts until the [[pupa]]l stage. The second domain starts around 20 hours after pupation around the original central cluster of cells, in an area in which a black ring of the eyespot will be formed. Functional experiments using [[transgenic]] ''[[Bicyclus anynana]]'' (the squinting bush brown butterfly) have shown that overexpression or down-regulation of Dll in the first expression domain correlates with bigger and smaller eyespots respectively. However, if this is done on the second domain then the overall size of the eyespots remains the same, but the width of the black ring raises with a higher amount of Dll. This suggests that Dll might be responsible for the differentiation of the focus in the first expression domain and might be involved in establishing the ring color patterns in the second domain. These experiments together with the wide distribution of Dll across eyespot forming butterflies suggest that this transcription factor is a central regulator for the correct patterning of the eyespots.&lt;ref name= Monteiro/&gt;

===Hedgehog===
{{further|Hedgehog (gene)}}

The Hh gene is the other element that has been functionally tested in the formation of eyespots. Investigating genes involved in wing development and morphogenetic activity has led to the discovery that Hh has a primary role in the morphogenetic signaling center of the foci.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt; In a manner that is similar to the development of ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies, Hh is expressed in all cells in the posterior compartment of the developing butterfly wing during the mid fifth instar of butterfly wing development. However, in butterflies, Hh expression is significantly higher in those cells that flank the potential foci.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt; Higher transcription levels of Hh, along with other known associates of the Hh pathway, namely patched (Ptc) the Hh receptor, and cubitus interruptus (Ci), the Hh transcription factor is seen throughout the mid to late fifth instar as well, which further implies a role for Hh signaling in eyespot development and patterning.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt;

Furthermore, cells that are flanked by the cells expressing the highest level of Hh signaling are fated to become the foci, indicating that focus cell fate determination relies on high concentrations of Hh in surrounding cells.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt; However this observation has not been totally confirmed as a rule for multiple butterfly species.&lt;ref name= Monteiro/&gt; Studies tried to extrapolate the result of Hh pathway involvement by looking for the expression of Ci in ''Bicyclus anynana''.&lt;ref name= Keys/&gt; Here they observed that both seem to be expressed in eyespots, suggesting a relation with the Hh signaling pathway. However, other studies did not find evidence of Hh expression in ''B. anynana''.&lt;ref name= Monteiro/&gt;

===Notch===
{{further|Notch signaling pathway}}

The Notch (N) gene expression precedes an upregulation of Dll in the cells that will become the center of the focus. This makes N the earliest developmental signal, so far studied, that is related with the establishment of the eyespots. Loss of N completely disrupts Dll expression, and eventually eyespot formation, in several butterfly species. A variety of other wing patterns are determined by N and Dll patterns of expression in early development of the wing imaginal disc, suggesting that a single mechanism patterns multiple coloration structures of the wing.&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reed |first1=R.D. |last2=Serfas |first2=M.S. |title=Butterfly Wing Pattern Evolution Is Associated with Changes in a Notch/Distal-less Temporal Pattern Formation Process |journal=Current Biology |date=2004 |volume=14 |pages=1159–1166 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.046 |pmid=15242612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this study, the [http://amapress.gen.cam.ac.uk Martinez Arias] laboratory in the Department of Genetics at the [[University of Cambridge]] demonstrated how aggregates of mouse ESCs were able to generate structures that exhibited collective behaviours with striking similarity to those during early development such as symmetry-breaking (in terms of gene expression), axial elongation and germ-layer specification&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. To quote from the original paper: ''"Altogether, these observations further emphasize the similarity between the processes that we have uncovered here and the events in the embryo. The movements are related to those of cells in gastrulating embryos and for this reason we term these aggregates ‘gastruloids’".'' As noted by the authors of this protocol, a crucial difference between this culture method and previous work with mouse EBs was the use of small numbers of cells which may be important for generating the correct length scale for patterning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baillie-Johnson|first=Peter|last2=Brink|first2=Susanne Carina van den|last3=Balayo|first3=Tina|last4=Turner|first4=David Andrew|last5=Arias|first5=Alfonso Martinez|year=2015|title=Generation of Aggregates of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells that Show Symmetry Breaking, Polarization and Emergent Collective Behaviour ''In Vitro''|url=http://www.jove.com/video/53252/generation-aggregates-mouse-embryonic-stem-cells-that-show-symmetry|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=105|doi=10.3791/53252|pmc=4692741|pmid=26650833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brachyury|Brachyury (T/Bra)]], a gene which marks the [[primitive streak]] and the site of gastrulation, is up-regulated in the Gastruloids following a pulse of the Wnt/β-Catenin agonist CHIR99021&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (Chi; other factors have also been tested&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) and becomes regionalised to the elongating tip of the Gastruloid.

The '''great books''' are [[book]]s that constitute an essential foundation in the [[literature]] of [[Western culture]]. Specified sets of great books typically range from 100 to 150, though they differ according to purpose and context. For instance, some lists are built to be read by undergraduates in a college semester system (130 books, Torrey Honors Institute),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academics.biola.edu/torrey/academics/reading/ |title=The Reading List &amp;#124; Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University}}&lt;/ref&gt; some are compiled to be sold as a single set of volumes ([[Great Books of the Western World|500 books]], [[Mortimer Adler]]), while some lists aim at a thorough literary criticism (2,400 books, [[Harold Bloom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teeter|first=Robert|url=http://sonic.net/~rteeter/grtbloom.html |title=Bloom. Western Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The great books are those that tradition, and various institutions and authorities, have regarded as constituting or best expressing the foundations of [[Western culture]] (the [[Western canon]] is a similar but broader designation); derivatively the term also refers to a curriculum or method of education based around a list of such books. [[Mortimer Adler]] lists three criteria for including a book on the list:
* the book has contemporary significance; that is, it has relevance to the problems and issues of our times;
* the book is inexhaustible; it can be read again and again with benefit; "This is an exacting criterion, an ideal that is fully attained by only a small number of the 511 works that we selected. It is approximated in varying degrees by the rest."&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberspacei.com/greatbooks/h2/criteria.htm |title=Selecting Works for the 1990 Edition of the Great Books of the Western World|author=Adler, Mortimer J. |accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the book is relevant to a large number of the great ideas and great issues that have occupied the minds of thinking individuals for the last 25 centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, "Second Look", p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.john-uebersax.com/plato/reading2.htm |title=Thomas Jefferson's Reading Lists |publisher=John-uebersax.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known for his interest in higher education, frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents, for example, for Peter Carr in 1785&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr  (An honest heart, a knowing head; Paris, August 19, 1785). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 814–818)&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (The homage to Reason; Paris, August 10, 1787). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 900–906).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Harvard University published a 51-volume great books series, titled the [[Harvard Classics]].  These volumes are now in the public domain.

The [[Great Books of the Western World]] came about as the result of a discussion among American academics and educators, starting in the 1920s and 1930s and begun by Prof. [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]] of [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |title=radicalacademy.com |publisher=radicalacademy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054422/http://radicalacademy.com/adlerlowelllec.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; about how to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western [[liberal arts]] tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included [[Robert Hutchins]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Jacques Barzun]], and [[Alexander Meiklejohn]]. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of [[higher education]] by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought.

They were at odds both with much of the existing educational establishment and with contemporary educational theory. Educational theorists like [[Sidney Hook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hook|first=Sidney|title=Education for Modern Man|year=1946|publisher=The Dial Press|location=New York, NY|url=http://www.ditext.com/hook/hook.html|authorlink=Sidney Hook|chapter=A Critical Appraisal of the St. John's College Curriculum|quote=Reprinted with some minor changes from ''[[The New Leader]]'', May 26 and June 4, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Dewey]] (''see [[pragmatism]]'') disagreed with the premise that there was [[educational crossover|crossover]] in education.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Program==
The Great Books Program is a curriculum that makes use of this list of texts. As much as possible, students rely on primary sources. The emphasis is on open discussion with limited guidance by a professor, facilitator, or tutor. Students are also expected to write papers.

In 1920, Professor Erskine taught the first course based on the "great books" program, titled "General Honors", at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=col&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beginnings of the Great Books Movement at Columbia |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/greatBooks.html |date=Winter 2001 |publisher=Columbia Magazine |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web |title= An Oasis of Order: The Core Curriculum at Columbia College:Faculty Profiles:John Erskine|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/oasis/profiles/erskine.php |date= |publisher=Columbia College |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped mold its core curriculum. It initially failed, however, shortly after its introduction due to fallings-out between the senior faculty over the best ways to conduct classes and due to concerns about the rigor of the courses. Thus junior faculty including [[Mark Van Doren]]  and [[Mortimer Adler]] after 1923, taught a part of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reconstituted. Adler left for the [[University of Chicago]] in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the University president, [[Robert M. Hutchins]], held an annual seminar of great books. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at [[St. John's College, Annapolis]], besides University of Chicago. This course later became Humanities A for freshmen, and subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities.&lt;ref name=col/&gt;  Survivors, however, include [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia's Core Curriculum]], the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at [[Boston University]], each heavily focused on the "great books" of the Western canon.

A university or college Great Books Program is a program inspired by the Great Books movement begun in the United States in the 1920s. The aim of such programs is a return to the Western [[Liberal Arts]] tradition in education, as a corrective to the extreme disciplinary specialisation common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, called the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's ''Republic'', or Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning.

There are only a few true "Great Books Programs" still in operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These schools focus almost exclusively on the Great Books Curriculum throughout enrollment and do not offer classes analogous to those commonly offered at other colleges. The first and best known of these schools is [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#Great Books program|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe (program established in 1937);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |title=St. John’s College &amp;#124; Academic Program &amp;#124; The Reading List |publisher=Stjohnscollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527090156/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/academic/readlist.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was followed by [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, the Integral Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/the-integral-program|title=The Integral Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Saint Mary's College of California (1955), [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), [[Northeast Catholic College]] in Warner, New Hampshire,  and [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Santa Paula, California. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include [[New Saint Andrews College]] in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), [[Gutenberg College]] in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), [[Harrison Middleton University]] in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), [[Wyoming Catholic College]] in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005), and [[Imago Dei College]] in Oak Glen, California (est. 2010). Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. The [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, is a highly regarded Great Books Program that operates as a separate institution within the College of Liberal Arts. [[Dharma Realm Buddhist University]] is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics.&lt;ref name="drbu.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Realm Buddhist University Accepting Applications for Undergraduate Program|url=http://www.drbu.org/news/dharma-realm-buddhist-university-accepting-applications-undergraduate-program|website=Dharma Realm Buddhist University|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Study of the Great Ideas advances the Great Conversation found in the great books by providing Adler's guidance, and resource materials through both live and on-line seminars, educational and philosophical consultation, international presence on the Internet, access to the Center's library collection of books, essays, articles, journals and audio/video programs. Center programs are unique in that they do not replicate other existing programs either started or developed by Adler.

=== Universities ===
Over 100 institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada, and Europe maintain some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casement|first=William|title=College Great Books Programs|url=http://www.coretexts.org/college-great-books-programs/#tz|publisher=The Association for Core Texts and Courses (ACTC)|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are:

==Controversy==
In contemporary scholarship, the great books curriculum was drawn into the popular debate about [[multiculturalism]], traditional education, the "culture war," and the role of the intellectual in American life. Much of this debate centered on reactions to the publication of ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'' in 1987 by [[Allan Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html John Searle, "The Storm Over the University," ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
{{main article|Great Books of the Western World}}

The ''Great Books of the Western World'' is a hardcover 60-volume collection (originally 54 volumes) of the books on the great books list (about 517 individual works). Many of the books in the collection were translated into English for the first time.{{fact|date=February 2017}} A prominent feature of the collection is a two-volume [[Syntopicon]] that includes essays written by Mortimer Adler on 102 "great ideas." Following each essay is an extensive outline of the idea with page references to relevant passages throughout the collection. Familiar to many Americans, the collection is available from [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], which owns the copyright.

Shortly after Adler retired from the [[Great Books Foundation]] in 1989, a second edition (1990) of the ''Great Books of the Western World'' was published; it included more Hispanic and female authors and, for the first time, works by black authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104001606/http://calbears.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13916438 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-04 |author=Sabrina Walters |title=Great Books won Adler fame, scorn |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as president of the Foundation, Adler had resisted such additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |author=Peter Temes |title=Death of a Great Reader and Philosopher |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2001-07-03 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012348/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010703/ai_n13917760 |archivedate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We did not base our selections on an author's nationality, religion, politics, or field of study; nor on an author's race or gender. Great books were not chosen to make up quotas of any kind; there was no "affirmative action" in the process&amp;nbsp;... we chose the great books on the basis of their relevance to at least 25 of the 102 great ideas. Many of the great books are relevant to a much larger number of the 102 great ideas, as many as 75 or more great ideas, a few to all 102 great ideas. In sharp contrast are the good books that are relevant to less than 10 or even as few as 4 or 5 great ideas. We placed such books in the lists of Recommended Readings to be found in the last section in each of the 102 chapters of the "Syntopicon". Here readers will find many twentieth-century female authors, black authors, and Latin American authors whose works we recommended but did not include in the second edition of the great books.&lt;ref name="Selecting Works for 1990 Edition"/&gt;}}
{{quote|In the course of history&amp;nbsp;... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Books – The Foundation of a Liberal Education'', New York – Simon &amp; Schuster, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
{{Main article| The Learning Channel's Great Books}}
In 1954 Mortimer Adler hosted a live weekly television series in San Francisco, comprising 52 half-hour programs, entitled ''The Great Ideas''. These programs were produced by the Institute for Philosophical Research and were carried as a public service by the [[American Broadcasting Company]], presented by National Educational Television (NET), the precursor to what is now PBS. Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatideas.org/mortimer_adler_videos/index.html|title=Mortimer Adler Videos on The Great Ideas|website=www.thegreatideas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 and 1994, The [[Learning Channel]] created a series of one-hour programs discussing many of the great books of history and their impact on the world. It was narrated by [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], amongst others.

'''Guard theory''' is a branch of [[immunology]] which concerns the innate sensing of stereotypical consequences of a [[virulence factor]] or [[pathogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Innovating immunology: an interview with Ruslan Medzhitov. Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms 2011;4(4):430-432. doi:10.1242/dmm.008151.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the classical understanding of recognition by the [[innate immune system]], which involves recognition of distinct microbial structures- [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs)- with [[pattern recognition receptor|pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)]]. Some of these stereotypical consequences of virulence factors and pathogens may include altered [[endosome|endosomal trafficking]] and changes in the [[cytoskeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Innovating immunology: an interview with Ruslan Medzhitov. Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms 2011;4(4):430-432. doi:10.1242/dmm.008151.&lt;/ref&gt; These recognition mechanisms would work to complement classical pattern recognition mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Innovating immunology: an interview with Ruslan Medzhitov. Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms 2011;4(4):430-432. doi:10.1242/dmm.008151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagan|first1=Jonathan C.|title=Common mechanisms activate plant guard receptors and TLR4|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=35|issue=10|pages=454–456|doi=10.1016/j.it.2014.08.009|pmc=4186901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==

=== In plants ===
In plants, guard theory is also known as indirect recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, Peter N., and John P. Rathjen. "Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions." Nature Reviews Genetics 11.8 (2010): 539+. Health Reference Center Academic. Web. 15 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because rather than direct recognition of a virulence factor or pathogen, there is instead recognition of the end result of a process mediated by a virulence factor or pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, Peter N., and John P. Rathjen. "Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions." Nature Reviews Genetics 11.8 (2010): 539+. Health Reference Center Academic. Web. 15 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the virulence factor appears to target an accessory protein that is either a target or a structural mimic of the target of that virulence factor,&lt;ref&gt;van der Hoorn, R. A. &amp; Kamoun, S. From guard to decoy: a new model for perception of plant pathogen effectors. Plant Cell 20, 2009-2017 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for plant defences to respond to a specific strategy of pathogenesis rather structures that may evolve and change over time at a faster rate than the plant can adapt to.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, Peter N., and John P. Rathjen. "Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions." Nature Reviews Genetics 11.8 (2010): 539+. Health Reference Center Academic. Web. 15 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between pathogen and accessory protein results in some modification of the accessory protein, which allows for recognition by plant NBS-LRR proteins, which monitor for infection.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou T, Wang Y, Chen JQ, Araki H, Jing Z, Jiang K, Shen J, Tian D: Genome-wide identification of NBS genes in japonica rice reveals significant expansion of divergent non-TIR NBS-LRR genes. Mol Genet Genomics 2004, 271:402-415.&lt;/ref&gt; This model is best illustrated by RIN4 protein in A. thaliana.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, Peter N., and John P. Rathjen. "Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions." Nature Reviews Genetics 11.8 (2010): 539+. Health Reference Center Academic. Web. 15 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; RIN4 forms a complex with the NB-LRR proteins RPM1 and RPS2.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, D., Holt, B. F., Wiig, A. &amp; Dangl, J. L. RIN4 interacts with Pseudomonas syringae type 111 effector molecules and is required for RPM1-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Cell 108, 743-754 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, D., Belkhadir, Y., Alonso, J. M., Ecker, J. R. &amp; Dangl, J. Arabidopsis RIN4 is a target of the type 111 virulence effector AvrRpt2 and modulates RPS2-mediated resistance. Cell 112, 379-389 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Protease effector AvrRpt2 is able to degrade RIN4, causing de-repression of RPS2.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, D., Holt, B. F., Wiig, A. &amp; Dangl, J. L. RIN4 interacts with Pseudomonas syringae type 111 effector molecules and is required for RPM1-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Cell 108, 743-754 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, AvrB or AvrRPM1-mediated phosphorylation of RIN4 results in activation of RPM1.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, D., Belkhadir, Y., Alonso, J. M., Ecker, J. R. &amp; Dangl, J. Arabidopsis RIN4 is a target of the type 111 virulence effector AvrRpt2 and modulates RPS2-mediated resistance. Cell 112, 379-389 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In short, this example elucidates how one NBS-LRR protein is able to recognize the effects of more than one virulence factor or effector.&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, Peter N., and John P. Rathjen. "Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions." Nature Reviews Genetics 11.8 (2010): 539+. Health Reference Center Academic. Web. 15 Dec. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guard defences in humans and relationship with allergies ==
Little is known concerning guard receptors in humans. One example currently under speculation involves recognition of [[cysteine protease]]s secreted by [[helminths]] during infection.&lt;ref&gt;Capron M, Trottein F (eds): Parasites and Allergy. Chem Immunol Allergy. Basel, Karger, 2006, vol 90, pp 45-64  (DOI:10.1159/000088880)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that some allergies develop as a result of structural similarities between the allergen and high-activity cysteine proteases secreted by helminths during their infectious cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Innovating immunology: an interview with Ruslan Medzhitov. Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms 2011;4(4):430-432. doi:10.1242/dmm.008151.&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed mechanism by which this may take place is that proteases secreted by the helminths cleave proteins which act as detectors, and these detectors in turn activate sensors to alert the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;Innovating immunology: an interview with Ruslan Medzhitov. Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms 2011;4(4):430-432. doi:10.1242/dmm.008151.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'Herkogamy''' is a common strategy employed by hermaphroditic [[angiosperms]] to reduce sexual interference between male ([[anthers]]) and female (stigma) function. Herkogamy differs from other such strategies (e.g. [[dichogamy]]) by supplying a spatial separation of the anthers and stigma.

Two forms of herkogamy are most common:

1.  '''Approach Herkogamy''' – (pin) is the presentation of the stigma above the level of the anthers.  This arrangement of sex organs causes floral visitors to first contact the stigma, before removing [[pollen]] from the anthers.  This form of herkogamy is considered to be common, and is associated with a large, diverse fauna of floral visitors/[[pollinator]]s.

2.  '''Reverse Herkogamy''' – (thrum) is displayed when the stigma is recessed below the level of the anthers.  This arrangement causes floral visitors to first contact the anthers before the stigma.  For this reason, reverse herkogamy is believed to facilitate greater pollen export than approach herkogamy.  This type of sex-organ arrangement is typically associated with [[Lepidopteran]] (moth or butterfly) pollination.

'''Inis Beag''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: "Little Island") is a remote island off the coast of [[Connemara]], [[Ireland]], near the [[Aran Islands]]. It contains a small, isolated [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking]] [[Catholic]] community which  [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] John Cowan Messenger observed in the 1960s, leading to several longer treatises, including "Inis Beag: Isle of Ireland" and "Sex and Repression in an Irish Folk Community". During the period of his study between 1958 and 1966, Inis Beag supported a population of around 350, mostly living by [[subsistence farming]] and fishing. The name "Inis Beag" is a name made up by researchers to protect the privacy of the island's people. Its true identity is [[Inisheer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D01tBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22inis%20beag%22%20inisheer&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Rural Community Studies in Europe | publisher=Pergamon Press | year=1981 | pages=88 | quote=Inis Beag – a fictional name for Inisheer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVmjCLpjCr0C&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22inis%20beag%22%20inisheer%20-wikipedia&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Locating Irish Folklore: Tradition, Modernity, Identity | author=Ó Giolláin, Diarmuid | year=2000 | pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nativism ==

Messenger used his study to discuss the pitfalls and advantages of [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] as it applied to the folk people of the island. After seven centuries of [[Republic_of_Ireland#Revolution_and_steps_to_independence|English occupation]], a movement of Irish patriots promoted what they saw as the essential elements of Irish identity, including language and religion. This led to many researchers, tourists, and authors holding up Inis Beag and the surrounding areas as examples of true Irish identity. According to Messenger, the island was the subject of a great many works he described as "romanticized," focusing on cultural forms that outsiders found attractive. These included "the traditional garb of the folk, their skill in rowing the famed canoe, called [[Currach|''curach'']], the manner in which they manufacture soils and grow in them a variety of crops, and their Gaelic speech."&lt;ref name="Isle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messenger|first1=John|title=Inis Beag: Isle of Ireland|date=1983|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Prospect Heights, Illinois|isbn=0-88133-051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messenger was critical of the attitude of outsiders towards the purity of these customs. He found that 11 of the 111 adult males and 9 of the 85 adult females had given up the traditional local garb for imported styles from the mainland. This behavior was especially prevalent among the younger women, with no adherents between the ages of 18 and 29. {{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=43}} He also found that use of the local [[Currach|''curach'']] had declined in recent decades, from 30 to 50 three-man crews fishing nearly all year in the early 1900s to nine crews working from the island in 1960.{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=38}} And despite the nativist opinion of the region's Gaelic, in his visit to the island, Messenger found that essentially all of the islanders older than eight spoke [[English language|English]] proficiently, mixed English regularly into their speech, and even confessed to their priests in English. He attributed the rise in English to a practical view of language; many young people emigrate and would be disadvantaged by speaking only Gaelic.{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=6}}

== Sexuality ==

Messenger's study of this community has often been cited by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[sexology|sexologists]] as an example of extreme [[sexual repression]]. He reported that Inis Beag had no formal [[sex education]], and [[sexual intercourse]] was treated by both sexes and the local [[curate]] as a "duty" which must be "endured."{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}} Messenger proposed that the early replacement of physical affection with verbal affection—by the time a child can walk—led to institutionalized repression of sexual conduct. As he put it, "any forms of direct or indirect [[sexual expression]]—[[masturbation]], mutual exploration of bodies, use of either standard or slang words relating to sex, and open [[urination]] and [[defecation]]—are punished severely by word and deed."{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}} Children were separated by gender in almost all activities. Islanders tended to bathe only the hands, face, and feet and developed an "obsessive fear" of nudity early in life. In some households, "dogs [were] whipped for licking their genitals and soon [learned] to indulge in this behavior outside when unobserved."{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}}&lt;ref name=margolis&gt;Jonathan Margolis, "O: The intimate history of the orgasm", 2003. P219&lt;/ref&gt; The repressive atmosphere, according to the researchers, led to high levels of [[masturbation]], [[alcoholism|drinking]], and alcohol-fueled fights.&lt;ref name=margolis /&gt; And, of course, repression of sexuality also manifested in intercourse. Elders of the island boasted that there was no premarital sex, although some young men did admit to it in rumor. When couples did have sex with each other, as reported to Messenger, the husband always initiated, the wife was commonly passive, couples left their underclothes only partially removed and used only the [[missionary position|male superior position]], and when the man orgasmed, he fell asleep almost immediately.{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}}

The folk of the island behaved so strangely because informal and formal social control left them ignorant. Phenomena such as [[menstruation]] and [[menopause]] were regarded with profound misgivings because of extreme ignorance. Perplexed women asked Messenger's wife about the female cycle more than any other question about sex phenomena. Young women were often traumatized by [[menarche]], and at least three older women had, in 1960, confined themselves entirely to bed to avoid a potential "madness" induced by menopause.{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}} Women sent their children out of the room when Messenger's wife would inquire about their pregnancies. Men were also grossly ignorant in regards to sex. Female [[orgasm]] was unknown to the men, not experienced by the women, or shunned and hidden. Messenger reported that one middle-aged bachelor who considered himself "wise in the ways of the outside world . . . described the violent bodily reactions of a girl to his fondling" and when Messenger explained, he "admitted not knowing that women also could achieve climax."{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}} Men of the island thought [[sexual intercourse]] would weaken them, and would abstain the night before an exhausting task. Despite all this, Messenger could not report a single family that was childless due to ignorance, a phenomenon in some other regions of Ireland. When Messenger inquired how newly-married couples learned how to [[copulate]], he was told that "after marriage, nature takes its course."{{sfn|Messenger|date=1983|p=108-110}}

The '''Iran Research Institute of Philosophy''' ('''IRIP''') ([[Persian language|Persian]]: مؤسسه پژوهشی حکمت و فلسفه ایران) is a [[Public university|Public]] research institute in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

==History==

In September 1974, [[Farah Pahlavi|Farah Pahlavi Empress of Iran]] commissioned her personal secretary [[Hossein Nasr]], Head of the Empress's Private Bureau, to establish and lead the Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p61&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first academic institution to be founded upon the principles of philosophical [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]]. Nasr was a Professor of History of Science and Philosophy at [[University of Tehran]] who also served for several years as President of [[Sharif University of Technology]] in Iran.

[[William Chittick]], who is a renowned scholar of [[Sufi]] thought, literature, and Islamic philosophy, completed his PhD in Persian literature at Tehran University in 1974. He then taught comparative religion at the Humanities Department at Sharif University and left Iran just before the revolution in 1979. He was also for a short period before the revolution an assistant professor at it. He has also served as assistant editor of ''Encyclopædia Iranica'' and is currently professor of Religious Studies at the [[State University of New York]] at [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]]. Chittick has had collaborations with Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Allameh Tabatabaei on several projects.

Of particular interest is the example of [[English Wikipedia]] and [[research ethics]].&lt;ref name="blogP2P"&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/wikipedia-and-research-ethics/2009/10/30 O'Neil, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The usual view is that private and public spaces become blurred on the Internet.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/utis/1996/00000012/00000002/art00003 King, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cddc.vt"&gt;[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/aoir/ethics/private/4S13.pdf Bakardjieva &amp; Feenberg, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of objections to this stance, which are all relevant to English Wikipedia research.&lt;ref name="blogP2P"/&gt;&lt;ref name="routledge2"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/utis/1996/00000012/00000002/art00006 Herring, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it can be difficult for researchers to ensure participant anonymity.&lt;ref name=Dawson2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Phillip|title=Our anonymous online research participants are not always anonymous: Is this a problem?|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/bjet.12144|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12144/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of 112 published educational technology research papers was able to identify participant identities in 10 of those papers; the majority of these studies had gathered this data under conditions of anonymity.&lt;ref name=Dawson2014 /&gt;

Language management is a discipline that consists of satisfying the needs of people who speak multiple different  languages. These may be in the same country, in companies, and in cultural or  international institutions where one must use multiple languages.

==Cultural Diversity and Multilingualism==
There are currently about 6000 languages in the world, 85 of which are protected by sovereign states.
The universal declaration of UNESCO on cultural diversity in 2001 recalls the richness of global cultural heritage, which comes from its cultural diversity:
"This intangible cultural heritage, passed down from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups according to their environment, their interaction with nature, and their history, and brings a feeling of identity and of continuity, thus contributing to the promotion of respect of cultural diversity and human creativity."
The declaration of Montreal in 2007 repeated this concern.
UNESCO organized a conference on "Multilingualism for Cultural Diversity and Participation of All in Cyberspace" in Bamako, Mali, on May 6 and 7, 2005, in partnership with the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), and the Government of Mali, as well as other international organizations.
UNESCO is otherwise responsible for the introduction of the concept of intangible cultural heritage, which manages the cultural heritage in terms of its information support.

For example, text and images associated with the Louvre museum in France are part of the intangible cultural heritage, and it goes without saying that the diversity of the visitors requires the management of text in several languages.
This meeting aimed to prepare the second phase of the World Summit of the Society of Information (held in Tunis, Tunisia, 16 to 18 of November 2005).
The other part, the phenomenon of globalization produces exchanges which requires the management of different languages at the nodes of interconnection (airports, parking lots, ...).
The Internet, finally, produces commercial exchanges indifferent to linguistic frontiers, and virtual communities, like Wikipedia, are where the participants speaking different languages can dialog and exchange information and knowledge.

==Language Policy==
International institutions, governments, and firms are faced with language management needs.

=== International institutions ===
In international institutions, languages can have different statutes: Official language or work language.

===European Union States===

Plenty of states have multiple official languages in their territory:

This is the case:

in Belgium (Dutch, French, German)

in Switzerland (German, French, Italian, Romansch)

in Canada (French and English)

in numerous African countries, and

in Luxembourg (French, German, Luxembourgish)

In France, where many regional languages exist, especially in the regions on the border (cross-border languages) and in Brittany (Breton) none of them have official status.
Therefore, a certain number of states have put linguistic policies in place.
On a larger scale, the European Union has also defined a linguistic policy, which distinguishes 23 official languages.

=== Impact on School ===
Upon entrance to school, children of diverse cultures are forced to abandon their cultural roots and their mother tongues, to the benefit of the normative language chosen by the school. Research has shown that school, by acting to transmit a country's norms, contributes to the destruction of diversity, can even create in certain children a rejection of their mother language that is shown to be the cause of their learning difficulties.

=== Historic methods of introducing languages ===

== Businesses ==

Many international enterprises are bringing about, in a strategic move toward internationalization, changing the language of work in all or part of their activities.   In an immense majority of cases, the chosen language is English called the 'lingua franca" or vehicular language.   The language of home (mother tongue) is keeping a definite importance in the direction of this lingua franca.   A great number of documents are coming to be published in English. which can become official language in certain meetings, teleconferences, or video conferences.

This poses obvious questions of language management.   How are workers educated in a new language for work in the case that English is not an official language of the country where they find themselves assigned?   What is the pertinence of imposing a foreign language on workers in a company, in the measure of usage of this language as part of their competence and effect on their productivity.   What is the economic equation to resolve between, on one had, the benefits (which may be more important) teased away for the internationalization and the ill-effects of this internationalization plus the level playing field of language, and unforeseen ill-effects which may well be present and the potentially high costs: cost of inefficiency, cost of translation, and cost of professional education.

Language management in organizations has been found to have instrumental consequences as well as identity related consequences (Lauring, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Lauring, J. 2008. Rethinking social identity theory in international encounters: Language use as a negotiated object for identity making. [[International Journal of Cross Cultural Management]], 8(3): 343-361.&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental benefits from language management and the use of a common organizational language could be related to easier access to documents and a generally better communication flow in the organization. However, the use of a common language can also provide a positive indication of inclusion to linguistic minorities. Thereby language management can help to reduce language based feeling of us versus them between different language communities. Some studies have also found negative consequences of using a common language (Marschan-Piekkari, Welch, &amp; Welch, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Marschan-Piekkari, R., Welch, D., &amp; Welch, L. 1999. In the shadow: The impact of language on structure, power and communication in the multinational. International Business Review, 8: 421–440.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using a common language may distort the normal power structure of an organization (Neeley, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Marschan-Piekkari, R., Welch, D., &amp; Welch, L. 1999. In the shadow: The impact of language on structure, power and communication in the multinational. International Business Review, 8: 421–440.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that speaking in a second language can be highly demanding for organization members cause strain on the individual (Volk, Köhler, &amp; Pudelko, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Volk, S., Köhler, T., &amp; Pudelko, M. 2014. Brain drain: The cognitive neuroscience of foreign language processing in multinational corporations. Journal of International Business Studies, 45(7): 862-885.&lt;/ref&gt; Language management has been found to work differently in face-to-face settings compared to virtual teams (Klitmøller &amp; Lauring, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Klitmøller, A., &amp; Lauring, J. 2013. When global virtual teams share knowledge: Media richness, cultural distance and language commonality. Journal of World Business, 48(3): 398–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MSL degree requirements may include some business/management courses that are required in an MBA program. However, this degree program concentrates heavily on leader-follower interactions, cross-cultural communications, coaching, influencing, team development, leading organizational changes, strategic thinking,  [[project leader]]ship, and behavioral motivation theories. It does not concentrate on financial or quantitative analysis, [[marketing]], or [[accounting]] which are common in MBA programs. The degree program is appealing to businesspeople in well-established careers already. The MSL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Organizational Leadership]] (MSOL) degree or the Master of Leadership Sciences degree offered by the [[National School of Leadership]] in India.

The '''Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics''' ('''RIDC NeuroMat''', or simply '''NeuroMat''') is a Brazilian research center established in 2013 at the [[University of São Paulo]] that is dedicated to integrating [[mathematical modeling]] and [[theoretical neuroscience]]. Among the core missions of NeuroMat are the creation of a new mathematical system to understanding neural data and the development of neuroscientific open-source computational tools, keeping an active role under the context of open knowledge, open science and scientific dissemination. The research center is headed by Prof. [[Antonio Galves]], from USP's Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, and is funded by the [[São Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP). Other names related to NeuroMat are the co-principal investigators [[Pablo Ferrari]] and [[Yoshiharu Kohayakawa]]; [[Béla Bollobás]], [[Michael Merzenich]] and [[Wojciech Szpankowski]] as members of the International Advisory Board and also [[Ernst W. Hamburger]], the former director of scientific dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bv.fapesp.br/pt/auxilios/58573/centro-de-pesquisa-inovacao-e-difusao-em-neuromatematica-neuromat/|title=Centro de Pesquisa, Inovação e Difusão em Neuromatemática - NeuroMat|last=|first=|date=|website=Biblioteca Virtual da FAPESP|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
NeuroMat has been involved in the development of what has been called the [[Galves-Löcherbach model]], a model with intrinsic stochasticity for biological neural nets, in which the probability of a future spike depends on the evolution of the complete system since the last spike.[1] This model of spiking neurons was developed by mathematicians Antonio Galves and Eva Löcherbach. In the first article on the model, in 2013, they called it a model of a "system with interacting stochastic chains with memory of variable length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">'''The northern riverine forest''' is a type of forest ecology most dominant along waterways in the northeastern and north-central [[United States]] and bordering areas of [[Canada]]. Key species include [[willow]], [[elm]], [[American sycamore]], [[Trillium undulatum|painted trillium]], [[Coptis|goldthread]], [[Common wood sorrel|common wood-sorrel]], [[Cypripedium acaule|pink lady's-slipper]], [[Aralia nudicaulis|wild sarsaparilla]], and [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/publications_maps/AWWBroc/AWW13.html|title=FORESTS AND FLOWERS|last=|first=|date=|website=Maine.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the distinct ecosystems is the Riverine Forest. These are found on the lower flood plains along the rivers edge. The main species found here is one of the deciduous species; the [[Populus balsamifera|Balsam Poplar]]. These trees like a high volume of moisture and are able to tolerate flooding. They are distinguishable by their thick, gnarly bark and their larger, pointed leaves. These leaves have a distinct drip tip. The trees supply homes for the many native species of fauna. 

Other Key trees include [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]], [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]], [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]], [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]], [[white pine]], [[Pinus resinosa|red pine]], [[Quercus rubra|northern red oak]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], and [[Picea rubens|red spruce]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Key shrubs include [[Acer pensylvanicum|striped maple]] and [[Viburnum lantanoides|hobblebush]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Northwest A&amp;F University''' ('''NWAFU''', A&amp;F referring to Agriculture and Forestry; [[simplified Chinese]]: 西北农林科技大学; [[pinyin]]: Xīběi Nónglín Kējì Dàxué; [[traditional Chinese]]: 西北農林科技大學), is a national key university located in [[Yangling Agricultural Hi-tech Industries Demonstration Zone]], [[Shaanxi Province]], [[P.R.China]]. The university has an old and abandoned name called  Northwest Sci-tech University of Agriculture and Forestry, NWSUAF for short, which is still kept in the [[domain name]] of the university's official website. A&amp;F is included in the [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University Plan]] by [[China's Ministry of Education]] (totally 42 universities were included in this plan) .&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Northwest A&amp;F University can be dated back to 1934 when '''''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''''' (simplified Chinese: 国立西北农林专科学校; traditional Chinese: 國立西北農林專科學校) was established by Ministry of Education, [[Republic of China]] based on an act drafted by [[Dai Jitao]], General [[Yang Hucheng]] and [[Yu Youren]] in 1932. This was the first national senior college with speciality on agriculture field in the north-west of China and was also the only independent senior college of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhshw.nwsuaf.edu.cn/show.php?articleid=752 Interview of NWAFU's Student Admission Office in 2008(Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yangling, where the university is located, is believed as the birthplace of [[Houji]], [[Agriculture (Chinese mythology)|God of Abundant Harvests]],&lt;ref&gt;Roberts. ''Chinese Mythology A to Z'', 2nd Ed, p.70. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and is the area where he taught people how to grow and harvest cereals. Since 1934, 7 academic institutions or universities resided here gradually and it is reputable as Town of Agriculture Sciences. Many achievements have been made by university, such as wheat cultivars Biman 1 (by [[:zh:赵洪璋|Zhao, Hongzhang]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsc.nwsuaf.edu.cn/show.php?id=2386 Introduction of Zhao Hongzhang and Bima 1(in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Xiaoyan 6 (by [[Li Zhensheng (geneticist)|Li, Zhensheng]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kepu.net.cn/gb/special/2009_kpday/tstj/tstj19_02.html Introduction of Xiaoyan 6 (in Chinese)]&lt;/ref&gt; which were dominant wheat cultivars in [[Yellow River]]-[[Huai River]] Wheat Growth Area and significantly increased wheat quality and yield. The Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government proposed to merge the 7 scientific organizations to 1 new University and finally get approved by [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] in 1999, thus establishing Northwest A&amp;F University.

The university expanded rapidly and has Top 3 research and teaching quality in China's agriculture universities&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.qq.com/a/20120416/000438.htm 武书连2012中国大学农学排行榜&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of "[[Project 985]]" club which is an organization of 39 reputable universities in China. Northwest A&amp;F University's research achievements are dominant in the fields of agriculture biology including [[wheat]] breeding, [[entomology]], agriculture resource management,  [[horticulture]], plant protection, [[food science]] (especially in [[Enology]]), [[forestry]] and [[veterinary]]. Besides, the university is also reputable in agricultural [[water conservancy]], [[agriculture economics]] and management, agriculture mechanics and [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] and ancient agricultural [[history]] research.The university has an annual income of around [[RMB]] 1.72 billion (around £172 million) in 2011,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwsuaf.edu.cn/jycgz/30098.htm “回顾五年办学成就，迎接党的十八大召开”系列报道之（九）资源保障与办学支撑条件显著改善&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2013, the university has 1661 teachers and 28964 students.&lt;ref name="2012-2013学年初学校基本数据"&gt;[http://www.nwafu.edu.cn/xxgk/xqtj/index.htm  2012-2013学年初学校基本数据]&lt;/ref&gt;

Northwest A&amp;F University provides courses covering [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[engineering]], [[natural science]], [[medicine]], [[management]] and [[economy]] etc. to both native and [[international students]]. These courses are provided by 23 academic [[colleges]]. Students can choose one college to register and pursue their honour degrees at different levels including [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]], [[Master's degree|Master]] and [[PhD]]. [[Studentship]] and [[scholarship]] from [[governments]] and [[organizations]] are available to help students finish their studies.

==Brief history==

=== Origins and re-organization ===
Northwest A&amp;F University was established on September 11, 1999 by merging 5 scientific research institutions and 2 universities in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, namely
# '''[[Institute]] of [[Soil conservation|Soil]] and [[Water Conservation]], [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]''',
# '''Institute of [[Hydrology|Water Resource Sciences]] (Northwest China)''', '''[[Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Water Resources]] of China'''
# '''[[Shaanxi]] [[Academy]] of Agricultural Sciences'''
# '''Shaanxi Academy of [[Forestry]]'''
# '''Institute of [[Botany]] (Northwest China), [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[Shaanxi Province]]'''
# '''Northwest Agricultural University''' and
# '''Northwest Forestry College'''.
The 7 members involved in re-organization were very close to each other historically. '''Northwest Agricultural University''' has the biggest area and the longest history out of 7 members and are the origin of '''Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China)''' and '''Northwest Forestry College'''. Her history can be dated back to 1934(Year 23 in [[Minguo calendar]]) when '''''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''''' (the predecessor of Northwest Agricultural University) was founded by the Senior Politician of [[Kuomintang]] Mr. [[Yu Youren]], Kuomintang veteran member [[Dai Jitao]], Kuomintang General [[Yang Hucheng]] .In 1937 and 1938, the Senior College merged with College of Agriculture of National Northwest Associated University and Department of Animal Husbandry in College of Agriculture of National [[Henan University]] (河南大学) respectively, then was renamed as National Northwest Agricultural College. Meanwhile, Department of Water Conservancy of National [[Lanzhou University]] （兰州大学） joined the College. Following the establishment of P.R.China in 1949, "National" was deleted from the College name although it remains a government funded academic school. In 1952, Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy was partially given to [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]] （西安交通大学） under the order of The State Council. 2 years later, the remained Department of Agricultural Water Conservancy became an independent academic institution which is the mold of '''Institute of Water Resource Sciences (Northwest China)'''. In 1979, '''Northwest Forestry College''' came out to be an independent school from Department of Forestry in Northwest Agricultural College. In 1985, with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery, the University name changed to be '''Northwest Agricultural University'''.&lt;br /&gt;
Other institutions have relatively shorter history. Institute of Botany (Northwest China) became an independent academy from '''Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Chinese Academy of Sciences''' (founded in 1956) in 1965. In 1980, '''[[Shaanxi]] Academy of Forestry''' got separated from '''Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences''' (founded in 1952).

The State Council agreed to merge 7 organizations as new Northwest A&amp;F University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/xxgk/pub/govpublic/mrlm/201011/t20101114_62708.html Official decision on establishing new A&amp;F, from State Council]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a reply to the proposal drafted by Ministry of Education and Shaanxi Province Government. A financial budget of 600,000,000 RMB was granted as start fund and further investment plan as well as related issue such as reshuffle were also briefly stated in this official reply. On 11 September 1999, a central government delegation led by Vice Premier [[Li Lanqing]] attended the opening ceremony and made the announcement.

== Campus and students life ==
[[Image:WP 20150421 006.jpg|thumb|left|Office Building, '''South Campus''']]
[[Image:WP 20150422 095.jpg|thumb|NO.3 Teaching Building, '''North Campus'''. The name of '''National Northwest Senior College of Agriculture and Forestry''', written by [[Dai Jitao]], is still readable after around 80 years.]]
The University urban area is around 3.94&amp;nbsp;km², covering two main campuses: '''North Campus''' and '''South Campus'''. Besides, Institute of Water and Soil Conservation, College of Food Science and Engineering and College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering have their own independent campuses for administrative affairs and research respectively. A 3D virtual campus map of A&amp;F has been generated and visitors can have a virtual tour around A&amp;F campuses on '''http://3dmap.nwsuaf.edu.cn'''.

[[Image:WP 20150423 048.jpg|thumb|left|Inside view of Science and Research Building, South Campus]]
Generally, '''South Campus''' hosts study and living facilities for senior undergraduates from College of Agriculture, College of Horticulture, College of Forestry, College of Water Resources and Architectural Engineering, College of Resource and Environment and College of Economics and Management. All students from International School, most of postgraduates, undergraduates from Department of Arts (Landscape Arts Design) and all students from College of Vocational and Adult Education also live and study in South Campus.

[[Image:WP 20150422 127.jpg|thumb|right|Agriculture Science Building, South Campus. This magnificent building will be used as labs by 4 agriculture science-related academic colleges.]]
Although '''North Campus''' is mainly for undergraduates of other colleges, some postgraduates move to North Campus for their research since they become the 2nd year students. On South Campus, Agriculture Science Building, Social Science Building, new apartments as well as students facilities are under construction now. Study and living environment will be greatly improved when these buildings are available. Besides, A&amp;F provides vehicles (small bus) to ferry students and staff between South Campus and North Campus on a daily schedule.

[[Image:WP 20150421 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Gate of Museums Garden, South Campus]]
The [[Museum]] Garden (a collection of 5 museums including [[insects]], [[animals]], [[plants]], [[soil]] and China's agricultural history) is located beside South Campus. The Insects Museum holds the most extensive collection of [[butterflies]] in China's Universities. This garden is also the greatest Agriculture-themed museum area in China. Besides its teaching role for A&amp;F students, this garden is also serving as a popular science centre in Shaanxi Province and attracts thousands of visitors especially young students every year.
[[Image:WP 20150422 002.jpg|thumb|Entomology Museum, South Campus]]

A&amp;F provides convenient [[sports facilities]] to staff and students. Across the campuses, there are 12 [[tennis courts]], 1 indoor [[stadium]], 2 outdoor stadiums, 1 [[arena]] for [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]], 2 outdoor [[swimming pools]], 48 outdoor [[basketball courts]], 28 outdoor [[volleyball court]]s, several [[Badminton|badminton courts]] and 143 outdoor tables for [[Table tennis|Ping-Pong]]. Tennis is popular across the campus and tennis championships are held every year. A&amp;F also supports College Students Basketball and Volleyball Team to gain reputation in CUBA ([[Chinese University Basketball Association]]) and CUVA (Chinese University Volleyball Association). 
[[Image:WP 20150422 004.jpg|thumb|left|Indoor Stadium, South Campus]]
[[Image:WP 20150422 068.jpg|thumb|right|Swimming Pool, South Campus]]
The university library was initially launched in 1934 and got extended in 1999 when new A&amp;F was established. In both North and South Campus, the well equipped air-conditioning system in the library makes it a popular site for students' study, especially in summer. A training centre for engineering in North Campus provides engineering courses and practices to all undergraduates, especially students majored at mechanics and electronics. At the heart of North Campus stands the tallest building of A&amp;F, the ten-storey NO. 8 Teaching Building. Along with its 12 subsidiary great lecture halls, they serve as the teaching centre in North Campus. 
[[Image:WP 20150423 013.jpg|thumb|left|Library, South Campus]]

[[Chefs]] in 11 [[cafeterias]] scattered in the 2 main campuses cook breakfast, lunch and supper to students and staff every day in each term. However, the cafeterias are usually very busy and crowded at dining time. Among these cafeterias, 2 [[Muslim]] cafeterias&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.nwsuaf.edu.cn/houqinxinwen/uploadfile/201105/20110509031623183.jpg One Muslim cafeterias in North Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; are specially built to cater for the needs of Muslim group. Food safety in these cafeterias is seriously controlled to provide good quality food. Campus Card (a campus identity card which acts like a Debit card to facilitate payment across campuses) is needed to buy food in all cafeterias but cash is also accepted.

Totally 48 [[dorm]] buildings are available for students. For Chinese students, 4 or 6 students share 1 bedroom&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.nwsuaf.edu.cn/houqinxinwen/uploadfile/201008/20100831063710934.jpg Typical Chinese Students Dorms]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[international students]] live in single or double bedroom equipped with [[bathroom]] and [[toilet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csc.edu.cn/laihua/universityAccommodation.aspx?collegeId=69 International Students Dorms in NWAFU]&lt;/ref&gt;(the price is much higher). Air conditioning in all students dormitories will be available since summer of 2015. As a part of International A&amp;F project, new apartments for international students and foreign experts will be ready since 2015. All apartments and dormitories are centrally heated in winter from 15 November to 15 March next year.

Campus events are usually hold in Xiu-Shan Students Venue Centre in North and South Campus. Xiu-Shan was named after Xiu-Shan Zhu, the father of a Taiwanese entrepreneur Yinglong Zhu who endowed NWAFU. Now, Xiu-Shan Students Venue is an important place for campus events such as [[exhibition]], [[concert]], [[Festival|gala]] and conferences.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer security:

'''[[Computer security]]''' &amp;ndash; [[security]] applied to computing devices such as [[computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s, as well as [[computer network]]s such as private and public networks, including the whole [[Internet]].  The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance in line with the increasing reliance on computer systems of most societies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/opinion/reliance-spells-end-of-road-for-ict-amateurs/story-e6frgb0o-1226636267865?nk=34fe4ab684629535daaf6a8fe6e6ef3d "Reliance spells end of road for ICT amateurs"], May 07, 2013, The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; Computer security includes measures taken to ensure the integrity of files stored on a computer or server as well as measures taken to prevent unauthorized access to stored data, by [[physical security|securing the physical perimeter]] of the computer equipment, authentication of users or computer accounts accessing the data, and providing a secure method of data transmission.

== Essence of computer security ==
Computer security can be described as all of the following:

* a branch of [[security]]

== Areas of computer security ==
* [[Access control]] &amp;ndash; selective restriction of access to a place or other resource. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
:* [[Computer access control]] &amp;ndash; includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit.
:::[[Authentication]]
::::* [[Knowledge-based authentication]]
:::::* [[Integrated Windows Authentication]]
::::* [[Password]]
:::::* [[Password length parameter]]
:::::* [[Secure Password Authentication]]
:::* [[Secure Shell]]
:::* [[Kerberos (protocol)]]
:::* [[SPNEGO]]
:::* [[NTLMSSP]]
:::* [[AEGIS SecureConnect]]
:::* [[TACACS]]
* [[Cyber security and countermeasure]]
* [[Device fingerprint]]
** [[Physical security]] &amp;ndash; protecting property and people from damage or harm (such as from theft, espionage, or terrorist attacks). It includes security measures designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, (such as a computer room), equipment (such as your computer), and resources (like the data storage devices, and data, in your computer). If a computer gets stolen, then the data goes with it. In addition to theft, physical access to a computer allows for ongoing espionage, like the installment of a [[hardware keylogger]] device, and so on.
* [[Data security]] &amp;ndash; protecting data, such as a database, from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.&lt;ref name="Summers, G. 2004 p4-5"&gt;Summers, G. (2004). Data and databases.  In: Koehne, H Developing Databases with Access: Nelson Australia Pty Limited. p4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Information privacy]] &amp;ndash; relationship between collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public [[expectation of privacy]], and the legal and political issues surrounding them. Privacy concerns exist wherever [[personally identifiable information]] or other sensitive information is collected and stored – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues.
** [[Internet privacy]] &amp;ndash; involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Privacy can entail either Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors relate to a specific person.
* [[Mobile security]] &amp;ndash; security pertaining to smartphones, especially with respect to the personal and business information stored on them.
* [[Network security]] &amp;ndash; provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.
** [[Network Security Toolkit]]
** [[Internet security]] &amp;ndash; computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.

== Computer security threats ==

The variety of threats combined with the rapid development of new threats has made cyber insecurity and the removal of information assurance the 'status quo'.  As long as man continues to use the computer, man will also takes interest in manipulating, modifying, creating and bypassing 'rules' and 'security standards.' 

The most common and effective method of violating computer security protocols is Phishing; Phishing is the process of providing a cloned login page for a site the victim uses, for example, Google's Gmail - once the user enters his/her login information, the data is captured and access to the victims account is gained. 

Many corporations executive's, mid-ranking managers and even low level staff of many current U.S. corporations have no idea that a malicious user is quietly and passively intercepting their communications. Why? A strong motivation is the theft of Intellectual Property. Often victims of phishing either never become aware there privacy has been breached, or many months pass before they become aware that their privacy has been lost.  &lt;ref&gt;Kristopher Richey&lt;/ref&gt;

* Computer malfunction &amp;ndash; 
** [[Operating system]] failure and vulnerabilities
** [[Hard disk drive failure]] &amp;ndash; occurs when a hard disk drive malfunctions and the stored information cannot be accessed with a properly configured computer. A disk failure may occur in the course of normal operation, or due to an external factor such as exposure to fire or water or high magnetic fields, or suffering a sharp impact or environmental contamination, which can lead to a head crash.  Data recovery from a failed hard disk is problematic and expensive. Backups are essential 
* [[Computer and network surveillance]] &amp;ndash; 
** [[Man-in-the-middle attack|Man in the Middle]]
** Loss of anonymity &amp;ndash; when one's identity becomes known. Identification of people or their computers allows their activity to be tracked.  For example, when a person's name is matched with the IP address they are using, their activity can be tracked thereafter by monitoring the IP address.
*** [[HTTP Cookie]]
**** [[Local Shared Object]]
**** [[Web bug]]
*** [[Spyware]]
****[[Adware]]
** [[Cyber spying]] &amp;ndash; obtaining secrets without the permission of the holder of the information (personal, sensitive, proprietary or of classified nature), from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage using methods on the Internet, networks or individual computers through the use of cracking techniques and malicious software including Trojan horses and spyware. It may be done online from by professionals sitting at their computer desks on bases in far away countries, or it may involve infiltration at home by computer trained conventional spies and moles, or it may be the criminal handiwork of amateur malicious hackers, software programmers, or thieves.
*** [[Eavesdropping#Techniques|Computer and network eavesdropping]]
**** [[Lawful Interception]]
**** [[War Driving]]
**** [[Packet analyzer]] (aka packet sniffer) &amp;ndash; mainly used as a security tool (in many ways, including for the detection of network intrusion attempts), packet analyzers can also be used for spying, to collect sensitive information (e.g., login details, cookies, personal communications) sent through a network, or to reverse engineer proprietary protocols used over a network. One way to protect data sent over a network such as the Internet is by using [[encryption software]].
* [[Cyberwarfare]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploit]] &amp;ndash; piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service attack.
** [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]]
** [[Computer virus]]
** [[Computer worm]]
** [[Denial-of-service attack]] &amp;ndash; an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users, usually consisting of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet.  One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable.
*** [[Distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS) &amp;ndash; DoS attack sent by two or more persons.
* [[Hacking tool]]
* [[Malware]]
[HID Spoofing keylogger] 
** [[Computer virus]]

** [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]]
* [[Data loss]] &amp;ndash;
** [[File deletion]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Data loss prevention software]]
* [[Natural disasters]] &amp;ndash; fire, flood, etc. can cause loss of computers and data. Either fire or water can cause a hard disk drive failure, for example. Earthquakes can cause a data center to go down. For this reason large web businesses  use [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[failover]] techniques to ensure [[business continuity]].
* [[Payload (computing)|Payload]] - malicious code that is delivered to a vulnerable computer, often masquerading  as something else
* Physical loss &amp;ndash; losing a computer (for example due to fire, or leaving one's laptop on a bus), results inke data loss, unless there is a [[backup]].
** Physical theft &amp;ndash; when someone takes property without authorization as his or her own.  When a computer is stolen, the data is gone too, unless there is a [[backup]].
*** [[Laptop theft]] &amp;ndash; stealing a laptop computer. Victims of laptop theft can lose hardware, software, and essential data that has not been backed up. Thieves also may have access to sensitive data and personal information. Some systems authorize access based on credentials stored on the laptop including MAC addresses, web cookies, cryptographic keys and stored passwords.
* [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerabilities]]
** Exploitable vulnerability &amp;ndash; vulnerability for which an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] exists
** [[Open port]] &amp;ndash; TCP or UDP port number that is configured to accept packets. Ports are an integral part of the Internet's communication model — they are the channel through which applications on the client computer can reach the software on the server. Services, such as web pages or FTP, require their respective ports to be "open" on the server in order to be publicly reachable. "Open" (reachable) is not enough for a communication channel to be established. There needs to be an application (service) listening on that port, accepting the incoming packets and processing them. Open ports are vulnerable when there is a service listening and there is no firewall filtering incoming packets to them.

=== Access control ===
[[Access control]] &amp;ndash; selective restriction of access to a place or other resource. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.
* [[Computer access control]] &amp;ndash; includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit.
** [[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] &amp;ndash; function of specifying access rights to computer resources. "To authorize" is to define an access policy. For example, human resources staff is normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is may be formalized as access control rules in a computer system. During operation, the computer system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authenticated) consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer programs and other devices attempting to access data that is on a computer.
** [[Authentication]] &amp;ndash; act of confirming the identity of a consumer. In this context, a consumer is a computer user, computer program, or other device attempting to access data that is on a computer
*** [[User account]] &amp;ndash; system ID unique to each user. It allows a user to authenticate (log in) to a system and to be granted authorization to access resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To log in to an account, a user is typically required to authenticate oneself with a password or other credentials for the purposes of accounting, security, logging, and resource management.
*** [[Password]] &amp;ndash; word or string of characters used for user authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource (example: an access code is a type of password), which should be kept secret from those not allowed access.
** Access approval (computer access control) &amp;ndash;
** [[Audit (computer access control)|Audit]] &amp;ndash; 
* [[Physical security]] &amp;ndash; protecting property and people from damage or harm (such as from theft, espionage, or terrorist attacks). It includes security measures designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, (such as a computer room), equipment (such as your computer), and resources (like the data storage devices, and data, in your computer). If a computer gets stolen, then the data goes with it. In addition to theft, physical access to a computer allows for ongoing espionage, like the installment of a [[hardware keylogger]] device, and so on. Examples of physical security system components include:
** [[Lock (security device)|Lock]]s &amp;ndash; locks may be used to secure a building or room that a computer is in. They may also be used on computer casings to prevent opening computers to remove or swap out parts, or install unauthorized components. And they may be used on a computer to disallow it from being turned on or used without a physical key. There are also locks to attach cables to laptops to prevent them from being taken.
*** [[Computer lock]] &amp;ndash;
** [[Security alarm]]s &amp;ndash;
** Security barriers &amp;ndash; such as fences and walls.
** [[Security guard]]s &amp;ndash;
** [[Theft recovery software]] &amp;ndash; as LoJack is to cars, theft recovery software is to desktop and laptop computers.

[[Data security]] &amp;ndash; protecting data, such as a database, from destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users.&lt;ref name="Summers, G. 2004 p4-5"/&gt;

=== Information privacy ===
* [[Information privacy]] &amp;ndash; relationship between collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. Privacy concerns exist wherever personally identifiable information or other sensitive information is collected and stored – in digital form or otherwise. Improper or non-existent disclosure control can be the root cause for privacy issues.
** [[Internet privacy]] &amp;ndash; involves the right or mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Privacy can entail either Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their name, as these two factors relate to a specific person.

=== Mobile security ===
* [[Mobile security]] &amp;ndash; security pertaining to smartphones, especially with respect to the personal and business information stored on them.

=== Network security ===
* [[Network security]] &amp;ndash; provisions and policies adopted by a network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources. Network security involves the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator.
** [[Internet security]] &amp;ndash; computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing. Different methods have been used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption.
*** [[Virtual private network]] (VPN) &amp;ndash; extends a private network across a public network, such as the Internet. It enables a computer or network-enabled device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the private network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Microsoft Technet|title=Virtual Private Networking: An Overview|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925145332/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742566.aspx|archivedate=2017-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A VPN is created by establishing a virtual point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual tunneling protocols, or traffic encryptions.
**** [[IPsec]] &amp;ndash; protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session. IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the session. IPsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host).
**** [[OpenVPN]] &amp;ndash; open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls. It was written by James Yonan and is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb| The paradox of fiction asks why we experience strong emotions when, for example,  we are watching [[Hamlet]] on stage while at the same time knowing that it is not really Hamlet but merely an [[actor]].]]

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">'''Philippa Hobbs''' is a published South African art historian, an artist and an art collector. She was born in 1955 and matriculated at St Andrew's School in 1972. She studied art at the Johannesburg College of Art before finishing a post-graduate [[printmaking]] course at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]]. She then furthered her studies through [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) and the [[Technikon Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbs was a senior Professor of History of Art at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg from 1988 to 1993. She has been noted for her contribution to the practice of art (with national and international exhibitions), art education, research and most recently, community development through art. Hobbs currently works are MTN Art Collection Curator and Arts and Culture Portolio Senior Manager.

==Art==

Hobbs was invited to contribute to the Images of Human Rights project in 1996, which involved artists making visual representation of each clause of South Africa's Bill of Rights. Hobbs' designated clause was Clause 8: Freedom of Expression, where her woodcut - 'Received by the Tongue' - shows the precarious balance between rights of expression and the subsequent consequences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durbanet.co.za/exhib/dag/hr/cl08.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Hobbs include '''Dracunculus and Cat's Cradle'' - a woodcut produced in 1993 and ''Spiritus Candelabrae'' - a two colour woodcut produced in 1992.

==Teaching==

Hobbs also took classes and workshops from her own printmaking studio, 'Foot Print Studio'. The studio started in order to offer visual training and printmaking guidance to beginners and advanced artists.

==Publications==

Hobbs co-published Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa with Elizabeth Rankin in 1997 (David Philip Publishers), which discusses how printmaking has “traversed the divisions of South African art”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E. 1997. Printmaking in a Transforming South Africa. Claremont: David Philip Publishers.{{ISBN|0-86486334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and describes the technical and expressive components of printmaking, while also exploring the role it played as a form of resistance during the liberation struggle.

In 2003 Hobbs and Rankin published Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints,&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P., Rankin, E., 2003. Rorke’s Drift Empowering Prints. Cape Town: Double Story Books.{{ISBN|1-919930-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at the Evangelical Lutheran Church Art and Craft Centre, more popularly known as [[Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre]], and the art produced by the black artists who studied there.

Hobbs’ most recent publication, Messages and Meaning, is a catalog for the MTN Art Collection for which she is curator. It is a collection of essays by writers such as Nessa Leibhammer, Elizabeth Rankin, Wilma Cruise and other prominent authors. It explores how the collection is “a tool for social investment, an educational resource, a means of inspiring in-house communication and debate, and a showcase of South African and African art to visitors.”&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, P. (ed.) 2006. Messages and Meaning. Johannesburg: David Krut Publishing.{{ISBN|0-9584860-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbs has also contributed to a well-known South African art publication, Taxi. Along with this involvement, she frequently writes the corresponding TAXI Art Education Supplement for school teachers and learners - allowing the information to be easily accessible. These supplements contain worksheets, information boxes about otherwise challenging art concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidkrutpublishing.com/taxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planning cultures''' are the differing customs and practices in the profession of [[Urban planning|urban and regional planning]] that exist around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Planning Cultures|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-95134-8|editor-last=Sanyal|editor-first=Bishwapriya|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Planning cultures in transition|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discourse, models, and styles of communication in planning are adapted to the various local conditions of each community such that planning approaches from one part of the world are not necessarily transferrable to other parts of the globe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Planning culture can refer to how planning professionals undertake their practice in a given location, where they are "affected by both individual and collectively shared cognitive frames" that shape their view of the world. Planners, as stated by Simone Abram, are "constantly in the process of actually producing culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10493875|title=Culture and Planning|last=Abram|first=Simone|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-4094-3506-8|location=Farnham, GB|pages=137|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of planning culture also encompasses how planning actually unfolds within a community, as shaped by its culture and influenced by its people. Differing cultural contexts produce different planning and policy responses to issues "bound to specific local (cultural) contexts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knieling|first=Joerg|last2=Othengrafen|first2=Frank|title=Planning Culture—A Concept to Explain the Evolution of Planning Policies and Processes in Europe?|journal=European Planning Studies|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2134|doi=10.1080/09654313.2015.1018404|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of planning cultures include those specific to different countries, regions, and parts of the globe, as well as differing cultures that exist within the same location, such as [[indigenous planning]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/isbn/9781315605647|title=Reshaping Planning with Culture|doi=10.4324/9781315605647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, planning cultures evolved throughout the 20th century from a state-centred attempt at city beautification toward a more collaborative process involving the public. This differs depending on local culture; however, as planning in some locations has remained a top-down process where plans are prescribed by senior government (for example, in China).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning culture requires treatment of different local circumstances and as such, varies around the world. In Canada, planning culture has evolved from its roots influenced by town planning in Great Britain to become a values-based political process that promotes public involvement in an attempt to give agency to various groups,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Reader in Canadian Planning: Linking Theory and Practice|last=Grant|first=Jill|publisher=Thomson Nelson|year=2008|isbn=978-0-17-610357-6|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although social inequalities and colonial legacies are still largely present.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|date=2004-03-01|title=Commentary: indigenous planning and the burden of colonialism|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=118–124|doi=10.1080/1464935042000204240|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous planning culture, which has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; is another distinct planning culture, within which exists distinct, fluid, and evolving planning cultures that are unique to land, history, and peoples. Today, the reclamation of Indigenous planning cultures has planning in many countries exploring how non-Indigenous and Indigenous planners can work collaboratively toward a reconciliatory, culturally-responsive, and respectful process.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uturn2.cyansolutions.com/cip/plan-canada/summer2013/|title=Plan Canada – Summer 2013|website=uturn2.cyansolutions.com|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planning cultures operate within the institutions of their locations. As such, planning cultures play out within the institutional spheres of society, spheres which are consistently evolving and changing in a dynamic response to cultural stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Educational institutions across the world differ in their approach to planning, contributing toward the formation of distinct planning cultures and demonstrating transformations within planning cultures through changing subject matter and emphases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Development of planning cultures ==
Planning cultures evolved alongside processes of industrialization and the advancement of societies. Prior to [[World War II]], planning was considered a [[City Beautiful movement|city beautification movement]] proposed by architects and politicians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities of tomorrow: An intellectual history of urban planning and design since 1880|last=Hall|first=Peter|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-45647-7|edition=4th|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, with industrialization, planning was conceived as an attempt to provide city leaders with a framework to develop new neighbourhoods and towns outside of the [[City centre|urban core]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After World War II, planning expanded from beautification to include many social elements such as economy, history, religion, and public policy. It became understood that such social factors influence how urban infrastructure develops.
[[File:Local, state, regional, and federal stakeholders work together in planning the future farmers markets and downtown. (19153622646).jpg|thumb|Increasingly, planning cultures are involving the general public throughout the planning process.]]
The formative years for planning cultures were the 1940s and 1950s, during a global period of rebuilding after World War II. Planning cultures emerged from planning practices as the public became increasingly aware of the impacts of planning. During this period, planners also started to take into consideration the impacts of planning practices on the public. Efforts began to shift from building functional and aesthetic architecture, to analytical and rational development approaches for resolving issues faced by a city or region.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The planning culture in many countries has shifted from a design-centric practice led by a small group of professionals to a much broader social activity involving the general public throughout the process.

Starting in the 1960s, the traditional “top-down” and “[[State-centered theory|state-centered]]” planning paradigm was criticized as being static and unresponsive in dealing with complex issues in local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanyal|first=B|title=From the Benevolent to the Evil State,|journal=Cooperative Autonomy: the Dialectic of State-NGO Ralationship in Developing Counties|volume=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, planning practice in many industrialized nations began to shift towards a more “bottom-up” and “[[People-centered development|people-centered]]” process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolan|first=R|last2=S|title=Emerging Views of Planning,|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|volume=33 |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this transitional period, planning evolved from its original object of providing solutions for specific issues to a more comprehensive goal of addressing socioeconomic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Private Voluntary Organizations as Agents of Development|last=Gorman|first=R.F.|publisher=West View Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an attempt to explore more efficient, flexible, and accountable options for  complex problems. As planning culture in industrialized states became more inclusive and aware of issues related to the environment, social equality, multiculturalism, and other non-spatial issues, planners felt it necessary to reflect upon their professional views in order to engage with general public and to search common ground across public in different background and interest groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybczynski|first=W.|title=Where Have All the Planners Gone?|journal=The Profession of City Planning: Change, Image and Challenge|volume=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, some developing countries maintained their “top-down” paradigm in planning, such as China, Cuba, and Iran, where planning still followed comprehensive national strategies. Since the 1980s, planning practices in those and other developing counties have begun to take different directions{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

== Comparing international planning cultures ==
Planning processes and results are highly subject to political influences and institutional structures, which vary significantly around the world. The process of planning involves many stakeholders, although primarily, it is overseen and approved by governments. As such, the largest influences on planning culture are the variables of: constitutional government structures ([[unitary state]]s, [[Federation|federal states]], [[multinational state]]s), economic structure ([[Market economy|market economies]], those in transition from [[Planned economy|command economies]]), the pace of urban population growth, political culture (involvement of [[civil society]], role of media, competitiveness among parties, openness of political process), and the level of [[economic development]]. In all cases, planning institutions are constantly evolving themselves to adapt to new needs and changes. One such broad shift is the embracing of market-led development, where planning institutions now facilitate market forces in an entrepreneurial fashion instead of restraining them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freidmann|first=John|year=2005|title=Globalization and the emerging culture of planning|journal=Progress in Planning|volume=64|pages=183–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of planning cultures are presented below, in alphabetical order by country name.

=== Planning culture in Canada ===
[[File:BC blank.png|thumb|Regional districts in the province of British Columbia are one example of a regional scale at which some planning processes are undertaken in Canada.]]
Planning culture in Canada is inherently value-laden, and cultural and moral values are important aspects of this practice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedmann|first=John|date=2008-12-01|title=The Uses of Planning Theory A Bibliographic Essay|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/28/2/247|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=247–257|doi=10.1177/0739456X08325220|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian planning culture has been influenced by the planning practices of [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|Great Britain]], who partly settled Canada, and by the United States, Canada's neighbour to the South.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The culture of planning in Canada has retained its unique identity by focusing on community planning, while Great Britain focuses on [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town planning]], and the United States on [[Urban planning in the United States|urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning canadian communities: An introduction to the principles, practice and participants|last=Hodge|first=Gerald|publisher=Thomson Nelson|year=2003|isbn=978-0-17-650982-8|edition=4|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's legacy as a sparsely populated nation has led to a planning culture that centres on regional planning as a way of tackling disparities between rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning Canadian Regions|last=Hodge|first=Gerald|last2=Robinson|first2=Ira|publisher=UBC Press|year=2001|isbn=0-7748-0851-9|location=Vancouver|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict of Canada's regional planning culture lies in the fact that a region can be defined in many different ways. For example, a [[region]] could be a large area centred around an urban area, a watershed area, or as an area based on the valley section between mountains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Combined with the regional approach to planning, the diverse and multicultural nature of the Canadian population has led to some challenges in the way that planning is conducted in Canada.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jill Grant explains that a potential solution to these conflicts that has been adopted by Canadian planners is a planning culture where the professional works proactively to anticipate conflicts and mitigate them before they reach a tipping point.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This flexible and proactive approach is useful in Canadian planning culture because it helps balance the needs of different groups living, an often very diverse geographic, political, and social, region to come to positive solutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Planning practice is influenced by politics, and in Canada social justice has been incorporated into progressive planning cultures since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Social justice in planning has focused on enabling typically under-resourced groups, such as the poor. The legacy of planning in Canada as a form of social justice has permeated to planning schools, including the [[School of Community and Regional Planning]] at the University of British Columbia, where agency, [[democratization]], and [[sustainability]] are declared to be important values of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scarp.ubc.ca/mission-and-goals|title=Mission and Goals {{!}} SCARP {{!}} UBC School of Community and Regional Planning|website=scarp.ubc.ca|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning culture in Canada is in part inspired by Porto Alegre's [[Participatory budgeting|participatory budget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boaventura de Sousa|first=Santos|year=1998|title=Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=26|issue=4|pages=461|doi=10.1177/0032329298026004003|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to a culture of [[Consensus decision-making|consensus-building]], [[collaboration]], and community agency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Canada's planning culture is rife with colonial legacies and inequalities and this is not forgotten in today's planning culture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, planning culture in Canada has evolved to a values-based practice embedded within the political realm that attempts to give agency to various groups by promoting collaboration and conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in China ===
{{Main|Urban planning in China}}
[[File:Shanghai Puxi in the Morning.jpg|thumb|The city of Shanghai, China.]]
In [[China]], planning activities and planning bureaucracies have expanded significantly in recent decades, with over 60,000 practicing planners in what is now a well-reputed profession.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Local development and land use decisions are guided by socio-economic plans developed by senior governments, which in turn are aligned with national 5-year plans. The [[Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China|State Land Administration Bureau]] is a vertically-integrated organization with branches in every major city that oversees the allocation of land uses and coordinates major projects along with the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development|Ministry of Construction and the Planning Bureau]]. This is indicative of planning culture in China, which is characterized by centralization of decision making: for example, Civic Mayors are appointed by higher levels of government. Planning is largely seen as a responsibility of government, with little involvement from civil society. Citizens who take issue with planning decisions may sue the local government, file a petition, or engage in public demonstration; however, these actions are largely futile. As a result, planners have significant latitude to implement their ideas without inhibition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently; however, media outlets have begun to offer critical perspectives on planning decisions.

=== Planning culture in India ===
Relative to China, planning culture in [[India]] is characterized by jurisdictional and administrative autonomy. The civil service in charge of planning is accountable to, yet separate from, the political sphere. Five-year national economic plans guide the direction of development and land use planning at the state and municipal level. With the quadrupling of urban populations over the past 50 years, planning is challenged to keep up with such rapid [[urbanization]]. As a result, civil society is still finding its role in balancing planning actors with increasing influence for historically marginalized groups. While planning in India is seen as a vehicle by which to organize and bring significant benefits to society, the planning culture is marred by a socio-economic disconnect between planners and the populations they serve, a highly bureaucratic administration, and the continued marginalization of vast swathes of the urban poor who often live without land rights.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in Japan ===
In [[Japan]], planning was a large part of the dynastic society throughout the known recent history of Japan. During successive heredity an Emperor or the appointed Shogun had the authority to provide centralized planning for the areas of the country under their control. Individual provinces would report to the authority and power of the central government. After the [[Meiji Restoration]] the government developed separated functions and planning functions largely centralized on a regional basis. During the 1990s, local governments were empowered to begin producing urban development Master Plans to guide long-term changes in their jurisdictions. While municipalities were still tied financially to the central government, this change in planning was seen as a major innovation, and one that created a planning culture with increased opportunities for localized public participation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in Russia ===
In [[Russia]], prior to the late 1980s, planning was highly centralized and plans were not publicly available. 30-year plans and designs for most areas were produced in government institutes in the largest cities, far removed from the realities where they were to be applied.  After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], local governments were rapidly given increased planning responsibility, but did not yet have the tools and structure in place to effectively regulate land use. Significant political, societal, and economic changes in that period of transition further complicated the challenges faced by local planning authorities. Attention was given to addressing these immediate needs, and less to the long-range planning tasks of the Soviet era.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Planning culture in South Africa ===
[[File:Townships of Cape Town.jpg|thumb|Informal settlements in Cape Town, South Africa.]]
In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], including the country of [[South Africa]], urban growth rates remain some of the highest in the world. A severe lack of institutional capacity and financial resources characterizes the context of planning challenges in sub-Saharan states. The planning culture is characterized by a process that focuses in the areas inhabited by urban elites, while the vast majority of urban populations live in informal and squatter settlements, which are technically illegal and beyond the official realm of planning jurisdiction. However, local and national authorities are increasingly directing attention to such settlements, and, combined with foreign financial support, are improving basic infrastructure needs. The precarious nature of these unofficial residential lands limits the ability of residents to obtain services and raise issues with local planning administrations, further maintaining their marginalization. Enforcement of regulations, public participation, and plan execution are notably weak, while nepotism is strong, resulting in much urban development taking place outside of official planning processes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Studies of planning culture have tended to focus on national scales for comparative analysis; however, a need has been identified to focus on the contextual factors that differentiate planning cultures at the local level. Further research is also needed to understand the underlying forces that affect the core values of planning cultures; while "planning artifacts", such as institutional planning structures, are evident and can be easily compared, intangible aspects of the "social environment" require more thorough examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Othengrafen|first=Frank|last2=Reimer|first2=Mario|date=2013|title=The embeddedness of planning in cultural contexts: theoretical foundations for the analysis of dynamic planning cultures|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=45|pages=1269–1284|doi=10.1068/a45131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous planning cultures ==
Indigenous planning culture is an approach to planning that is both by and for indigenous peoples and is a practice that has evolved over hundreds to thousands of years.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mqup.ca/reclaiming-indigenous-planning-products-9780773541948.php|title=Reclaiming Indigenous Planning {{!}} McGill-Queen’s University Press|website=www.mqup.ca|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its cultural practice is defined by the sets of traditional knowledges, customs, practices, and cultural identities that are unique to the approximately 350 [[Indigenous peoples]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Indigenous [[world view]]s ground Indigenous planning cultures, that have evolved and been sustained through time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Indigenous planning|Indigenous Planning]] is defined by Dr. Theodore (Ted) Jojola as, "both an approach to community planning and an ideological movement. What distinguishes indigenous planning from mainstream practice is its reformulation of planning approaches in a manner that incorporates 'traditional' knowledge and cultural identity. Key to the process is the acknowledgement of an indigenous world-view, which not only serves to unite it philosophically, but also to distinguish it from neighbouring, non land-based communities." &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Indigenous+planning--an+emerging+context.-a0185031904|title=Indigenous planning--an emerging context. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars, practitioners, and community leaders see Indigenous planning as a cultural practice of reclaiming traditional and reformulating mainstream planning approaches that are respectful, responsive to, and owned by Indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Planning cultures in transition: institutional transformation ==
According to Sanyal, (p.xxi)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "planning cultures are cultures of planning practice. They are the collective [[Ethos (disambiguation)|ethos]] and dominant attitudes of professional planners toward the appropriate roles of the state, market forces, and civil society in urban, regional, and national development." As Reimer notes, this ethos refers to the "basic ideas, traditions, and values of planning professionals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reimer further suggests that planning cultures are "complex and multi-dimensional institutional matrices comprising formal and informal institutional spheres that need to adapt to ever-changing external and internal circumstances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this context, planning cultures operate in an institutional setting and any evolution of a planning culture must contend with a "persisting institutional stability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riemer|first=Mario|year=2013|title=Planning Cultures in Transition: Sustainability Management and Institutional Change in Spatial Planning|url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability|journal=sustainability|volume=5|pages=4653–4673|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reimer evaluates planning cultures as "an analytical concept (and not as a normative paradigm in theory and practice)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Planning is embedded and operates in specific cultural contexts, subject to changing planning cultures. This change can be seen as it plays out in institutional spheres, a form of [[social transformation]]. Institutional change can be theorized as a process comprising six stages: equilibrium, shock event, deinstitutionalization, preinstitutionalization, theorization, diffusion, and reinstitutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, R.; Suddaby, R.; Hinings, C.R. Theorizing change: The role of professional associations in the transformation of institutionalized fields. Acad. Manage. J. 2002, 1, 58–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitions in planning cultures can also be seen in the style and focus of education programs for new planners. Traditionally, planning was closely aligned with architecture and engineering; this is evidenced in planning programs in continental Europe, which emphasize [[urban design]] and land use planning. In North America, the United Kingdom, and select European countries, the breadth of planning subject matter in education has expanded and directs more attention to environmental sustainability and social justice, while also focusing on built form and land regulation.  Planning programs are evolving to train planners to be more creative, innovative, and [[Collaborative planning|collaborative]]. Such skills are essential to meet the increasing challenges faced by planning, for which traditional methods will not suffice.  In unprecedented, uncertain, and unstable times, adaptation of planning cultures is seen as key to their efficacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The foundation of Anglo-American planning values has long been guided by a yearning to implement utopian ideals.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This starts with planning institutions where academics and practitioners practice, where institutional reform is a constant focus. By reforming institutions, planners believe they can improve core issues in the practice and process of planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Zack|date=2013|title=Rethinking planning culture: a new institutionalist approach|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=84.6|pages=683–702|doi=10.3828/tpr.2013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2017}}

'''Power engineering''', also called '''power systems engineering''', is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of [[electric power]], and the electrical apparatus  connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of [[three-phase electric power|three-phase AC power]] – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between [[rectifier|AC and DC power]] and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from [[electrical engineering]].

==Pioneering years==
[[Electricity]] became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century.  Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[voltaic pile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History Of The Light Bulb | publisher = Net Guides Publishing, Inc. | year = 2004 | url = http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-the-light-bulb.html | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas | last = Greenslade | title = The Voltaic Pile | publisher = [[Kenyon College]] | url = http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Electricity/Voltaic_Pile/Voltaic_Pile.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from [[Michael Faraday]] who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an [[electromotive force]] in a loop of wire&amp;mdash;a principle known as [[electromagnetic induction]] that helps explain how generators and transformers work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Faraday Page | publisher = The Royal Institute | url = http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329153140/http://www.rigb.org/heritage/faradaypage.jsp | archivedate = 2008-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 two electricians built the world's first power station at [[Godalming]] in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens [[arc lamp]]s at 250 volts and thirty-four [[incandescent lamp]]s at 40 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=744 | title=Godalming Power Station | publisher=Engineering Timelines | accessdate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However supply was intermittent and in 1882 [[Thomas Edison]] and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The [[Pearl Street Station]] consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jasmin | last=Williams | title = Edison Lights The City | publisher =[[New York Post]] | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302007/news/cextra/edison_lights_the_city_514905.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | date=2007-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Casey | last = Grant | title = The Birth of NFPA | publisher = [[National Fire Protection Association]] | url = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us/History&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1 | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228104759/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=500&amp;itemID=18020&amp;URL=About%20Us%2FHistory&amp;cookie_test=1 | archivedate = 2007-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station used [[direct current]] and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Bulk Electricity Grid Beginnings  | publisher=New York Independent System Operator |url=http://www.pearlstreetinc.com/NYISO_bulk_elect_beginnings.pdf | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year in London [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs' transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at [[Turin]] where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single [[alternating current]] generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html | title=Lucien Gaulard | first=Evgeny | last=Katz | date=2007-04-08 | accessdate=2008-05-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072336/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/gaulard.html |archivedate = 2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration [[George Westinghouse]], an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a [[Siemens]] generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.

One of Westinghouse's engineers, [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]], recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to [[series and parallel circuits|parallel]] and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the [[voltage regulation]] of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world's first practical transformer based alternating current power system at [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html Great Barrington 1886 - Inspiring an industry toward AC power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/stanley.html | title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886 | publisher=IEEE | first=Thomas | last=Blalock | date=2004-10-02 | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 349611 | y = 1886 | m = 09 | d = 21 | inventor = William Stanley Jr. | title = Induction Coil}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In 1885 the  Italian physicist and electrical engineer [[Galileo Ferraris]] demonstrated an [[induction motor]] and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36 |title=Fritz E.

By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the "[[War of Currents]]" emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a {{convert|100|hp}} synchronous motor at [[Telluride, Colorado]] with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | title=The Day They Turned The Falls On | first=Jack | last=Foran | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151552/http://ublib.buffalo.edu/libraries/projects/cases/niagara.htm | archivedate=2008-05-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the Atlantic, [[Oskar von Miller]] built a 20 kV 176&amp;nbsp;km three-phase transmission line from [[Lauffen am Neckar]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.more-powerful-solutions.com/media/ScreenPDF_Hypower_15_72dpi.pdf | author=Voith Siemens (company) | title=HyPower | pages=7 | date=2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the [[Adams Power Plant|Adams No. 1 generating station]] at [[Niagara Falls]] began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose [[alternating current]] as opposed to [[direct current]] for electrical transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/adams.html | title=Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant, 1895 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Twentieth century==
===Power engineering and Bolshevism===
[[File:Klutsis (1929) Soviet Power plus electrification.png|thumb|right|1929 poster by [[Gustav Klutsis]]]]
The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the [[October revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]]. [[Lenin]] stated "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vladimir|first=Lenin|title=Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks|year=1920|location=Moscow|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/21.htm|quote=Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country, since industry cannot be developed without electrification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The [[GOELRO plan]] was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. [[Gleb Krzhizhanovsky]] was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in [[Moscow]] in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the ''Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class''.

===Power engineering in the USA===
In 1936 the first commercial [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) line using [[mercury-arc valve]]s was built between [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] and [[Mechanicville, New York]]. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the [[Thury system]]) although this suffered from serious reliability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | title=A Novel but Short-Lived Power Distribution System | date=2005-05-01 | publisher=IEEE | accessdate=2008-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524013821/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pes/public/2005/may/peshistory.html | archivedate=2011-05-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 [[Siemens]] demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gene Wolf | title=Electricity Through the Ages | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_electricity_ages/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=2000-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first [[circuit breaker]] that used [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the interrupting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=John Tyner, Rick Bush and Mike Eby | title=A Fifty-Year Retrospective | url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_fiftyyear_retrospective/ | work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World | date=1999-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a far superior [[dielectric]] to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as [[switchgear]]) and [[transformer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC710047.aspx | publisher=ABB | title=Gas Insulated Switchgear | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.sayedsaad.com/Transformer/SF6_Transformer/sf6_transformer_main.htm | title=SF6 Transformer | first=Sayed | last=Amin | accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant [[load flow study|load flow studies]] could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.

==Power==
[[File:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|220px|Transmission lines transmit power across the [[Power grid|grid]].]]

Power Engineering deals with the [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and utilization of [[electricity]] as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include [[transformer]]s, [[electric generator]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[power electronics]].

Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.

==Fields==

[[Electricity generation]] covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.

[[Electric power transmission]] requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. [[High voltage direct current]] systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.

[[Electric power distribution]] engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.

[[Power system protection]] is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.

In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.

==Professional societies==
In both the UK and the USA, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers.  The [[Institution of Electrical Engineers|IEE]] was founded in the UK in 1871, and the [[AIEE]] in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education.

'''Processing''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] graphical library and [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) / playground built for the electronic arts, [[new media art]], and [[visual design]] communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of [[computer programming]] in a visual context.

Processing uses the [[Java (programming language)|Java language]], with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. As well as this, it also has a graphical user interface for simplyfing the compilation and execution stage.

The Processing language and IDE were the precursor to numerous other projects, notably [[Arduino]], [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] and [[P5.js]].

==History==
The project was initiated in 2001 by Ryan Hopkins and [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [[Daniel Shiffman]], who joined as a third project lead. [[Johanna Hedva]] joined the Foundation in 2014 as Director of Advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://processingfoundation.org/people|title=People|website=processingfoundation.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Processing had the URL at proce55ing.net, because the ''processing'' domain was taken. Eventually Reas and Fry acquired the domain processing.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://processing.org/discourse/alpha/board_Collaboration_action_display_num_1074297082.html|title=Processing 1.0 _ALPHA_ - processing.org|website=processing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the name had a combination of letters and numbers, it was still pronounced ''processing''. They do not prefer the environment being referred to as ''Proce55ing''. Despite the domain name change, Processing still uses the term ''p5'' sometimes as a shortened name (''p5'' specifically is used, not ''p55''), for example p5.js is a reference to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2443|title=What means number 5 in name "p5"? · Issue #2443 · processing/p5.js|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processing includes a ''sketchbook'', a minimal alternative to an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for organizing projects.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKgfVpWPb0sC&amp;pg=PA151|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0310-0|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the &lt;code&gt;PApplet&lt;/code&gt; [[Java class]] (formerly a subclass of Java's built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language's features.&lt;ref name="Meyer2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanine Meyer|title=Programming 101: The How and Why of Programming Revealed Using the Processing Programming Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yypgDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|date=15 June 2018|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4842-3697-0|pages=121–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as [[inner class]]es when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pVhzd6h20IC&amp;pg=PA412|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-1980-4|pages=412–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the use of [[static variable]]s and [[Static methods|methods]] in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode.

Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex [[data types]] that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: [[Integer (computer science)|int]] (integer), [[Character (computing)|char]] (character), [[Floating point|float]] (real number), and color (RGB, [[RGBA color space|RGBA]], hex).

==Examples==

The simplest possible version of a "Hello World" program in Processing is:

&lt;source lang="arduino"&gt;
//This prints "Hello World." to the IDE console.
void setup() {
       println("Hello World.");
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However, due to the more visually-oriented nature of Processing, the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language.

&lt;source lang="arduino"&gt;
//Hello mouse.
void setup() {
       size(400, 400);
       stroke(255);
       background(192, 64, 0);
}

void draw() {
       line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Awards==
In 2005 Reas and Fry won the prestigious Golden Nica award from [[Ars Electronica]] in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing.&lt;ref name="Hoy2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meredith Hoy|title=From Point to Pixel: A Genealogy of Digital Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0NwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0023-0|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Fry won the 2011 National Design Award given by the [[Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum]] in the category of Interaction Design. The award statement says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, Ben Fry pursues a long-held fascination with visualizing data. As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Fry develops software, printed works, installations, and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents. With Casey Reas, he founded the Processing Project, an open-source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive-media software. It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts."&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.cooperhewitt.org/2011/05/26/Final%20-%20CHNDM%20NDA%202011%20Winner%20Release%205-26-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related projects==

Processing is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to learning, teaching, and making things with code. There are several variants and related projects:

===Design By Numbers===
Processing was based on the original work done on [[Design By Numbers]] project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.

===Processing.js===
{{Main|Processing.js}}
In 2008, [[John Resig]] ported Processing to [[JavaScript]] using the [[Canvas element]] for rendering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/|title=John Resig - Processing.js&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a Java plugin. Since then, the open source community including students at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto have taken over the project.

Processing.js is also used to advocate very basic programming to Students of all ages on [[Khan Academy]] by creating drawings and animations. Learners showcase their creations to other learners.

===p5.js===
[[Lauren McCarthy]] created [http://p5js.org/ p5.js], a native [[JavaScript]] alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. McCarthy also teaches an introductory course to p5.js on [[Kadenze]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js on Kadenze]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|'''What means number 5 in name "p5"?'''&lt;br /&gt; the original domain of processing was proce55ing.net, so people used to sometimes refer to processing as proce55ing or P5 or p5 for short. they still do sometimes. p5.js is a reference to that.

===Processing.py===
Python Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit. It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov.&lt;ref name="ParrishFry2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allison Parrish|author2=Ben Fry|author3=Casey Reas|title=Getting Started with Processing.py: Making Interactive Graphics with Processing's Python Mode|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddYlDAAAQBAJ|date=11 May 2016|publisher=Maker Media, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4571-8679-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processing has spawned another project, [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]], which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the [[C++]] language as a way to teach artists how to program [[microcontroller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circuitcellar.com/ee-tips/processing-wiring-and-arduino-ee-tip-101/|title=Processing, Wiring, and Arduino (EE Tip 101) - Circuit Cellar|date=18 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and [[Arduino]], using the Wiring environment and language.
[[Fritzing]] is another software environment of the same sort, which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.

===Mobile Processing===
Another spin-off project, now defunct, is Mobile Processing by Francis Li, which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices. Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2013-06-03
| url = http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iProcessing===
iProcessing was built to help people develop native [[iPhone]] applications using the Processing language. It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.link/2010/02/iprocessing-puts-processing-js-on-iphone-but-what-about-browsers/|title=iProcessing Puts Processing.js on iPhone - But What About Browsers? - CDM Create Digital Music|date=11 February 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spde===
Spde (Scala Processing Development Environment) replaces Processing's reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off-the-shelf [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] programming language which also runs on the [[Java platform]] and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods, while also allowing more concise code, and supporting [[functional programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technically.us/spde/About|title=Spde: Spde|publisher=Technically.us|accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technically.us/code/x/runaway-processing/|title=Coderspiel / Runaway processing|publisher=Technically.us|accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technically.us/code/x/flocking-with-spde/|title=Coderspiel / Flocking with Spde|publisher=Technically.us|accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quil===
Quil (formerly named ''clj-processing'') is a wrapper for Processing in the [[Clojure]] language, a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] that runs on the Java platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=quil/quil|url=https://github.com/quil/quil|website=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JRubyArt===
JRubyArt (formerly named ''ruby-processing'')  is a wrapper for Processing in the [[Ruby (language)|Ruby]] language, that runs on the Java platform using JRuby.

'''Proto-fascism''' refers to the direct predecessor ideologies and cultural movements that influenced and formed the basis of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''.

Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent proto-fascist figure is [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], the [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] whose politics influenced [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Spackman. Fascist virilities: rhetoric, ideology, and social fantasy in Italy. Pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-fascist political movements include the [[Italian Nationalist Association]] (ANI), the [[German National Association of Commercial Employees]] (DHV) and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. ''The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge. Pp. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily on law and order, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[ancien régime|anciens régimes]] of Europe.

Other people that have been labeled proto-fascist are [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Ion Dragoumis]] (by John Mazis in his book "A Man For All Seasons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ethnikonkratos.gr/2017/06/05/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BC/|title=Γιάννης Μάζης: «Ο Δραγούμης δεν έχω καμία αμφιβολία ότι ήταν ένας πρωτοφασίστας»|date=2017-06-04|work=Εθνικόν Κράτος|access-date=2018-10-23|language=el-GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''''Ramkinar Baij''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48693&lt;/ref&gt; that was brought out on the occasion of a massive retrospective exhibition of [[Ram Kinker Baij]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]].

The exhibition was curated by K.S. Radhakrishnan&lt;ref&gt;http://isikkim.com/2012-02-a-retrospective-of-ramkinkar-baij-inaugurated-in-delhi-09-5/&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was brought out in collaboration with the Delhi Art Gallery. The book presents entire body of Ramkinkar’s sketches, watercolours, etchings, oils and sculptures, together with many invaluable period photographs. This is considered to be the authoritative volume on the “prolific master”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120323/jsp/opinion/story_15278556.jsp#.VJDGSSvF-So&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing distinction between [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]] Siva Kumar notes, "If his friend and colleague Binodebihari painted the starker side of Santiniketan landscape, and saw himself as a lonely palm tree in the middle of the barren and parched Khoai, Ramkinkar saw himself as the Palash in full bloom: No leaves, bare branches, fully ablaze".&lt;ref&gt;http://muktodhara.org/?p=2169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[R. Siva Kumar]] was awarded by the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi]] for this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E. Sharpe 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in [[sustainable agriculture]] and to an extent [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="What are Renewable Resources"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea79e/ch05.htm What are “Renewable Resources”?], by A.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M.

United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]
{{main article|Energy crop|Non-food crop}}
An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
&lt;ref Name=unece&gt;[http://www.unece.org/unece-main/info-resources/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2012/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe.html Wood confirmed as the primary source of renewable energy in Europe, UNECE February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/am859e/am859e08.pdf FAO Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=woodecon&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575771-environmental-lunacy-europe-fuel-future  Wood The fuel of the future] Environmental lunacy in Europe, Economist title story Apr 6th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between [[energy crop]]s and [[non-food crop]]s. A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]]. Conflicts between food needs and usage, as supposed by [[fief]] obligations were in so far common in historical times as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wageningenacademic.com/_clientfiles/download/livestockhousing-e_01.pdf A short history of livestock production]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, J. Hartung, in Livestock housing, Modern management to ensure optimal health and welfare of farm animals, edited by: Andres Aland and Thomas Banhazi, © 2013 {{ISBN|978-90-8686-217-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a significant percentage of (middle European) farmers yields went into [[livestock]], which provides as well organic fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Comberg, Die deutsche Tierzucht im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Ulmer, 1984, {{ISBN|3-8001-3061-0}}, (History of livestock breeding in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes,  drove engines as e.g. in [[treadmill]]s.

Other regions solved the transportation problem with [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], [[urban agriculture|urban]] and garden agriculture.&lt;ref name=rad&gt;Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment. By Joachim Radkau. Publications of the German Historical Institute Series. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Further conflicts as between forestry and herding, or (sheep) herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds.&lt;ref&gt;Veröffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts für Geschichte. 2, Band 0, Max-Planck-Institut für Geschichte, Reiner Prass, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1958, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===
[[Image:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===
Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolau|first=Basil J.|last2=Perera|first2=M.

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biofuel is a type of [[fuel]] whose energy is derived from biological [[carbon fixation]]. Biofuels include fuels derived from [[biomass]] conversion, as well as [[Biofuel#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biology and genetic improvement of Jatropha curcas L.: A review| journal = [[Applied Energy]] | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | year = 2010| pages = 732–742 |author1=B.N.

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]] or [[switchgrass]].

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

[[Biogas]] is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;Redman, G., The Andersons Centre.

===Biogas===
[[Biogas]] typically refers to a mixture of [[gas]]es produced by the breakdown of [[organic matter]] in the absence of [[oxygen]]. Biogas is produced by [[anaerobic digestion]] with anaerobic bacteria or [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of biodegradable materials such as [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[municipal waste]], [[green waste]], [[plant material]], and crops.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

===Natural fibre===
{{main article|Natural fiber}}

Natural fibres are a class of hair-like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces, similar to pieces of [[yarn|thread]]. They can be used as a component of [[Composite material|composite]] materials. They can also be [[felted|matted]] into sheets to make products such as [[paper]] or [[felt]]. Fibres are of two types: natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres, and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres.

===Overfishing===
[[Image:Surexploitation morue surpêcheEn.jpg|thumb|200px|Left|[[Atlantic cod]] stocks severely overfished leading to abrupt collapse]]
{{main article|Overfishing}}
''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' has described ocean over fishing as "simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/critical-issues-overfishing/ |title=Overfishing |publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuna]] meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:358:0059:0080:EN:PDF COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2371/2002] of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy.

===Deforestation===

{{main article|Deforestation}}
[[File:Deforestation Carceres Braasil 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation in Brazil]] 1996]]
Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama. TakingITGlobal. 18 July 2006. Web. 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]]. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation |work=UN Secretary-General’s Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html |archivedate=2001-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|author=Daniel Rogge|work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire|title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805191140/http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/EH2/Rogge/index.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm |title=China's floods: Is deforestation to blame? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 6, 1999 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities.  In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/AssessingBiofuels/tabid/56055/Default.aspx |title=Assessing biofuels: towards sustainable production and use of resources |year=2009 |publisher=[[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered species===

{{main article|Endangered species}}

Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

[[File:Eglise Saint-Ayoul Provins retable maitre-autel.jpg|thumb|On one strict definition, this French 17th-century construction is a retable rather than a reredos, as it is all one construction]] 
A '''retable''' is a structure or element placed either on or immediately behind and above the [[altar]] or [[communion table]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Retable |volume=23 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a church. At the minimum it may be a simple shelf for candles behind an altar, but it can also be a large and elaborate structure. A retable which incorporates sculptures or painting is often referred to as an [[altarpiece]].

According to the Getty ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online'', "A 'retable' is distinct from a '[[reredos]]'; while the reredos typically rises from ground level behind the altar, the retable is smaller, standing either on the back of the altar itself or on a pedestal behind it. Many altars have both a reredos and a retable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=retable&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300076035 ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online''] 'Retable'&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is not always upheld in common use, and the terms are often confused or used as synonyms. In several foreign languages, such as [[French language|French]] (also using 'retable'), the usage is different, usually equating the word with the English 'reredos' or 'altarpiece', and this often leads to confusion, and incorrect usage in translated texts. The [[Medieval Latin]] ''retrotabulum'' (modernized ''retabulum'') was applied to an architectural feature set up at the back of an altar, and generally taking the form of a screen framing a picture, carved or sculptured work in wood or stone, or [[mosaic]], or of a movable feature such as the  ''[[Pala d'Oro]]'' in [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], of gold, jewels and enamels.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The non-English word "retable" therefore often refers to what should in English be called a [[reredos]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The situation is further complicated by the frequent modern addition of free-standing altars in front of the old integrated altar, to allow the celebrant to face the congregation, or be closer to it. 

[[Dossal]]' is another term that may overlap with both retable and reredos; today it usually means an altarpiece painting rising at the back of the altar to which it is attached, or a cloth usually hanging on the wall directly behind the altar.

The cognate Spanish term, ''[[retablo]]'', refers also to a reredos or retrotabulum, although in the specific context of Mexican folk art it may refer to any two-dimensional depiction (usually a framed painting) of a saint or other Christian religious figure, as contrasted with a ''[[bulto]]'', a three-dimensional statue of same.

The retable may hold the [[altar cross]], mostly in Protestant churches, as well as candles, flowers and other things.

[[File:Sacramento Delta at flood stage, 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|Sacramento (California) Delta]] at flood stage, early-March 2009]]
A '''river delta''' is a [[landform]] that forms from [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] carried by a [[river]] as the flow leaves its [[river mouth|mouth]] and enters slower-moving or stagnant water.&lt;ref&gt;Miall, A. D. 1979. Deltas. in R. G. Walker (ed) Facies Models. Geological Association of Canada, Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, T. 1986. Deltas. in H. G. Reading (ed.). Sedimentary environments and facies. Backwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs where a river enters an [[ocean]], [[sea]], [[estuary]], [[lake]], [[reservoir]], or (more rarely) another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment. The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment, and receiving basin processes that redistribute, sequester, and export that sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = M.D. | last2 = Tornqvist | first2 = T.E. | year = 2000 | title = Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change: a review and look forward | url = | journal = Sedimentology | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 2–48 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S.|last3=Hilgartner|first3=William B.|date=2001-04-01|title=Impact of historic land-use change on sediment delivery to a Chesapeake Bay subestuarine delta|journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=409–427|doi=10.1002/esp.189|issn=1096-9837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size, geometry, and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution. River deltas are important in human civilization, as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers. They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply.&lt;ref name="Anthony 53–78"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Edward J.|date=2015-03-01|title=Wave influence in the construction, shaping and destruction of river deltas: A review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322714003788|journal=Marine Geology|volume=361|pages=53–78|doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2014.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also ecologically important, with different species' assemblages depending on their landscape position.

== Formation ==
[[File:Delta Formation.svg|thumb|Delta forms where river meets lake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19071 |title=How a Delta Forms Where River Meets Lake |date=2014-08-12 |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or [[reservoir]], (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This [[alluvium]] builds up to form the river delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-modeling/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: TFD Modeling|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its [[stream channel|channel]] and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to [[sediment transport|transport sediment]]. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and [[deposition (geology)|deposits]]. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the [[gradient]] of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see [[slope]]).

As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course down slope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.&lt;ref name="SlingerlandSmith"&gt;Slingerland, R. and N. D. Smith (1998), "Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion," ''Geology'' (Boulder), 26, 435–438.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a [[distributary]] network.

Another way these distributary networks form is from deposition of [[Shoal#Harbour and river bars|mouth bars]] (mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth-bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the [[Wax Lake Delta]].

In both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position results in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not [[Avulsion (river)|avulse]] often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. [[Alluvial fan]] deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape.

Deltas are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, [[wind wave|wave]], and [[tide|tidal]] processes,&lt;ref name="Galloway1975"&gt;Galloway, W.E., 1975, Process framework for describing the morphologic and stratigraphic evolution of deltaic depositional systems, in Brousard, M.L., ed., Deltas, Models for Exploration: Houston Geological Society, Houston, Texas, p. 87– 98.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the strength of each.&lt;ref&gt;Perillo, G. M. E. 1995. Geomorphology and Sedimentology of Estuaries. Elsevier Science B.V., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orton | first1 = G.J. | last2 = Reading | first2 = H.G. | year = 1993 | title = Variability of deltaic processes in terms of sediment supply, with particular emphasis on grain size | url = | journal = Sedimentology | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 475–512 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1993.tb01347.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave-dominated deltas ===
In wave dominated deltas, wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line.&lt;ref name="Galloway1975" /&gt; The relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin. With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta,  causing the delta to retreat.&lt;ref name="Anthony 53–78" /&gt; For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/tfd-hydrometeorology/|title=Dr. Gregory B.

[[File:Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh, India.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Ganges Delta]] in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] is the largest delta in the world, and one of the most fertile regions in the world.]]

=== Tide-dominated deltas ===
Erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas, such as the [[Ganges Delta]], which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sandbars and ridges. This tends to produce a "dendritic" structure.&lt;ref name="Fagherazzi2008"&gt;Fagherazzi S., 2008, Self-organization of tidal deltas, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 105 (48): 18692–18695,&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal deltas behave differently from a river- and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries.  Once a wave- or river-dominated distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there is a lot of water around – such as floods or [[storm surge]]s. These distributaries slowly silt up at a more or less constant rate until they fizzle out.&lt;ref name="Fagherazzi2008" /&gt;

=== Gilbert deltas ===
A Gilbert delta (named after [[Grove Karl Gilbert]]) is a specific type of delta formed from coarse sediments, as opposed to gently-sloping muddy deltas such as that of the Mississippi. For example, a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/surficial/facts/dec03.htm Characteristics of deltas].

=== Tidal freshwater deltas ===
A tidal freshwater delta&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/tidal-freshwater-deltas/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Tidal Freshwater Deltas|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary, in the region known as the "subestuary".&lt;ref&gt;Pasternack, G. B. 1998. Physical dynamics of tidal freshwater delta evolution.  Ph. D. Dissertation. The Johns Hopkins University, 227pp, 5 appendices.&lt;/ref&gt; Drowned coastal river valleys that were inundated by rising sea levels during the late Pleistocene and subsequent Holocene tend to have dendritic estuaries with many feeder tributaries. Each tributary mimics this salinity gradient from their brackish junction with the mainstem estuary up to the fresh stream feeding the head of tidal propagation. As a result, the tributaries are considered to be "subestuaries". The origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Hilgartner|first2=William B.|last3=Brush|first3=Grace S.|date=2000-09-01|title=Biogeomorphology of an upper Chesapeake Bay river-mouth tidal freshwater marsh|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1672/0277-5212(2000)0202.0.CO;2|journal=Wetlands|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=520–537|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020&lt;0520:boaucb&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=0277-5212}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S|date=2002-03-01|title=Biogeomorphic controls on sedimentation and substrate on a vegetated tidal freshwater delta in upper Chesapeake Bay|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X01001398|journal=Geomorphology|volume=43|issue=3–4|pages=293–311|doi=10.1016/s0169-555x(01)00139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of processes that create a tidal freshwater delta result in a distinct morphology and unique environmental characteristics. Many tidal freshwater deltas that exist today are directly caused by the onset of or changes in historical land use, especially deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|last2=Brush|first2=Grace S.|date=1998-09-01|title=Sedimentation cycles in a river-mouth tidal freshwater marsh|journal=Estuaries|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=407–415|doi=10.2307/1352839|issn=0160-8347|jstor=1352839|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/61w6m8kc|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are well illustrated by the many tidal freshwater deltas prograding into Chesapeake Bay along the east coastline of the United States. Research has demonstrated that the accumulating sediments in this estuary derive from post-European settlement deforestation, agriculture, and urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gottschalk | first1 = L.

=== Estuaries ===
Other rivers, particularly those on coasts with significant [[tidal range]], do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an [[estuary]].  Notable examples include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Tagus]] estuary.

=== Inland deltas ===
[[File:OkavangoDelta.png|thumb|right|Okavango Delta]]In rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an [[inverted river delta]]. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an ''inland delta'', and often occurs on former lake beds. The [[Inner Niger Delta]] and [[Peace–Athabasca Delta]] are notable examples. The [[Amazon River|Amazon]] also has an inland delta before the island of [[Marajó]], and the [[Danube]] has one in the valley on the Slovak-Hungarian border between [[Bratislava]] and [[Iža]].

In some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. [[Okavango Delta]] in [[Botswana]] is one well-known example.

=== Mega deltas ===
The generic term ''mega delta'' can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl]], [[Red River Delta|Red]], [[Mekong Delta|Mekong]], [[Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy]], [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra]], and [[Indus River Delta|Indus]].

== Sedimentary structure ==
[[File:Line5066 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Delta on [[Kachemak Bay]] at low tide]]
The formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by [[crossbedding]].&lt;ref name=maine /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.G.A Whitten, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Geology'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by [[sediment gravity flow]], creating a [[turbidite]]. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes.
*The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of [[sand dunes]]).&lt;ref name="BatesDict"&gt;Robert L. Bates, Julia A. Jackson, ''Dictionary of Geological Terms'' [[American Geological Institute|AGI]] (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the [[bed load]] that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the [[angle of repose]] of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, [[Wiktionary:subaqueous|subaqueous]] landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.
*The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain.&lt;ref name="BatesDict" /&gt; As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hori, K. and Saito, Y. ''Morphology and Sediments of Large River Deltas''. Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo Geographical Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of deltas ==
[[File:EbroRiverDelta ISS009-E-09985.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Ebre]] River delta at the [[Mediterranean Sea]]]]

The [[Ganges]]/[[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] combination delta, which spans most of [[Bangladesh]] and empties into the Bay of Bengal, is the world's largest delta.

The [[St. Clair River]] delta, between the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] and the U.S. state of [[State of Michigan|Michigan]], is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water.

== Ecological threats to deltas ==
Human activities, such as the creation of [[dam]]s for [[hydroelectric]] power or to create [[reservoir]]s can radically alter delta ecosystems.  Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away.  The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water.  While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the [[Nile Delta]] and [[Colorado River Delta]] are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maselli |first1=Vittorio |last2=Trincardi |first2=Fabio |date=2013-05-31 |title=Man made deltas |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01926 |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=3 |pages=1926 |doi=10.1038/srep01926 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=3668317 |pmid=23722597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deltas in the economy ==
Ancient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted [[sand]] and [[gravel]]. Sand and gravel is often quarried from these old deltas and used in concrete for [[highways]], buildings, sidewalks, and even landscaping. More than 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are produced in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Information Institute. 2011. Sand and Gravel. {{cite web |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photosandgr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006200708/http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photosandgr.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sand and gravel quarries are former deltas, but for ones that are, much of the sorting is already done by the power of water.

As lowlands often adjacent to urban areas, deltas often comprise extensive industrial and commercial areas as well as agricultural land.  These uses are often in conflict.  The [[Fraser Delta]] in [[British Columbia]], Canada, includes the [[Vancouver Airport]] and the [[Roberts Bank Superport]] and the [[Annacis Island]] industrial zone, and a mix of commercial, residential and agricultural land.  Space is so limited in the [[Lower Mainland]] region, and in British Columbia in general, which is very mountainous, that the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] was created to preserve agricultural land for food production.

== Deltas on Mars ==
Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes.  Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had large amounts of water.  Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range.  Below are pictures of a few.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin III, R. et al.  2005.  An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars:  2.

'''Scepticism in law''' is a school of [[jurisprudence]] that was a reaction against the idea of [[natural law]], and a response to the '[[Legal formalism|formalism]]' of [[legal positivism|legal positivists]]. Legal scepticism  is sometimes known as [[legal realism]].&lt;ref&gt;In the context of [[philosophy]], some people prefer the word '[[scepticism]]’ to 'realism'  because the word 'realism' is also used for school of thought founded by [[Plato]] and his followers. The reason for this preference for the use of word 'scepticism' is not only that this word is used in the writings of sceptic jurists themselves, but also that this word is suitable in the context of history of philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Posner, "The skeptical vein in American thinking about law runs from Holmes to the legal realists to the critical legal studies movement, while behind Holmes stretches a European skeptical legal tradition that runs from [[Thrasymachus]] (in Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]) to Hobbes and Bentham and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==

Scepticism is a [[philosophy| philosophical]] approach that includes a scientific method and a rejection of unevidenced claims to certainty. Scepticism has been known in various degrees. [[Pyrrho]] was the first philosopher who developed it to a high degree. Greek [[Sophist]] were also sceptics. [[Protagoras]] was a famous Greek Sophist. Greek Sophists were also law teachers.

Writing about the courts of Athenian democracy, [[Bertrand Russell]] states: "In general, there were a large number of judges to hear each case. The plaintiff and defendant, or prosecutor and accused, appeared in person, not through professional lawyers. Naturally, success or failure depended largely on oratorical skill in appealing to popular prejudices. Although a man had to deliver his own speech, he could hire an expert to write a speech for him, or, as many preferred, he could pay for instruction in the arts required for success in the law courts. These arts the Sophists were supposed to teach".&lt;ref&gt;History of Western Philosophy, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Stumpf writes about Sophists as, "It was their skepticism and relativism that made them suspect. No one would have criticized them for training lawyers, as they did, to be able to argue either side of a case" Philosophy, History &amp; Problems, p.&amp;nbsp;30. American legal sceptics are influenced by '[[pragmatism]]' of [[William James]], Dr. John Dewey, and F.e.S. Schiller.

Bertrand Russell declares that William James's doctrine is "an attempt to build a superstructure of belief upon a foundation of scepticism". One of the three founders of pragmatism, Schiller, considered himself a disciple of Protagoras. See &lt;ref&gt;Russell's History of Western Philosophy, p.94 and p.772.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the reasons for the preference of some people for the word 'scepticism'.

==Early history==

[[Mickey Dias]] writes: "a preliminary warning is needed against the tendency to imagine that there is anything like a 'school' of American realists. A difficulty in the way of a coherent presentation of their views is that there are varying versions of realism as well as changes of front; positions formerly defended with zest have since been forgotten or abandoned……. Judge Jerome Frank (1889–1957), a leading exponent preferred the phrases 'experimentalists' or 'constructive skeptics', He repudiated the charge that 'the realist school embraced fantastically inconsistent ideas' by pointing out that 'actually no such school existed'. The common bond is, in his words&lt;ref&gt;Law and the Modem Mind (first English edition, 1949), Preface, pp. vii-viii.&lt;/ref&gt;
,'skepticism as to some of the conventional legal theories, a skepticism stimulated by a zeal to reform, in the interests of justice, some court-house ways. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
With such zeal to reform, legal sceptics made a revolt against the formalism.

Lord Lloyd of Hamstead has described this revolt in a wider philosophical perspective as follows:

"In the nineteenth and at the beginning of the present century, laissez-faire was the dominant creed in America. This creed was associated, in the intellectual sphere, with a certain attachment to what has been called "formalism" in philosophy and the social sciences. This was marked by a reverence for the role of logic and mathematics and a priori reasoning as applied to philosophy, economics and jurisprudence, with but little urge to link these empirically to the facts of life. Yet empirical science and technology were increasing dominating American society and with this development arose and intellectual movement in favor of treating philosophy and the social sciences, and even logic itself, as empirical studies not rooted in abstract formalism. In America this movement was associated with such figures as William James and Dewey in philosophy and logic. Veblen in economics, Beard and Robinson in historical studies, and Mr. Justice Holmes in [[jurisprudence]]. It is important to note that this movement was especially hostile to the so-called British empirical school derived from Hume, and to which [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Austin]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] adhered. For while it is true that these thinkers were positivist and anti-metaphysical they were for the anti-formalists, not empirical enough, since they were associated with a priori reasoning not based on actual study of the facts, such as Mill's formal logic and his reliance on an abstract "economic man," Bentham's hedonic calculus of pleasures and pains, and the analytical approach to jurisprudence derived from Austin. They were particularly critical of the ahistorical approach of the English utilitarians. Nor, unlike the sociologists of Pound persuasion, were they interested to borrow from Bentham such abstract analyses of society as his doctrine of conflicting to emphasise was the need to enlarge knowledge empirically, and to relate it to the solution of the practical problems of man in society at the present day., &lt;ref&gt;Lord Lloyd of Hamstead, Jurisprudence, 679.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new movement in jurisprudence found philosophical support of '[[Pragmatism]]'. The principal exponent of 'Pragmatism', William James, writes: "A pragmatist turns away from abstraction and insufficiencies, from verbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns towards completeness and adequacy, towards facts, towards actions, towards powers.,,&lt;ref&gt;James, Pragmatism, (1925), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.==
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]]]
This sceptical approach impressed Justice Holmes, who laid the foundation of healthy and constructive scepticism in the law. Hughes writes: "Though another half century was to elapse before the appearance of Ogden and Richard's The Meaning of Meaning, exploration of meaning of meaning of law was Holmes's pioneer enterprise.,,&lt;ref&gt;Charles. Hughes, "Early Writing of Holmes, Jr.", in 44&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes further writes: " To me, Mr. Justice Holmes is a prophet of the Law,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Law Review (1930-31), at p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] was graduated from Harvard Law School in 1866, and opened a private law practice. He devoted most of his energies to legal scholarship. From 1870 to 1873 he served as editor of the American Law Review and taught constitutional law at Harvard.

In 1881, Holmes published ''The Common Law'', representing a new departure in legal philosophy. He changed the attitude of the law through his writings. The opening sentence captures the pragmatic theme of that work and of Holmes's philosophy of law: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. " As a justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. was well known for the eloquence, pungency, and abundance of his dissenting opinions––so much so that he was called the "Great Dissenter." Holmes was appointed justice in 1902, and served the Court for thirty years. At that time, many state regulatory laws were being declared unconstitutional because the Court felt they did not conform to its concept of due process of law.

In a dissenting opinion in ''Lochner v. New York'' (1905)&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"&gt;198 U.S. 45,76 (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes declared that the law should develop along with society and that the 14th Amendment did not deny states a right to experiment with social legislation. He also argued for judicial restraint, asserting that the Court should not interpret the Constitution according to its own social philosophy. Speaking for a unanimous Court in ''Schenck v. United States'' (1919), however, he stated that judicial review was necessary in cases involving Freedom and Speech and presented the "clear and present danger" doctrine associated with his name. Francis Biddle writes: ''He was convinced that one who administers constitutional law should multiply his skepticisms to avoid heading into vague words like liberty, and reading into law his private convictions or the prejudices of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural law, and the Supreme Court, (1960), p.lO. Biddle also tells usthat Holmes ,"refused to let his preferences (other men were apt to call them convictions) interfere with his judicial decisions……	The steadily held determination to keep his own vies isolated from his professional work is aptly shown by his famous remark in the Lochner case-the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statistics….	A constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory." P.IO. It is importantto note that eighty years after Lochner case (1905), Human Right Commission of Pakistan recommended that, "the confusion caused by conflict between normal Iaws and belief  which does not enjoy the force of law) needs to be removed." See, State of Human Rights in 1996, at p. 46, Human Right Commission of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Holmes, 'men make their own laws; that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that these laws do not flow from some mysterious omnipresence in the sky, and that judges are not independent mouthpieces of the infinite.,&lt;ref&gt;Francis Biddle, Justice Holmes, Natural Law and the Supreme Court, (1960) p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; 'The common law is not a brooding omnipresence in the sky'.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Pac. Co. V. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (dissent).&lt;/ref&gt; Law should be viewed 'from the stance of the bad man'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"&gt;Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harvard Law Review (1897) 457&lt;/ref&gt;
'The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law'.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; A judge must be aware of social facts. Only a judge or lawyer who is acquainted with the historical, social, and economic aspects of the law will be in a position to fulfill his functions properly.

As a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Holmes introduced a new method of constitutional interpretation. He challenged the traditional concept of constitution. Holmes also protested against the method of abstract logical deduction from general rules in the judicial process. According to Holmes, lawyers and judges are not logicians and mathematicians. The books of the laws are not books of logic and mathematics. He writes: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, and even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed.

The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics., &lt;ref&gt;Holmes, The Common Law,1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Lochner v. New York''&lt;ref name="198 US 45,76 1905"/&gt; he observes that, 'General propositions do not decide concrete cases."

Holmes, also insisted on the separation of 'ought' and 'is' which are obstacles in understanding the realities of the law. As an ethical sceptic, Holmes tells us that if you want to know the real law, and nothing else, you must consider it from the point of view of 'bad man' who cares only from material consequences of the courts' decisions, and not from the point of view of good man, who find his reasons for conduct "in the vaguer sanctions of his conscience.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt; The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and talks about rights and duties, malice, intent, and negligence- and nothing is easier in legal reasoning than to take these words in their moral sense.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Biddle. Justice Holmes, Natural Law, and the Supreme Court. 40 332 p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes said: "I think our morally tinted words have caused a great deal of confused thinking. But Holmes is not unconcerned with moral question. He writes: "The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law.&lt;ref name="Holmes_457"/&gt;

==Jerome Frank==

[[Jerome New Frank]] followed Holmes scepticism, and made an elaborate system of legal scepticism. He considered himself to be 'a constructive sceptic'. He challenged the traditional conception that law consists of rules from which deductions are made. He called that conception a 'basic myth of law'. He argued that it is fruitless to seek such certainty, that the law is uncertain and that the law cannot be separated from decisions of the courts.

Frank argues that every legal controversy is unique and may not be decided by rigid universals and abstract generalizations. He calls those jurists who find legal uncertainty within the laws's formal rules 'Rule-sceptics', and those who find legal uncertainty arising from the nature of facts 'Fact-sceptics'. Dias writes: "Frank divided realists into two camps, described as 'rule skeptics' and 'fact skeptic'. The 'rule skeptics' rejected legal rules as providing uniformity in law, and tried instead to find uniformity in rules evolved out of psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, politics, etc. [[Hans Kelsen]], it will be remembered, maintained that it is not possible to derive an 'ought' from an 'is'. The 'rule skeptics' avoided that criticism by saying that they were not deriving purposive 'oughts', but only predictions of judicial behaviour analogous to the laws of science. Frank called this brand realism the left-wing adherents of a right-wing traditions, namely, the tradition of trying to find uniformity in rules. They, too, had to account for uncertainty in the law on the basis of rule-uncertainty. The 'fact skeptics', among them Frank, rejected even this aspiration towards uniformity. So he abandoned all attempts to seek rule-certainty and pointed to the uncertainty of establishing even the facts in trial courts. These have to be established largely by witnesses, who are fallible and who may be lying. It is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty how fallible a particular witness is likely to be, or how persuasively he will lie. All persons, judges and jurymen alike, form different impressions of the dramas unfolded before them; an inflexion or a cough may awaken subconscious predilections, varied idiosyncrasies and prejudices. Eternal verities are not to be erected on such a basis. Frank alleged that all those who write on [[legal certainty]], not excepting the 'rule skeptics', over look these difficulty. 'They often call their writings 'jurisprudence'; but as they almost never consider juries and jury-trials, one might chide them for forgetting jurisprudence. ",&lt;ref&gt;Dias, Jurisprudence, p.624. see also, Law and the Modem Mind (1930), Preface, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
"For any particular lay person", Frank writes: "the law, with respect to any particular set of facts, is a decision of a court with respect to those facts so far as that decision affects that particular person. Until a court has passed on those facts no law on that subject is yet in existence. ,&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Law and the Modem Mind'' (1930), p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Frankfurter, who wrote book "Mr. Justice Holmes and the Supreme Court" published three years after the death of Holmes, observes in ''Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Ry. V. Browning''&lt;ref&gt;310 U.S. 362, 369 (1940).&lt;/ref&gt; that: "It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of 'laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it."

Statutes and constitutions are inanimate object which cannot speak by themselves. [[John Chipman Gray]], the great American Jurist, who reiterated Holmes's view, writes: "Statutes do not interpret themselves; their meaning is declared by the courts, and it is with the meaning declared by the courts, and with no other meaning, that they are imposed upon the community as law. ,&lt;ref&gt;Jhon Chipman Gray, The Nature and Sources of the Law. (1909), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He further writes: "It has been sometime said that the Law is composed of two parts,-legislative law and judge-made law, but, in truth all the Law is judge-made law. The shape in which a statute is imposed on the community as a guide for conduct is that statute as interpreted by the courts. The courts put life into the dead words of the statute. 339 To quote from Bishop Hoadly.......'Nay, whoever hath an absolute authority to interpret any written or spoken laws, it is He who is truly the law Giver to all intents and purposes, and not who first who wrote and spoke them”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2037">The '''Structural Engineers Association of Northern California''' ('''SEAONC''') is a structural engineering association established in 1930. Its headquarters are in [[San Francisco, California]]. Initially a club for [[structural engineer]]s to exchange technical information, it evolved into a professional organization advising on the development of [[building code]] requirements and California legislation related to earthquake hazard reduction such as the [[Field Act]] and [[Alquist Priolo Special Studies Zone Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Structural Engineers Association of Northern California |title=Origin and History |url=https://www.seaonc.org/origin-and-history |accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEAONC is the northern California section of the statewide Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC). SEAOC's ''Recommended Lateral Force Requirements,'' a.k.a. "Blue Book", first published in 1959, has since influenced the development of [[seismic analysis]] and design provisions in building codes nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first1=J. |last1=Diebold |first2=K. |last2=Moore |first3=T. |last3=Hale |first4=G. |last4=Mochizuki  |title=SEAOC Blue Book: Seismic Design Recommendations 1959 to 2008 |booktitle=Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering |date=October 12–17, 2008 |location=Beijing, China |url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/14_S07-022.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15145">A '''tag system''' is a deterministic [[computation|computational model]] published by [[Emil Leon Post]] in 1943 as a simple form of a '''[[Post canonical system]]'''. A tag system may also be viewed as an abstract machine, called a '''Post tag machine''' (not to be confused with [[Post–Turing machine]]s)—briefly, a [[finite-state machine]] whose only tape is a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] of unbounded length, such that in each transition the machine reads the symbol at the head of the queue, deletes a constant number of symbols from the head, and appends to the tail a symbol-string that depends solely on the first symbol read in this transition. 

Because all of the indicated operations are performed in a single transition, a tag machine strictly has only one state.

== Definitions ==

A ''tag system'' is a triplet (''m'', ''A'', ''P''), where

* ''m'' is a positive integer, called the ''deletion number''.
* ''A'' is a finite alphabet of symbols, one of which is a special ''halting symbol''. All finite (possibly empty) strings on ''A'' are called ''words''.
* ''P'' is a set of ''production rules'', assigning a word ''P(x)'' (called a ''production'') to each symbol ''x'' in ''A''.  The production (say ''P(&lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;)'') assigned to the halting symbol is seen below to play no role in computations, but for convenience is taken to be ''P(&lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;)'' = ''&lt;tt&gt;'H'&lt;/tt&gt;''.

A ''halting word'' is a word that either begins with the halting symbol or whose length is less than ''m''.

A transformation ''t'' (called the ''tag operation'') is defined on the set of non-halting words, such that if ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the result of deleting the leftmost ''m'' symbols of ''S'' and appending the word ''P(x)'' on the right. Thus, the system processes the m-symbol head into a tail of variable length, but the generated tail depends solely on the first symbol of the head. 

A ''computation'' by a tag system is a finite sequence of words produced by iterating the transformation ''t'', starting with an initially given word and halting when a halting word is produced.  (By this definition, a computation is not considered to exist unless a halting word is produced in finitely-many iterations.  Alternative definitions allow nonhalting computations, for example by using a special subset of the alphabet to identify words that encode output.)

The term ''m-tag system'' is often used to emphasise the deletion number.  Definitions vary somewhat in the literature (cf References), the one presented here being that of Rogozhin.

The use of a halting symbol in the above definition allows the output of a computation to be encoded in the final word alone, whereas otherwise the output would be encoded in the entire sequence of words produced by iterating the tag operation.

A common alternative definition uses no halting symbol and treats all words of length less than ''m'' as halting words. Another definition is the original one used by Post 1943 (described in the historical note below), in which the only halting word is the empty string.

=== Example: A simple 2-tag illustration ===

This is merely to illustrate a simple 2-tag system that uses a halting symbol.

&lt;pre&gt;
2-tag system 
    Alphabet: {a,b,c,H} 
    Production rules:
         a  --&gt;  ccbaH
         b  --&gt;  cca
         c  --&gt;  cc

Computation
    Initial word: baa
                    acca
                      caccbaH
                        ccbaHcc
                          baHcccc
                            Hcccccca (halt).
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Example: Computation of Collatz sequences ===

This simple 2-tag system is adapted from [De Mol, 2008].  It uses no halting symbol, but halts on any word of length less than 2, and computes a slightly modified version of the [[Collatz conjecture|Collatz sequence]].

In the original Collatz sequence, the successor of n is either {{sfrac|''n''|2}} (for even&amp;nbsp;''n'') or 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (for odd n).  The value 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is clearly even for odd&amp;nbsp;''n'', hence the next term after 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is surely {{sfrac|3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1|2}}. In the sequence computed by the tag system below we skip this intermediate step, hence the successor of ''n'' is {{sfrac|3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1|2}} for odd&amp;nbsp;''n''.

In this tag system, a positive integer ''n'' is represented by the word aa...a with ''n'' a's.

&lt;pre&gt;
2-tag system 
    Alphabet: {a,b,c} 
    Production rules:
         a  --&gt;  bc
         b  --&gt;  a
         c  --&gt;  aaa

Computation
    Initial word: aaa &lt;--&gt; n=3
                    abc  
                      cbc
                        caaa
                          aaaaa  &lt;--&gt; 5
                            aaabc
                              abcbc
                                cbcbc
                                  cbcaaa
                                    caaaaaa
                                      aaaaaaaa  &lt;--&gt; 8
                                        aaaaaabc
                                          aaaabcbc
                                            aabcbcbc
                                              bcbcbcbc
                                                bcbcbca
                                                  bcbcaa
                                                    bcaaa
                                                      aaaa  &lt;--&gt; 4
                                                        aabc
                                                          bcbc
                                                            bca
                                                              aa  &lt;--&gt; 2
                                                                bc
                                                                  a  &lt;--&gt; 1
                                                                   (halt)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Turing-completeness of ''m''-tag systems ==

For each ''m'' &gt; 1, the set of ''m''-tag systems is [[Turing-complete]]; i.e., for each ''m'' &gt; 1, it is the case that for any given Turing machine '''T''', there is an ''m''-tag system that [[Surrogate model|emulates]] '''T'''. In particular, a 2-tag system can be constructed to emulate a [[Universal Turing machine]], as was done by Wang 1963 and by Cocke &amp; Minsky 1964.

Conversely, a Turing machine can be shown to be a Universal Turing Machine by proving that it can emulate a Turing-complete class of ''m''-tag systems. For example, Rogozhin 1996 proved the universality of the class of 2-tag systems with alphabet {''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;} and corresponding productions {''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;}, where the ''W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are nonempty words; he then proved the universality of a very small (4-state, 6-symbol) Turing machine by showing that it can simulate this class of tag systems.

== The 2-tag halting problem ==
This version of the [[halting problem]] is among the simplest, most-easily described [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]]s:

Given an arbitrary positive integer ''n'' and a list of ''n''+1 arbitrary words ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''Q'' on the alphabet {1,2,...,''n''}, does repeated application of the tag operation ''t'': ''ijX'' → ''XP''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; eventually convert ''Q'' into a word of length less than 2?  That is, does the sequence ''Q'', ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ... terminate?

== Historical note on the definition of tag system ==

The above definition differs from that of Post 1943, whose tag systems use no halting symbol, but rather halt only on the empty word, with the tag operation ''t'' being defined as follows:

* If ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a nonempty word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the operation consisting of &lt;u&gt;first appending&lt;/u&gt; the word ''P(x)'' to the right end of ''S'', and &lt;u&gt;then deleting&lt;/u&gt; the leftmost ''m'' symbols of the result &amp;mdash; &lt;u&gt;deleting all&lt;/u&gt; if there be less than ''m'' symbols.

The above remark concerning the Turing-completeness of the set of ''m''-tag systems, for any ''m'' &amp;gt; 1, applies also to these tag systems as originally defined by Post.

=== Origin of the name "tag" ===

According to a footnote in Post 1943, B. P. Gill suggested the name for an earlier variant of the problem in which the first ''m'' symbols are left untouched, but rather a check mark indicating the current position moves to the right by ''m'' symbols every step. The name for the problem of determining whether or not the check mark ever touches the end of the sequence was then dubbed the "problem of tag", referring to the children's [[Tag (game)|game of tag]].

==Cyclic tag systems==

A cyclic tag system is a modification of the original tag system.  The alphabet consists of only two symbols, '''0''' and '''1''', and the production rules comprise a list of productions considered sequentially, cycling back to the beginning of the list after considering the "last" production on the list.  For each production, the leftmost symbol of the word is examined—if the symbol is '''1''', the current production is appended to the right end of the word; if the symbol is '''0''', no characters are appended to the word; in either case, the leftmost symbol is then deleted.  The system halts if and when the word becomes empty.

===Example===
&lt;pre&gt;
Cyclic Tag System
 Productions: (010, 000, 1111)

Computation
 Initial Word: 11001
    Production         Word
    ----------         --------------
       010             11001
       000              1001010
       1111              001010000
       010                01010000
       000                 1010000
       1111                 010000000
       010                   10000000
        .                      .
        .                      .
&lt;/pre&gt;

Cyclic tag systems were created by [[Matthew Cook]] and were used in Cook's demonstration that the [[Rule 110 cellular automaton]] is universal.  A key part of the demonstration was that cyclic tag systems can emulate a [[Turing-complete]] class of tag systems.

==Emulation of tag systems by cyclic tag systems==

An ''m''-tag system with alphabet {''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} and corresponding productions {''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is emulated by a cyclic tag system with ''m*n'' productions (''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', -, -, ..., -), where all but the first ''n'' productions are the empty string (denoted by '&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;').  The ''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are encodings of the respective ''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', obtained by replacing each symbol of the tag system alphabet by a length-''n'' binary string as follows (these are to be applied also to the initial word of a tag system computation):

 ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 100...00
 ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 010...00
 .
 .
 .
 ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 000...01

That is, ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is encoded as a binary string with a &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; in the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; position from the left, and &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;'s elsewhere.  Successive lines of a tag system computation will then occur encoded as every (''m*n'')&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; line of its emulation by the cyclic tag system.

===Example===

This is a very small example to illustrate the emulation technique.
&lt;pre&gt;
2-tag system
    Production rules: (a --&gt; bb, b --&gt; abH, H --&gt; H)
    Alphabet encoding: a = 100, b = 010, H = 001 
    Production encodings: (bb = 010 010, abH = 100 010 001, H = 001)

Cyclic tag system 
    Productions: (010 010, 100 010 001, 001, -, -, -)

Tag system computation
    Initial word: ba
                    abH
                      Hbb (halt)

Cyclic tag system computation
    Initial word: 010 100 (=ba)

    Production       Word
    ----------       -------------------------------
  * 010 010          010 100  (=ba)
    100 010 001       10 100
    001                0 100 100 010 001
    -                    100 100 010 001
    -                     00 100 010 001
    -                      0 100 010 001
  * 010 010                  100 010 001  (=abH)
    100 010 001               00 010 001 010 010
    001                        0 010 001 010 010
    -                            010 001 010 010
    -                             10 001 010 010
    -                              0 001 010 010
  * 010 010       emulated halt --&gt;  001 010 010  (=Hbb)
    100 010 001                       01 010 010
    001                                1 010 010
    -                                    010 010 001
    ...                                    ...
&lt;/pre&gt;  
Every sixth line (marked by &lt;tt&gt;'*'&lt;/tt&gt;) produced by the cyclic tag system is the encoding of a corresponding line of the tag system computation, until the emulated halt is reached.

The '''UKRC''' ('''UK Resource Centre''') is a UK organisation for the provision of advice, services and policy consultation regarding the under-representation of women in science, engineering, technology and the built environment (SET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theukrc.org/ |title=Welcome to |publisher=The UKRC |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is funded by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and was launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-and-society/stem-skills/diversity-in-science/women-in-science |title=The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=Bis.gov.uk |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central base is located in [[Bradford]] in the North of England but there are also centres in South East England, South Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |title=About us |publisher=The Ukrc |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129034550/http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UKRC works to promote gender equality in SET with employers and professional bodies; education institutions; women's organisations and networks; policy institutes; sector skills councils; the government and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/diversity/ukrc.htm |title=The UK Resource Centre (UKRC) for Women in SET |publisher=Raeng.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes implementing the [[Athena SWAN]] Charter.

In 2011 it took over the leadership of the [[WISE Campaign]] and became UKRC-WISE. In late 2012 it took on the WISE name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="626">'''Usus''' ({{lang-la|usus}} — usage; long-established rule, practice, custom) is a term referring to the common usage of [[linguistic unit]]s (words, idioms, forms) in a particular speech community.

Usus can be contrasted with both occasional usage and prescribed [[standard language|standard usage]]. The term is used to designate usage that has wide currency and acceptance among speakers of a language, even if it diverges from the "high" literary standard. 

Usus is one of the crucial terms in the research of Danish linguists [[Otto Jespersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]].

'''Visual geography''' is the study of [[geography]] as represented in paintings, photos and other forms of the [[visual arts]]. Both [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]] in the visual arts are studied. Typical studies in Visual Geography include the [[geographical]] symbols within visual arts. Another is cross referencing the date a piece of visual art was produced with known weather records to see if the art was drawn accurately in the field or from memory in a studio.

=== Nano-engineered materials===
Research in nano-engineered materials includes many departments and Faculties at Waterloo. Researchers in chemistry, [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical and mechatronics engineering]], and [[electrical and computer engineering]] are collaborating on modeling, design, fabrication, processing, characterization and analysis of nano-scale properties of materials, structures, devices and systems. This development will be further driven by the need to address a critical issue also faced in the integration of nano-scale devices: the interface between nano-structured materials and the macroscopic world.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Nano-instrumentation===
Techniques to fabricate new instrumentation to characterize critical parameters such as size, composition, stiffness, surface characteristics, dopant concentration, [[magnetic coercivity]], and other properties of particular interest to the nano scale. Due to their small size, nano-systems are extremely challenging to assemble, and yet precise control of their parameters is often critical to their performance. A related goal is to cause a paradigm shift in classical chemical measurements (in which samples are brought to the lab for analysis) by developing wireless, energy-efficient mobile nano-instruments that allow users to bring the lab to the sample. Examples of "the lab" include nano-instruments of all types and two examples of "the sample" include the environment or a patient. The metrology arm of the new labs will be used to study measurements at the nano-scale, to develop new and unique nano-scale measuring instruments, and to calibrate such instruments. It will also address associated challenges involved in fabricating, integrating and packaging instruments at the nano-scale.

===Nano–biosystems===
Nano–bio is a field that includes both the use of nanotechnology in biological and agrifood systems and use of biological or biomimetic techniques in nanotechnology. Nanobiotechnology shows a tremendous promise of improving the quality of life. For example, nanovehicles might deliver drugs directly to targeted cells, nanomembranes may be used for development of cheap, effective water purification systems, or nanochips that interface neurons with electronics may become common place. NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems) might use sensors and physical controls to stabilize individuals with heart, kidney or liver disease. As nanotechnology researchers strive to create self-assembling devices, they are beginning to exploit natural self-assemblers: proteins, DNA and viruses. Examples also include development of food quality monitoring sensors and microfluidic biosensor components.Nanoscale imaging of biological systems helps to understand the nanoscale structure–function relationship of materials and in evaluating the food quality–function information. Characterization of nanoscale fragments of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, chromosomes, plant cells, bacteria, starch granules and anti-allergens are extremely important.

====Nano–bio projects====
*[[Lab-on-a-chip]] applications, such as DNA chips and pharmacy-on-a-chip.
*Creation of nano-vehicles that mimic the way viruses interact with specific cells. This will facilitate the [[Targeted drug delivery|delivery of drugs directly to targeted cells]], and could, for instance, eliminate the toxic side-effects of [[chemotherapy]] by directing the therapeutic agents to cancer cells only.
*Development of nanotech methods for therapeutic applications, for example, for replacing faulty DNA or RNA strands with corrected strands.

'''Wellcome Research Laboratories''' was a site in [[Beckenham]], south-east London, that was a main research centre for pharmaceuticals. Until 1965, this laboratory site was situated in [[Kent]].

==History==
In 1894 [[Henry Wellcome]] set up a laboratory in central London to investigate a treatment for [[diphtheria]]. In 1898 it moved to Brockwell Hall in [[Herne Hill]] (now in [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]). In 1919 Henry Wellcome bought a 105-acre site in Beckenham, Kent, which cost £32,000. The site had belonged to the Langley family since 1350. Langley Court had been built in 1886 by James Bucknall, who lived in the house with his family until 1914.

It was named the Wellcome Research Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7DYvphaRhwC|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=4 October 1984|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946 after the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories moved to the site. The [[Wellcome Trust]] had been set up in 1936, after the death in that year of Sir Henry Wellcome.

===Closure===
It closed in 1995 after Wellcome had been taken over by Glaxo in March 1995 to form Glaxo Wellcome. In December 2000, Glaxo Wellcome became [[GlaxoSmithKline]], when it merged with SmithKline Beecham.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19397">The '''X-machine''' (''XM'') is a theoretical model of [[computation]] introduced by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] in 1974.&lt;ref
  name="Eil74"&gt;S. Eilenberg (1974)
  ''Automata, Languages and Machines, Vol. A''. 
  Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''X'' in "X-machine" represents the fundamental data type on which the machine operates; for example, a machine that operates on databases (objects of type ''database'') would be a ''database''-machine. The X-machine model is structurally the same as the [[finite state machine]], except that the symbols used to label the machine's transitions denote [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] of type ''X''→''X''. Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the relation that labels it (computing a set of changes to the data type ''X''), and traversing a path in the machine corresponds to applying all the associated relations, one after the other.

==Original theory ==

Eilenberg's original X-machine was a completely general theoretical model of computation (subsuming the [[Turing machine]], for example), which admitted deterministic, non-deterministic and non-terminating computations.  His seminal work &lt;ref name="Eil74" /&gt; published many variants of the basic X-machine model, each of which generalized the [[finite state machine]] in a slightly different way.

In the most general model, an X-machine is essentially a "machine for manipulating objects of type X". Suppose that X is some [[datatype]], called the ''fundamental datatype'', and that Φ is a set of (partial) relations φ: X → X. An X-machine is a [[finite state machine]] whose arrows are labelled by relations in Φ. In any given state, one or more transitions may be ''enabled'' if the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the associated relation φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; accepts (a subset of) the current values stored in X.  In each cycle, all enabled transitions are assumed to be taken.  Each recognised path through the machine generates a list φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of relations. We call the composition φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ... &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of these relations the ''path relation'' corresponding to that path. The ''behaviour'' of the X-machine is defined to be the union of all the behaviours computed by its path relations. In general, this is non-deterministic, since applying any relation computes a set of outcomes on X. In the formal model, all possible outcomes are considered together, in parallel.

For practical purposes, an X-machine should describe some finite computation.  An encoding function α: Y → X converts from some ''input'' data type Y into the initial state of X, and a decoding function β: X → Z, converts back from the final state(s) of X into some ''output'' data type Z.  Once the initial state of X is populated, the X-machine runs to completion, and the outputs are then observed.  In general, a machine may deadlock (be blocked), or livelock (never halt), or perform one or more complete computations.  For this reason, more recent research has focused on deterministic X-machines, whose behaviour can be controlled and observed more precisely.

=== Example ===

A compiler with a peep-hole optimizer can be thought of as a machine for optimizing program structure.  In this '''Optimizer'''-machine, the encoding function α takes source code from the input-type Y (the program source) and loads it into the memory-type X (a parse tree).  Suppose that the machine has several states, called '''FindIncrements''', '''FindSubExprs''' and '''Completed'''.  The machine starts in the initial state '''FindIncrements''', which is linked to other states via the transitions:

  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindIncrements'''
  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''Completed'''

The relation '''DoIncrement''' maps a parsed subtree corresponding to "x := x + 1" into the optimized subtree "++x".  The relation '''DoSubExpr''' maps a parse tree containing multiple occurrences of the same expression "x + y ... x + y" into an optimized version with a local variable to store the repeated computation "z := x + y; ... z ... z".  These relations are only enabled if X contains the domain values (subtrees) on which they operate.  The remaining relations '''SkipIncrement''' and '''SkipSubExpr''' are ''nullops'' (identity relations) enabled in the complementary cases.

So, the '''Optimizer'''-machine will run to completion, first converting trivial additions into in-place increments (while in the '''FindIncrements''' state), then it will move on to the '''FindSubExprs''' state and perform a series of common sub-expression removals, after which it will move to the final state '''Completed'''.  The decoding function β will then map from the memory-type X (the optimized parse-tree) into the output-type Z (optimized machine code).

=== Convention ===

When referring to Eilenberg's original model, "X-machine" is typically written with a lower-case "m", because the sense is "any machine for processing X".  When referring to later specific models, the convention is to use a capital "M" as part of the proper name of that variant.

==1980s==
Interest in the X-machine was revived in the late 1980s by Mike Holcombe,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88a"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification',
  ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3'''(2), pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt; who noticed that the model was ideal for software [[formal specification]] purposes, because it cleanly separates ''control flow'' from ''processing''. Provided one works at a sufficiently abstract level, the control flows in a computation can usually be represented as a finite state machine, so to complete the X-machine specification all that remains is to specify the processing associated with each of the machine's transitions. The structural simplicity of the model makes it extremely flexible; other early illustrations of the idea included Holcombe's specification of human-computer interfaces,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88b"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'Formal methods in the specification of the human-machine interface', 
  ''International J. Command and Control, Communications and Info. Systems.'' '''2''', pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

  'An organisational approach to decision-making in command systems.'

== Major variants ==

The X-machine is rarely encountered in its original form, but underpins several subsequent models of computation.  The most influential model on theories of software testing has been the [[Stream X-Machine]].  [[NASA]] has recently discussed using a combination of [[Communicating X-Machine|Communicating Stream X-Machines]] and the process calculus WSCSS in the design and testing of ''swarm satellite'' systems.&lt;ref name="HRRT05" /&gt;

=== Analog X Machine (AXM) ===

The earliest variant, the continuous-time ''Analog X-Machine'' (''AXM''), was introduced by Mike Stannett in 1990 as a potentially "super-Turing" model of computation;&lt;ref
  name="Sta90"&gt;M. Stannett (1990) 
  'X-machines and the Halting Problem: Building a super-Turing machine'. 
  ''Formal Aspects of Computing'' '''2''', pp. 331-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
it is consequently related to work in [[hypercomputation]] theory.&lt;ref
  name="Cop02"&gt;B. J. Copeland (2002) 
  'Hypercomputation'. 
  ''Minds and Machines'' '''12''', pp. 461-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stream X-Machine (SXM) ===
{{main|Stream X-Machine}}
The most commonly encountered X-machine variant is Gilbert Laycock's 1993 ''[[Stream X-Machine]]'' (''[[SXM (computational model)|SXM]]'') model,&lt;ref name="Lay" /&gt;
which forms the basis for Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate's theory of ''complete'' software testing, which guarantees known correctness properties, once testing is over.&lt;ref name="HI98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IH98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'.
  ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stream X-Machine differs from Eilenberg's original model, in that the fundamental data type X is of the form ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, where ''In''* is an input sequence, ''Out''* is an output sequence, and ''Mem'' is the (rest of the) memory.

The advantage of this model is that it allows a system to be driven, one step at a time, through its states and transitions, while observing the outputs at each step.  These are witness values, that guarantee that particular functions were executed on each step.  As a result, complex software systems may be decomposed into a hierarchy of Stream X-Machines, designed in a top-down way and tested in a bottom-up way.  This divide-and-conquer approach to design and testing is backed by Florentin Ipate's proof of correct integration,&lt;ref name="IpaHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method that is proved to find all faults', ''International Journal of Computer Mathematics'' '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves how testing the layered machines independently is equivalent to testing the composed system.

=== Communicating X-Machine (CXM) ===
{{Redirect|CXM|the Angolan airport with that [[IATA]] code|Camaxilo Airport}}

The earliest proposal for connecting several X-machines in parallel is Judith Barnard's 1995 ''Communicating X-machine'' (''CXM'' or ''COMX'') model,&lt;ref
  name="BTWM95"&gt;J. Barnard, C. Theaker, J. Whitworth and M. Woodward (1995) 'Real-time communicating X-machines for the formal design of real-time systems', in ''Proceedings of DARTS '95, Universite Libre, Brussels, Belgium, 9–11 November 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
  name="Bar96"&gt;J. Barnard (1996)
  ''COMX: A methodology for the formal design of computer systems using Communicating X-machines''. 
  PhD Thesis, Staffordshire University.&lt;/ref&gt;
in which machines are connected via named communication channels (known as ''ports''); this model exists in both discrete- and real-timed variants.&lt;ref
  name="AldBarn97"&gt;A. Alderson and J. Barnard (1997)
  'On Making a Crossing Safe',
  ''Technical Report SOCTR/97/01'', School of Computing, Staffordshire University.
  [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/alderson97making.html (Citeseer)]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier versions of this work were not fully formal and did not show full input/output relations.

A similar Communicating X-Machine approach using buffered
channels was developed by Petros Kefalas.&lt;ref name="KEK00a"&gt;E. Kehris, G. Eleftherakis and P. Kefalas (2000) 'Using X-machines to model and test discrete event simulation programs', ''Proc. 4th World Multiconference on Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers'', Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KEK00b"&gt;P. Kefalas, G. Eleftherakis and E. Kehris (2000) 'Communicating X-machines: a practical approach for modular specification of large systems', ''Technical Report CS-09/00, Department of Computer Science'', City College, Thessaloniki.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this work was on expressiveness in the composition of components.  The ability to reassign channels meant that some of the testing theorems from Stream X-Machines did not carry over.

These variants are discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Communicating Stream X-Machine (CSXM) ===

The first fully formal model of concurrent X-machine composition was proposed in 1999 by Cristina Vertan and Horia Georgescu,&lt;ref name="GeoVer00"&gt;H. Georgescu and C. Vertan (2000) 'A new approach to communicating stream X-machines', ''Journal of Universal Computer Science'' '''6''' ''(5)'', pp. 490-502.&lt;/ref&gt; based on earlier work on communicating automatata by Philip Bird and Anthony Cowling.&lt;ref
  name="BC94"&gt;P. R. Bird and A. J. Cowling (1994)
  'Modelling logic programming using a network of communicating machines', in
  ''Proc. 2nd Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing, Malaga, 26–28 January 1994'', pp. 156-161.
  [http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~ajc/csxms/papers/euromic94.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Vertan's model, the machines communicate indirectly, via a shared ''communication matrix'' (essentially an array of pigeonholes), rather than directly via shared channels.

Bălănescu, Cowling, Georgescu, Vertan and others have studied the formal properties of this CSXM model in some detail.  Full input/output relations can be shown.  The ''communication matrix'' establishes a protocol for synchronous communication.  The advantage of this is that it decouples each machine's processing from their communication, allowing the separate testing of each behaviour.  This compositional model was proven equivalent to a standard [[Stream X-Machine]],&lt;ref name="BCHGGV99"&gt;T.Balanescu, A. J. Cowling, H. Georgescu, M. Gheorghe, M. Holcombe and C. Vertan (1999) 'Communicating X-machines systems are no more than X-machines', ''Journal of Universal Computer Science'', '''5''' ''(9)'', pp. 494-507.&lt;/ref&gt; so leveraging the earlier testing theory developed by Holcombe and Ipate.

This X-machine variant is discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Object X-Machine (OXM) ===

Kirill Bogdanov and Anthony Simons developed several variants of the X-machine to model the behaviour of objects in object-oriented systems.&lt;ref name="SBH01"&gt;A. J. H. Simons, K. E. Bogdanov and W. M. L. Holcombe (2001) 'Complete functional testing using object machines', ''Technical Report CS-01-18, Department of Computer Science'', University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt;  This model differs from the [[Stream X-Machine]] approach, in that the monolithic data type X is distributed over, and encapsulated by, several objects, which are serially composed; and systems are driven by method invocations and returns, rather than by inputs and outputs.  
Further work in this area concerned adapting the formal testing theory in the context of inheritance, which partitions the state-space of the superclass in extended subclass objects.&lt;ref name="Simo06"&gt;A. J. H. Simons (2006) 'A theory of regression testing for behaviourally compatible object types', ''Software Testing, Verification and Reliability'', '''16''' ''(3)'', John Wiley, pp. 133-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "CCS-augmented X-machine" (CCSXM) model was later developed by Simons and Stannett in 2002 to support complete behavioural testing of object-oriented systems, in the presence of asynchronous communication&lt;ref
  name="SS02"&gt;M. Stannett and A. J. H. Simons (2002)
  'CCS-Augmented X-Machines', 
  ''Technical Report CS-2002-04, Department of Computer Science'', Sheffield University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is expected to bear some similarity with [[NASA]]'s recent proposal; but no definitive comparison of the two models has as yet been conducted.
