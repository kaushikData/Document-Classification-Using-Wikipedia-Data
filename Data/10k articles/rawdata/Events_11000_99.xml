{{Muhammad cartoons}}
The '''2010 Copenhagen terror plot''' was a terrorist plot against ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'', the publisher of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversial cartoons]] of [[Muhammad]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doku.nu/2018/10/08/terroristen-forsokte-radikalisera-sina-medfangar/|title=Terroristen försökte radikalisera sina medfångar – Doku.nu|website=doku.nu|language=sv-SE|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In December the most serious terror operation ever uncovered in Denmark before the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]] was thwarted by a successful cooperation between security services in Denmark and Sweden. Police, accompanied by bomb experts, conducted several raids and detained five men,&lt;ref name="thelocal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedes arrested over 'Muhammad cartoon plot' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/31144/20101229/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were described as [[militant]] [[islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Arrest `Militant Islamists' Planning Attack in Denmark |first=Christian |last=Wienberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-29/five-people-arrested-in-denmark-sweden-under-suspicion-of-terrorist-plot.html |newspaper=[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]] |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automatic weapons, together with ammunition and silencers, were seized by the police. Plastic strips to use as handcuffs were also found.

The terrorists alledegly plotted to conduct a "Mumbai-style" attack on Jyllands-Posten to revenge the 2005 publishing of the cartoons portraying Muhammad as a terrorist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark and Sweden arrest five over suspected 'Mumbai-style' terror plot |first=Peter |last=Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/29/denmark-arrests-terror-plot |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
As suspects they had been under surveillance for an extended period of time and the arrests were the result of a long investigation.&lt;ref name="cphpost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/crime/50741-five-arrested-for-planning-imminent-attack.html|title=Five arrested for planning imminent attack|date=29 December 2010|newspaper=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group travelled to Copenhagen 27 December 2010, Zalouti changed his mind the way to Denmark and returned to Järfälla. Police arrested the group 28 December 2010 in Copenhagen and Zalouti was arrested on the same day in Sweden.&lt;ref name="expo5jun2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expo.se/2012/svenska-terrorister-doms-till-langa-fangelsestraff_5088.html|title=(se) Svenska terrorister döms till långa fängelsestraff|date=5 June 2012|accessdate=9 April 2017|publisher=Expo.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
The men are charged with attempted terrorism and unlawful possession of weapons (a machine gun with silencer, a pistol and more than 100 cartridges).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BT1QV20101230|title=Three charged over plot to attack Danish newspaper|last=Fraende|first=Mette|date=30 December 2010|accessdate=1 January 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/utrikes/haktningsforhandling-i-kopenhamn_5837431.svd|title=Häktningsförhandling i Köpenhamn|last=Chaaban|first=Sebastian|date=30 December 2010|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=1 January 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 June 2012 the four named above were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[[:da:Terrorsagen mod Jyllands-Posten i december 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was silent during the proceedings of the lower instance (Danish: ''Byret''), but told his version of events in the next instance (Danish: ''Landsret''). The state prosecutor demanded a 14 year sentence, while a [[lay judge]] recommended a 10 year sentence. The judges and the other lay judges chose a sentence of 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://journalisten.dk/12-aars-faengsel-terrorplaner-mod-jppolitiken|title=12 års fængsel for terrorplaner mod JP/Politiken|date=2013-01-31|work=Journalisten|access-date=2018-10-13|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in prison he attempted to contact others by connecting other participants to a phonecall with his wife, thereby attempting to communicate with people he was forbidden to contact.

As a consequence he has at times been put in [[Isolation cell|isolation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*''NN'', 26, Iraqi - arrested in [[Greve Municipality|Greve]], later released though suspicions remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four Danish terror plot suspects remanded in custody |first=Jasmina |last=Nielsen |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/four-danish-terror-plot-suspects-remanded-in-custody-20101230-19awt.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 December 2010 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munir Awad was previously arrested in Pakistan in 2009 on suspicions of terrorism, together with [[Mehdi Ghezali]], a former [[Guantanamo]]-detainee.  Notably, Munir Awad is the son-in-law of [[Helena Benaouda]], head of the [[Muslim Council of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="aftonbladet2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Min svärson torterades |first=Oisín |last=Cantwell |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article5959502.ab |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |date=14 October 2009 |language=Swedish |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led some Swedish newspaper editors to question Benaouda's role as head of one of the country's largest Muslim organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/ledare/1.2273383/sluta-blunda Sluta blunda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103132922/http://www.expressen.se/ledare/1.2273383/sluta-blunda |date=2011-01-03 }}, editorial in Expressen 31 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sn.se/asikter/opinion/1.913559 Krönika: Svärmodern som inget såg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111134411/http://www.sn.se/asikter/opinion/1.913559 |date=2011-01-11 }}, Lars Kriss in Södermanlads Nyheter, January 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The suspects' various ties to the [[Stockholm Mosque|Stockholm Grand Mosque]] also stirred up some media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2273609/hon-har-gjort-sig-oantraffbar Hon har gjort sig oanträffbar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dagen.se/dagen/article.aspx?id=241228 |title=Delade lägenhet med terroristdömda |access-date=2011-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001023623/http://www.dagen.se/dagen/article.aspx?id=241228 |archive-date=2011-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahbi Zalouti has also been previously arrested in Pakistan in 2009 on suspicions of terrorism, roughly at the same time as Munir Awad though not together.

== Reactions ==
* {{flag|Sweden}} – [[Abd al Haqq Kielan]], the imam at the Sabirin Mosque in [[Eskilstuna]] said in an interview that "These people do things that are explicitly forbidden in Islam. They make our religion to appear cruel and brutal." The imam also said that "the prophet is very clear on this: A muslim must not be unloyal to the country one lives in, much less the country that received you, given you a visa, residence permit and protection when one most need it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kand-imam-de-har-inget-att-gora-med-islam|title=Det är perverst att de kallar sig muslimer|date=1 January 2011|newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=1 January 2011|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"cyber thief"). Hold claimed the hack was perpetrated through the use of [[SQL injection]].&lt;ref name="Politico_August_6_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/russian-hacking-gang-usernames-passwords-109741.html |title=Russian hacking gang steals more than 1 billion usernames and passwords|newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=August 5, 2014  |first=Joseph|last=Marks|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/08/russian-hackers-stole-12-billion-passwords-20148752422349560.html Al Jazeera: Russian hackers stole 1.2 billion passwords]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] article, Hold Security says that not all the 1.2 billion credentials were stolen this way, there are also ones that CyberVor simply bought from people that used other means, and Hold Security doesn't know what the split is.&lt;ref name="ForbesDefense"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/08/12/alex-holden-explains-data-breach-profiteering-defense/ |title=The Man Who Found 1.2 Billion Stolen Passwords: Negative Publicity Harming My Business | date=August 12, 2014 |first=Brewster |last=Thomas |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |publisher=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Hold Security==

Forbes columnist, Kashmir Hill, noted "The Internet predictably panicked as the story of yet another massive password breach went viral." and "[T]his is a pretty direct link between a panic and a pay-out for a security firm."&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/08/05/huge-password-breach-shady-antics/ |title=Firm That Exposed Breach Of 'Billion Passwords' Quickly Offered $120 Service To Find Out If You're Affected | date=August 5, 2014 |first=Kashmir |last=Hill |accessdate=August 7, 2014 |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hold Security's website has a service offering people to check if their username and password pair has been stolen. It requires people to send Hold Security encrypted versions of their passwords.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skepticism ==

No named independent sources have come forward to confirm the breach,&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Forbes columnist, Joseph Steinberg, even expressed outright skepticism about many of the "facts" claimed about the breach, raising questions about the trustworthiness of the reports of the breach altogether. &lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''617 Patroclus''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|t|r|oʊ|k|l|ə|s}} {{Respell|pə|TROH|kləs}}), provisional designation ''{{mp|1906 VY}}'' is a binary [[Jupiter trojan]] approximately {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=off|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter.{{efn|name=Diameters}} It was discovered on 17 October 1906, by astronomer [[August Kopff]] at the [[Heidelberg Observatory]] in Germany. The [[asteroid]] was named after [[Patroclus]] from Greek mythology.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; It was the second trojan to be discovered and the only member of the [[Trojan camp]] named after a Greek character.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The dark [[D-type asteroid]] is also [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]] and one of the [[#Largest Jupiter trojans|largest Jupiter trojans]]. ''Patroclus'' is one of five Jovian asteroids targeted by the ''[[Lucy (spacecraft)|Lucy]]'' space probe to be visited in 2033. In 2001, a [[minor-planet moon|moon]] – later named '''Menoetius''', and slightly smaller than its primary – was discovered. It was the first discovery of [[binary asteroid]] among the Jupiter trojans.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;

== Orbit ==

''Patroclus'' orbits in Jupiter's trailing [[Lagrangian point]], {{L5}},&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt; in an area called the [[Trojan camp]] after one of the sides in the legendary [[Trojan War]] (the other node, at the {{L4|pt=yes}}, is called the "Greek camp").

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.5–5.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 11 years and 11 months (4,353 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.14 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 22[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The asteroid's [[observation arc]] begins at the discovering Heidelberg Observatory in November 1906, about 3 weeks after its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Binary system ==

In 2001, it was discovered that ''Patroclus'' is a [[binary asteroid|binary system]], made up of two components with a [[minor-planet moon]] of roughly similar size.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Merline"&gt;{{Citation| last=Merline| first=W.

In 2006, accurate measurements of the orbit from the [[Keck telescopes|Keck]] [[Laser guide star]] [[adaptive optics]] system were reported.&lt;ref name="Marchis2006" /&gt;

It was estimated&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{Citation| last=Sanders| first=Robert| year=2006| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/02/01_patroclus.shtml| title=Binary asteroid in Jupiter's orbit may be icy comet from solar system's infancy| publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the two components orbit around their [[center of mass]] in {{val|4.283|0.004}} days at a distance of {{val|680|20|u=km}} in a roughly circular orbit.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt; Combining these observations with thermal measurements taken in 2000, the sizes of the components of the system were estimated at 106&amp;nbsp;km and 98&amp;nbsp;km, with an equivalent whole-system diameter of 145&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;, refined by later measurements from the Keck Observatory to approximately 122&amp;nbsp;km and 112&amp;nbsp;km for each partner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://franckmarchis.com/trojan-binary-asteroid-patroclus-menoetius/ |title=Trojan Binary Asteroid – Patroclus &amp; Menoetius |last=Sanders |first=Robert |work=UC Berkeley |accessdate=2017-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a co-orbital period of {{val|103.5|0.3}} hours ({{val|4.3125|0.0125}} days)&lt;ref name="Marchis2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oey-2012c" /&gt;.

More recent direct optical measurements using stellar occlusion data pin the orbital distance closer to 664.6&amp;nbsp;km, and give a size for the slightly larger component, which retains the name Patroclus, as 124.6x98.2&amp;nbsp;km and overall volume equivalent to a 113&amp;nbsp;km sphere, with the smaller component, now named Menoetius ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|iː|ʃ|ə|s}} {{Respell|mi|NEE|shəs}}; official designation (617) Patroclus I Menoetius) after the legendary father of Patroclus, measuring 117.2x93.0&amp;nbsp;km with a volume equivalent to a 104&amp;nbsp;km diameter sphere&lt;ref name="Buie-2015" /&gt;. It was previously known by the [[provisional designation]] {{mp|S/2001 (617) 1}}.

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Lightcurves ===

Since 1989, several rotational [[lightcurve]]s of ''Patroclus'' have been obtained from photometric observations. Analysis of the best rated lightcurves gave a [[rotation period]] between 102.8 and 103.5 hours with a brightness amplitude of less than 0.1 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2/3/]]}}).&lt;ref name="Marchis-2006a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mueller-2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oey-2012c" /&gt; A low brightness variation typically indicates that a body has a nearly spheroidal shape. Its long rotation period makes it a [[List of slow rotators (minor planets)|slow rotator]].

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite [[IRAS]] and NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, the ''Patroclus'' system has an effective combined size between 140.36 and 140.92 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.047.&lt;ref name="Grav-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMPS" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0471 and a diameter of 140.92 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 8.19.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

{{Largest Jupiter trojans}}

=== Composition ===

Recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy like [[comet]]s, rather than rocky like most [[asteroid]]s. In the [[Tholen classification]], ''Patroclus'' is a dark [[P-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

Because the density of the components (0.88 g/cm³) is less than water and about one third that of rock, it was suggested that the Patroclus system, previously thought to be a pair of rocky [[asteroid]]s, is more similar to a [[comet]] in composition.&lt;ref name="Marchis2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marchis | first1 = F. | last2 = Hestroffer | first2 = D. | author1link = Franck Marchis| last3 = Descamps | first3 = P. | last4 = Berthier | first4 = J.

The binary resides in the [[Trojan camp]] at {{L5}}.

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after the Greek hero [[Patroclus]] from [[Greek mythology]]. Friend of [[Achilles]], he was killed by [[Hector]] during the [[Trojan War]] ''(see also {{MoMP|588|(588)}} and {{MoMP|624|(624)}})''. The minor planet's name was proposed by Austrian astronomer [[Johann Palisa]]. The official naming citation was mentioned in ''[[The Names of the Minor Planets]]'' by [[Paul Herget]] in 1955 ({{small|[[Herget's discovery circumstances|H 65]]}}).&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

''Patroclus'' is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek rather than a Trojan character. The naming conventions for the Jupiter trojans were not adopted until after Patroclus was named (similarly, the asteroid [[624 Hektor|Hektor]] is the only Trojan character to appear in the [[Greek camp]]).

== Notes ==
{{notelist|refs=

{{efn|name=Diameters|1= Buie (2015). Volume equivalent diameters based on derived ellipsods are: Patroclus: 113&amp;nbsp;km and Menoetius: 104&amp;nbsp;km, while for the combined system, a mean-diameter of 154&amp;nbsp;km is given. Measured by [[asteroid occultation]]. Alternative observations gave a combined diameter of 140 kilometers.

The year '''633 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 121 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 633 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.
 |date=1915
 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie
 |journal=Sitzungsberichte [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften]]
 |pages=778–786
 |language=German
 |bibcode=1915SPAW.......778E
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

'''''Army of Darkness''''' (referred to as '''''Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness''''' on its title card&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness - Studio Canal | url= http://www.studiocanal.co.uk/Film/Details/d8aec917-9448-499e-98fa-9e7f006298f3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1992 American [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film directed and co-written by [[Sam Raimi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/search/all/Army%20of%20Darkness |title=Army of Darkness|last=Williams|first=Karl|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-produced by [[Robert Tapert]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] and co-written by [[Ivan Raimi]]. It stars Campbell and [[Embeth Davidtz]]. It is the third installment in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise, and continuing from ''[[Evil Dead II]],'' [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is trapped in the [[Middle Ages]] and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.

The film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Studios]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]] were responsible for the Ash &amp; Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero &amp; Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |title=Book Of The Dead - The Definitive Evil Dead Website |publisher=Bookofthedead.ws |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Army of Darkness'' premiered at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to [[Irvin Shapiro]], who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.

== Plot ==
After being transported to the Middle Ages, [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a [[Witch-hunt|witch hunt]], and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. 

When he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely{{snd}} "[[Klaatu barada nikto]]"{{snd}} he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough "nikto". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.

Upon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]], and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.

Back in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a [[Winchester rifle]] from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims "hail to the king, baby" before passionately kissing the woman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/army-of-darkness-bubba-ho-top-comic-ash-elvis-evil-dead/|title=Ash Vs.

===Original ending===
In the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|title=10 Canceled Twists That Would’ve Saved Movies (And 10 That Would’ve Hurt Them)|author=Leon Miller|date=July 30, 2018|work=ScreenRant|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2018/08/21/bruce-campbell-ash-vs-evil-dead-3-sam-raimi-rob-tapert-lucy-lawless-starz/|title=Bruce Campbell Talks 'Ash Vs.

==Production==

===Development===
Plans to make a third ''[[Evil Dead]]'' film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of ''[[Darkman]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite news | last = Muir | first = John Kenneth | authorlink = John Kenneth Muir | title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi | work = | page = 152 | language = | publisher = Applause | year = 2004 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' made enough money internationally that [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was willing to finance a sequel.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt;  Director and script writer [[Sam Raimi]] drew from a variety of sources, including literature with ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' and [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and films like ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'',  [[The Three Stooges]], and  ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan The Barbarian]]''. ''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made".&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | authorlink = Bill Warren (film historian and critic) | title = The Evil Dead Companion | work = | page = 143 | language = | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2000 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot.  The working title for the project was ''Medieval Dead'',before it was later known as''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren2"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title "Army of Darkness" came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay and pre-production===
Initially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.&lt;ref name="Warren3"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] decided to co-write the film together.&lt;ref name="Warren4"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script.&lt;ref name="Warren4"/&gt; Campbell remembers, "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting".&lt;ref name="Warren"/&gt; Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.&lt;ref name="Warren6"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.&lt;ref name="Warren5"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Robert Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.&lt;ref name="Muir"/&gt; Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming]]'s film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt;

[[Traci Lords]] was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | title=Traci Lords |publisher= (chat transcript), [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] | date = January 25, 2001 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030729085136/http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | archivedate=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
[[Principal photography]] took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[Front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].&lt;ref name="Muir2"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.&lt;ref name="Muir2"/&gt; According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".&lt;ref name="Robley"&gt;{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | authorlink =  | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via "Go-Animation" |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |page = 74 | language = | publisher = | date = March 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.&lt;ref name="Warren9"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.&lt;ref name="Muir3"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.&lt;ref name="Warren7"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.&lt;ref name="Muir4"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.&lt;ref name="Muir5"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes".&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt; Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons{{clarify|date=January 2012}} that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.&lt;ref name="Muir5"/&gt;

===Post-production===
While [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.&lt;ref name="Muir6"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]].&lt;ref name="Muir6"/&gt; Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".&lt;ref name="Warren11"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character which Universal needed so that they could film a [[Hannibal (film)|sequel]] to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.&lt;ref name="Muir8"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for ''Army of Darkness''' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.

For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.&lt;ref name="Warren12"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi ran into further troubles when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt;

===Music===
[[Danny Elfman]], who composed the score for ''Darkman'', wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="Warren8"&gt;Warren 2000, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-shoots were completed, [[Joseph LoDuca]], who composed the music for ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', returned to score the film.&lt;ref name="Muir7"&gt;Muir 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the [[Seattle Symphony]].&lt;ref name="Warren8"/&gt; The score was released during the [[MondoCon]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on October 3 and 4, 2015, on [[Gramophone record|Vinyl]], over [[Mondo Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3356356/mondo-announces-army-darkness-vinyl-soundtrack/ |title=Mondo Announces ‘Army Of Darkness’ Vinyl Soundtrack |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a 72% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 46 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/army_of_darkness/ |title= ''Army of Darkness'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made its critical reception above average but much lower than ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', which received 96% and 98% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead/ |title=''The Evil Dead'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525174901/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead/| archivedate=May 25, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn/ |title=''Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn'' Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/army-of-darkness |title=Metacritic.com |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, "The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as ''Evil Dead II'', however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930219/REVIEWS/302190301/1023 | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] praised, "Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook."&lt;ref name="Maslin"&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | coauthors = | title = An Army of Skeletons In a Dark Ages Battle | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF123EF93AA25751C0A965958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=%22Army+of+Darkness%22&amp;st=nyt | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Desson Howe, in this review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film's style: "Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and others) are incredibly imaginative."&lt;ref name="Howe"&gt;{{cite news | last = Howe | first = Desson | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Washington Post]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 19, 1993 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/armyofdarknessrhowe_a0af6d.htm | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "C+" rating and wrote, "This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood extras]]. By the time ''Army of Darkness'' turns into a retread of ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'', featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | coauthors = | title = ''Army of Darkness'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = March 5, 1994 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305759,00.html | accessdate = July 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atlanta Fantasy Fair (AFF)''' was a [[List of multigenre conventions|multigenre convention]] which took place once each summer in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] from 1975–1995. Organized by A.C.F.F., Ltd., the convention was a nonprofit entity designed to promote the [[fantasy genre]] in the [[American Southeast]]. Over its two-decade run, the AFF featured hundreds of guests, encompassed hotels in [[downtown Atlanta]] and ran thousands of hours of programming for fans of [[science fiction]], fantasy, [[comic books]], and other elements of [[fandom]].

Most AFFs took place over three days, from Friday to Sunday. The convention featured a large range of [[popular culture|pop culture]] elements, primarily [[comic books]] but also [[science fiction]]/fantasy, film/television, animation, [[anime]], [[manga]], toys, [[horror fiction|horror]], and [[collectible card game]]s. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with industry professionals, the AFF often featured previews of upcoming films, and such evening events as a costume contest. The convention featured a large floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants.&lt;ref name=Keefer2 /&gt;

The Atlanta Fantasy Fair was a family-friendly event&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Henry, Scott |url=http://www.clatl.com/news/article/13007243/the-wizard-of-dragoncon-stands-trial |title=The wizard of Dragon*Con stands trial: The force behind Atlanta's largest sci-fi convention finds himself in his own world of darkness |newspaper=[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)]] |date=January 20, 2002 |access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that worked on a "membership" basis, which enabled attendees to gain admittance to the show for the entire weekend. The show was known for its program booklet (titled ''Visions'') and for the annual presentation of the Atlanta Fantasy Fair Award for Outstanding Achievement.

== History ==
The Atlanta Comics &amp; Fantasy Fair was founded in 1975 by Harley Anton,&lt;ref name=Keefer2 /&gt; [[Lamar Waldron]], and Gary Cook. The first convention was held July 22–24, 1975, at the Ramada Inn and Conference Center located near [[Interstate 85]] and [[Monroe Drive]]. The guest of honor was [[Marvel Comics]] figurehead [[Stan Lee]]. The convention offices were in [[Morrow, Georgia]].

Dr. [[Kenneth Smith (comics)|Kenneth Smith]], a local fantasy illustrator, small-press publisher, and philosophy professor, was a guest of every show from 1975 until 1988, when a dispute with an attendee led to him leaving and not coming back.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

By 1977 the co-chairmen of the convention were Harley Anton, Gary Cook, and [[Lamar Waldron]].

By 1982, the convention was officially being organized as a nonprofit through the organization Atlanta Comics &amp; Fantasy Fair, Ltd. In 1984, the AFF headquarters were in [[Marietta, Georgia]].

Waldron was displaced as convention chair after the 1986 convention.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Terry (alternately spelled as "Terri")&lt;ref name=Keefer2&gt;Keefer III, John. [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-06-18/features/8901310472_1_fiction-and-fantasy-star-trek-fantasy-art "Indulge Fantasies At Atlanta Sci-fi Fair,"] ''Sun-Sentinel'' (June 18, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Loggins was convention president from 1986-1989. In 1989, the AFF headquarters were in [[Norcross, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=Keefer2 /&gt;

The Atlanta Fantasy Fair, Inc. registered as a Georgia Domestic Non-Profit Corporation on August 12, 1991. Their headquarters were in [[Stockbridge, Georgia]], and the two principals were listed as CEO (Felton) Wayne Loggins and CFO David Denton.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaCorporate&gt;[http://www.georgiacorporates.com/corp/188295.html Company profile], GeorgiaCorporate.com.

By the early 1990s, attendance at AFF was declining, in many ways due to competition with the also Atlanta-based [[Dragon Con]] (est. 1987),&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt; as well as the collapse of the comic speculator market. The quality of guests began to decline and the show petered out in 1995.

Former Atlanta Fantasy Fair co-organizer Wayne Loggins attempted to rebrand the convention the next year, producing '''Atlanta StarCon &amp; Comics'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizapedia.com/ga/ATLANTA-STARCON-AND-COMICS-INC.html Atlanta StarCon and Comics registration as Georgia Domestic Profit Corporation], BizPedia (Aug. 14, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; on November 1–3, 1996. Held at the Atlanta Marriott North Central Hotel, the show boasted such guests as [[George Pérez]], [[Michael O'Hare]], [[Kane Hodder]], [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]]. Programming included a party at [[Planet Hollywood]], a masquerade contest, meals "with the stars," a dealer room, and gaming. The show was not enough of a success to continue the following year.

== ''Visions'' ==
From 1979–1987, the convention produced ''Visions,'' a program booklet given out to convention attendees. Each issue of the AFF [[zine]] highlighted that year's special guests, publishing biographies and checklists of their work. Each issue also featured pinup illustrations by professional and amateur artists. ''Visions'' was published by convention organizers Gary Cook and [[Lamar Waldron]], and then, beginning with issue #4 (1982), under the name Atlanta Comics &amp; Fantasy Fair, Ltd. ''Visions'' was edited by Lamar Waldron and was typically 12" x 9" in size.

''Visions'' #1 (1979) features the first appearance of [[Bob Burden]]'s [[Flaming Carrot]]. ''Visions'' #3 (1981) contains an extremely rare early Flaming Carrot story by Burden.

The AFF published 4,000 copies of ''Visions'' #4 (1982), which contained a [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] [[Batman]] pinup, a Miller checklist, a [[Forrest J Ackerman]] article written by [[Robert Bloch]], artwork by [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Will Eisner]], and the fourth appearance of Burden's Flaming Carrot.

''Visions'' #5 featured checklists of the books of [[Robert Bloch]] and [[Larry Niven]], and "Remembering [[Boris Karloff]]" by [[Forrest J Ackerman]]. The cover depicted model Susan Barrow (a.k.a. Susie the Floozie).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Atlanta Fantasy Fair Awards ==
In 1982 the Atlanta Fantasy Fair Award for Outstanding Achievement was established, bestowed for lifetime achievement in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, horror, comics, and related fields in any medium. The prize (sculpted by Edward Knox) was a [[sterling silver]] [[statuette]] of "Miss Fantasy Fair," with an elaborate [[headdress]] and a diamond in one eye.

Winners were required to be present to claim the award, or it would pass to the next choice. The inaugural recipient was science fiction and fantasy fan, spokesman, and promoter [[Forrest J Ackerman]].

'''August Valentine Kautz''' (January 5, 1828 – September 4, 1895) was a [[German-American]] soldier and [[Union Army]] [[cavalry]] officer during the [[American Civil War]]. He was the author of several army manuals on duties and customs eventually adopted by the U.S. military.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Ispringen]], Baden, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/august-valentine-kautz|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kautz immigrated with his parents to [[Brown County, Ohio]] in 1832. He later enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|Private]] in the [[1st Ohio Infantry]], serving in the [[Mexican–American War]] from 1846 to 1847.

Entering the [[United States Military Academy]] following the war, Kautz graduated in the class of 1852. He primarily served at [[Fort Steilacoom]] in the Pacific Northwest, where he was wounded twice with the [[U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment|4th U.S. Infantry]] during [[Rogue River Wars]] with Indians along the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in 1855, and also served in the [[Puget Sound War]] in 1856. He was rewarded with a commission as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]].

On July 16, 1857, Kautz made what is sometimes credited as the first ascent of [[Mount Rainier]].  Kautz is reported as having climbed to the edge of Rainier's crater rim, but as he did not make the final walk to Rainier's Columbia Crest, his ascent has often been described as incomplete.&lt;ref name=majors&gt;{{Cite book |last=Majors |first=Harry M. |title=Exploring Washington |publisher=Van Winkle Publishing Co |year=1975 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-918664-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in the Pacific Northwest, Kautz became a supporter of [[Chief Leschi]], who was executed in 1858. Kautz believed the execution was illegal and that Leschi should have been considered a prisoner of war. Shortly before Leschi's execution, Kautz published two issues of a newspaper defending him. The newspaper was called the ''Truth Teller'', and its masthead stated: "Devoted to the Dissemination of Truth and the Suppression of Humbug."

From 1859 to 1860, he traveled in Europe. In August 1860, under Major George A. H. Blake's command, he traveled with recruits on a march from [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]] to [[Vancouver Barracks|Fort Vancouver]], commanding a detachment of 150 recruits, which broke off from the main group at [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]] to begin service at [[Fort Colville (US Army)|Colville Depot]], Washington Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7992|title=U.S. Army founds Fort Colville on June 20, 1859. - HistoryLink.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fort Colville Military Log and Correspondence microfilms from NARA viewed at Colville Public Library&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the Eastern United States in April 1861, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities between the Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

==Civil War==
Kautz was a captain with the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Cavalry]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] from April to July 1862. Transferred to the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], Kautz later assisted in operations as a colonel with the [[2nd Ohio Cavalry]] against Confederate General [[John Hunt Morgan]]'s highly successful [[Morgan's Raid|raid]] behind Union lines in [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]] during June–July 1863 and under the command of [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ambrose Burnside]] at the [[Battle of Fort Sanders|Battle of Knoxville]] from September to December 1863.

Promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers on April 16, 1864, Kautz led cavalry operations under the command of Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] during [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant's]] [[Richmond-Petersburg Campaign|campaigns]] against Richmond and Petersburg between April and June 1864. His cavalry division was a part of the [[Army of the James]] and was forced to withdraw from its position at [[First Battle of Deep Bottom|White's Tavern]] following an attack by parts of Confederate Lt. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s Corps. On December 12, 1864, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Kautz for appointment to the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] grade of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers, to rank from October 28, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]], ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}. p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; He was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, 2001, pp. 327-328&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 17, 1866, President [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Kautz for appointment to the [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] grade of [[Major general (United States)|major general]], U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 708&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 1865, Kautz marched into [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in command of a division of [[United States Colored Troops|colored troops]] which belonged to [[Godfrey Weitzel]]'s [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|XXV Corps]]. He was active during the Union pursuit of [[Robert E. Lee]] from April 2 to April 9, 1865, until Lee's surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]].

==After the Civil war==
{{expand section|date=October 2010}}
After the war, Kautz served (from May to June 1865) on the trial board investigating the conspirators involved in the assassination of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], before performing extensive service in the southwest frontier, including as the commander of the Department of Arizona and commanding officer of [[Fort McDowell, Arizona|Fort McDowell]]. He was appointed commander of the [[Department of the Columbia]] in July 1891 with the rank of [[brigadier general]]. After leaving military service in 1892, he lived in retirement until his death at [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

'''Balloons over Waikato''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] that has been running for the last 15 years, held in [[Hamilton, New Zealand]]. It is held over five days during autumn and attracts both local and overseas balloonists. The Festival is held primarily at [[Innes Common]], at [[Lake Rotoroa, Waikato|Hamilton Lake]], which gets an estimated 130,000 visitors during the festival. The highlight of the festival, the "[[Night glow]]" is held at the [[University of Waikato]] where an estimated 80,000+ people attend to watch the lighting of balloons putting on a spectacular glow to music.

Events in the festival include sunrise and sunset launches, a balloon basket glow in the city's Garden Place, the "Night Glow", a morning "Key Grab" competition where balloonists must attempt to secure a key placed on a pole in Innes Common and a Dawn Patrol where a select number of balloons inflate and lift off at dawn creating a magical glow in the sky.

The '''Saint Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre''' (The Big Stone Theatre of Saint Petersburg, {{lang-ru|Большой Каменный Театр}}) was a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

It was built in 1783 to [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]]'s Neoclassical design as the Kamenny (i.e., Stone) Theatre; [[Giovanni Paisiello]]’s opera ''Il mondo della luna'' was performed at the opening on 24 September.&lt;ref name=mariinsky&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=28 December 2016  |url=https://www.mariinsky.ru/en/about/history/mariinsky_theatre/
|title=Mariinsky Theatre: History of the Theatre
|publisher=Mariinsky Theatre |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rebuilt in 1802 according to the designs of the architect [[Thomas de Thomon]] and renamed the Bolshoi, but burned down in 1811.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt; The building was restored in 1818, and modified between 1826 and 1836 by [[Alberto Cavos]] to accommodate more modern machinery.&lt;ref name=mariinsky/&gt;

Until 1886, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was principal theatre for both the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] and the Imperial Russian Opera. It was there that the first Russian operas — [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' and ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' — were premiered. Although the theatre would include many of the great Russian operas in its repertory, many of the works of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their world premieres on the stage of the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]].  Many of the great 19th century ballets of [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] were given for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre.

In 1886 the building was declared unsafe and, at the behest of the theatre director [[Ivan Vsevolozhsky]], the [[ballet]] and [[opera]] performances moved to the [[Imperial Mariinsky Theatre]], where they have remained ever since. The Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was then torn down to make place for the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. The only surviving sections of the original theatre are the grand staircase and landing, preserved in the building of the conservatory.

'''Commercial Paper Funding Facility''' (CPFF) was a system created by the United States [[Federal Reserve Board]] during the [[Global financial crisis of 2008]] to improve liquidity in the short-term funding markets. The CPFF was created on 27 October 2008 and funded a [[special purpose vehicle]] (SPV) that purchased three-month unsecured and [[asset-backed commercial paper]] (CP) from eligible issuers. This resulted in greater availability of credit for firms doing business. It worked under the aegis of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] where the NY Fed finances the purchase of highly rated unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible issuers via eligible primary dealers. The facility expired February 1, 2010. The final CP purchased matured on April 26, 2010. All CP notes purchased were repaid in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Reform|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_cpff.html}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
The CPFF began operations on October 27, 2008 following the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] and government bailout of [[AIG]] and the global credit freeze that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through an SPV, which bought unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper for three-month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained in the custody of the SPV until the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers.  This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed.  45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms.  Research shows that [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout.  The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Linus and Wu, Yan, Does Receiving TARP Funds Make it Easier to Roll Your Commercial Paper Onto the Fed? (August 22, 2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1911454&lt;/ref&gt;

This program was created at the same time that the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] implemented the [[Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program]] to increase liquidity in inter-bank lending.

== Eligibility ==
Only "Active" U.S. issuers of commercial paper (including those with a foreign parent), were eligible to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Active was defined as having at least three consecutive months of commercial paper outstanding during the period starting January 1, 2008 through August 31, 2008.

The commercial paper had to be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must have been rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs.

As part of the application process to be eligible for this program issuers had to pay a 10 basis point (0.1%) fee based on their maximum CP balance during the active period mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Paper Funding Facility|url=http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/cpff_faq.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camp Hyrule''' was an annual online virtual camp that was sponsored and moderated by [[Nintendo of America]]. It first opened in the summer of 1995, and emerged as Nintendo’s biggest online event. Camp Hyrule, which was usually held in August, allowed Nintendo fanatics to chat, play online games, and win prizes under the supervision of Nintendo employees and ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' [[columnist]]s. The camp's name is [[eponymous]] to the fictional land of [[Hyrule]], a prominent and recurring setting in [[The Legend of Zelda series|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. The last camp was in 2007, with no plans to host another Camp Hyrule.

==Background==
Essentially an online simulation of a [[summer camp]], Camp Hyrule had refined many traditional outdoor themes, such as [[campfires]], [[water sports]], and [[archery]] into many [[Java (programming language)|Java-based games]]. Participants were assigned to cabins, where they worked with other teammates to earn points by participating in games, Photoshop contests, and other activities. After the camp session ended, the cabin with the most points won a special prize, while runner-up cabins received other consolation prizes.

The camp was also used to promote various Nintendo-related products. In past years, some of the camp's games have revolved around ''[[1080° Avalanche]]'', the [[Game Boy Advance SP]], and ''[[Donkey Konga]].'' Additionally, the camp had a theme, related to an upcoming video game, that often prompted mini-story line. For example, in 2005, the camp's design and layout reflected the upcoming ''[[Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]''. Nintendo went to further detail to add a story line to that camp session, in which games and layouts were mysteriously vanishing at the hands of an evil force. Nevertheless, all the issues were always resolved at the camp's closing ceremony, where awards and grand prize winners were announced.

Camp Hyrule was moderated and maintained by [[Nintendo of America]]'s online staff. Staff members, called counselors, were responsible for moderating their assigned cabin’s [[message board]] and [[chat rooms]], while also advocating participants to earn points. The camp’s staff also sent participants daily emails pertaining to earning points or the camp’s plot developments. In recent years, Nintendo had turned to the ''NSider Forums'', their official online community, in order to provide additional moderators. Camp Hyrule also had a [[mascot]], named Stumpy, who was often seen wandering the campgrounds.

The community elements were removed from Camp Hyrule in 2007, coinciding with the closing of the NSider forums and the impending switch from in-house publication of [[Nintendo Power]] to publication by [[Future US]], which occurred in November 2007.

==Registration==
Unless announced otherwise, Nintendo usually opened registration for Camp Hyrule in late July or early August. Although there was no limit as to how many users could sign up, registration was only open for one week. To register, one first needed to acquire a "My Nintendo" account (which Nintendo has since phased out to bring [[Club Nintendo]] to the US), and then visit the official Camp Hyrule website for further instructions.

The 2007 year camp was open from August 13 to August 23 to all My Nintendo members, and registration was not required.

==Notable landmarks==
Camp Hyrule features several landmarks which have appeared year after year on the campgrounds:
* '''NOA HQ''', a [[chatroom]] exclusive to Nintendo of America employees. It also serves as the camp's [[command center]].
* '''Trading Post''', an area where updates regarding announcements, contests, and other miscellaneous information are disseminated to users by camp counselors.
* '''First Aid Hut''', an area which offers users technical support.
* '''The Amphitheater''', a [[chatroom]] which hosts special events, such as interviews from Nintendo officials, and the camp’s annual closing ceremony.
* '''Lake Webaconda''', an area which features games related to [[water sport]] activities, such as fishing and boating.
* '''The Bonfire,''' usually the camp's largest "general discussion" chat room.
* '''Stumpy's Stable''', where users can play a game in which they feed Stumpy, the camp's mascot.
* '''The [[Hyrule#Lost Woods|Lost Woods]]''', a chatroom for discussion of [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]], often secretly used by the majority of the veterans from the "Trivia HQ", one of the Live Chats on the NSider forums during Camp Hyrule as a substitute place to chat. The Annual Lost Woods Trivia was also hosted here by TSA.
* '''Maniac's Cave''', a secret chatroom inside Camp Hyrule, the Camp Maniac would occasionally come out and boot everyone out of the chatroom.
* '''Kirby's Mess Hall''', a chat formerly called "Mess Hall" until Kirby took over. Users were virtually fed "food" and it was a general discussion chat.
* '''Mr. Pickle's Crib''', a chat only open to NOA Shaun when he decides to use it.

==History==
*Camp Hyrule was first held from August 15 to August 19, 1995 on [[AOL]].
*In 1997, Camp Hyrule was moved from [[AOL]] to www.nintendo.com
*In 1999, Camp Hyrule moved to the more familiar "www.camphyrule.com".
*Beginning with the 2000 camp, campgrounds were designed around a theme based on an upcoming console or game release. The first theme used was ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''.
*In 2000, Camp Hyrule began the tradition of ending each year's camp with a disaster.
*In 2002, registration quotas were finally removed due to popular request. Prior to 2002, Camp Hyrule was limited to the 500-2000 registrants, thus causing intense competition and often overloading the servers.
*In 2002, a majority of the camp's themes were renamed to make the camp more Nintendo related.
*In 2005, each member of the winning cabin received a free Stumpy T-shirt.
*In 2006, due to [[glitch]]es the closing ceremonies were delayed for two hours.
*In 2006, all campers were entered into a [[sweepstakes]] to win a [[Wii]].
*In 2007, the site's administrators announced they will remove Camp Hyrule's community elements. Also, all participants in the United States were able to enter a sweepstakes to win a life-size [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] statue.
*The 2008 event was nonexistent.
*In 2009, the Camp Hyrule page originally directed to the [[Nintendo.com]] home page, though it eventually relaunched in the archived 2007 format.

The {{nihongo|'''Chrysanthemum Throne'''|皇位|kōi|lit. "Imperial seat"}} is the [[throne]] of the [[Emperor of Japan]]. The term also can refer to very specific seating, such as the ''takamikura'' (高御座) throne in the Shishin-den at [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]]&lt;!-- NengoCalc 昭和三年十一月十日 --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ponsonby-Fane|Ponsonby-Fane, Richard]]. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other thrones or seats that are used by the Emperor during official functions, such as those used in the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]] or the throne used in the [[Speech from the Throne#Other countries|Speech from the Throne]] ceremony in the [[National Diet]], are, however, not known as the "Chrysanthemum Throne".&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Walter Wallace.

In a [[Metonymy|metonymic]] sense, the "Chrysanthemum Throne" also refers [[rhetorically]] to the [[head of state]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David. (1858).

==History==
[[File:Main Building of Meiji Palace.JPG|thumb|left|upright|This [[Meiji period]] throne room was used by Emperor [[Hirohito]]. This room was destroyed in World War II.]]
Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary [[monarchy]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, David.

February 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same sense as the British [[The Crown|Crown]], the Chrysanthemum Throne is an abstract [[metonymic]] concept that represents the monarch and the legal authority for the existence of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David. (1858). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BmMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=throne+of+england&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA153,M1 ''The preceptor's assistant, or, Miscellaneous questions in general history, literature and science'', p. 153.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike its British counterpart, the concepts of Japanese monarchy evolved differently before 1947 when there was, for example, no perceived separation of the property of the nation-state from the person and personal holdings of the Emperor.

According to legend, the Japanese monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BC by [[Emperor Jimmu]]; [[Akihito]] is the 125th monarch to occupy the Chrysanthemum Throne. The extant historical records only reach back to [[Emperor Ōjin]], who is considered to have reigned into the early 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Titsingh|Titsingh, Isaac]]. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA19,M1 ''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' pp. 19]-21; [[H. Paul Varley|Varley, H. Paul]]. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki,'' pp. 103-110; [[William George Aston|Aston, William George]]. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1IJrNAKBpycC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=nihongi+aston&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA254,M1 ''Nihongi'', pp. 254]-271.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The chrysanthemum is a symbol of the emperor and the imperial house. In particular, a "chrysanthemum crest" (菊花紋章, ''kikukamonshō'' or'' kikkamonshō''), i.e. a ''[[mon (crest)|mon]]'' of chrysanthemum blossom design, indicates a link to the emperor. Notable uses of and reference to the imperial chrysanthemum include the [[Imperial Seal of Japan]], a number of formerly state-endowed shrines (官国弊社, ''kankokuheisha'') have adopted a chrysanthemum crest, and the Supreme [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]]. 

The current [[Constitution of Japan]] considers the Emperor as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people." The modern Emperor is a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisman, Steven R. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DD133CF931A25752C1A966958260 "Japan Enthrones Emperor Today in Old Rite With New Twist,"] ''New York Times.'' November 12, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The metonymic meanings of "Chrysanthemum Throne" encompass the modern monarchy and the chronological list of legendary and historical monarchs of Japan.

==Takamikura==
[[File:Imperial Throne of Shishinden in Kyoto Imperial Palace.jpg|thumb|The ''Takamikura'' throne kept in the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]].]]
The throne {{Nihongo|''Takamikura''|[[:ja:高御座|高御座]]}} is located in the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It is the oldest surviving throne used by the monarchy. It sits on an octagonal dais, {{convert|5|m}} above the floor. It is separated from the rest of the room by a [[Sudare|curtain]]. The sliding door that hides the Emperor from view is called the {{Nihongo|''kenjō no shōji''|[[:ja:賢聖障子|賢聖障子]]}}, and has an image of 32 celestial saints painted upon it, which became one of the primary models for all of [[Heian period]] painting. The throne is used mainly for the [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|enthronement ceremony]], along with the twin throne {{Nihongo|''michodai''|御帳台|extra=august seat of the [[Empress of Japan|Empress]]}}.

==Rhetorical usage==
This flexible English term is also a [[rhetorical]] [[trope (linguistics)|trope]]. Depending on context, the Chrysanthemum Throne can be construed as a [[metonymy]], which is a rhetorical device for an allusion relying on proximity or correspondence, as for example referring to actions of the [[Emperor]] or as "actions of the Chrysanthemum Throne."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Peter. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=A1nJbdwgQVUC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=taisho+speech+from+the+throne&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a  ''The Chrysanthemum Throne,'' p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chrysanthemum throne is also understood as a [[synecdoche]], which is related to metonymy and metaphor in suggesting a play on words by identifying a closely related conceptualization, e.g.,

* referring to a part with the name of the whole, such as "Chrysanthemum Throne" for the mystic process of transferring Imperial authority—as in:
: December 18, 876 (''[[Jōgan]] 18, on the 29th day of the 11th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 貞観十八年十一月二十九日 --&gt;:  In the 18th year of [[Emperor Seiwa]]'s reign (清和天皇18年), he ceded the Chrysanthemum Throne to his son, which meant that the young child received the succession (‘‘senso’’).  Shortly thereafter, [[Emperor Yōzei]] is said to have formally acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).&lt;ref&gt;Titsigh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA122,M1  p. 122]; [[Delmer Brown|Brown, Delmer M.]] (1979). ''Gukanshō,'' pp. 288; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]],  Yōzei, [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami|Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as "Chrysanthemum Throne" for the serial symbols and ceremonies of enthronement—as in:
: January 20, 877 (''[[Gangyō]] 1, on the 3rd day of the 1st month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc  元慶一年一月三日 --&gt; Yōzei was formally installed on the Chrysanthemum Throne;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The enthronement ceremony (''sokui'') is something of a misnomer in English since no throne is used, but the throne is used in a larger and more public ceremony that follows later. ''See'' Berry, Mary Elizabeth. (1989). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEGjGOphv_wC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=richard+ponsonby-fane&amp;lr=  ''Hideyoshi,'' p. 245 n6.]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the beginning of a new ''[[nengō]]'' was proclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA122,M1  p. 122.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* referring to the general with the specific, such as "Chrysanthemum Throne" for Emperorship or ''senso''—as in:
:Before Emperor Yōzei ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his ''imina'')&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 264; up until the time of [[Emperor Jomei]], the personal names of the Emperors (their ''imina'') were very long and people did not generally use them.  The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign.&lt;/ref&gt; was Sadakira ''Shinnō'' (貞明親王).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA121,M1  p. 121]; Varley, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

* referring to the specific with the general, such as "Chrysanthemum Throne" for the short reign of Emperor Yōzei or equally as well for the ambit of the Imperial system.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Jonathan.  [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/28/japan.worlddispatch  "The Emperor's new roots: The Japanese Emperor has finally laid to rest rumours that he has Korean blood, by admitting that it is true,"] ''The Guardian'' (London). 28 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the State Visit in 2007 of the Emperor and Empress of Japan to the United Kingdom, the ''Times'' reported that "last night’s dinner was as informal as it could get when the House of Windsor entertains the Chrysanthemum Throne."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1857043.ece Hamilton, Alan. "Palace small talk problem solved: royal guest is a goby fish fanatic,"] ''The Times'' (London). May 30, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conímbriga''' is one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements excavated in [[Portugal]], and was classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]] in 1910. Located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of Condeixa-a-Velha e Condeixa-a-Nova, in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Condeixa-a-Nova]], it is situated {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the municipal seat and {{convert|16|km|mi}} from [[Coimbra]] (the Roman town of ''[[Aeminium]]'').

Conímbriga is a walled urban settlement, encircled by a curtain of stone structures approximately {{convert|1500|m|ft}} long. Entrance to the settlement is made from vaulted structures consisting of two doors (one on hinges), and at one time was defended by two towers. The walls are paralleled by two passages, channelled to excavations, in order to remove water infiltration from the walls. The urban settlement consists of various structures such as a forum, basilica and commercial shops, thermal spas, aqueducts, insulae, homes of various heights (including interior patios) and [[domus]] (such as the ''Casa dos Repuxos'' and ''Casa de Cantaber''), in addition to paleo-Christian basilica.

A visitors' centre (which includes restaurant/café and gift-shop) was constructed to display objects found by archaeologists during their excavations, including coins, surgical tools, utensils and ceramics.

==History==

Like many archaeological sites, Conímbriga was evolved sequentially and built up by successive layers, with the primary period of occupation beginning in the 9th century; during this period the area was occupied by a [[Castro culture]].&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2710 |title=Cidade romana de Conímbriga/Ruínas de Conímbriga  (IPA.00002710/PT020604050001) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=João |last=Cravo |first2=Horácio |last2=Bonifácio |first3=Carlos |last3=Amaral |year=2005 |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conimbriga.pt/portugues/ruinas.html |title=Conimbriga - Ruínas, Museu monográfico |year=2000 |accessdate=2011-10-28 |publisher=Museu Monográfico de Conimbriga/IPM |language=Portuguese |location=Coimbra, Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Roman occupation, the [[Conii]] peoples (who would later settle in southern Portugal) occupied the settlement.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The Conímbriga designation came from ''conim'', used by pre-European indigenous to designate ''the place of rocky eminence'', and ''briga'', the Celtic suffix meaning "citadel".&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This site had become a junction between the road that linked [[Olisipo]] to [[Bracara Augusta]], by way of [[Aeminium]] (Coimbra).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Around 139 BC, Romans began arriving in the area, as a consequence of the expeditionary campaigns of Decimus Junius Brutus.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/pt/patrimonio/patrimonio-imovel/pesquisa-do-patrimonio/classificado-ou-em-vias-de-classificacao/geral/view/70107/ |title=Ruínas de Conímbriga |publisher=Direção-Geral de Património Cultural |editor=GIF/IPPAR |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=A. |last=Martins |accessdate=19 April 2015 |date=28 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Conímbriga was already a built-up settlement. The Romans introduced the formal organization of space to the settlement. Owing to the peaceful nature of rural Lusitania, [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of the indigenous population was quick and Conímbriga, inevitably, became a prosperous town.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

Between 69 and 79 AD, during the reign of Vespasian, Conímbriga was elevated to the status of ''[[municipium]]''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; At that time, new urban programs were initiated. Judging by the capacity of the amphitheatre, by this time, the city had an estimated population of approximately 10600.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Alarcão (1999), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new colonists came from the Italian peninsula (like the [[Lucanus (disambiguation)|Lucanus]], [[Murrius]], [[Vitellius]] and [[Aponia]] families) and intermarried with local inhabitants (such as the [[Turrania]], [[Valeria (disambiguation)|Valeria]], [[Alios]] and [[Maelo]] families).

Construction of the ''Casa dos Repuxos'' began in the 2nd century, likely over a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; At the end of the 3rd century, the Augustian walls were replaced by the existing structures.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; In addition there was a remodelling of the baths and construction of a majority of the larger homes of the town, leading to the construction of the paleo-Christian basilica in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Between 465 and 468, invasions by [[Sueves]] caused the destruction of the city, and its inhabitants dispersed, some into slavery.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The bishopric of Conímbriga was established between 561 and 572, under the direction of Lucêncio, its first bishop. By 589, Conímbriga ceased to be the episcopal seat, and was transferred to [[Aeminium]], which later became Coimbra.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Kingdom===
During the reign of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]] (1519), the king ordered the inscriptions on the facade of the Church of Condeixa-a-Nova.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In the 18th century, Conímbriga was first referred to in parochial documents, resulting in the 1869 visit by Hubner to the site. In 1873, the ''Instituto de Coimbra'' (''Coimbra Institute'') was created, in addition to the formation of a museum dedicated to archaeology, instigating the first formal excavations at Conímbriga in 1873.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Mosaics were removed from the uncovered homes and the first excavations were made in 1899, resulting in the plan for the oppidum.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Republic===
In 1911, the Coimbra Institute ceded its collection to the Museum Machado de Castro, resulting in the beginnings of the studies by Augusto Filipe Simões and António Augusto Gonçalves.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On the occasion of the 11th International Congress on Archaeology and Pre-History (1930) in Portugal, the state acquired the first lands and official excavations on the site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; At the time of this congress the eastern gates to the city were unobstructed. The following year the DGEMN started the work of reconstructing and consolidating the ruins, which were continued in 1955.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1956, there were archaeological studies of ''Oppidum Romano'', by the ''Serviços dos Monumentos Nacionais'' (''National Monument Service''). New excavations occurred in 1964.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1962, the ''Museu Monográfico de Conímbriga'' (''Conímbriga Monographic Museum'') was inaugurated. It was followed in 1964 by the collaboration between this museum and the archaeological mission from the [[University of Bordeaux]]: under the direction of J. Bairrão Oleiro, Robert Étienne and Jorge de Alarcão, the centre of the Roman city was unearthed.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In 1970, the work with the mosaics was consolidated, at a time when the monograph museum was expanded (with a basement, installations for a guard and interior shelter).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; But, throughout the transition to Portuguese democracy and beyond, the team at Conímbriga attempted to consolidate and maintain the site.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The early work continued into 1974, with the consolidation, restoration and expansion of the museum and 1975, with the prospecting into other zones, the paving of walkways, landscaping and solutions to drainage issues. In 1976, the gazebo and interior of the older Monographic Museum was repaired.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These repairs continued into 1977, with expansion of the museum, restoration of the facades, the old portico and the colonnade was transformed into an internal gallery, the arrangement of the principal atrium and creating a gutters to alleviate pedestrian walkways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The following year began the construction of a ticket booth in cement and glass, while in 1979 an electrical transformer and litter incineration unit was installed. The installation of electrical devices, illumination and climate control units in the museum only occurred between 1981 and 1982.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1986 a new awning was installed to cover the ''Casa dos Repuxos''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first permanent public exposition was opened in April 1985.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

During the 1990s, there were projects to remodel the museum and upgrade the displays and various installations to support visitors, under the direction of Cruz Alarcão, Arquitectos Lda.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; They were re-contracted between 2004-2005 to improve the site, including the reconstruction of the Augustian forum and southern thermal spas, construction of a small structure for spectacles (consisting of a roadway, stage and bunks molded to the terrain), alongside the aqueduct.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

On 9 August 1991, the museum became part of the ''Instituto Português de Museus'' (''Portuguese Institute for Museums''), leading to the 1 June 1992 transfer to the ''Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico'' (IPPAR), and then on 29 March 2007, the ''Instituto dos Museus e Conservação'' (''Institute for Museums and Conservation'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

[[File:Conimbriga (13248781615).jpg|thumb|235px|The exposed ruins and the gazebo protecting the ''Casa dos Repuxos.'']]

The excavation site and visitors' centre is located on the outskirts of the rural community of [[Condeixa-a-Nova]], based on a plateau-shaped triangular spur over two deep depressions (one occupied by the Ribeira dos Mouros).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

Although Conimbriga was not the largest [[Roman cities in Portugal|Roman city in Portugal]], it is the best preserved, with archaeologists estimating that only 10 percent of the city has been excavated.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The urbanized civitas includes integrated structures starting from the Iron Age and extending to the 5th century. There were specifically three phases of spatial organization: in the 1st century BC, under the reign of Augustus, a late republican forum (that included crypto-portico, basilica, curia and commercial shops), thermal baths, an aqueduct and the first residential pre-Roman architectural structures;  a 1st-century AD group, established under Flavius, that included a reconstructed imperial forum, Vitruvian baths and revised urban plan; and a 3rd-century settlement that fell within revised walls.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

The civil/residential buildings included numerous examples of remodeled and reused structures dating from the first century BC. Most of these homes were insulae (houses with more than one floor), with open patio/courtyards and domus with peristyle (such as the ''Casa dos Repuxos'' and ''Casa de Cantaber'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Most of the private/civil architecture and public buildings included abundant decorative materials, including mosaics, sculptures and painted murals.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Of the Suebic occupation, there is a paleo-Christian basilica (5th-6th century), which was a reused and transformed domus.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The robust, rustic {{convert|1500|m|ft}} walls imply an urgency in its construction.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; It was built using large, carved, irregular blocks, with most coming from other constructions. The height of the walls vary from {{convert|5|m|ft}} to {{convert|6.5|m|ft}}, suggesting the significance of its military feasibility.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

There are three distinct baths within the walls: the Great Southern Baths, the Baths of the Wall, and the Baths of the Aqueduct.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The network of stone heating ducts under the (now-missing) floors are the most distinct structures in the Roman baths.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The amphitheatre, dating from the end of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], takes advantage of a natural depression that surrounded the city to the north.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The first was identified in 1993 by Virgílio H. Correia, and excavations began in 2012-2013. Part of the amphitheatre was located below local homes in Condeixa-a-Nova, consisting of three entranceways to the Roman structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/vida/2011/11/06/escavacoes-em-conimbriga-vao-por-a-descoberto-anfiteatro-romano-unico-no-pais |title=Escavações em Conimbriga vão pôr a descoberto anfiteatro romano único no país |publisher=SIC Noticias |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109105807/http://sicnoticias.sapo.pt/vida/2011/11/06/escavacoes-em-conimbriga-vao-por-a-descoberto-anfiteatro-romano-unico-no-pais |archivedate=2011-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5000-capacity monument was {{convert|90|x|60|x|20|m|ft}}, and {{convert|4|m|ft}} underground, with some rural homes built using part of the structure.

The Luso-French mission (1965-1968) unearthed public structures of great dimensions, whose architecture was reconstructed. This included two phases, where the first structures can not be reconstructed with certainty.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; These [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] monuments coincide with the location of some important elements, such as the central square.

Flight Lieutenant '''Dominic Bruce''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|MC|AFM|KSG}} (7 June 1915 &amp;ndash; 12 February 2000) was a British [[Royal Air Force]] officer, known as the "Medium Sized Man."{{sfnp|Kerr|2011|loc=Colditz Castle|ps=: 'Dominic Bruce, a British officer, known as 'Medium-sized Man'...}}{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}} He has been described as "the most ingenious escaper" of World War II.{{sfnp|Chrisp MBE RN|1959|ps=:'can claim to be the most ingenious and unlucky escaper of the war.'}} During the Second World War he made seventeen attempts at escaping from POW camps, including several attempts to escape from [[Colditz Castle]], a castle that housed prisoners of war ''deemed incorrigible.''

Famed for his time in Colditz, Bruce also escaped from Spangenberg Castle and the Warburg POW camp. In Spangenberg Castle he escaped with the ''Swiss Red Cross Commission escape,'' it is also argued he co-innovated the wooden horse escape technique whilst serving time inside Spangenberg. In Warburg he escaped dressed as a British orderly in a fake workers party. Inside Colditz Castle, Bruce authored the ''Tea Chest Escape'' and also faced a firing squad for an attempted escape via a sewer tunnel. Whilst held in solitude in Colditz, along with two other prisoners, Bruce became a key witness to the post war Musketoon, commando raid trial.

For his exploits in WWII he was awarded the Military Cross and is the only known person to have received both the Military Cross and the Air Force Medal.

In his later years he received the OBE for his services to education.

==Early years==
[[File:MARY BRUCE BEM AWARD CEREMONY.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mary McClurry Bruce (Bruce's mother) called 'The Angel of Hebburn' for her charity work amongst young mothers, receives the British Empire Medal from the Lord Lieutenant of Durham, Lord Lawson of Beamish, a former school friend]]
Bruce was born on 7 June 1915, in [[Hebburn]],{{sfnp|Hunt|1988|p=443}} [[County Durham]], [[England]]. He was the second of the four children of William and Mary Bruce.{{sfnp|Hunt|1988|p=443}} Mary (née McClurry) Bruce was awarded the [[British Empire Medal]] in 1956 for her services to the care of the sick and infirm and was known as the 'Angel of Hebburn'. His older brother was Brother Thomas (William) Bruce {{post-nominals|list=FSC}}, a member of the De La Salle religious congregation or [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]] who died in Nazareth in 1974, and is buried in a wall tomb in the crypt of the University of Bethlehem. His two younger siblings were Anne Bruce-Kimber and John Bruce (who died in infancy). Dominic Bruce's escaping adventures started early in his life when he ran away from home by means of a train to London. Remarkably on arrival in London he was recognised by a police officer married to his father's sister Anne. He was quickly returned to Shakespeare Avenue in Hebburn. Bruce was educated at and matriculated from [[St Cuthbert's Grammar School]], Newcastle, 1927-1935.{{sfnp|Hunt|1988|p=443}} He was of an adventurous disposition and as an alternative to his formal education he spent some time as an unauthorised visitor to the [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] law courts{{refn|group=note|name=Newcastle Law Courts. Chronicological reference.|The Newcastle law courts are now on the [[Quayside]]. The courts Bruce would have frequented in his youth would have been the city's [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]] courthouse. The Moot Hall operated as law courts from 1812 to 1998.{{sfnp|Chronicle Crown Court Staff|2018|ps=:'Newcastle’s Moot Hall previously heard all cases before Newcastle Crown Court was built.'...}}}} during school time.{{sfnp|Bruce|1999|loc=Visits to law courts}} 

Bruce married Mary Brigid Lagan on 25 June 1938 at Corpus Christi Catholic Church, [[Maiden Lane, Covent Garden|Maiden Lane]], London, WC2.

==Early RAF career==
On joining the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1935 he trained as an wireless operator,{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2863}} then as an airgunner.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} In November 1936 Bruce joined No. 214 Squadron at [[Scampton]]. Scampton was equipped with Virginias and Harrows.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} On 25 March 1937 he was involved in the crash of the [[Handley Page H.P.54 Harrow|Handley Page Harrow]] "K6940"  which resulted from a badly judged descent which removed the roof of a train travelling on railway lines adjacent to the Handley Page works airfield at [[Radlett]].{{sfnp | Moss | 1975 |p=320}}{{sfnp|BAAA|1937}}

===Air Force Medal===
[[File:DOMINIC BRUCE RECEIVES AFM.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dominic Bruce receives the Air Force Medal]]On 6 October 1938, while with [[No. 214 Squadron RAF|No. 214 Squadron]], he survived the crash of Harrow "K6991" at [[Pontefract]], Yorkshire.{{sfnp|BAAA|1938}} While acting as a wireless operator for his aircraft he was knocked out by a lightning strike.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} Once recovered he alerted his base to the fact that the crew were bailing out. Wishing to get out of an escape hatch he found his way blocked by other airmen who were hesitating about throwing themselves out of the aircraft into the howling darkness. He rushed to the other side of the hatch and jumped. His parachute harness caught on projecting clamps and pulled the trapdoor shut above him. Bruce was now suspended under the bomber and unable to escape further. Realising what had happened his fellow crew members were now galvanised into action raised the trapdoor and were shocked to have Bruce shoot back into the aircraft, though not too shocked to eject him again. Bruce was subsequently awarded the [[Air Force Medal]] (AFM) on 8 June 1939.{{sfnp|Air Ministry|1939|p=3874|ps=: 'Air Force Medal...; 522098 Leading Aircraftman Dominic BRUCE.'...}}{{refn|group=note|name=AFMedal_AFCMedal_Distinction|Prior to the war, in 1938 when the incident took place, Bruce, new to his career, was only a [[Leading aircraftman|Leading Aircraftman (LAC)]]; therefore he received the Air Force Medal, rather than the Air Force Cross (AFC) which was given only to officers. This is explained in Pete Tunstall's book, 'The Last Escaper.'   In the book Tunstall argues this was needless discrimination against lower ranks.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2866}}}} According to [[Pete Tunstall]], Bruce was very proud of being the only man known to have bailed from an aircraft three times and to have landed only twice.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2878}} After the war he used to entertain his children with the seemingly insoluble riddle: "How is it that I baled out three times, but only landed twice?" Bruce called his AFM medal the 'Away From Mam' medal.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}}

In March 1939 Bruce retrained as an [[air observer]] and studied at the Bombing School Stranrear.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} 

==WWII==
At the outbreak of war, in 1939, and following his training, Bruce was an instructor at [[RAF_Harwell|OTU Harwell]].{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} In May 1940 he was posted to [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|No. 9 Squadron]] which was equipped with Vickers Wellingtons.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} After 25 operations, Bruce became the squadron’s Navigation and Bombing Leader, which was a staff appointment with restricted operational flying duties.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} By 1940, Bruce, had won an AFM, was part of the staff, was a qualified instructor, had experience as a Wireless Operator, had experience as an air-gunner and now had experience as a Navigator with the RAF No.9 Squadron.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} The mortality risk for [[RAF Bomber Command aircrew of World War II|RAF Bomber Command aircrew]] in World War II was significant. One of his roles as a navigator would have involved keeping the aircraft on course at all times.{{sfnp|Mason|2018|loc=Navigator}} He would have had to have had a high level of concentration as missions could last up to seven hours.{{sfnp|Mason|2018|loc=Navigator}} His account (including a photo of the actual handwritten report) of a bombing raid, on military infrastructure in Leverkusen in 1940 can be read in 'Voices of Colditz.'{{sfnp|Wood|Watton|1946|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Clay|2014|p=71}}}} The report describes the aircraft swinging around [[Cologne]] on a moonlight night, Bruce using the silver river [[Rhine]] as the navigational signpost; how the guns were firing more to make it look like a raid than to hit the aircraft; and how the run up in this raid was textbook. He finishes the report, mentioning the parking in the hanger; highlighting his workload filling up his bulky navigators satchel and how he sadly climbed out of the plane on to nothing, resulting in him receiving a sprained ankle.{{sfnp|Wood|Watton|1946|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Clay|2014|p=71}}}}

On 20 January 1941 Acting [[Flight Sergeant]] Bruce was granted a commission "for the duration of hostilities" as a probationary [[pilot officer]], with seniority from 8 January.{{sfnp|Air Ministry|1941|p=1371|ps=: 'Acting Flight Sergeant. 2oth Jan. 1941.

===Camaraderie with messmates===
====Pranks====
[[File:DB raid on Brest.tif|thumb|upright|left|Bruce (far right) with crew about to raid Brest in 1941]] Bruce was a notorious prankster. In Pat Reid's book about Colditz he describes how a group of new Navy entrants to the castle were horrified when a uniformed German doctor (in fact, Howard Gee, one of the 'prominente' hostages) insisted that they were lice ridden and must strip naked for their private parts be treated by his medical orderly. This alarming figure in white overalls would approach each man with a lavatory brush dipped in a bucket of evil smelling blue liquid (consisting of lavatory disinfectant and theatrical paint) and dabbed each man's genitals. The new boys would later realise that the evilly grinning orderly was Bruce.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=149}}

[[File:DB COLDITZ MESS.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bruce in Colditz, seated, fifth from left]]In the IWM interview tapes held in the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive, Bruce tells the tale of a bombing mission over Berlin when he persuaded the pilot to descend to five hundred feet over the city. Bruce climbed down into the now empty bomb bay, hand cranked the doors open; sat on the bomb rack and threw a lit distress flare out of the plane. When asked later why, he answered "Because I've always wanted to see the Unter den  Linden lit up at night."{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}}

Bruce, like a lot of his comrades, participated in [[goon baiting]]. In his book 'Colditz: the German Story' (1961, translation by Howard Gee), [[Reinhold Eggers]], the castle's Security Officer, describes how Bruce was fond of sowing confusion amongst the German guards during Appel, or roll call, using the 'rabbit run' prank. Bruce would stand in the ranks, wait until he had been counted, then duck quickly along the line, only to be counted again at the other end. This trick was also used for more serious purposes, to cover up for a missing escapee.{{sfnp|Eggers (R). Gee (H) (Author)|1961}}

John 'Bosun' Chrisp explained that after their sewer drain escape attempt, Bruce, billed the Kommandant and Staff Paymaster Heinze in the castle for £600 on behalf of Messrs Chrisp, Lorraine and Bruce, for their service of cleaning the drains that had not been cleaned for 300 years.{{sfnp|Wood|1996|loc=Reel 3, 20:00s - 29:00s}}

{{See also|Goon baiting}}

====Nicknames====
In his IWM interview tapes he tells how he fooled the King's cousin [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Viscount Lascelles]] (later the Earl of Harewood, he was being kept in Colditz as a hostage by the SS) into believing that the average or medium size of home sapiens was 5 feet 3 inches (his own height). When Lascelles told his mess mates about this novel theory it did not take them long to discover who had fooled him. That resulted in his nickname, 'the Medium Sized Man.'{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}} Bruce was also known as the 'Medium Sized Officer.'{{sfnp|Reid|1954}}He was also was known as 'Brucie' or 'Bruce.'{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Chapter 8 - "Whats the plan?"}}

During his failed escape under the wire at Colditz he discovered his German nickname, as the guard who fell over him in the dark (and in his fright shot at Bruce, just barely missing his eyebrow) answered the security patrol's question as to who it was by saying 'Der Kleine' ('the little one'). The sentry overcame his shock only to burst out laughing when Bruce shouted "I surrender" in an effort to prevent him shooting again. When he emerged from his six-week sentence in solitary confinement he asked another prisoner, Cyril Lewthwaite, who spoke excellent German, if he could explain the guard's odd reaction. Lewthwaite asked Bruce what he had said in German. Bruce obliged, whereupon Lewthwaite pointed out that "Ich ueber gebe mich" does not in fact mean "I surrender" but "I am going to be sick" (taken from a private letter to Peter Tunstall dated 5 September 1979).{{sfnp|Bruce|1979}}

====Character====
Over forty percent of those in the RAF were killed in action in WWII.{{sfnp|Veterans SA|2016}} Bruce and his comrades in [[RAF Bomber Command]] would have had to have ''nerves of steel.''{{sfnp|Veterans SA|2016}}
Notoriously short tempered (his father 'Billie' Bruce was supposed to be the 'worst tempered man in the North of England') he was described as 'as hard as nails' by his fellow Spangenberg inmate, Squadron Leader Eric Foster, in his autobiography.{{sfnp|Foster|1992}} Foster's autobiography is also an eye witness source for the Swiss Red Cross Commission escape{{sfnp|Foster|1992}} at Spangenberg Castle. Tunstall explained Bruce was very meticulous, and gave plaudits to him by describing him as having the draw of a big personality.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3174}} After the Swiss commission escape, Tunstall also claimed that compared to him with his bad ankle, Bruce and Newborn had mental toughness to keep going whilst on the march; and that of the three Bruce, with his stamina, was the pacesetter.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3199}}
Ingenious he may have been, but not all Bruce's escape ideas were successful. The Colditz dentist, [[Julius Green]] (in his book 'From Colditz in Code') tells the story of an escape attempt that was a little too ingenious. Bruce persuaded a friend, Rex Harrison of the Green Howards, who was six feet five inches, to carry him inside his long greatcoat from a series of straps. Rex was to carry a football under his arm, into which Bruce would put his head using a hole cut into the back of the football. The idea was simple. Harrison would exit the castle to go the exercise park below the castle walls with Bruce clinging to his waist. Once in the park, accomplices would create a distraction, Bruce would slip out from under Harrison's coat, and then hide under a pile of leaves. When the guards counted the prisoners as they re-entered the castle, the count would be identical to the number who went out. Unfortunately, while the duo were practising the escape on a staircase, another inmate came rushing down the stairs, crashed into Harrison, and all three went tumbling down the staircase. Bruce reluctantly abandoned the idea.{{sfnp|Green|1971}}

===Wing Commander Roy Arnold===
[[File:ROY ARNOLD BLANKENBERGE.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Blankenberge grave of Wing Commander Roy  George Claringbould Arnold MD who saved the life of Bruce (and four others) by holding the burning Wellington steady so they could bale out.]][[File:FATHER SKY TV INTERVIEW.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bruce (middle, in flying suit and Caterpillar Club tie, glass in hand, aged 80)  being interviewed by a SKY TV reporter, after having alighted from a vintage Tiger Moth biplane at RAF Fairford during the RAF 50th Anniversary Victory Airshow in 1995, where he was chosen to represent RAF veterans of 1935.]] On 9 June 1941, while navigating a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] bomber over the North Sea, on a mission to bomb enemy shipping on the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Belgium]] coast, his aircraft was shot down by, what was thought to be, two [[Bf 109]]’s.{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=54}} The Bf 109’s were first encountered four miles from [[Calais]].{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=54}} Black smoke was seen coming out of the Wellington.{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=54}}

The area in which the Wellington was shot down was hazardous.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} From 1939 to 31 December 1942 1497, sailors, airmen and soldiers were either killed or went missing in that area, with over 370 aircraft losses counted.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Of the No. 9 Squadrons four Wellington planes on this operation only two come back. In total 18 aircraft took part in this raid.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

Just prior to this raid, Bruce had previously flown three operations with three various scratch crews.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} On this raid Bruce also formed part of another scratch crew.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} The crew included: Bruce, Wing Commander pilot Roy Arnold, air-gunner Thomas Albert Bax,  air-gunner Sgt. R. H. Barratt who was also from staff, Sgt. James Murray Pinkham and Sgt. Harold Arthur Wink. Wing Commander Arnold lost his life.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} The pilot Wing Commander Roy Arnold bravely and calmly stayed at the controls of the burning Wellington, at low height, in order to keep it steady and allow the other five crew members to escape.{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=54}} He did this in the certain knowledge that he would die doing so. He was thirty years old and married. Arnold is buried in the CWG cemetery at [[Blankenberge]], Belgium.{{sfnp|CWGC|1941|ps=:'Roy George Claringbould... Service Number 29198...'}} The story of his heroic act of self-sacrifice did not emerge until after the war when the crew returned from captivity and could tell their squadron commander.

The 9 squadrons other Wellington (R2620) lost in this raid resulted in 2 deaths, 3 airmen being noted as missing in action and one airman noted as surviving.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} The Luftwaffe airman who claimed shooting down the Wellington (R1758) was Walter "Jap" Schneider.{{sfnp|AR|2018}} Jap would also become a fatality of warfare when flying over [[Abbeville]] France in 1941.{{sfnp|AR|2018}}

====Zeebrugge capture and Caterpillar Club====
In WW2, the survival rates for bailing out into the sea were not great with roughly one third surviving{{sfnp|RAF St Mawgan|2015}} and despite the fact that he could not swim, Bruce, with at least air-gunner Thomas Bax,{{sfnp|Alexander|2018}} baled out into the sea, hoping to allow the current to wash him south towards France and the resistance life lines that had been established there. However, motor launches were quickly despatched from the port and he was picked by the German Navy in the sea near [[Zeebrugge]]. He earned membership of the "[[Caterpillar Club]]" as a result of this exit from a "disabled aircraft" as can be seen from his wearing of the Club tie in the photo taken in 1995 at RAF Fairford (right).{{refn|group=note|name=Caterpillar Club reference.| The Caterpillar Club is an informal association. The only requirement to join is that you have survived by using a parachute when jumping from a stricken aircraft.{{sfnp|Irvin|2018}} In his career, documents show Bruce qualified not just in 1941, but in 1938.}}

On the day of the raid Bruce had told his wife he would be back for tea.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Bruce would later write, ''"This was a silly daylight raid... with no escort against enemy fighters."''{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Bruce became a casualty of this raid suffering burns.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Documents also highlight a comrade, the Australian air-gunner Thomas Bax became a casualty of warfare. Bax would eventually be repatriated because of the seriousness of his condition.{{sfnp|Alexander|2018}} After capture Bruce was sent to [[Dulag Luft]], where from the camp he was immediately sent to Hohemark for treatment for burns.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

====Presumed KIA====
Information exchange in WWII was slow, with a reliance on telegram. At first, it was thought that all the crew had died as a result of their Wellington being shot down. The father of 9 Squadrons Thomas Bax received a telegram on the 3 July 1941 explaining that his son was a POW and no longer missing. Later, on the 19 August 1941, the Red Cross received information that Bax had been sent to Spangenberg.{{sfnp|Alexander|2018}} It was similar for Bruce. After two weeks without news, the International Red Cross sent a message to his wife, Mary Lagan Bruce, that her husband was in fact alive. In recordings, now lodged in the Oral History Sound Archive of the British Library, she tells how that she had been utterly convinced that he was alive, despite all the evidence to the contrary.{{sfnp|Bruce|2000}}

Spangenberg Castle ({{lang-de|Schloss Spangenberg}}) is a ''[[schloss]]'' above the small German town of [[Spangenberg]] in the [[Hesse|North Hesse]] county of [[Schwalm-Eder-Kreis]]. He was also awaiting trial after being involved with an altercation with an overzealous guard in Dulag Luft.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Inside the castle he would be joined by the injured No. 9 Squadron air gunner Thomas Albert Bax.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}{{sfnp|Alexander|2018}} His other surviving No. 9 Squadron comrades were sent to other POW camps.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

====Innovator of the wooden horse technique====
[[File:First US Army Rehabilitation Centre- Recuperation and Training at 8th Convalescent Hospital, Stoneleigh Park, Kenilworth, Warwickshire, UK, 1943 D16599.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A "wooden horse", as seen in an US Army rehabilitation centre; UK, 1943.]]It has been argued that Bruce and Tunstall are the original innovators of the wooden horse escape technique.
Along with Eustace Newborn and [[Pete Tunstall|Peter Tunstall]], Bruce came up with the escape plan now known as "the Swiss Red Cross Commission." Tunstall, also highlights that in 1941, prior to he and Bruce planning an escape with the famed 'Swiss Red Cross Commission,' he and Bruce had been digging an escape route with a wooden horse tunnel from inside the gymnasium, the wooden horse was placed roughly four feet from the wall that separated the gym from the moat.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2899}} The digging was a very slow process, it required the removal of spoil, bricks and stone work,{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2909}} and was aided by other prisoners distracting the guards.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2904}} They were later joined by Sammy Hoare and a syndicate who were promised a second go if they escaped undiscovered.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2899}} Other members of this syndicate were also named as: Harry Bewlay, John Milner and Eustace Newborn.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

When Bruce and Tunstall noted the slow process they began examining the rest of the castle and left the digging to the other team involving Hoare.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2912}} The tunnel almost reached completion but unfortunately the digging team got caught when a guard become suspicious at the large stones that were accumulating outside of the gym. The guard then called a search, and then found found the escape tunnel.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3028}} When the guards found the shaft they called an Appell and Hauptmann Schmidt confidently stated to the prisoners, ''"It is impossible to escape by tunnel or any other way."''{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} 

This wooden horse gym escape tunnel was two years prior to the famed [[Stalag Luft III#The first escape|Sagan wooden horse escape]]. Tunstall stated that he would like to think some of the watchers and workers who helped on their original wooden horse escape may have mentioned it from time to time;{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3031}} and would like to think that their idea contributed to the success of the effort at Sagan.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3031}}

====Exploration of the castle====
Whilst the wooden horse tunnel was being dug, Bruce and Tunstall, were planning, after they had escaped from the castle grounds, to steal an aircraft from [[Kassel-Rothwesten Airfield|Kassel airfield]] to fly to [[Basle]] [[Switzerland]]. To do this they also created Luftwaffe uniforms.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2922}} As the tunnel was being dug by other prisoners, Bruce and Tunstall were also in the process of exploring the castle and keeping their options open for other escape possibilities in case the tunnel route was found. At this time, Bruce and Tunstall got to know a new prisoner called Eustace Newborn who was in the wooden horse tunnel syndicate.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Newborn was a South African airman with plenty of experience flying [[Junkers Ju 52]] and [[Junkers Ju 86]] airplanes.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2912}} Needing his experience with [[Junkers Ju 52]] airplanes, Newborn joined their escape team.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2912}} In the escape it was decided Tunstall, who could speak better German, would be a Feldwebel and Bruce and Newborn would be privates.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2920}}

Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall also wanted to explore a walled off flat.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2922}} The flat had once been explored by a [[France|French]] lieutenant named Merlin, who had broke into the flat in 1939.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} It was rumoured the previous occupant of this apartment was a forestry school principal who was now at the front for Germany.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2922}} They eventually found a way into this flat via a chamber found at the top of the staircase which had a plaster ceiling. This chamber led to the attic.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2947}} They broke through this plaster ceiling in the chamber with a four foot long metal-pole that they claimed could break through anything and that they affectionately pun-named [[Napoleon]].{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} From the attic they found a staircase down to the principals flat.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2947}} Bruce and Tunstall picked the locked door at the bottom of the stairs.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2947}} Inside the room they found escape material such as civilian clothes, officer uniforms, guns including a [[Luger pistol]], maps, a compass, cases and stale cigars.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2951}} Upon sourcing these materials Bruce and Tunstall then gave up their wooden horse tunnel escape completely and left it all to Hoare. Instead they began solely focussing on the bridge and gate security.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2959}} Unfortunately the gate security had been increased because of a 1940 escape from the castle by three Canadians, Keith Milne, Don Middleton and Hank Wardle.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3822}}

====Gate security====
[[File:Burg Spangenberg Turm.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The inner court yard looking towards the gate as seen in 2009]]There were three companies working the castle gate. Tunstall called them, ''A company,'' ''B company'' and ''C company.''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2969}} Each company worked shifts. All staff rotated their roles and sometimes a staff member would be the sentry on the castle side of the bridge who opened the gate.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2969}} There could be ten other posts a guard could be on.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2981}}

The guard commander was on the other side of the bridge away from the castle. The sentry on the castle side of the bridge was to open and close the gate on command. To let people into the castle the sentry could only open the gate after an order that could only come from the guard commander, and this order would come after the guard commander had signed the people in. To let people out of the castle, the sentry, would blow a whistle, and the guard commander would come through the gate to sign the people out, then following a command, the sentry would then open the gate.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2961}} Over time, they observed the C company Feldwebel was the least meticulous of the three companies and that there was no chance of escape if A company and B company had a shift, being they followed the protocol to the letter.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2969}}

They worked out that C company had two big flaws that could be exploited. They noticed the guard commander did not bother with the protocol when the orderlies went to the moat to feed the pigs potato peelings and rubbish from the kitchen,{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2972}} this left the gate open. They also pinpointed the weak link in the C company team. Tunstall called the guard ''Blockhead.'' They believed he would be the least alert enough of the guards to notice their faces when they were in disguise.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2977}}

====Escape plan====

[[File:Marcel Junod-5.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marcel Junod]], delegate of the ICRC, visiting [[Prisoner of War|POWs]] in Germany. Bruce's attire would have been similar.]]They hid all the gear needed for the escape in the sick bay.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2997}} They decided the escape would revolve around the three being disguised as a visiting Swiss Red Cross Commission inspection team. It was planned that on the day of escape, Tunstall would be dressed as an army Hauptmann and carrying the ID card which was no more than a touched up fishing license with an official seal,{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} and Bruce and Newborn would be dressed as visiting doctors.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2982}} Bruce and Newborn would be very well dressed, carrying dispatch cases.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2982}} Bruce would also be wearing a [[Homburg hat]] and smoking a cigar.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2982}} Newborn would be wearing a [[Tyrolean hat]]. Underneath the attire they would be each wearing their Luftwaffe uniforms.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2982}} They also had a debate about carrying the [[Luger pistol]]. Bruce and Tunstall were in favour of carrying the gun for the sake of authenticity. Newborn, along with a prisoner called Joe Kayll were strongly against it, arguing you cannot expect the protection of the Geneva convention for carrying it. The argument was in turn settled by the SBO, Brigadier Somerset who strictly forbade them taking the Lugar with them.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall then settled on building a replica using wood and lead stripped from the roof. They polished and blued the replica until it looked perfect.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} The escape was planned to be ''shit or bust'', as such the cases only carried three rations. More important to the three was boot polish, shaving equipment which would keep them presentable as Luftwaffe airmen, and the local map and compass.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2989}} 

Bruce and Tunstall estimated their escape from the castle grounds depended on these three things, pig feeding time leaving the gate to the bridge open, 'Blockhead' being on the gate and C company being on the afternoon shift.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2977}} They waited a long time for these conditions to occur, waiting all through August.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3027}} These conditions in turn rested on Blockhead failing a gullibility test.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2997}} The plan was for this test to be performed by a prisoner called John Milner who spoke good German.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2997}} The planned test was to see if Blockhead would bluff. In German, Milner would ask Blockhead if the German officer and the two Swiss doctors had left the castle?{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2997}} If Blockhead bluffed this question, he failed the test and this would probably mean he assumed a Swiss Commission team was inside the castle. If he bluffed Milner would give a thumbs up from behind his back and this thumbs up would mean the escape plan would kick into action.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2997}} If ‘Blockhead,’ passed the test Milner would give a thumbs down signal from behind his back and the escape would not go ahead.

Upon the thumbs up sign the kitchen orderlies would immediately go to the door with their kitchen rubbish.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3006}} It was always predicted Blockhead and C company would always open the gate to the orderlies to allow the orderlies to feed the pigs with rubbish from the kitchen. At this point, when the gate was predicted to be left open by Blockhead, they devised to immerse Blockhead in to a social orchestration. They arranged for: Blockhead to be blustered and overwhelmed by his perceptions;{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3009}} they scheduled deftly timed goon baiting from the orderlies at the gate to overwhelm him;{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3048}} and timed for a perception of urgency from Swiss Commission inspection team and the Army Hauptmann, to rush him.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3009}} 
Prior to walking through the gate the faux Swiss commission team would be seen having chats with the British medical officers to help with the frame.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3006}} Upon reaching the gate they had lined up for Tunstall to state in German to Bruce, right in front of Blockhead, ''“Du lieber Gott, Herr Doktor, schon viertel zwei. Kommen, wir müssen weitergehen!”'' (“Good God, Doctor, it’s already a quarter to two. We must hurry!”).{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3009}}

Upon exiting the castle security they planned on heading down the hill. At the bottom of the hill they planned on removing and hiding their Swiss commission clothes. They arranged to walk to the forest on their way to Kassel, dressed as Luftwaffe airmen, knowing the guards would eventually be searching for two civilians and an army Hauptmann.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3023}} They also organised for a white smoke signal. The white signal would come from the kitchen. This white smoke would warn Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn that the guards are now searching for them.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3023}}

====Swiss Red Cross Commission escape====
[[File:Castle_Spangenberg_(2).JPG|thumb|upright|right|Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall walked across the bridge dressed as a Swiss Red Cross inspection team]]The 'Swiss Red Cross Commission' has been described as the most audacious escape of World War II. Bruce's MC citation described it as a ''very clever escape.'' On the 3 September 1941{{sfnp|Rollings|2003|p=185}} using an officer uniform and civilian clothes found in a walled off apartment belonging to the forestry principal, the three POWs simply walked out of the camp posing as a German officer (Tunstall) and two doctors (Bruce and Newborn) of a Swiss Red Cross inspection team.

The escape plan to escape the castle grounds worked. Milner tested the guard Blockhead and Milner gave the thumbs up.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3045}} Bruce, disguised as a doctor, conversed with the British medical officers to help frame Blockheads confusion, the orderlies goon baited Blockhead at the gate,{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3048}} the Hauptmann (Tunstall) then marched to the gate in a hurry and stated to Bruce, ''“Du lieber Gott, Herr Doktor, schon viertel zwei. Kommen, wir müssen weitergehen!”''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3057}} Blockhead even saluted the Hauptmann (Tunstall).{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3058}} Tunstall walked by and walked through the gate, and Bruce and Newborn, carrying dispatch cases, with Bruce insouciantly smoking a cigar{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3054}} (a rarity by this period of the war; and convincing evidence for the guards that the visitor was Swiss), followed him over the bridge. The guards at the other end of the bridge saluted at the Hauptmann as they made it over the bridge on their way out of the castle grounds.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3062}} Though Kassel is a right turn from the exit of the castle, exiting the grounds they turned left before they set on their way to Kassel and made their way to the bottom of the hill, were they removed and hid their commission disguises. They then, chose one of two roads that led from the castle, and marched to Kassel, along Melsunger Straße, dressed as Luftwaffe airmen.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

In their escape plan there was only one thing that did not come off, at the bottom of the hill they did not see the white smoke warning that come from the kitchen warning them the security team was searching for them.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3070}} There were also some close calls on the way to the forest. When on an open road heading towards the forest, search parties drove past them, even asking Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn if they had seen three escapees dressed as the Swiss Commission inspection team, causing some mild anxiety.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3084}} Along the route, after walking openly through the streets saluting with German officers, they gained confidence their disguises were working.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}}

They reached the airfield the next day. At [[Kassel-Rothwesten Airfield|Kassel airfield]] they intended to steal a [[Junkers Ju 52]], which Newborn had flown before the war, and then fly to Basle Switzerland.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3115}}They penetrated the aerodrome, but were discovered trying to start a Luftwaffe aircraft,{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} so they decided to find another aerodrome that was less heavily guarded near the Belgian frontier. Whilst on the road from Kassel, unknown to Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall, every police and military unit in German occupied Europe had been informed of the escape of an army Hauptmann and two civilians from Spangenberg castle.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3157}} They also decided it was better to travel in plain sight and in daylight with their Luftwaffe uniforms, whilst saluting and using colloquial phrases, instead of going cross country, and getting their uniforms dirty.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3161}} As the escape was originally planned as ''shit or bust''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 2989}} and they had packed limited rations, they decided they had to live of the land where possible, aiming to eat apples, plums and pears stolen from trees and by eating crops out of the soil.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3168}} They also stole three loafs of bread from a horse and cart. To the laughter of Bruce and Newborn, Tunstall, stole three loafs of bread from a horse and cart whilst matching the horses gallop, and painfully crouching to stay out of the sight-line of the driver.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3215}} 
On the march Tunstall explained the three were approached by some women. As they could not hold a conversation in German this raised anxiety they could immediately be caught. Tunstall explained to the women that they must not speak to them. The women asked ‘warum’ (why). Tunstall mentioned “they are under arrest.” Bruce caught on quickly, and Tunstall claims Bruce then leered at them and did the ”finest brutal-and-licentious-soldiery act you can imagine.”{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3269}} In the IWM tapes Bruce expands on this. He relates how one morning (after a night sheltering under cover on farmland) they woke up to an audience of German land girls. They questioned Tunstall as to why the trio were travelling in such an unorthodox fashion. Tunstall, in an effort to allay their suspicions, claimed that he and Newborn were taking their prisoner Bruce to a military prison. The women asked what crimes Bruce had committed. As a prank, Bruce leered at the girls and replied 'unmentionable sexual practices' -upon which they ran away in alarm.{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}}
After ten days on the road, near a small prison camp used for farm labour,{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3279}} they were arrested by a soldier who followed them on a bike with another guard and a civilian. This soldier, who just three weeks previously worked as a guard at Spangenberg, recognised Tunstall.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3317}}

====Interrogated by the Gestapo====
Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn were taken many miles to [[Frankenberg, Hesse|Frankenberg]] on the [[Eder|river Eder]]{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3322}} and interrogated by the [[Gestapo]]. During WWII, the Gestapo were notorious for not verifying information and sending people to concentration camps.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 4166}} Not much was known about the Gestapo in 1941.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3329}} Tunstall described how even the [[Wehrmacht]], who had transported them, become anxious in the malevolent presence of the Gestapo.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3329}} Tunstall wanted to get out of the presence of the softly spoken Gestapo interrogator as soon as possible.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3336}} When Tunstall was answering his questions, Bruce and Newborn looked at Tunstall with disdain, consequentially, when Bruce and Newborn were interrogated, they instead, approached the questioning from the interrogator with disrespect.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3337}} Tunstall believes had the same situation happened just three years later, Bruce's and Newborn's approach could have been fatal.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3344}}

====Solitary confinement====

They were then sent back to Spangenberg.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3345}} Hauptmann Schmidt was incensed at the audacity of the escape.{{sfnp|de Meester|2018}} The three were each held to a long period in [[solitary confinement]].{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3412}} Bruce received 53 days in solitude for the Spangenberg Castle escape, which was longer than the Geneva convention suggested.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} In Spangenberg they were not sentenced for their escape but held in ''preventative arrest.''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3412}} The Senior British Officer also complained that according to the Geneva convention guidelines, the exercise yard in Spangenberg was too small, and they needed to be moved to another camp.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3385}}

{{See also|Preventive detention|Solitary confinement|l1=Preventative arrest}}

=====Defying solitude=====
In solitary confinement, Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall were placed in three separate cells in front of, and high above, the moat they had previously escaped from.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3409}} The approach by C company to Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall was different to A and B company. When compared to C company, A and B company treat Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall with good humour.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=location 3415}} To the amusement of Bruce, Newborn, and Tunstall, in the remaining cell, Blockhead was also doing his time in confinement for letting the fake inspection team through the gate.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3418}} Whilst they were held in confinement, they even managed to defy solitude after Bruce picked the lock on his, Newborn's and Tunstall's cell doors{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3471}} in order that they might join him in his cell to play poker with a set of home made cards a previous occupant had left behind.{{sfnp|Rollings|2004|p=210}} For the breaking of the solitude, Bruce was eventually court-martialled on the serious military charge of breaking free from arrest, the other two eventually got 5 extra days solitude. Tunstall explained he thought Bruce eventually got away with it by Bruce explaining escaping was not a court-martial offence for a POW, according to the Geneva Convention.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3486}} Inside of solitary, Tunstall claims, early on, there were rumours of Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn being shot.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3488}} After nearly eight weeks, the whole camp was made to move; Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn were rumoured to be, and expected to be, sent straight to the Colditz ''Straflager'' (punishment camp), instead, they were sent to Warburg.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3488}} This immediate move was a hindrance to Bruce and Tunstall as they had been formulating two more escape plans.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3488}} Tunstall mentions that on the journey to Warburg there was a flurry of train jumpers.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3488}}

===Warburg prisoner of war camp===
After his Spangenberg Castle escape, Bruce was eventually sent to [[Oflag VI-B]], then in the village of [[Dössel]] (now in [[Warburg]]).{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} The Warburg camp has been described as soulless, bleak and unfinished. It roughly housed 3000 prisoners.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location  3494}}

====Working party escape====
Upon arrival Bruce and Tunstall immediately ''cased the joint'' and formulated escape plans.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3501}} They noticed the secondary gate was used occasionally to march out guarded working parties of orderlies and that the security here was lax, when compared to Spangenberg.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3501}} Bruce and Tunstall then created their first plan. The plan involved walking out of the camp dressed as guards. Bruce and Tunstall, then registered their new plan of escape with the Warburg escape committee. They then got working on German army uniforms to walk out through the lax security.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3507}} They soon faced two problems. The first problem being being they were immediately put back into solitary; and the next problem being, the escape committee changed their plans.

Their previous ''preventative arrest'' in Spangenberg amounted to almost two months, and despite the fact they had been promised that their arrest time in Spangenberg would count against any sentence in Warburg, a Major called Rademacher announced to Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn that they each would be serving 28 days in solitary.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3528}} This was the first immediate blow to Bruce's and Tunstall's first escape plan. The second blow occurred when the escape committee decided on adjusting their plan; they wanted their escape plan to accommodate more prisoners.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3535}} The escape committee new plan was to use the uniforms and the forged papers and then march out a big bogus working party.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3541}} Bruce and Tunstall were to be orderlies in the plan and the uniforms were to be worn by two fluent German speakers. One of the guards was called [[Peter Stevens (RAF officer)|Peter Stevens MC]] who was a fluent German speaker; and the other guard of the orderlies was called Lance Pope who also spoke good German.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3554 - 3561}} Tunstall explains he and Bruce, accepted the change selflessly but were worried that the change in plan was too ambitious and would complicate things.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3541}} Still the escape committee worked on the uniforms, dummy rifles and the forged documents which were forged by John Mansel. Mansel who Tunstall described as the master forger of WWII.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3535}}

{{See also|Batman_(military)|l1=Orderlies}}

The first two times the worker party escape was tried it was held back at the gates via faults in the documentation. In January 1942,{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} the third time they attempted the bogus worker party, they forged the signature of the guard Feldwebel Braun.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3595}} This opened the gate. Though this escape was immediately hindered by the guardsman noticing Feldwebel Braun could not have signed the papers as he was on compassionate leave.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3595}} The guards then started firing, and the bogus workers party dispersed.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3595}} According to Tunstall, not one of the escape party was caught and the German uniforms, the dummy rifles and forged papers where quickly stowed away in the hides at emergency speed.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3610}} The German search party, though, did find a piece of green cloth which was used to make the German uniform, on the camps belongings. Bruce and Tunstall were blamed for this by Major Rademacher.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3616}} For this action Bruce received more time in solitary confinement.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}}

====Escaping from solitary confinement====

Bruce and Tunstall were sent to solitary confinement for the attempted escape with a workers party and they were given three months. They felt persecuted by Rademacher as they perceived the Major was always putting them into confinement for baseless reasons. Whilst in solitary though they still constructed more escape plans.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3704}} In this specific stretch of confinement, they worked out one more plan, and this set up involved an actual escape from inside the solitary confinement.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3704}} They wanted to break out of the camp and follow a previous route to France which was attempted by a former prisoner who had jumped on a goods train in Dössel and had evaded capture for five days. They also noted the cell block was made of a heavy timber, and that to escape from the camp with this type of timber it required adequate tools.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3714}} Knowing this escape needed tools, they then made a selection of hand made tools and wrapped them up. Bruce eventually hid the tools in the wood shavings in his mattress.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3732}}

Knowing the tools were now safe and they could pick their moment, on the morning of their planned escape, they noticed more snow had fell. They observed that this was not escaping weather and because of the conditions they had no option but to wait.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3732}} This wait, sadly for Bruce and Tunstall,  prolonged. Whilst waiting for the weather conditions to improve, Bruce and Tunstall were ordered to pack their belongings... and they were then sent to Colditz.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3732}}
A year later, inside Colditz, former Warburg prisoner [[Douglas Bader]], explained the escape tools they left inside Warburg had been successfully used by another prisoner.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3742}}

===Prisoner at Colditz===

[[File:Colditz Castle 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Colditz Castle]] as seen in 2011]]
Bruce arrived in [[Colditz Castle]], known as officer prisoner-of-war camp [[Oflag IV-C]], on 16 March 1942. Colditz was near [[Leipzig]] in the State of [[Saxony]].{{sfnp|Tyson|2001}} It was intended to contain Allied officers who had escaped many times from other prisoner-of-war camps and were deemed ''incorrigible''.{{sfnp|Tyson|2001}} It was the only POW camp with more guards than prisoners. The Nazis regarded it as the most escape proof prison in Germany.{{sfnp|Tyson|2001}} Colditz, because of the escapee prisoners it housed, eventually become thought of as an ''international escape academy.''{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=345}} Heavily guarded Colditz, still managed more home runs than anywhere else.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=Location 3993}}

====Arrival and processing====
[[File:SCHLOSS COLDITZ.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Prisoners yard as seen in 2011.]] On the train journey to Colditz, they had been escorted to Colditz by three privates and one NCO.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=location 3756}} These guards were in turn briefed about Bruce's and Tunstall's propensity for escaping; the guards were under a threat of severe retribution if they ever escaped.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=location 3756}} The guards called Colditz ''Sonderlager'' (Special Camp) and the prisoners called Colditz ''Straflager'' (Punishmant Camp).{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=location 3756}} When Bruce arrived at Colditz late at night and, for the first time, entered the deserted, flood lit exercise yard, on his way to the ''upper cells'', Tunstall recollects that Bruce's first words were, ''"We'll get out of this bloody place too."'' To which Tunstall recalls he replied, ''"You bet."''{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc=location 3793}}

After recapture from his Spangenberg and Warburg escapes, Bruce, now in Colditz, was put in a cell whilst waiting for trial. He was charged with breaking and entering for picking a lock in a walled off part of the Spangenberg Castle; and theft of the uniform he found in the walled off room inside Spangenberg Castle; the documents also show, he was put into solitary confinement in Spangenberg Castle, and allege, Bruce kicked the cell door down whilst in his cell. The alleged action of kicking the cell door down, added a very serious charge of sabotage of state property.{{sfnp|The Timaru Herald Staff|2013}} Tunstall description of the events, differs to Bruce's charge sheet, it highlighted that no state property was broken and Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall were defying solitude after Bruce picked the locks in their solitary confinement.{{sfnp|Tunstall|2014|loc= location 3471}} In WWII it was generally accepted that the main rules of escaping were: don't wear German uniform; don’t use violence; and don’t engage in espionage or sabotage. It was perceived that breaking these rules could result in the prisoner facing a court-martial, and even death.{{sfnp|Morison|2003}} Bruce was clearly in trouble with regards to his charge sheet in that he had stolen a German uniform, and had been charged with an alleged sabotage of state property. The sabotage of state property being a very serious charge.{{sfnp|The Timaru Herald Staff|2013}}

To defend himself, Bruce choose a fellow Colditz prisoner, [[Alan Campbell, Baron Campbell of Alloway|Lieutenant Alan Campbell]], a trained lawyer, to advocate for him. Campbell (subsequently Baron Campbell of Alloway ERD QC (24 May 1917 – 30 June 2013)) argued that, according to King's Regulations, Bruce had a duty to escape; and using a precedent, cited a case of a German fighter pilot called [[Franz von Werra]] who had escaped, von Werra who was famed for getting the German High Command to change its policy with regards to POW's; and highlighted the fact that Bruce had never used violence. After the trial, Bruce received a moderate sentence of three months in solitary.{{sfnp|The Timaru Herald Staff|2013}}

On 21 April 1942 Bruce's commission was confirmed and he was promoted to the [[war substantive]] rank of [[flying officer]].{{sfnp|Air Ministry|1942|p=1753|ps=: 'and to be Fig. Offs...; D. BRUCE, A.F.M. (45272). 2oth Jan. 1942. (Seny. 8th Jan. 1942.)'...}}

Within six months Bruce escaped the castle grounds with the tea chest escape.

====Tea chest escape====

He made use of a ''[[Escape and evasion map|silk map]].''{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}} The silk escaping map Bruce used in the escape to guide him to [[Danzig]] (now Gdansk) which was sent to him by his wife concealed in a brass button of a uniform, at the behest of MI9, can be seen in the IX Squadron archive museum at RAF Marham,{{sfnp|RAF Marham Museum|2018}} donated to the Squadron in a handover ceremony by the Bruce family.

When a new Commandant arrived at Colditz in the summer of 1942 he enforced rules restricting prisoners' personal belongings. On 8 September 1942 POWs were told to pack up all their excess belongings and an assortment of boxes were delivered to carry them into store. Bruce immediately seized his chance and was packed inside a Red Cross packing case, three foot square, with just a file and a {{Convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} length of rope made from bed sheets. Bruce was taken to a storeroom on the third floor of the German ''Kommandantur'' and that night made his escape.{{sfnp | Chancellor | 2001 }}  The next morning the castle was visited by General Wolff, officer in charge of POW army district 4.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=149}} He inspected the camp and found everything to his satisfaction.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=149}} Fortunately for the camp commandant, as Wolff was driven away, his back was turned to the southern face of the castle. If he had turned his head he would have seen a length of blue and white checked (bedsack) rope dangling from a remote window.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=149}} It was, however, eventually noticed by a hausfrau (housewife) in the town, who quickly reported it to the duty officer.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secondworldwar.org.uk/colditz.html |first=Mike |last=Kemble |title=Colditz Castle |website=Second World War.org.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227114143/http://www.secondworldwar.org.uk/colditz.html |archivedate=27 December 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the German guards entered the storeroom they found the empty box on which Bruce had, in yet another of his pranks,  inscribed in chalk:{{cquote

The allies did not start [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|survival training]] until 1943.{{sfnp|RAF St Mawgan|2015}} This highlights that Bruce was using an initiative, without any official training, with regards to the triple identity ploy. This can also give plausibility to the understanding that Bruce, if found not to be the first, was one of the first few, captured airmen, to ever use the 'triple identity ploy' technique.}} The triple identity meant that he had three personae; his real identity as himself, the identity shown on his false ID papers; and another identity that he would only reveal under pressure. When he was captured, he was disguised as a Belgian Gastarbeiter or 'guest worker' named Josef Savon (his false ID is still in the possession of the Bruce family) another example of Bruce's fondness of disguises. In his autobiographical book, 'The Tunnellers of Sandborstal' (Robert Hale, 1959), Lieutenant Commander John 'Bosun' Chrisp MBE RN  said that "Bruce's  adventures in various corners of occupied Europe read like John Buchan (author of 'The Thirty Nine steps') at his most melodramatic" and that Bruce "can claim to be the most ingenious and unlucky escaper of the war."{{sfnp|Chrisp MBE RN|1959|ps=:'can claim to be the most ingenious and unlucky escaper of the war.'}} The use of the Josef Savon disguise is also another example of Bruce's predilection for pranks, as Josef Savon translates into 'Joe Soap'. In 1944, Joe Soap was RAF slang for a legendary airman who ''[[wikt:carry the can|carried the can]]''.{{refn|group=note|name=joeSoapEtym|For the WW2 definition the etymologist [[Michael Quinion]] quoted the Royal Air Force Quarterly:
"''Joe Soap was the legendary airman who carried the original can. He became a synonym for anyone who had the misfortune to be assigned an unwelcome duty in the presence of his fellows, or to be temporarily misemployed in a status lower than his own. “I’m Joe Soap,” he would say lugubriously, and I’m carrying the something can.” Royal Air Force Quarterly, 1944.''"

Quinion then explains, "''“Something” may be read as a polite substitute for a more forceful epithet.''"{{sfnp|Quinion|2007|ps=: '...Royal Air Force Quarterly, 1944. “Something” may be read as a polite substitute for a more forceful epithet.'}}}}

When captured he pretended to break down and admitted he was in fact Flight Sergeant Joseph Lagan. Lagan was his brother in law and so Bruce could answer detailed questions about his service record etc. Initially the delighted Germans believed him and were ready to send him to a Stalag or 'other ranks' camp.{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}} Under the Geneva Convention, other ranks (unlike officers) could be made to work; and were often taken outside camps on working parties; from which it was easy to escape. His story when captured was that he had jumped from a British plane over [[Bremen]] and arrived in Danzig on a stolen bicycle;{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}} his bicycle, unbeknown to Bruce, had a local number on it.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}} Bruce was then sent to the RAF camp at [[Dulag Luft]] near [[Oberursel]].{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}} Whilst at the camp, the Germans had already requested a specialist Gestapo interrogator to come from Berlin, who was to recognise Bruce.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=150}}{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}} When he arrived he took one look at the supposed Flight Sergeant Lagan and said "Ah, Captain Bruce, how nice to see you again". This was the second time he had interrogated Bruce (whom the Germans habitually addressed as 'Captain').  Under heavy guard, Bruce was taken by train back to Colditz. On the overheated train, the guard detail fell asleep and Bruce tried to escape once again, but was prevented by a watchful officer.{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}}

====Aiding an escape from solitary confinement====

[[File:Colditz Schlosshof Pano.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''German Kommandantur'' in 2011.]] The 'Tea Chest Escape' made Bruce the first prisoner to escape from both Spangenberg Castle and Colditz Castle. He was soon to be joined by [[Hank Wardle|Howard 'Hank' Wardle MC]]{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=161}} who would soon escape from Colditz with Captain [[Pat Reid]], Major [[Ronald Littledale|Ronald B. Littledale]], and Lieutenant Commander L. W. Stephens. Wardle had also escaped from Spangenberg Castle.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name=spangenbergColditzEscapees|Bruce and Wardle are thought to be the only two documented prisoners who have escaped from Spangenberg Castle and Colditz Castle.}} This escape by Wardle, Reid, Littledale and Stephens was aided by reconnaissance from Bruce. Pat Reid explained that whilst Bruce was in solitude, he got a message smuggled to Bruce, via his food. Reid wanted Bruce to give him some detail about the ''German Kommandantur'' of the castle.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=158}} In due course Reid received a return message from Bruce.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=158}} This message gave him information about the specific unused staircase, the top floors, and importantly, how the door to this staircase was in full view of the Kommandantur sentries, and how this door was put into shadow by the flood lights.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=158}} On 14 October 1942, in [[Pat Reid#Escaping Colditz|the Kommandantur cellar escape]], they all used Bruce's information and tried to get the staircase door open with a dummy key. Unfortunately the dummy key failed. This worked out though; as with their contingency plan, using the shadow, they slowly worked their way to the ''Kommandantur cellar'' to which they were to escape from.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|pp=158-161}}

====Musketoon witness====
In October 1942 seven captured commandos were processed inside Colditz and sent to solitary confinement. These commandos had previously been involved in the ''Operation Musketoon'' raid.  Inside the cells Peter Storie-Pugh, [[Dick Howe]] and Bruce had managed to have conversations with them.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=154}}

On 13 October 1942 the commandos were removed from Colditz and taken to the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] (RHSA) headquarters in [[Berlin]], where they were interrogated one by one by [[Obergruppenführer]] [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]].{{sfnp|Schofield|1964|p=141}} They remained in Berlin until 22 October, when they were taken to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. On the next day, 23 October, they were all shot in the back of the neck and their bodies cremated.{{sfnp|Schofield|1964|p=143}} These commandos were the first to fall victim to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s  [[Commando Order|''Kommandobefehl'']] (Commando Order) issued on 18 October 1942, which called for the execution of all commandos after capture.

In 1964 Stephen Schofield interviewed Bruce for his book 'Musketoon: commando raid, Glomfjord, 1942' (University of Michigan), revealing that while in the solitary confinement cells, Bruce managed to make contact with Captain Black DSO, leader of Operation Musketoon, the Anglo-Norwegian commando raid mounted against the German-held [[Glomfjord power plant]] in [[Norway]]. Bruce was the last British person to speak to Black before he (and six comrades) was murdered in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=154}} The official German story given to the Red Cross was that the seven men had escaped and not been recaptured, and Colditz ''Oflag IVC'' were instructed to return any letters to their senders marked ''Geflohen'' (escaped),{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=154}} but Bruce's testimony was sent from Colditz to MI5 in London and ensured that the British authorities knew the truth.{{sfnp|Schofield|1964| p=135}}

{{See also|Commando Order|Operation Musketoon}}

Bruce was promoted again, to [[flight lieutenant]], on 20 January 1943.{{sfnp|Air Ministry|1943|p=1744|ps=: 'Flight Lieutenants...; D. BRUCE, A.F.M. (45272). 2oth Jan. 1943. (Seny. 8th Jan. 1943.)'...}}

====Escaping after August 1943====
By 1944 escaping was becoming tougher and more risky. [[Walter Morison]] explained that by August 1943 most of the loopholes to escape in the castle had been exploited;{{sfnp|Wilson|2000|p=143}} making escaping even harder. By spring 1944 escaping got more risky. Contrary to the Geneva convention the use of force had been debated inside the German mess for years. Oberstleutnant Prawitt, the Kommandant and Staff Paymaster Heinze were keen on using it on repeat offenders,{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=301}} such as Bruce. As was the Major Amthor, the new second in command, who had joined the mess in May 1943. Amthor was a young keen Nazi and had constantly tried to influence for the use rough measures.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=301}} Amthor and Prawit were hated by the prisoners that when ever they entered the court yard they were whistled and howled at.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=301}} Püpke was not a Nazi and was even given a courteous reception during Appell in the summer of 1944.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=222}} In late March 1944, Hitler had disregarded the Geneva Convention with regards to POW's. The punishment for escape now carried a punitive risk of execution.{{refn|group=note|name=Hitler disregards Geneva Convention on POW's|On 25 March 1944, going against objections of many senior officers, Hitler ordered the execution of 50 allied troops who had escaped from [[Stalag Luft III murders|Stalag Luft III]].{{sfnp|Klein |2014}} This highlighted Hitler was no longer following the Geneva Convention with regards to POW's. This precedent meant escaping from any POW camp, after 24 March 1944, carried a significant risk of execution.}} Bruce made [[List of attempts to escape Oflag IV-C|two further escape attempts]] in 1944; on 19 April and on the 16 June.

On his 19 April escape he cut through bars on north side of the castle and reached the wire fence before being detected.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=403}} After Bruce was seen by the sentries, Bruce was then fired at by rifle and machine guns.{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=55}} Knowing he did not stand a chance, Bruce surrendered. When surrendering, Bruce, to the amusement of the German guards, instead of yelling, ''"Ich gebe auf"'' (''"I give up"''), in a ''faux pas'' yelled, ''"Ich ueber gebe mich"'' (''"I feel sick."'').{{sfnp|Thorburn|2006|p=55}}

====Drain escape====
On 16 June escape, Bruce, Major R. Lorraine and John "Bosun" Chrisp tunnelled through sewers into an old well in the German yard that had a pipe that lead into the river, but were again detected.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=300}} The sewage escape route that lead to the manhole covered well, was found via the help of earlier tunnelling and reconnaissance by the [[Poland|Poles]], along with the help of Jack Best (also of the [[Colditz Cock]] fame) and Mike Harvey.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=298}} Best and Harvey had frequented with the Poles in their time as ''ghost prisoners'' and had participated in their tunnel digging.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=298}} Best hated the tunnel in his days as a ghost prisoner, claiming your arse always got wet with cold waste water.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=298}} Though Best noted the Poles were very proud of their dangerous tunnel.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=298}} One prisoner claimed the tunnel even had a 'terrifying' electrical cable that ran inside the damp conditions.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}} When the Poles left the castle, the tunnel was bought by a party involving [[Douglas Bader]], for 100 cigarettes.{{sfnp|Wood|1996|loc=Reel 3, 20:00s - 29:00s}} Sometime after 1941, the Poles had dug a key hole through a rock that itself led onto the main sewer system. In 1944, Bruce, Chrisp and Lorraine, surveyed the tunnel, whilst [[Dick Howe]] ensured the kitchen, showers and toilets were off limits to other POW's.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}} When they entered that hole they found the main sewage system led to the well;{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=299}} the well they were soon to be captured in.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}} They then returned to base, to have the castle's doctor brush them with iodine, and to collect some tools which would help them hammer spikes into the well wall.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}}

When they returned to the well, Lorraine, tied by a rope, was lowered to the bottom of the well, in what was low tide, and began hammering in the spikes.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}} There were three manhole covers around the German Kommandantur that were within 50 yards of each other.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=220}} At the archway halfway outside of the castle, a guard heard noises beneath his feet, whilst he was standing near one of the manhole covers.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=220}} Upon hearing the noise, the guard gave a shout to the riot squad and security officer; and an immediate order was made to open up the three manhole covers.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=220}} Staff Paymaster Heinze walked past one of the covers and spotted them and spat at them calling them ''”stinking swines.”''{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=220}} Later, for this abuse, the Senior British Officer (SBO), obtained an apology.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=220}} A guard also threatened to shoot Bruce, Lorraine and Chrisp whilst they were in the uncovered drain.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|pp=298-301}} The Germans then called an immediate ''Sonderappell.'' and after this Appell, an effort was made by the escape committee to save the hundred yard tunnel from inside the ex-Polish long-room, unluckily, for the escape committee, the Appell had given the Germans enough time to uncover the rest of the shaft.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=221}}

=====Facing a firing squad=====
When Bruce, Lorraine and Chrisp were caught, according to Chrisp, Bruce became spokesman for the three in the interrogation.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=300}} As spokesman he declined to answer to Eggers, on three separate times, as to where the entrance to their escape tunnel was. For this the three men where placed in front of a wall and faced a firing squad; though Eggers did not give an order to fire.{{sfnp|Chancellor|2001|p=300}} Chrisp explained, in his IWM tapes, the three were then put in the civilian cells outside the castle for two or three weeks; whereby after the solitary confinement, the Senior British Officer informed them that the Komandment had fined them £100 each for damaging the drains.{{sfnp|Wood|1996|loc=Reel 3, 20:00s - 29:00s}} Bruce, upon hearing the fine, made a counter claim, and he billed the Kommandant for £200 each for their service of cleaning the drains that had not been cleaned for 300 years.{{sfnp|Wood|1996|loc=Reel 3, 20:00s - 29:00s}} With regards to billing the Kommandant, Chrisp explained it wasn’t just Bruce behaving like this; and that in the castle, this type of behaviour went on all the time - it never stopped.{{sfnp|Wood|1996|loc=Reel 3, 20:00s - 29:00s}}

The Germans were getting tired of the prisoner escapes, and in the summer of 1944, each POW camp was given a flyer reinforcing the fact the Germans were taking escaping very seriously. The notice referenced that breaking out was no longer a sport, and that prisoners would be shot if the attempted to escape.{{sfnp|Wilson|2000|pp=143-144}} The notice was up inside the Colditz prisoner yard by the 8 August 1944.{{sfnp|Reid|2015|p=222}} Eventually, orders came (via MI9 and the Senior British Officer) that all escapes were forbidden and so Bruce and his comrades had to sit out the war until the liberation came in April 1945.

===Liberated from Coldtiz===
[[File:FATHER PISTOL GUN.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The German Army issue pistol used by Bruce in a failed attempt to liberate a chicken from Hitler's tyranny]] Bruce was eventually liberated on 16 April 1945 by the US Army.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} In a 1973 interview, Bruce described the day of liberation as, pure wild west, getting guns, going off to liberate chickens and wine, and having a great time.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2006|p=377}}

In the IWM tapes Bruce describes the scene. The first GI through the castle gates heard a voice from a second floor window. "Take that man's sidearm" the voice ordered. The GI duly disarmed a German guard. "Tie it onto this piece of string" the voice said. The GI complied. The pistol (which is still in the possession of the Bruce family) was hauled up the castle wall and disappeared into the window. Bruce (who, like the other prisoners and Germans alike, had been at near starvation levels  during the last months of the war) went directly to the castle kitchens and put the gun to the head of a German cook and demanded a chicken. Sadly, there were none to be had. Bruce was flown to England to meet the two small boys (and the wife) he had not seen since 1941 outside Victoria railway station in London.{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}}{{sfnp|Windle|2006}}

==Later life==
===Personal life===
After the war, Bruce and his wife Mary, bought Blakesley Lodge in Green Street, [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in [[Surrey]].{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} They brought up nine children, six boys and three girls.{{sfnp|Honan|2000}}
One of his sons, Brendan,{{sfnp|Bruce|1999}} is a communications executive, and a former Director of Communications to Prime Minister Thatcher. The Bruce family report that his nickname amongst the family (which was given to him by his Italian son-in-law, Piero Carloni), was 'Il Cavaliere' ('the knight') due to his Papal knighthood .

===Education===
[[File:Father corpus cox 1948 (2).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dominic Bruce (middle in white blazer) as cox of the Corpus Christi, Oxford, rowing eight, 1948]] In 1946 Bruce became a student at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], reading Modern History, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1949.{{sfnp|Hunt|1988|p=443}} He completed what was known as War Degree (7 terms) and was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1953.

Bruce served as an Adult Education Tutor at [[Bristol University]], 1949–50. He was Assistant Secretary of the University Committee, Adult Education HM Forces, 1950–53; Further Education Officer, Surrey County Council, 1953–59; Principal, Richmond Technical Institute, 1959–62. Bruce became the Founding Principal of [[Kingston College (England)|Kingston College of Further Education]], 1962–1980.{{sfnp|Bradshaw|Benjamin|Cotterell|1999}}
There was significant interest  at the time for this important new position and the short list consisted of Bruce, a distinguished Royal Navy Captain and an Army Brigadier (i.e. a 'one star' general). Bruce's  quick wit was responsible for his appointment. When he entered the interview room, the Chairman of the Panel was reading his CV and looked up at him in astonishment saying "it says here that you have nine children. Are they all yours?" (thinking that  some were perhaps stepchildren). "So my wife assures me" came Bruce's imperturbable reply.

====Executive and advisory roles and honours====
[[File:FATHER WITH QUEEN 1995.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bruce receives the OBE from HM Queen Elizabeth II]]In civic and charitable bodies Bruce also acted as:
*Chairman of the Further and Higher Education Committee of the [[Archdiocese of Westminster]]
*Schools Officer, Archdiocese of Westminster, 1978–80.
*Member of the Board of Governors of St Mary's College (now St Mary's University), Twickenham
*Member of the Board of Managers of St Ignatius RC Primary School, Sunbury
*Committee member of the Association of Principals of Colleges and member of its Regional Advisory Council
*Chairman of the General Commissioners of Income Tax, [[Spelthorne]] Division
*Education Advisor to the RAF Benevolent Fund.

Bruce was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1989 for his services to Education.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}} He was also awarded the Pontifical Equestrian [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] (Latin: ''Ordo Sancti Gregorii Magni'') by Pope [[John Paul II]].

==Filmography and sound==
===Portrayals in film and television===

In the BBC TV series ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' (1972–74), which chronicled the lives of the Allied prisoners of war held in the castle, one of the characters portrayed was Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter (played by [[David McCallum]]) - Carter was a young, upstart, hot-headed RAF officer who enjoys goon-baiting and is very impatient to escape. The fictional Carter closely resembles Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://randomramblingsthoughtsandfiction.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/theme-time-robert-farnon-colditz.html |title=Theme Time: Robert Farnon - Colditz |website=So It Goes... |date=23 October 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, from series one, 'Gone Away, part 1', first shown 18 January 1973, the 'Tea Chest Escape' was re-enacted.{{sfnp|Battle|2018}}

''[[Colditz (2005 TV series)|Colditz]]'', a 2005 British two-part television [[miniseries]] produced by [[Granada Television]] for ITV, written by [[Peter Morgan]] and directed by Stuart Orme, features a fictionalised account of an actual event when three inmates; Dick Lorraine, John 'Bosun' Chrisp, and the 'Medium Sized Man', Dominic Bruce attempted to escape using the castle sewers. In reality the escape team were discovered when they attempted to exit a manhole. The Germans threatened to throw grenades down into the sewer chamber and, as the escapers could not reverse back up the sewer pipe, they were forced to surrender. They were immediately put in front of a firing squad, but unlike the fictional TV account, the guards did not fire. Just before the order was to be given, Bruce lost his temper and approached the officer in charge, Eggers, saying "you can shoot us, but after the War we'll hang you". Eggers stood the squad down.

The 'Red Cross Commission' escape from Spangenberg provided the plot for the 1961 film, '[[Very Important Person (film)|Very Important Person]]' although no acknowledgement was made by the producers at the time. In the film, James Robertson Justice also escapes disguised as a Swiss civilian Commissioner, just as Bruce had done in real life.

On the 70th Anniversary of the liberation of Colditz, the BBC programme 'The One Show' featured photographs of the 'Tea Chest' escape which were discussed by the participants.{{sfnp|Baker &amp; Jones|2015}}

The [[BBC]] series ''[[Colditz (TV series)|Colditz]]'' (1972–74), was such a success that it was quickly repeated. In order to make up the episodes to a sixty-minute slot (the BBC had hoped to sell the series to the USA, hence the use of [[Robert Wagner]], so they had to be only fifty minutes in length to include commercials) a select group of six Colditz escapers were interviewed individually by the famous war correspondent [[Frank Gillard]] and shown immediately after the repeat programmes were broadcast. Bruce was one of the interviewees. The documentary series was called ''Six from Colditz,'' and Bruce's interview was listed in 17 April 1973,{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2006|p=382}} and also on 17 January 1974 in the [[Radio Times]].{{sfnp|Radio Times|1974}}{{refn|group=note|name=bbcPre1980LostArchives|Pre 1980 the [[BBC]] had a [[BBC Archives#Archive Treasure Hunt|practice of wiping]]. This interview may be lost.}} Transcripts of Bruce's interview, with Gillard, which aired in 1973, exist.{{sfnp|Mackenzie|2006|p=382}}

From 1996 to 2006 the Colditz Society created a selection of filmed interviews with many Colditz survivors. Bruce was recorded and is referenced in the collection. These interviews are now museum artefacts and are held in the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{sfnp|Colditz Society|2006}}

Multiple medical professionals have evaluated that these experiences are [[hallucination]]s; the result of [[delusional disorder]]s or [[psychosis]],&lt;ref name=kmir20150212/&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday"/&gt;  the same sources from which arise [[religious delusions]], accounts of [[alien abduction]]s, and beliefs in visitations from dead relatives.

== Experiences ==
The experiences of people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment using esoteric technology, and who call themselves "Targeted Individuals" ("T.I.") vary, but include hearing voices in their heads calling them by name, often mocking them or others around them, as well as physical sensations like burning.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20081112 /&gt;   They have also described being under physical surveillance by one or more people.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114 /&gt;  Many of these people act and function otherwise normally and included among them are people who are successful in their careers and lives otherwise, and who find these experiences confusing, upsetting, and sometimes shameful, but entirely real.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114 /&gt;  They use news stories, military journals and declassified national security documents to support their allegations that governments have developed technology that can send voices into people's heads and cause them to feel things.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114 /&gt;

Psychologist Lorraine Sheridan co-authored a study of gang-stalking in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology]]''. According to Sheridan, "One has to think of the T.I. phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the gang-stalking idea as an explanation of what is happening to them".&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPhate|first1=Mike|title=United States of Paranoia: They See Gangs of Stalkers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/gang-stalking-targeted-individuals.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health professionals say that TIs can experience [[hallucination]]s and their explanations of being targeted or harassed arise from [[delusional disorder]]s or [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399_pf.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aboujaoude|first1=Elias|title=Psychotic Websites.

Press accounts have documented individuals who apparently believed they were victims of electronic harassment, and in some cases persuaded courts to agree. In 2008, James Walbert went to court claiming that his former business associate had threatened him with "jolts of radiation" after a disagreement, and later claimed feeling symptoms such as electric shock sensations, and hearing generated tones and other strange sounds in his ears. The court decided to issue an order banning "electronic means" to further harass Walbert.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/07/court-to-defendant-stop-blasting-that-mans-mind/ Court to Defendant: Stop Blasting That Man’s Mind!

=== Notable crimes ===
Various people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have committed crimes; among those crimes are [[mass shooting]]s.

Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, a 20-year-old man, [[Tensas State Bank hostage crisis|took two women and a man hostage]] at the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank on August 13, 2013, eventually killing two of them and then himself. A subsequent police investigation officially concluded that Ahmed suffered from mental issues such as hearing voices and paranoid schizophrenia. Ahmed had accused the family of his ex-girlfriend of placing a "microphone device" of some kind in his head.&lt;ref name=policereport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/8612131-125/la-bank-hostages-killer-had-no|title=Jim Mustian,  Man who killed hostages in north Louisiana bank had mental illness, March 12|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313181529/http://theadvocate.com/home/8612131-125/la-bank-hostages-killer-had-no|archivedate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2014, [[Myron May]] shot and injured three people on the campus of [[Florida State University]] and was killed by responding police officers.

On February 20, 2016, Jason Brian Dalton, an [[Uber (company)|Uber]] driver, was accused in [[2016 Kalamazoo shootings|a deadly shooting spree]] in which six people were killed and two others were injured in [[Kalamazoo County, Michigan]]. He blamed his actions on his Uber mobile app, which uses a symbol that he claims resembles the [[Order of the Eastern Star]], and claimed it took over his body after he pressed the button of a new app resembling the Devil.&lt;ref name=FeltonVisions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/kalamazoo-shooter-jason-dalton-uber-iphone-takes-over-body|title=Kalamazoo shooter saw 'devil' on Uber app and blames visions for killing spree|work=The Guardian|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=March 15, 2016|first=Ryan|last=Felton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Eugene Long, who [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|killed three police officers and injured three others]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], on July 17, 2016, believed in a number of anti-government movements and conspiracy theories, and was a member of a group dedicated to helping people suffering from "remote brain experimentation, remote neural monitoring of an entire human's body."&lt;ref name=CNN.Killer&gt;{{cite news |first=Joshua |last=Berlinger |title=Gavin Long: Who is Baton Rouge cop killer? |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=July 18, 2016 |website=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/18/us/who-is-gavin-long/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conspiracy theories ==
Mind control conspiracy advocates believe they have found references to secret weapons in government programs such as "Project Pandora", a [[DARPA]] research effort into biological and behavioral effects of microwave radiation commissioned after the [[Moscow Signal]] incident, when the US embassy in Moscow was bombarded with microwaves by the Soviets beginning in 1953. It was discovered that the Soviets' intent was [[eavesdropping]] and [[radio jamming|electronic jamming]] rather than mind control.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114/&gt; Project Pandora studied the effects of occupational radiation exposure, and the project's scientific review committee concluded that microwave radiation could not be used for mind control.&lt;ref name="Weinberger2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Weinberger|title=The Imagineers of War: The Untold Story of DARPA, the Pentagon Agency That Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1ZxDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195|date=14 March 2017|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-385-35180-5|pages=195–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy advocates also frequently cite the 2002 [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] patent for using microwaves to send spoken words into someone's head. Although there is no evidence that mind control using microwaves exists, rumors of continued classified research fuel the worries of people who believe they are being targeted.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114/&gt;

In 1987, a U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] report commissioned by the [[United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine|Army Research Institute]] noted psychotronics as one of the "colorful examples" of claims of psychic warfare that first surfaced in anecdotal descriptions, newspapers, and books during the 1980s. The report cited alleged psychotronic weapons such as a "hyperspatial nuclear howitzer" and beliefs that Russian psychotronic weapons were responsible for [[Legionnaire's disease]] and the sinking of the [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']] among claims that "range from incredible to the outrageously incredible". The committee observed that although reports and stories as well as imagined potential uses for such weapons by military decision makers exist, "Nothing approaching scientific literature supports the claims of psychotronic weaponry".&lt;ref name="Frazier"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendrick Frazier|title=The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ1v3bggyr8C&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=4 May 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-401-1|pages=153–|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychotronic weapons were reportedly being studied by the Russian Federation during the 1990s&lt;ref name="autofilled2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leigh Armistead autofilled|title=Information Operations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxFibw3NxBcC&amp;pg=PA197|accessdate=30 April 2013|year=2004|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59797-355-7|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parameters&gt;[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/Parameters/Articles/98spring/thomas.htm The Mind Has No Firewall], [[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]], Spring 1998, pp. 84-92&lt;/ref&gt; with military analyst Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas saying in 1998 that there was a strong belief in Russia that weapons for attacking the mind of a soldier were a possibility, although no working devices were reported.&lt;ref name=Parameters /&gt; In Russia, a group called "Victims of Psychotronic Experimentation" attempted to recover damages from the [[Federal Security Service]] during the mid-1990s for alleged infringement of their civil liberties including "beaming rays" at them, putting chemicals in the water, and using magnets to alter their minds. These fears may have been inspired by revelations of secret research into "[[Psychotronics|psychotronic]]" psychological warfare techniques during the early 1990s, with Vladimir Lopatkin, a [[State Duma]] committee member in 1995, surmising "Something that was secret for so many years is the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Report: Soviets Used Top-Secret 'Psychotronic' Weapons | first=Owen|last=Matthews |work=The Moscow Times | date=July 11, 1995 |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/report-soviets-used-top-secret-psychotronic-weapons/337288.html|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russian Defense Minister [[Anatoly Serdyukov]] and Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] commented on plans to draft proposals for the development of psychotronic weapons.&lt;ref name=NBC20130430&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=Reality check on Russia's 'zombie ray gun' program|url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/04/06/11061093-reality-check-on-russias-zombie-ray-gun-program?lite|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC News]] Science Editor Alan Boyle dismissed notions that such weapons actually existed, saying, "there's nothing in the comments from Putin and Serdyukov to suggest that the Russians are anywhere close to having psychotronic weapons."&lt;ref name=NBC20130430 /&gt;

== Support and advocacy communities ==
There are extensive online support networks and numerous websites maintained by people fearing mind control. Palm Springs psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of delusional disorders on many of these websites&lt;ref name=kmir20150212/&gt; and psychologists agree that such sites negatively reinforce mental troubles, while some say that the sharing and acceptance of a common delusion could function as a form of group cognitive therapy.&lt;ref name=nyt20081112/&gt;

According to psychologist Sheridan, "page after page" of internet search results about electronic harassment "that regard it as fact" and the absence of counter-information creates a harmful "closed ideology echo chamber" for TIs.&lt;ref name="NYT3" /&gt;

As part of a 2006 British study by Vaughan Bell, independent psychiatrists determined "signs of psychosis are strongly present" based on evaluation of a sample of online mind-control accounts whose posters were "very likely to be schizophrenic".&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday" /&gt; Psychologists have identified many examples of people reporting "mind control experiences" (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are "highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs". Common themes include "bad guys" using "psychotronics" and "microwaves", frequent mention of the CIA's [[MKULTRA]] project and frequent citing of a scientific paper entitled "Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy".&lt;ref name="Psychopathology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Vaughan|last2=Maiden|first2=Carla|last3=Muñoz-Solomando|first3=Antonio|last4=Reddy|first4=Venu|title='Mind control' experiences on the  internet: implications for the psychiatric diagnosis of delusions.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.9838&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|website=Psychopathology|publisher=School of Psychology, Cardiff University|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have organized and campaigned to stop the use of alleged psychotronic and other mind control weapons.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20081112 /&gt; These campaigns have received some support from public figures, including former U.S. Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]], who included a provision banning "psychotronic weapons" in a 2001 bill that was later dropped,&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114 /&gt; and former Missouri State Representative [[Jim Guest]].&lt;ref name=nyt20081112 /&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1999''' was the 44th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]],
following [[Dana International]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998 contest]] in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] with the song "[[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]]". This was Israel's third victory in the contest (after [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]]), and the second time hosting the event (after 1979).

It was held on 29 May 1999 at the [[International Convention Center (Jerusalem)|International Convention Center]], the same venue that hosted it [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|20 years earlier]]. Television news anchor [[Yigal Ravid]], singer and 1992 contestant [[Dafna Dekel]] and model/actress [[Sigal Shachmon]] were the show's hosts, and it was the first time that three presenters were used to host the Contest. Israel's two previous winners, [[Izhar Cohen]], who won in 1978 with "A-Ba-Ni-Bi" and [[Milk and Honey (group)|Milk and Honey]]'s [[Gali Atari]] who won it the next year with "Hallelujah" attended as spectators.

The winner of the Contest was [[Charlotte Perrelli|Charlotte Nilsson]], representing [[Sweden]] with "[[Take Me to Your Heaven (song)|Take Me to Your Heaven]]", which scored 163 points. This was Sweden's fourth win in the Contest and the second in the 1990s (after [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]]'s win for Sweden in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]]).

In the run-up to the Contest, many speculated that it would not be held in Israel, but would be moved to either [[Malta]] or stay at the [[United Kingdom]] (the countries that completed the top 3 of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998 Contest]]). This came about after major concerns over funding for the event from the Israeli government arose, alongside the opposition from Orthodox Jews that they would attempt to stop the Contest from coming to Israel after [[Dana International]] won the previous year's Contest. This, however, provided no hindrance for [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] or to the organizing team of the event, and the Ussishkin Auditorium at [[International Convention Center (Jerusalem)|International Convention Center]] in [[Jerusalem]] was selected as the venue for the 44th Contest.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=John Kennedy|title=The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=UK|year=2007|pages=156–159|isbn=978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, this is the last Eurovision Song Contest to have been held in a concert hall rather than in an indoor arena.

== Format ==
Long-standing rules in place for decades were abolished during this Contest: rules that each country had to sing in one of their national languages was abolished for the first time since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977]]. A majority of the participating countries, fourteen out of twenty-three, chose to sing entirely or partly in English and only eight entirely in their respective national languages; Lithuania, Spain, Croatia, Poland, France, Cyprus, Portugal and Turkey, not counting the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, whose national language is English. Furthermore, live music became optional for the first time in the Contest's history. IBA took advantage of this and decided to drop the orchestra from the Contest as a way to conserve money for the show. This meant that for the first time all entries used backing track during their performances.&lt;ref name="EBU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=History – Eurovision Song Contest 1999|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union]]''|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy for Eurovision traditionalists, with three-time winner [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]] criticising the move, describing the event now as "karaoke".&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

A compilation CD was released in Israel. The CD omitted the songs from Poland, Cyprus, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Since then, all compilation CDs have featured all the songs.

It was announced in 1999 that, as of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]], the four biggest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) – [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] – would all be given automatic entry into the Contest, regardless of their average scores over the past five years.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt;

[[Latvia]] had attempted to participate in the Contest for the first time, but withdrew at a late stage. This gave [[Hungary]] a chance to enter the Contest; however, [[Magyar Televízió]] decided not to take part. This allowed Portugal to compete as the 23rd country.&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt;

[[Austria]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] returned to the Contest after being relegated from competing in 1998. [[Lithuania]] also returned to the Contest for the first time in five years. The Lithuanian delegation has had budget problems to contend with, and so the EBU allowed the Lithuanians to arrive in Israel a day later than everyone else. The first delegation on the other hand, to arrive were [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt;

After being relegated from the 1998 Contest, [[Russia]]'s [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] had decided not to broadcast that year's contest, in order to allow for a strong comeback in Israel. However, as only countries which had broadcast the previous year's contest were allowed to enter the next year's contest, Russia was forced to miss another year. They were joined by [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Switzerland]]; the countries with the lowest average scores over the previous five years.

The favourites to win the Contest came from [[Iceland]]'s [[Selma Björnsdóttir|Selma]] with "[[All Out of Luck]]", and [[Cyprus]]'s [[Marlen Angelidou|Marlain]] with "[[Tha 'Nai Erotas|Tha 'Ne Erotas]]", after an internet poll by fans. But, while Iceland finished second to Sweden (the country's best showing in the contest), Cyprus failed to inspire televotes, finishing second last with only two points, both from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt;

== Incidents ==
A number of controversies occurred before the Contest. Two songs selected to compete in Israel were found to be ineligible: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Hari Mata Hari]] were disqualified after their entry was discovered to have been released in Finland some years previously; [[Germany]]'s [[Corinna May]] was also disqualified after her song was revealed to have been released in 1997 by a different singer.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natfinals.50webs.com/90s_00s/Germany1999.html|title=GERMAN NATIONAL FINAL 1999|work=50webs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both artists would eventually represent their countries in Eurovision, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] respectively.

Croatia's entry attracted objections from the Norwegian delegation, due to synthesised male vocals being used on the backing track of [[Doris Dragović]]'s entry. The EBU decided to reduce the country's score by a third for the purpose of calculating its five-year average to determine participation in future contests, though it was decided to leave its placement in the 1999 result unaffected.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt;

The interval act was provided by Dana International, who performed a cover of the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "Free", which although was a smash hit in Israel at the time, caused some controversy there due to the song's lyrics. Dana International also appeared at the end of the show, handing the winning trophy to Nilsson. After pretending that the trophy was too heavy to lift, she fell to the stage, bringing down the winning composers with her.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBU" /&gt; The show finished with the three presenters inviting everyone on stage to sing a rendition of the English version of "[[Hallelujah (Gali Atari and Milk &amp; Honey song)|Hallelujah]]", the Israeli winner from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Contest]], as a tribute to the victims of the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Balkan War]] (particularly Serbia and Montenegro, which was banned from participation as penalty for the Balkan Wars), who were unable to view the contest after bombings destroyed television transmitters.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

The '''''Frutillar Musical Weeks''''' (Semanas Musicales de Frutillar) is a [[classical music]] [[Music Festival|festival]] that takes place every year in the southern [[Chile]]an town of [[Frutillar]], [[Los Lagos Region]].

== History ==

The Frutillar Musical Weeks were conceived in 1968 by a group of Frutillar residents supported by the [[German Chilean| German Chilean League of Santiago]]. Robert Dick, Arturo Yunge, Alfredo Daetz and Flora Inostroza made up the organizing committee for the first 12 years of the festival’s existence, and much of the credit for the success of the festival should be granted to them. Thanks to Flora Inostroza, the [[University of Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Air Force]] have been close collaborators in the festival since its launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpatagonia.com/paseos/semanas_musicales/index_i.html Musical Weeks (EN)] Interpatagonia touristic information retrieved on November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days, the Musical Weeks were held in [[Catholic]] or [[Lutheran]] church and then at the municipal gym, until they became so popular that they needed a larger venue.

The Musical Weeks have been held every summer since 1968. Today the festival is one of the most important classical music events in Chile.

== Location and venues ==

[[Frutillar]] is a small [[List of cities in Chile|town]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] located in southern [[Chile]] in the [[Los Lagos Region]], 983&amp;nbsp;km (630&amp;nbsp;mi) south of [[Santiago]], the capital.
The bay of Frutillar is found on the shores of [[Lake Llanquihue]], the largest lake lying entirely within Chile.  Frutillar (which translates as “strawberry fields”) is known as the "City of Music" thanks to the festival, and was originally populated mainly by German settlers from Hamburg in the 1850s.

The main venue of the festival since 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://diario.latercera.com/2010/11/07/01/contenido/cultura-entretencion/30-43968-9-veronica-villarroel-y-paquito-d-rivera-se-lucen-en-teatro-del-lago.shtml Verónica Villarroel y Paquito D' Rivera se lucen en Teatro del Lago (ES)]  Denisse Espinoza, Frutillar november 07, 2010  La Tercera]&lt;/ref&gt; is the '''Teatro del Lago''' (''Theatre of the Lake''), a theatre and concert hall housed in a 10,000 m2 building. Opening on November 6, 2010 after 12 years in development, it is located right on the shore of [[Llanquihue Lake]] so that the interior auditorium enjoys a view of the snow-capped [[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] across the lake.

The architecture of the building is contemporary, but retains links with the traditional southern Chilean style, strongly influenced by German immigrants. Native materials were used in construction, such as wood, stone and copper.

The largest room in the venue is the "Espacio Tronador", which can seat almost 1,200 spectators. The auditorium is made completely of wood, and the spaces are outlined by the curved lines of the stage, rows of seats and high balconies.

There is also a range of other multipurpose salons and foyers, exhibition areas, rehearsal spaces, conference rooms and congress halls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrodellago.cl/web/english/ Teatro del Lago (EN)] www.teatrodellago.cl retrieved on November 05, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival ==

The festival takes place between January and February every year and lasts for 10 days. It features more than 40 classical concerts performed by both Chilean and international artists. The program includes music and composers from different periods as well as famous Chilean and international performers and conductors, chamber orchestras, choirs and soloists.

In addition to the events that take place in Frutillar, other nearby towns also hold free concerts.

Sculptures on musical and festival themes can be found all along the Frutillar lakeshore, such as an amphitheatre, a [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] grand piano and a [[gazebo]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welcomechile.com/frutillar/musical-weeks.html Frutillar Musical Weeks (EN)] welcomechile.com © 2007-2014 Total or partial reproduction forbidden.

'''''Give a Boy a Gun''''' is an [[epistolary novel]] for young adults by [[Todd Strasser]], first published in 2000. The novel describes the events and social circumstances that lead up to, and form the aftermath of, a fictional [[school shooting]]. The story is presented in the form of dickents of transcribed post-incident interviews with students, parents, teachers, and community members, compiled by Denise Shipley, a journalism student who is the stepsister of one of the shooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life is Tough: Guys, Growing Up, and Young Adult Literature

Interspersed through the book are footnotes providing statistical information about guns and [[gun violence]].
 
The plot has some similarities to the real-life [[Columbine High School massacre]] of April 20, 1999, although Strasser began research on the book before the Columbine shooting.&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite book|title=They Hurt, They Scar, They Shoot, They Kill: Toxic Characters in Young Adult Fiction|year=2016|author= Joni Richards Bodart|isbn=1442230827| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_PADAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was the first book relating to school shootings published after Columbine.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

==Summary==

|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary has lived in town since second grade, while Brendan is a new arrival. The two quickly become friends. They are subjected to verbal and physical bullying by football players at Middletown, which teachers and parents fail to notice, downplay, or outright ignore. 

As time passes, both boys become darker and angrier, experimenting with alcohol and drugs, becoming obsessive about violent video games, and withdrawing from most social activities. Eventually the boys begin to obsess over the possibility of acting on their violent impulses. Gary experiments with developing a powerful homemade bomb. Gary and Brendan steal [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic guns]] from a neighbour. Meanwhile, students are excited about an upcoming dance to be held in the school's gym. 

On the night of the dance, Brendan leaves a cryptic message for his friend Emily, warning her not to attend because there will be trouble. Masked, Brendan and Gary enter the gym just after the dance begins. They shoot out the lights before restraining the attendees with [[Cable tie|cable ties]]. Gary booby-traps the doors with bombs so they will explode if anyone tries to open them. 

The pair approach the football team's quarterback, Sam, who has been one of their main tormentors. After some debate, they decide to shoot out his kneecaps so he will be unable to play football ever again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BB7hAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22give+a+boy+a+gun%22+emily+dance+kneecaps|title=Kliatt Young Adult Paperback Book Guide - Volume 36|year=2002|isbn=|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary and Brendan fire their guns randomly around the gym, scaring students and injuring others. Another football player, Dustin, manages to get free and unties some others. Gary commits suicide while Brendan is beaten into a coma by the football players. Brendan suffers irreversible brain damage from the beating and those responsible are arrested and put on trial for attempted murder. 

The book ends with Denise Shipley, Gary's stepsister, wondering if Gary knew if there were other options besides violence. She swears she will always treat others with respect and teach others to do the same. She also shares her belief that semi-automatic weapons should be outlawed and handguns should be only in the hands of law enforcement.

== Prevention and control ==
* Using the '''health warning systems'''. A health system responsive to the needs of the population is required to refine the instruments to ensure adequate preparation before their hatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|title=Health Alert Network (HAN). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Atlanta. 2011/08/29.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912180424/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/|archivedate=2011-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valencia R, Román E, García-León FJ, et al.

Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:425–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Transparency of the institutions''' public or private. The perception of crisis can escape the control of experts or health institutions, and be determined by stakeholders to provide solutions propagate or concerned. This requires a difficult balancing of the need to articulate clear answers and the little-founded fears.&lt;ref&gt;Abouzhr C, Adjei S, Kanchanachitra C. From data to policy: good practices and cautionary tales. Lancet. 2007; 369:1039–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adequate '''information policy'''. Irrationality arise when information is distorted, or hidden. Face a health crisis involves: respect for society, coordination of organizations and an institution with scientific weight to the people and to the media, who acted as spokesman in situations of public health risk, to get confidence citizens. The technical capacity of health professionals is more proven than the public officials, which suggests a greater share of the former and better training of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/Risks/|title=Risk Communication- Gateway to Health Communication - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcs.es/publicaciones/sistema_sanitario_situaciones_crisis.html|title=El Sistema Sanitario ante situaciones de crisis|first=Quodem Consultores S.L.|last=www.quodem.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamata F. Crisis sanitaria y respuesta política. Rev Adm Sanit. 2006; 4:401–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Evaluate the previous crisis''' or others experiences. Crises are challenges that must be learned from both the mistakes and successes, since they serve to bring about to the devices and improve the response to other crises.

'''Independence Day''' ([[colloquial]]: '''the Fourth of July''') is a [[Federal holidays in the United States|federal holiday]] in the United States commemorating the adoption of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776. The [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] declared that the [[Thirteen colonies|thirteen American colonies]] regarded themselves as free and independent states, the [[United States|United States of America]], and were no longer connected to the British Crown.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technotes.whw1.com/all/78-differences-days-of-memorial-veterans-independence-and-labor#What-is-Independence-Day-in-USA

Independence Day is commonly associated with [[fireworks]], [[parade]]s, [[barbecue]]s, [[traveling carnival|carnivals]], [[funfair|fairs]], [[picnic]]s, [[concert]]s, [[baseball|baseball game]]s, [[family reunion]]s, and [[political speech]]es and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States.

==Background==
During the [[American Revolution]], the legal separation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from Great Britain in 1776 actually occurred on July 2, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted to approve a [[Lee Resolution|resolution of independence]] that had been proposed in June by [[Richard Henry Lee]] of [[Virginia]] declaring the United States independent from Great Britain's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tws20novllpkl&gt;{{cite news
| author=Staff writer
| title = How Declaration of Independence was Drafted
| quote = On the following day, when the formal vote of Congress was taken, the resolutions were approved by twelve Colonies–all except New York. The original Colonies, therefore, became the United States of America on July 2, 1776.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a [[Committee of Five]], with [[Thomas Jefferson]] as its principal author. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier, [[John Adams]] had written to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]]:

{{quote|The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776, 'Had a Declaration…' |url=http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/aea/cfm/doc.cfm?id=L17760703jasecond |work=Adams Family Papers |publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CNFwEVU?url=http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/aea/cfm/doc.cfm?id=L17760703jasecond |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Maier |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Maier |title=Making Sense of the Fourth of July |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2005/06/20050606131757pssnikwad0.3779871.html#axzz3fMjujpiK |work=American Heritage |date=August 7, 1997 |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and [[Benjamin Franklin]] all later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have concluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnett |first=Edward Cody |year=1941 |title=The Continental Congress |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

Coincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the Declaration of Independence later to serve as [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]], died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meacham |first=Jon |title=Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power |publisher=Random House LLC |year=2012 |isbn=978-0679645368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeFUTfvFquEC |page=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a signer of the Declaration of Independence, [[James Monroe]], another [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] who was elected as President, also died on July 4, 1831.

==Observance==
* In 1777, thirteen [[gunshot]]s were fired in salute, once at morning and once again as evening fell, on July 4 in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. An article in July 18, 1777 issue of ''[[The Virginia Gazette]]'' noted a celebration in Philadelphia in a manner a modern American would find familiar: an official dinner for the Continental Congress, toasts, [[Saluting guns|13-gun salutes]], speeches, prayers, music, parades, troop reviews, and fireworks. Ships in port were decked with red, white, and blue bunting.&lt;ref name="heintze_first"&gt;Heintze, "The First Celebrations".&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1778, from his headquarters at [[Ross Hall]], near [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], General [[George Washington]] marked July 4 with a double ration of [[rum]] for his soldiers and an artillery salute (''[[feu de joie]]''). Across the Atlantic Ocean, [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassadors]] John Adams and [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a dinner for their fellow Americans in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref name="heintze_chron"&gt;Heintze, "A Chronology of Notable Fourth of July Celebration Occurrences".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:American 1902 Fourth of July fireworks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|American children of many ethnic backgrounds celebrate noisily in 1902 ''Puck'' cartoon]]

* In 1781, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] became the first [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] to recognize July 4 as a state celebration.&lt;ref name="heintze_chron" /&gt;
* In 1783, [[Old Salem|Salem, North Carolina]] held a celebration with a challenging music program assembled by [[Johann Friedrich Peter]] entitled ''The Psalm of Joy''. The town claims to be the first public July 4 event, as it was carefully documented by the [[Moravian Church]], and there are no government records of any earlier celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ourstate.com/old-salem/ |title=Time Stands Still in Old Salem |first=Michael |last=Graff |date=November 2012 |magazine=[[Our State]] |access-date=July 4, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004152134/http://www.ourstate.com/old-salem/ |archivedate=October 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence Day is a [[National Day|national holiday]] marked by patriotic displays. Similar to other summer-themed events, Independence Day celebrations often take place outdoors. According to {{UnitedStatesCode|5|6103}}, Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as the [[United States Postal Service|postal service]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]) are closed on that day. Many politicians make it a point on this day to appear at a public event to praise the nation's heritage, laws, history, society, and people.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Families often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or barbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long weekend to gather with relatives or friends. Decorations (''e.g.'', streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Parades are often held in the morning, before family get-togethers, while fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings often incorporating [[bonfires]] as their centerpiece. In [[New England]], towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels and casks. They were lit at nightfall to usher in the celebration. The highest were in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels. These made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries and is still practiced in some [[New England]] towns.&lt;ref name="appelbaum"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Night Before the Fourth |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/07/the-night-before-the-fourth/241259/ |publisher=The Atlantic |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 4, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025113635/http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/07/the-night-before-the-fourth/241259/ |archivedate=October 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence Day [[fireworks]] are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the [[national anthem]], "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"; "[[God Bless America]]"; "[[America the Beautiful]]"; "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]"; "[[This Land Is Your Land]]"; "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]"; and, regionally, "[[Yankee Doodle]]" in northeastern states and "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall images of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] or the [[War of 1812]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[File:4th of July Independence Day Parade 2014 DC (14466486678).jpg|thumb|Independence Day Parade in Washington, D.C.]]

Firework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have led some states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In addition, local and regional weather conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local or regional firework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other specific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as those at sports events) may still take place, if certain safety precautions have been taken.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a "salute to the union," is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the 21-Gun Salute|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/salute.html|publisher=U.S. Army [[Center of Military History]]|date=October 3, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619040513/http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/salute.html|archivedate=June 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City has the largest fireworks display in the country, with more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded in 2009.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; It generally holds displays in the East River.

Willard]] that came to be known as ''The Spirit of '76''. Often imitated or parodied, it is a familiar symbol of American patriotism]]
* Held since 1785, the [[Bristol Fourth of July Parade]] in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]], is the oldest continuous Independence Day celebration in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of America's Oldest Fourth of July Celebration|url=http://fccbristol.org/meet-fcc-bristol/founder-of-americas-oldest-fourth-of-july-celebration/|publisher=First Congregational Church|accessdate=23 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323224322/http://fccbristol.org/meet-fcc-bristol/founder-of-americas-oldest-fourth-of-july-celebration/|archivedate=March 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 1868, [[Seward, Nebraska]], has held a celebration on the same town square. In 1979 Seward was designated "America's Official Fourth of July City-Small Town USA" by resolution of Congress. Seward has also been proclaimed "Nebraska's Official Fourth of July City" by Governor James Exon in proclamation. Seward is a town of 6,000 but swells to 40,000+ during the July 4 celebrations.&lt;ref name="Seward"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Seward Nebraska 4th of July|url=http://www.julyfourthseward.com/history.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713125505/http://www.julyfourthseward.com/history.html|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 1912, the Rebild Society, a Danish-American friendship organization, has held a July 4 weekend festival that serves as a homecoming for Danish-Americans in the [[Rebild Hills]] of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.rebildfesten.dk/default.asp?pageId=48&amp;mainId=9&amp;lang=UK |work=Rebild Society |publisher=Rebild National Park Society |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701064103/http://www.rebildfesten.dk/default.asp?pageId=48&amp;mainId=9&amp;lang=UK |archivedate=July 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 1959, the [[Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival|International Freedom Festival]] is jointly held in Detroit, Michigan and [[Windsor, Ontario]] during the last week of June each year as a mutual celebration of Independence Day and [[Canada Day]] (July 1). It culminates in a large fireworks display over the [[Detroit River]].
* The famous [[Macy's]] fireworks display usually held over the [[East River]] in New York City has been televised nationwide on [[NBC]] since 1976. In 2009, the fireworks display was returned to the [[Hudson River]] for the first time since 2000 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s exploration of that river.&lt;ref name="macys2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fds.com/pressroom/macys/macysnational/media_kits.asp?mediakit=318 |title=2009 Macy's 4th of July Fireworks |date=April 29, 2009 |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |publisher=[[Federated Department Stores]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CNRE8Yp?url=http://www.fds.com/pressroom/macys/macysnational/media_kits.asp?mediakit=318 |archivedate=August 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] has hosted a music and fireworks show over the [[Charles River Esplanade]] called the "Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular" annually since 1973.&lt;ref name="boston4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.july4th.org/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822175246/http://www.july4th.org/index.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |title=Welcome to Boston's 4th of July Celebration |year=2009 |publisher=Boston 4 Celebrations Foundation |accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was broadcast nationally from 1991 until 2002 on [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]], and since 2002 by [[CBS]] and its Boston station [[WBZ-TV]]. [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ/1030]] and WBZ-TV broadcast the entire event locally, and from 2002 through 2012, CBS broadcast the final hour of the concert nationally in primetime. The national broadcast was put on hiatus beginning in 2013, which Pops executive producer [[David G. Mugar]] believed was the result of decreasing viewership [[Counterprogramming|caused by]] NBC's encore presentation of the Macy's fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Burnett III.

==Other countries==
[[The Philippines]] celebrates July 4 as its [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Republic Day]] to commemorate that day in 1946 when it ceased to be a [[U.S. territory]] and the United States officially recognized [[History of the Philippines (1946–65)|Philippine Independence]].&lt;ref name="Gov.Ph"&gt;{{Citation

July 4 was intentionally chosen by the United States because it corresponds to its Independence Day, and this day was observed in the Philippines as [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] until 1962. In 1964, the name of the July 4 holiday was changed to Republic Day. [[Rebild National Park]] in Denmark is said to hold the largest July 4 celebrations outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20120627-worldwide-weird-celebrate-american-independence-in-denmark |date= Jul 3, 2012 |title= Celebrate American independence in Denmark |author= Lindsey Galloway |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141115201301/http://www.bbc.com/travel/blog/20120627-worldwide-weird-celebrate-american-independence-in-denmark |archivedate= November 15, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69779">This is a '''list of countries by natural disaster risk''', as measured in the ''World Risk Index'', calculated by the [[United Nations University]] Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and featured in the 2016 World Risk Report (WRR 2016) published by the Alliance Development Works/Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft (BEH).

The report systematically considers a country's vulnerability and its exposure to [[natural hazard]]s to determine a ranking of countries around the world based on their [[natural disaster]] risk. The WRI developed by UNU-EHS and BEH the main feature of the WRR, determines the risk of becoming a victim of a disaster as a result of vulnerability and natural hazards such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcanic eruptions]], [[storms]], [[floods]], [[droughts]] and [[sea level]] rise for 173 countries worldwide. The WRI is based on 28 indicators and research data which are globally freely available and results in a global risk ranking and maps which allow for comparison between countries. Risk is at its highest where a high level of exposure to natural hazards coincides with very vulnerable societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldriskreport.com/uploads/media/WorldRiskReport_2013_fact_sheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504140244/http://www.worldriskreport.com/uploads/media/WorldRiskReport_2013_fact_sheet.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moors and Christians Festival of Alcoy, in honor of [[Saint George]] was declared of International Tourist Interest in 1980, and is the origin for all the Moors and Christians festivals celebrated in the Valencian Community.

In 1276, different historical figures related to the various Muslim uprisings taking place in the region led to Saint George being recognized as the patron of Alcoy, who is attributed with the intervention in a battle to defend the population who were under attack by the Muslims. It was in this battle that the Muslim leader [[Al-Azraq]] is reputed to have been killed.

== Museum ==

== Dates ==

The '''National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL)''' was India’s first electronic commodity spot exchange that was established in view of the then Prime Minister’s vision to create a “single market” across the country for both manufactured and agricultural produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/indias-first-electronic-spot-exchange-starts-trading/articleshow/3599865.cms|title=India's first electronic spot exchange starts trading|date=15 October 2008|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Economic Survey of 2002-03 of the Government of India also recommended setting up a national-level, integrated market for agricultural products, as did the Planning Commission. This was followed by the Rangarajan Committee, which too sought a national spot market. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2004-05/chapt2005/chap818.pdf |title=Budget |website=indiabudget.nic.in |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/aboutus/committee/wrkgrp11/wg11_agrpm.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - COVER PAGE.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2004-05/bs/speecha.htm|title=Government of India : Union Budget and Economic Survey|website=indiabudget.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of India granted permission to NSEL along with two other spot exchanges to start operations. The Government of India issued a Gazette Notification dated June 5, 2007 granted general exemption under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA.) 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmc.gov.in/show_file.aspx?linkid=gazette_notification_fcra-2007-506708308.pdf |title=Notification |website=www.fmc.gov.in |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSEL commenced operations providing an electronic trading platform in October 2008 and simultaneously, as many as six state governments issued licenses under the model Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act to NSEL.
In August 2011, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) was appointed as the ‘designated agency’ to regulate these spot exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/360759776/The-Gazette-Notification-NSEL|title=The Gazette Notification - NSEL|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrupt Closure of NSEL==

Immediately after being designated the agency to supervise and regulate spot exchanges by the MoCA, the FMC sought clarification from NSEL regarding the fulfillment of conditions stipulated under the exemption notification.
 
Despite the detail clarification given by the NSEL, the FMC wrongly, on April 10, 2012, sent a letter to MoCA misrepresenting facts and stating that NSEL had breached certain conditions of the exemption notification and in view thereof called upon the MoCA to take necessary action for such violation.

In view of this, on April 27, 2012, the MoCA issued show cause notice to NSEL. 
Responding twice to the show cause notice, NSEL wrote to the Ministry clarifying that the exemption granted to it under Section 27 of FCRA was general and not specific in nature.

Despite giving a detailed explanation, there was no communication from the Ministry’s side for over a year and half. All said and done, the Ministry in a letter on July 12, 2013, pending legal advice, directed NSEL to halt launching of further and fresh contracts until further instruction from the concerned authority and to settle all existing contracts on the due dates. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-nsel-did-forward-markets-commission-s-action-spook-the-market-2059598|title=NSEL: Did Forward Markets Commission's action spook the market?|date=10 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==24 Defaulters and their Role==

On August 4, 2013, the FMC Chairman Mr Ramesh Abhishek had a meeting with defaulters and Brokers at Hotel Trident at BKC in Mumbai. After the meeting, Abhishek told the media: ‘There are 23 such entities who owe Rs 5,400 to the exchange and through exchange to the people who put money there. Sixteen entities came today and we had detailed discussions with them about how they are going to repay the money and the schedule, etc. And, we found that most of them were willing to repay in as little time as possible for them.’ 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znfuIhVMUnc&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Bloomberg TV Market Pulse NSEL's Settlement Plan - 05 Aug 2013|first=|last=Sanjana Yadav|date=22 September 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2013, the MoCA also issued a gazette notification giving omnibus powers to the FMC to take all actions necessary against all persons including defaulters, brokers, warehouses etc. for recovery.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartinvestor.business-standard.com/market/Marketnews-191811-Marketnewsdet-Govt_provides_teeth_to_FMC_to_probe_NSEL_fiasco.htm#.WZQX1VEjG1s|title=The Smart Investor|website=smartinvestor.business-standard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the exchange closed abruptly, 24 entities collectively failed to honour their commitment, giving rise to a payment default of Rs 5,600 crore. The 24 entities also defaulted on their obligations after promising FMC Chairman Abhishek at the August 4, 2013 meeting that they will repay their dues in a phased manner. 
Instead of repaying the money, the defaulters not only diverted the proceeds of this crime into parallel businesses.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/investing/nsel-scam-police-attach-100-properties-of-defaulters-1228263.html|title=NSEL scam: Police attach 100 properties of defaulters - Firstpost|website=www.firstpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, On August 22, 2014, the Bombay High Court categorically stated ‘The money invested has not come to NSEL, but has gone to the borrowers. i.e. bogus sellers. It is the borrowers who have been benefitted by the transactions and the money of 'investors' have gone to them. The names of 25 different companies who are the defaulters have been mentioned in the FIR itself. Thus, though projected a 'scam of Rs.5600 crores', the ill-gotten amount has not gone to the applicant (Jignesh Shah,) or for that matter, to NSEL.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/360761496/5-Bail-application-Jignesh-Shah|title=5. Bail application - Jignesh Shah - Sales - Investor|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the investigating agencies including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police have traced the entire money trail of Rs.5,600 crore to the 24 defaulters. Not a single paisa has been found with NSEL, FTIL or its founder.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/360761505/6-Order-by-the-Ministry-of-Corporate-Affairs|title=6. Order by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs - Government Of India - Liquidation|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2016, in a written reply in Lok Sabha, the then Union Minister of State in Finance, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal also stated that ‘The entire amount which is gone to the brokers and defaulters belong to the 13,000 investors.’ 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=39132&amp;lsno=16|title=Questions : Lok Sabha|website=164.100.47.194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Brokers mis-sold NSEL Products, Manipulated KYCs==

In the NSEL crisis, big brokers have many irregularities by mis-selling the products, misrepresenting the facts and manipulating the KYC and modifying the client code. 
Considering the multiple complaints against the misdeeds of the brokers, in 2016, SEBI cracked the whip on the top powerful brokers by initiating an audit against those who sold NSEL contracts to their clients often presenting them as an assured return product, which in reality, were not.  Five top brokers are under scanner as they have the highest exposure to NSEL from 2011 to 2013. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/xSbXBF4WhEuhZNDsnGNE4N/Sebi-begins-action-against-NSEL-brokers.html|title=Sebi begins action against NSEL brokers|first=Jayshree P.|last=Upadhyay|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These brokers have been facing the regulatory heat, as SEBI has issued show cause notice for various irregularities done by them. The charges against these brokers are as follows:

#False assurance, inducement and misrepresentation
#Trading without client authority
#Misuse of Unique Client Code
#Funding with or without the consent of the trading client
#Trades not matching with the records of  NSEL
#Non-receipt of the pay-outs
#Manipulation of ledger accounts
#Fabrication of client’s KYC documents
#Threats of submitting incorrect information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-suspects-money-laundering-by-brokers-in-nsel-scam-116083101615_1.html|title=Sebi suspects money laundering by brokers in NSEL scam|first=Shrimi|last=Choudhary|date=31 August 2016|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/nsel-crisis-over-30-brokers-under-regulatory-scanner-113120400802_1.html|title=NSEL crisis: Over 30 brokers under regulatory scanner|first=Press Trust of|last=India|date=4 December 2013|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/NSEL-scamSebi-starts-probing-brokers-for-mis-selling-products/articleshow/51895310.cms|title=NSEL scam:Sebi starts probing brokers for mis-selling products - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEBI has issued two show-cause notices to the top five brokers namely Anand Rathi Commodities, India Infoline Commodities (IIFL), Geofin Comtrade, Motilal Oswal Commodities, and Phillip Commodities, on charges of mis-selling NSEL contracts by promising assured returns without ensuring delivery.  
They also allegedly modified client codes for doing multiple deals. In the notice, SEBI asked these brokers as to why they should not be declared not “fit and proper” since they were found to have violated securities regulations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-sends-not-fit-and-proper-notice-to-five-brokers-in-rs-5-600-cr-nsel-scam-116121500606_1.html|title=Sebi showcause notice to 5 brokers in NSEL scam|first=Dilip Kumar|last=Jha|date=15 December 2016|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police also found evidence of large-scale irregularities on the part of these brokers in the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) case. A forensic audit by the EOW also revealed hawala transactions, benami trades and client code modifications by these brokers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-s-nsel-audit-finds-lapses-at-five-brokers-117042701351_1.html|title=Sebi issues final show-cause notice in NSEL scam case to five big brokers|first=Shrimi|last=Choudhary|date=27 April 2017|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, NSEL never ever offered assured return product. 
In fact, NSEL had repeatedly warned these members about selling contracts as assured return products to its trading clients and cautioned them not to offer any assured returns. 
NSEL had issued circulars cautioning its members to refrain from offering any such contracts by offering assured returns. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalspotexchange.com/NSELUploads/ExchangeCircular/2012/February/747/NSEL-2012-024.pdf |title=Circular |date=2012 |website=www.nationalspotexchange.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Actuality of 13,000 Trading Clients==

In the NSEL case, there have been claims of 13,000 trading clients who have faced monetary losses. However, the authenticity or genuineness of these so-called investors is under scrutiny. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3S3vtHjxQ8|title=Market Pulse- 13,000 NSEL Investors 'Not Genuine’: Bombay HC|first=|last=Bloomberg TV India|date=25 August 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Many brokerage firms misused and cheated the trading clients by misrepresenting facts, mis-selling NSEL contracts and also misusing the KYC of trading clients without their knowledge and as a result of which, trapped them of huge exposures on the NSEL platform.

On June 27, 2016, some trading clients received notices from the income-tax department seeking details, among others, of source of funds, bad debt claimed during assessment years 2014-15 and 2015–16 and their transactions made on NSEL. 
According to the report in The Economic Times, the letter terms the claims by traders, brokers, and their nonbanking finance companies "illegal", "multiple" and for "bogus losses". It said the Rs 2,000-3,000 crore worth claims were causing losses to the exchequer. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/nsel-investors-and-entities-receive-tax-notices/articleshow/53924386.cms|title=NSEL investors and entities receive tax notices|first=Ram|last=Sahgal|date=30 August 2016|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2016, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the then Minister of State for Finance, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal also made it clear that the veracity of these investors is being looked into. He stated, “The EOW, Mumbai has the data of 12,768 investors, who claimed to have lost monies in NSEL. The verification of genuineness of investors can be done through the examination of the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) documents.” Mr Meghwal further clarified that the Income Tax Department, which is also investigating the investors, has not given a clean chit to any of these investors. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=45920&amp;lsno=16|title=Questions : Lok Sabha|website=164.100.47.194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/none-of-nsel-investors-given-clean-chit-by-it-dept-meghwal/article9440755.ece|title=None of NSEL investors given ‘clean chit’ by I-T Dept: Meghwal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hon. Bombay High Court appointed committee has also questioned the genuineness of the trading clients and whether in fact there are 13,000 trading clients who have reportedly suffered due to the crisis.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BS Reporter |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/bombay-hc-allows-collecting-info-on-outstanding-from-nsel-investors-115040101147_1.html |title=Bombay HC allows collecting info on outstanding from NSEL investors &amp;#124; Business Standard News |publisher=Business-standard.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has sought detailed answers from the 13,000 so-called investors to uncover if the brokers induced them to trade in the commodities spot exchange. The 6-page questionnaire also wants answers on the non-payment of value-added tax at the time of trading.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets-business/sfio-sends-6-page-questionnaire-to-nsel-investors-intensifies-probe-against-brokers-2278899.html|title=SFIO sends 6-page questionnaire to NSEL investors, intensifies probe against brokers|website=Moneycontrol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery by NSEL==

*NSEL has been successful in obtaining decrees on admission against 5 defaulters from the Hon. Bombay High Court, to the tune of Rs. 1,233.02 crore
*NSEL has helped in tracked the assets of defaulters and secured injunctions against the assets of 18 defaulters from the Bombay High Court in respect of claims of Rs. 4515.93 crore &lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;
*NSEL has already cleared 100% dues of all trading clients (so-called investors) who had an exposure of up to Rs.2 lakh
*NSEL has also cleared 50% of the claim amount of each of 6,445 trading clients (so-called investors) having claims of Rs.2 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=46340&amp;lsno=16|title=Questions : Lok Sabha|website=164.100.47.194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thus, NSEL, with the help of its parent company 63 moons, has given relief to 7,053 trading clients
*NSEL has filed various cases including recover suits against the defaulting members before different forums, civil as well as criminal. These proceedings are pending at different stages and NSEL is taking appropriate steps for quick redressal.

==What lessons in India can we learn from other countries?==

Dr. Jatin Pancholi (Middlesex University, London, United Kingdom) found in his research that an emerging south Asian economy Hong Kong has faced a similar issue. Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (HKMex) that was started in June 2008 is now closed in May 2013 on account of financial irregularities and false instruments. 
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), now known as Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is the world’s oldest futures and options exchange in the USA since 1848. The trading here is by both open-outcry and electronic methods. CME is regulated by rules and regulations of the National Futures Association (NFA) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In addition, the CME is regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency of the USA government. Post 2008 financial crisis in the USA, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform &amp; Consumer Protection Act has brought comprehensive reforms in the commodities and swaps markets. 

The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (LIFFE), UK, formerly known as the London Commodities Exchange (LCE) is now a part of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). LIFFE is the biggest futures exchanges in the Europe and is recognized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the new name of Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is a part of the government in the UK. The London Metal Exchange (LME) based in the UK has both market and member surveillance systems. 

In November 2007, a European Union law on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) has been passed to provide harmonised regulation for investment services across the 31 members (28 members of the European Union, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). MiFID has attempted to strike a delicate balance between controlled regulations and encouraged harmonious transactions. MiFID provides for position limits on commodity derivatives, prevents market abuse and supports orderly pricing and settlement conditions. The entire European market is being watched and regulated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), based in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2013/37/commentary/nsel-debacle.html|title=NSEL Debacle|date=5 June 2015|publisher=|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=48|issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Forced Merger Order of NSEL-FTIL==
 
Despite all the measures taken by NSEL, the FMC has misinformed the Ministry of Consumer Affairs that NSEL does not have resources, financial or organisational capability to recover the dues of the trading members. On February 12, 2016, the MCA issued the Final Order to forcefully amalgamate NSEL with its publicly listed parent, FTIL, completely undermining and ignoring the interest of FTIL’s 63,000+ shareholders in spite of their vehement opposition to the forced merger. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-editorials/sebi-should-apply-its-mind-to-nsel-ftil-proposed-amalgamation-case/|title=Sebi should apply its mind to NSEL-FTIL proposed amalgamation case|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2016, The Hindu Business Line in its editorial stated: 'The use of Section 396 of the Companies Act to push through the merger also sets a bad precedent. The Centre has used this tool four times in the past, but it was done sensibly, and in a manner that protected the interests of both the entities being merged. NSEL, which has no operations currently, will only saddle FTIL with additional liabilities; this is against the interest of the minority shareholders of the company. Ironically, this is being done to protect investors savvy enough to trade on a commodity exchange.'
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/editorial/robbing-peter/article8241245.ece#|title=Robbing Peter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2016, The Economic Times in its editorial stated: 'The government has set a bad precedent with the forcible merger it has ordered of National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) into its promoter company, Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL). There are three problems with the move. One, it would go down as an instance of rare executive high-handedness, if it were to emerge, in the judicial challenge and resolution of the dispute that will now ensue, that this was not the right thing to do. Two, the natural order of priority for recovery of the outstanding dues of some Rs 5,600 crore owed to some traders would begin with the defaulting traders, proceed to the brokers involved and then the exchange, but the government has short-circuited the sequence by fixing the responsibility on the exchange and then shifting it to its promoter company. Three, the concept of limited liability, a cornerstone of modern entrepreneurship, stands revealed as having limited value in India’s regulatory apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-editorials/why-the-nsel-ftil-merger-may-be-a-bad-precedent/|title=Why the NSEL-FTIL merger may be a bad precedent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2017, the Bombay High Court dismissed the petition filed by 63 moons technologies, previously FTIL, to oppose the forced merger of NSEL with FTIL. The execution of the order, however, has been held up for up to 12 weeks and 63 moons technologies plans to proceed with the case to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/bombay-hc-dismisses-ftils-plea-challenging-its-forceful-merger-with-nsel/articleshow/61911827.cms|title=Bombay HC upholds NSEL merger order; 63 Moons to move Supreme Court|first=Ram|last=Sahgal|date=4 December 2017|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25678">{{About|path dependence in economics and social sciences|a similar topic in physics|Path dependence (physics)}}

'''Path dependence''' explains how the set of decisions one faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions one has made in the past or by the events that one has experienced, even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Definition from [http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/06/15/346883/-Our-Love-Of-Sewers-A-Lesson-in-Path-Dependence "Our Love Of Sewers: A Lesson in Path Dependence"], Dave Praeger, 15 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]] and the [[social science]]s, path dependence can refer either to outcomes at a single moment in time, or to long-run equilibria of a process. In common usage, the phrase implies either:
{{ordered list |type=upper-alpha
 |that "history matters" — a broad concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liebowitz |first1= S. |last2=Margolis |first2= Stephen |title= Encyclopedia of Law and Economics |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-1-85898-984-6 |page= 981 |quote= Most generally, path dependence means that where we go next depends not only on where we are now, but also upon where we have been.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
 |that predictable [[Amplifier|amplifications]] of small differences are a disproportionate [[ultimate cause|cause]] of later circumstances, and, in the "strong" form, that this historical hang-over is [[inefficient]].&lt;ref name="LMTypes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liebowitz |first1= S. |last2=Margolis |first2= S. |editor1-first= Boudewijn |editor1-last= Bouckaert |editor2-first= Gerrit |editor2-last= De Geest |title= Encyclopedia of Law and Economics, Volume I. The History and Methodology of Law and Economics |url= http://encyclo.findlaw.com/0770book.pdf |accessdate= 2010-05-20 |date=September 2000 |publisher= Edward Elgar |location= Cheltenham |isbn= 978-1-85898-984-6 |page= 985 |quote= path dependence can be weak (the efficiency of the chosen path is tied with some alternatives), semi-strong, (the chosen path is not the best but not worth fixing, or strong (the chosen path is highly inefficient, but we are unable to correct it). }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the first usage, (A), "history matters" is trivially true in many contexts; everything has causes, and sometimes different causes lead to different outcomes. In these contexts, the direct influence of earlier states may not be notable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bellaïche |first=Joël |year=2009 |title=On the path-dependence of economic growth |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Economics]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |page=178 |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~jbellaic/growth.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jmateco.2009.11.002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624073123/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~jbellaic/growth.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-24 |df= }} The standard [[economic growth]] rate measurements are path-dependent, and "the phenomenon of dependence of history might be ignored for short period of time (10 years, 20 years), but is not negligible for [[wiktionary:secular|secular]] comparisons."&lt;/ref&gt; unlike [[Option style#Non-vanilla path-dependent .22exotic.22 options|"path-dependent" options]] in [[finance]], where the influence of history can be [[exotic option|non-standard]].

It is the narrow concept (B), that has the most explanatory force, and which is covered in this article.

==Illustration==
The [[videotape format war]] is an example. Three mechanisms ''independent of product quality'' could explain how [[VHS]] [[format war#1970s|achieved dominance]] over [[Betamax]] from a negligible [[early adoption]] lead:
# A [[network effect]]: [[videocassette]] [[video rental shop|rental stores]] observed more VHS rentals and stocked up on VHS tapes, leading [[Renting#Rental agreements|renters]] to buy VHS players and rent more VHS tapes, until there was complete [[vendor lock-in]].
# A VCR manufacturer [[bandwagon effect]] of switching to VHS-production because they expected it to win the ''standards battle''.
# Sony, the original developer of Betamax, was not very interested in supporting the pornographic video industry, which made nearly all pornographic motion pictures released on video to use VHS format.

An alternative analysis is that VHS was [[Videotape format war#Market share|better-adapted to market demands]] (e.g. having a longer recording time). In this interpretation, path dependence had little to do with VHS's success, which would have occurred even if Betamax had established an early lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liebowitz |first=Stan |title=Re-thinking the Network Economy |year=2002 |page=41 |url= http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/book/chapter1.html#_Toc536617 |isbn=978-0-8144-0649-6 |quote=It was the inferior playing time that led to the demise of the Betamax, not the fact that it was first or second or third.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive feedback]] mechanisms, like bandwagon and network effects, are at the origin of path dependence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} They lead to a reinforcing pattern, in which industries 'tip' towards one or another product design. Uncoordinated [[standardisation]] can be observed in many other situations.

==Economics==
Path dependence theory was originally developed by economists to explain technology adoption processes and industry evolution. The theoretical ideas have had a strong influence on [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An evolutionary theory of economic change|last1=Nelson|first1=R|last2=Winter|first2=S|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many models and empirical cases where economic processes do not progress steadily toward some pre-determined and unique [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], but rather the nature of any equilibrium achieved depends partly on the process of getting there. Therefore, the outcome of a path-dependent process will often not converge towards a unique equilibrium, but will instead reach one of several equilibria (sometimes known as [[Attractor|absorbing states]]).

This dynamic vision of economic evolution is very different from the tradition of [[neo-classical economics]], which in its simplest form assumed that only a single outcome could possibly be reached, regardless of initial conditions or transitory events. With path dependence, both the starting point and 'accidental' events ([[noise (economic)|noise]]) can have significant effects on the ultimate outcome. In each of the following examples it is possible to identify some [[random]] events that disrupted the ongoing course, with irreversible consequences:

* In economic development, it is said (initially by [[Paul A. David|Paul David]] in 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martin |last1=Stack |first2=Myles |last2=Gartland |year=2003 |title=Path Creation, Path Dependency, and Alternative Theories of the Firm |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |volume=37 |issue=2 |page=487 |quote=Paul David and Brian Arthur published several papers that are now regarded as the foundation of path dependency (David 1985; Arthur 1989, 1990).}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a ''standard'' that is first-to-market can become entrenched (like the [[QWERTY]] layout in typewriters still used in computer keyboards). He called this "path dependence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul David |date=May 1985 |title=Clio and the Economics of QWERTY |journal=American Economic Review |pages=332–337 |volume=75 |number=2 |quote=In such circumstances "historical accidents" can neither be ignored, nor neatly quarantined for the purpose of economic analysis |jstor=1805621}}&amp;nbsp;[https://econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/Ec100C/DavidQwerty.pdf Direct PDF link]&lt;/ref&gt; and said that inferior standards can persist simply because of the [[Legacy system|legacy]] they have built up. That [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard#Comparison of the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts|QWERTY vs. Dvorak]] is an example of this phenomenon, has been re-asserted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diamond |first=Jared |authorlink=Jared Diamond | date=April 1997 |title=The Curse of QWERTY |journal=[[Discover Magazine]] |url= http://discovermagazine.com/1997/apr/thecurseofqwerty1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liebowitz |first1=S.

* Economists from [[Adam Smith]] to [[Regional science#New economic geography|Paul Krugman]] have noted that similar businesses tend to congregate geographically ([[Economies of agglomeration|"agglomerate"]]); opening near-similar companies [[labor mobility|attracts workers]] with skills in that business, which draws in more businesses seeking experienced employees. There may have been no reason to prefer one place to another before the industry developed, but as it concentrates geographically, participants elsewhere are at a disadvantage, and will tend to move into the hub, further [[Knowledge spillover|increasing its relative efficiency]]. This [[network effect]] follows a statistical [[power law]] in the idealized case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Souza |first=Raissa M. |year=2007 |title=Emergence of Tempered Preferential Attachment from Optimization |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

* Buyers often [[cluster effect|cluster]] around sellers, and related businesses frequently form [[business cluster]]s, so a concentration of producers (initially formed by accident and agglomeration) can trigger the emergence of many dependent businesses in the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Networks and Local Linkages: The Paradox of Cluster Development in an Open Economy |author=Jen Nelles, Allison Bramwell and David Wolfe |year= 2005 |publisher= Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queens University Press for Queen's School of Policy Studies |isbn= 978-1-55339-047-3 |page= 230 |url= http://www.druid.dk/uploads/tx_picturedb/dw2005-1650.pdf |accessdate= 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s, the US dollar [[exchange rate]] appreciated, lowering the world price of [[tradable goods]] below the cost of production in many (previously successful) [[United States|U.S.]] manufacturers. Some of the factories that closed as a result, could later have been operated at a (cash-flow) profit after dollar depreciation, but reopening would have been too expensive. This is an example of [[hysteresis]], [[switching barriers]], and irreversibility.
* If the economy follows [[adaptive expectations]], future [[inflation]] is partly determined by past experience with inflation, since experience determines expected inflation and this is a major determinant of realized inflation.
* A transitory high rate of [[unemployment]] during a [[recession]] can lead to a permanently higher unemployment rate because of the skills loss (or skill obsolescence) by the unemployed, along with a deterioration of work attitudes. In other words, cyclical unemployment may generate [[structural unemployment]]. This [[structural hysteresis]] model of the [[labour market]] differs from the prediction of a "natural" unemployment rate or [[NAIRU]], around which 'cyclical' unemployment is said to move without influencing the "natural" rate itself.

Liebowitz and Margolis distinguish ''types'' of path dependence;&lt;ref name="LMTypes"/&gt; some do not imply inefficiencies and do not challenge the [[Normative economics|policy implications]] of neoclassical economics. Only "third-degree" path dependence — where switching gains are high, but transition is impractical — involves such a challenge. They argue that such situations should be rare for theoretical reasons, and that no real-world cases of [[Free market|private]] locked-in inefficiencies exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/palgrave/palpd.html |title=Path Dependence '''4.

Technically, a path-dependent stochastic process has an [[asymptotic distribution]] that "evolves as a consequence (function of) the process's own history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution and path dependence in economic ideas: past and present |first=Paul |last=David |year=2005 |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=978-1-84064-081-6 |page=19 |quote=as generally is the case for branching processes &amp;#x5b;in Path dependence, its critics and the quest for 'historical economics'&amp;#x5d;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also known as a [[Ergodic (adjective)|non-ergodic]] [[stochastic process]].

In ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959), [[Edith Penrose]] analyzed how the growth of a firm both organically and through acquisition is strongly influenced by the experience of its managers and the history of the firm's development.

==History==
{{see also|Historical institutionalism}}

Recent methodological work in comparative politics and sociology has adapted the concept of path dependence into analyses of political and social phenomena. Path dependence has primarily been used in [[Historical comparative research|comparative-historical]] analyses of the development and persistence of [[institutions]], whether they be social, political, or cultural. There are arguably two types of path-dependent processes:

* One is the "[[critical juncture]]" framework, most notably utilized by Ruth and David Collier in [[political science]]. In the critical [[wiktionary:juncture|juncture]], [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] conditions allow [[contingent]] choices that set a specific trajectory of [[institutional]] development and consolidation that is difficult to reverse. As in economics, the generic drivers are: lock-in, [[positive feedback]], [[increasing returns]] (the more a choice is made, the bigger its benefits), and [[self-reinforcement]] (which creates forces sustaining the decision).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Page | first = Scott E. | author-link = Scott E. Page | title = Path dependence | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = 88 | doi = 10.1561/100.00000006 | date = January 2006 | ref = harv }} [http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Page2006.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other path-dependent process deals with "[[reactive sequences]]" where a primary event sets off a temporally-linked and causally-tight [[deterministic]] chain of events that is nearly uninterruptible. These reactive sequences have been used to link the death of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] with welfare expansion and the [[industrial revolution]] in [[England]] with the development of the [[steam engine]].

The critical juncture framework has been used to explain the development and persistence of [[welfare states]], labor incorporation in [[Latin America]], and the variations in [[economic development]] between countries, among other things. Scholars such as Kathleen Thelen caution that the [[historical determinism]] in path-dependent frameworks is subject to constant disruption from [[Institutional economics|institutional evolution]].

==Social sciences==
[[Paul Pierson]]'s influential attempt{{specify|date=March 2017}} to [[Validity (logic)|rigorously formalize]] path dependence within political science, draws partly on ideas from economics. Herman Schwartz has questioned those efforts, arguing that forces analogous to those identified in the economic literature are not pervasive in the political realm, where the strategic exercise of power gives rise to, and transforms, institutions.

The path-dependence of [[Strategy dynamics#The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process|emergent strategy]] has been observed in behavioral [[experimental economics|experiments]] with individuals and [[Institutional memory|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egidi |first1=Massimo |last2=Narduzzo |first2=Alessandro |date=October 1997 |title=The emergence of path-dependent behaviors in cooperative contexts |journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=677–709 |url= http://www-ceel.economia.unitn.it/papers/lyon.html |doi=10.1016/S0167-7187(97)00007-6 |quote="&amp;#x5b;Some test subjects&amp;#x5d; adopted a strategy once and for all&amp;#x5b;,&amp;#x5d; and insisted on using it&amp;#x5b;,&amp;#x5d; even when the configurations could not be efficiently played with the strategy adopted."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the social sciences, especially [[sociology]] and [[organizational theory]], a distinct yet closely related concept to path dependence is the concept of "imprinting", which captures how initial environmental conditions leave a persistent mark (or imprint) on organizations and organizational collectives (such as industries and communities), thus continuing to shape organizational behaviours and outcomes in the long run, even as external environmental conditions change.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Marquis |first1=Christopher |last2=Tilcsik |first2=András |title=Imprinting: Toward A Multilevel Theory |pages=193–243 |journal=[[Academy of Management Annals]] |year=2013 |ssrn=2198954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==
*A general type of path dependence is a [[typological vestige]].
**In [[typography]], for example, some customs persist, although the reason for their existence no longer applies; for example, the placement of the period inside a [[Quotation mark|quotation]] in U.S. spelling. In [[movable type|metal type]], pieces of terminal punctuation, such as the comma and period, are comparatively small and delicate (as they must be [[x-height]] for proper [[kerning]].) Placing the full-height quotation mark on the outside protected the smaller [[sort (typesetting)|cast metal sort]] from damage if the word needed to be moved around within or between lines. This would be done even if the period did not belong to the text being quoted.
*[[Evolution]] is considered by some to be path-dependent: mutations occurring in the past have had long-term effects on current life forms, some of which may no longer be adaptive to current conditions. For instance, there is a controversy about whether the [[Sesamoid bone#In other animals|panda's thumb]] is a leftover trait or not.
*In the [[computer]] and [[software]] markets, [[legacy system]]s indicate path dependence: customers' needs in the present market often include the ability to read data or run programs from past generations of products. Thus, for instance, a customer may need not merely the best available [[word processor]], but rather the best available word processor that can read [[Microsoft Word]] files. Such limitations in [[Backward compatibility|compatibility]] contribute to lock-in, and more subtly, to design compromises for independently developed products, if they attempt to be compatible.

{{Suicide sidebar}}
In [[ethics]] and other branches of [[philosophy]], [[suicide]] poses difficult questions, answered differently by various philosophers. The French essayist, novelist, and playwright [[Albert Camus]] (1913–1960) began his philosophical essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' with the famous line "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide" ({{lang-fr|Il n'y a qu'un problème philosophique vraiment sérieux : c'est le suicide}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus |first=Albert |translator-last=O'Brien |translator-first=Justin |date=1942 |title=The Myth of Sisyphus |url= |location= |publisher=Penguin Group |page= |isbn=978-0-141-18200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of suicide==
There are arguments in favor of allowing an individual to choose between life and suicide. Those in favor of suicide as a personal choice reject the thought that suicide is always or usually irrational, but is instead a solution to real problems; a line of last resort that can legitimately be taken when the alternative is considered worse. They believe that no being should be made to suffer unnecessarily, and suicide provides an escape from suffering.

===Idealism===
{{See also|Idealism}}
[[Herodotus]] wrote: "When life is so burdensome, death has become for man a sought-after refuge". Schopenhauer affirmed: "They tell us that suicide is the greatest act of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person."

Schopenhauer's main work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', occasionally uses the act in its examples. He denied that suicide was immoral and saw it as one's right to take one's life. In an allegory, he compared ending one's life, when subject to great suffering, to waking up from sleep when experiencing a terrible nightmare. However, most suicides were seen as an act of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], as it takes place when one denies life's pains, and is thus different from ascetic renunciation of the will, which denies life's pleasures.

According to Schopenhauer, moral freedom—the highest ethical aim—is to be obtained only by a denial of the will to live. Far from being a denial, suicide is an emphatic assertion of this will. For it is in fleeing from the pleasures, not from the sufferings of life, that this denial consists. When a man destroys his existence as an individual, he is not by any means destroying his will to live. On the contrary, he would like to live if he could do so with satisfaction to himself; if he could assert his will against the power of circumstance; but circumstance is too strong for him.

===Liberalism=== &lt;!--should this be Libertarianism?--&gt;
[[Liberalism]] asserts that a person's life belongs only to them, and no other person has the right to force their own ideals that life must be lived. Rather, only the individual involved can make such a decision, and whatever decision they make should be respected.

Philosopher and psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] goes further, arguing that suicide is the most basic right of all. If freedom is [[self-ownership]]—ownership over one's own life and body—then the right to end that life is the most basic of all. If others can force you to live, you do not own yourself and belong to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide as a Moral Issue|author=Thomas Szasz|url=http://www.szasz.com/iol2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Améry]], in his book ''On Suicide: a Discourse on Voluntary Death'' (originally published in German in 1976), provides a moving insight into the suicidal mind. He argues forcefully and almost romantically that suicide represents the ultimate freedom of humanity, justifying the act with phrases such as "we only arrive at ourselves in a freely chosen death" and lamenting "ridiculously everyday life and its alienation". {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Améry killed himself in 1978.

Philosophical thinking in the 19th and 20th century has led, in some cases, beyond thinking in terms of pro-choice, to the point that suicide is no longer a last resort, or even something that one must justify, but something that one must justify {{em|not}} doing. Many forms of [[Existentialism|existentialist]] thinking essentially begin with the premise that life is objectively meaningless, and proceed to the question of why one should not just kill oneself; they then answer this question by suggesting that the individual has the power to give personal meaning to life.

===Stoicism===
Although [[George Lyman Kittredge]] states that "the Stoics held that suicide is cowardly and wrong," the most famous [[Stoicism|stoics]]—[[Seneca the Younger]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]]—maintain that death by one's own hand is always an option and frequently more honorable than a life of protracted misery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Suicide and Brutus' Philosophy in Julius Caesar|author=Mark Sacharoff|publisher=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=33|number=1|date=Jan–Mar 1972|pages=115–122|jstor=2709060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics accepted that [[suicide]] was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pages 153–4. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency ({{lang-la|constantia}}) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease,&lt;ref name="marietta153"/&gt; but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.&lt;ref name="irvine200"&gt;William Braxton Irvine, (2009), ''A guide to the good life: the ancient art of Stoic joy'', page 200. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
{{see also|Suicide in China}}
[[Confucianism]] holds that failure to follow certain values is worse than death; hence, suicide can be morally permissible, and even praiseworthy, if it is done for the sake of those values. The Confucian emphasis on loyalty, self-sacrifice, and honour has tended to encourage [[altruistic suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stress and Suicide in Japan|journal=Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review|author1=Iga, Mamoura|author2=KS Adam (abstract)|publisher=Transcultural Psychiatry|year=1980|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/4/243.pdf|volume=17|issue=4|pages=243–244|doi=10.1177/136346158001700405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]] wrote, "For gentlemen of purpose and men of [[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]] while it is inconceivable that they should seek to stay alive at the expense of ren, it may happen that they have to accept death in order to have ren accomplished."&lt;ref&gt;Analects, trans. D.C. Lau, second edition, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1992), XV:9D&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencius]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Mencius, trans. D.C. Lau, (Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 1984), VI A:10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Fish is what I want; bear's palm is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take bear's palm than fish. Life is what I want; [[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]] is also what I want. If I cannot have both, I would rather take yi than life. On the one hand, though life is what I want, there is something I want more than life. That is why I do not cling to life at all cost. On the other hand, though death is what I loathe, there is something I loathe more than death. That is why there are dangers I do not avoid ... Yet there are ways of remaining alive and ways of avoiding death to which a person will not resort. In other words, there are things a person wants more than life and there are also things he or she loathes more than death.}}

==Arguments against suicide==
Common philosophical opinion of suicide since modernization reflected a spread in cultural beliefs of western societies that suicide is immoral and unethical. One popular argument is that many of the reasons for committing [[suicide]]—such as [[Clinical depression|depression]], emotional pain, or economic hardship—are transitory and can be ameliorated by therapy and through making changes to some aspects of one's life. A common [[adage]] in the discourse surrounding [[suicide prevention]] sums up this view: "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." However, the argument against this is that while emotional pain may seem transitory to most people, and in many cases it is, in other cases it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to resolve, even through counseling or lifestyle change, depending upon the severity of the affliction and the person's ability to cope with their pain. Examples of this are incurable disease or lifelong mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Craig. Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. Ashgate, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absurdism===
The [[French Algeria]]n absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] saw the goal of [[absurdism]] in establishing whether suicide is a necessary response to a world which appears to be mute both on the question of God's existence (and thus what such an existence might answer) and for our search for meaning and purpose in the world. For Camus, suicide was the rejection of freedom. He thinks that fleeing from the absurdity of reality into [[illusion]]s, [[religion]], or [[death]] is not the way out. Instead of fleeing the [[Albert Camus#Camus' ideas on the Absurd|absurd]] meaninglessness of life, we should embrace life passionately.

Existentialist [[Sartre]] describes the position of Meursault, the protagonist of Camus' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' who is condemned to death, in the following way:

{{Quote|"The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions ... and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the "divine irresponsibility" of the condemned man."&lt;ref&gt;Sartre analysis of Mersault, in Literary and Philosophical Essays, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christian-inspired philosophy===
{{See also|Christian philosophy}}
[[G. K. Chesterton]] calls suicide "the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence". He argues that a person who kills himself, as far as he is concerned, destroys the entire world (apparently exactly repeating [[Maimonides]]' view).

===Liberalism===
[[John Stuart Mill]] argued, in his influential essay "[[On Liberty]]", that since the {{lang|la|[[sine qua non]]}} of liberty is the power of the individual to make choices, any choice that one might make that would deprive one of the ability to make further choices should be prevented. &lt;!-- As it stands, that assertion is worthless, since {{em|every}} choice one makes deprives one of {{em|some}} further choices; perhaps the writer means to say "all further choices", as is consistent with the next sentence. --&gt;Thus, for Mill, selling oneself into [[slavery]] should be prevented in order to avoid precluding the ability to make further choices. Concerning these matters, Mill writes in "On Liberty"

{{Quote|Not only persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimes considered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement, that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other civilized countries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell himself, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void; neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus limiting his power of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and is very clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for not interfering, unless for the sake of others, with a person's voluntary acts, is consideration for his liberty. His voluntary choice is evidence that what he so chooses is desirable, or at the least endurable, to him, and his good is on the whole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pursuing it. But by selling himself for a slave, he abdicates his liberty; he forgoes any future use of it, beyond that single act. He therefore defeats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification of allowing him to dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thenceforth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour, that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principle of freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is not freedom, to be allowed to alienate his freedom.}}

It could be argued that suicide prevents further choices in the same way slavery does. However, it can also be argued that there are significant differences in not having any further involvement in decisions about your life and not having any further life to make decisions about. Suicide essentially removes the condition of being alive, not the condition of making choices about your life. 

Mill believes the individual to be the best guardian of their own interests. He uses the example of a man about to cross a broken bridge: we can forcibly stop that person and warn him of the danger, but ultimately should not prevent him from crossing the bridge—for only ''he'' knows the worth of his life balanced against the danger of crossing the bridge.

Too much should not be read into "disposing of his own lot in life" in the passage as this is not necessarily talking about anything other than slavery. Indeed, it would be odd if Mill had intended it to be about suicide but not explored the issue fully.

===Deontology===
From a [[deontological]] perspective, [[Immanuel Kant]] argues against suicide in ''Fundamental Principles of The Metaphysic of Morals''. In accordance with the second formulation of his [[categorical imperative]], Kant argues that, "He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself." Kant's theory looks at the act only, and not at its outcomes and consequences, and claims that one is ethically required to consider whether one would be willing to ''universalise'' the act: to claim ''everyone'' should behave that way. Kant argues that choosing to commit suicide entails considering oneself as a means to an end, which he rejects: a person, he says, must ''not'' be used "merely as means, but must in all actions always be considered as an end in himself." Therefore, it is unethical to commit suicide to satisfy oneself.

===Social contract===
The [[social contract]], according to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], is such that every man has "a right to risk his own life in order to preserve it."

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] reject the right of individuals to take their own life. Hobbes claims in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that natural law forbids every man "to do, that which is destructive of his life, or take away the means of preserving the same." Breaking this natural law is irrational and immoral. Hobbes also states that it is intuitively rational for men to want felicity and to fear death most.

==Neutral and situational stances==
===Honor===
Japan has a form of suicide called [[seppuku]], which is considered an honorable way to redeem oneself for transgressions or personal defeats. It was widely accepted in the days of the Samurai and even before that. It was generally seen as a privilege granted only to the samurai class; civilian criminals would thus not have this 'honor' and be executed. This reflects a view of suicide as brave and correct rather than cowardly and wrong.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Utilitarianism===
[[Utilitarianism]] can be used as a justification for, or an argument against, suicide. Though the death of a depressed person ends their suffering, the person's family and friends may grieve.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Other arguments===
[[David Hume]] left an essay on suicide to be published after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/suicide.htm|title=''Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul: The Complete 1783 Edition''|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of it is concerned with the claim that suicide is an affront to God. Hume argues that suicide is no more a rebellion against God than is saving the life of someone who would otherwise die, or changing the position of anything in one's surroundings. He spends much less time dismissing arguments that it is an affront to one's duty to others or to oneself. Hume claims that suicide can be compared to retiring from society and becoming a total recluse, which is not normally considered to be immoral, although the comparison would not seem to justify a suicide that leaves in its wake children or dependents who are thereby rendered vulnerable. As for duty to self, Hume takes it to be obvious that there can be times when suicide is desirable, though he also thinks it ridiculous that anyone would consider suicide unless they first considered every other option.&lt;!-- I am not sure that my edit has captured the gist of Hume's position; an editor familiar with H.'s essay will need to review this. --&gt;

Those who support the [[right to die]] argue that suicide is acceptable under certain circumstances, such as incurable disease and old age. The idea is that although life is, in general, good, people who face irreversible suffering should not be forced to continue suffering.

[[Leonard Peikoff]] states in his book ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'':

{{Quote|Suicide is justified when man's life, owing to circumstances outside of a person's control, is no longer possible; an example might be a person with a painful terminal illness, or a prisoner in a concentration camp who sees no chance of escape. In cases such as these, suicide is not necessarily a philosophic rejection of life or of reality. On the contrary, it may very well be their tragic reaffirmation. Self-destruction in such contexts may amount to the tortured cry: "Man's life means so much to me that I will not settle for anything less. I will not accept a living death as a substitute."}}

Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] has criticized "arbitrary" ethical systems that allow patients to refuse care when they are physically ill, while denying the mentally ill the right to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, JM. A Suicide Right for the Mentally Ill? A Swiss Case Opens a New Debate, The Hastings Center Report. 2007;37(3):21–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wesley J. Smith]], Death on Demand: The assisted-suicide movement sheds its fig leaf, ''The Weekly Standard'', June 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prague Provisional Theatre''' ({{lang-cz|'''Prozatímní divadlo'''}}, {{IPA-cs|ˈprozaciːmɲiː ˈɟivadlo}}) was erected in 1862 as a temporary home for Czech drama and opera until a permanent National Theatre could be built. It opened on 18 November 1862 and functioned for 20 years, during which time over 5,000 performances were presented. Between 1866 and 1876 the theatre staged the premieres of four of [[Bedřich Smetana]]'s operas, including ''[[The Bartered Bride]]''. The Provisional Theatre building was eventually incorporated into the structure of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], which opened its doors on 11 June 1881.

==Origins==
[[File:Jan Nepomuk Mayr.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Nepomuk Maýr]], first Principal Conductor of the Prague Provisional Theatre]]
Before the early 1860s almost all cultural institutions in Prague, including theatre and opera, were in Austrian hands. [[Bohemia]] was a province of the [[Habsburg Empire]], and under that regime's absolutist rule most aspects of Czech culture and national life had been discouraged or suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 697&lt;/ref&gt; Absolutism was formally abolished by a decree of the [[Emperor Franz Josef]] on 20 October 1860, which led to a Czech cultural revival.&lt;ref name= Large114&gt;Large, pp. 114–15&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian ''Diet'' (parliament) had acquired a site in Prague on the banks of the [[Vltava]], and in 1861 announced a public subscription, which raised a sum of 106,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]].&lt;ref name= Large114/&gt; This covered the costs of building a small 800-seat theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 698&lt;/ref&gt; which would act as a home for production of Czech drama and opera while longer-term plans for a permanent National Theatre could be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;
The Provisional Theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of [[Vítězslav Hálek]]'s tragic drama ''King Vukašín''.&lt;ref name= Large124&gt;Large, pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was at the time no Czech opera deemed suitable, the first opera performed at the theatre, on 20 November 1862, was [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]]'s ''[[Les deux journées]]''.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt; For the first year or so of its life, the Provisional Theatre alternated opera with straight plays on a daily basis, but from the start of 1864 opera performances were given daily.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Bedrich Smetana.jpg|thumb|upright|Bedřich Smetana, who succeeded Maýr as Principal Conductor, and was in turn succeeded by him]]
The first principal conductor (or musical director) of the Provisional Theatre, appointed in the autumn of 1862, was Jan Nepomuk Maýr &amp;ndash; to the disappointment of Smetana, who had hoped for the position himself.&lt;ref name= Large124/&gt; Maýr held the position until September 1866; his tenure was marked by a professional rivalry with Smetana, who criticised the theatre's conservatism and failure to fulfil its mission to promote Czech opera.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr retaliated by refusing to conduct Smetana's ''[[The Brandenburgers in Bohemia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; A change in the theatre's management in 1866 led to Maýr's removal and replacement by Smetana, who held the post for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Ott&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ottlová|first= Marta|title= Smetana, Bedřich|encyclopedia= Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/|accessdate= 12 May 2009}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr's bias in favour of Italian opera was replaced by Smetana's more balanced repertoire, which mixed Italian, German and French pieces with such Slavonic and Czech works as he could find.&lt;ref name= Large207&gt;Large, pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his own compositions (''The Bartered Bride'', ''The Brandenburgers in Bohemia'' and ''[[Dalibor (opera)|Dalibor]]'', Smetana introduced works by the Czech composers Lepold Eugen Měchura and [[Josef Rozkošný]],&lt;ref name= Large207/&gt; but was nevertheless attacked by some parts of the music establishment for giving insufficient encouragement to native talent. Efforts to remove him from his post, and to reinstate Maýr, were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Large, pp. 233–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Smetana was responsible for the establishment of an independent school attached to the theatre. He became the school's director and professor of theory.&lt;ref name= Large206&gt;Large, pp. 206–07&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1874 Smetana became afflicted with deafness, which forced him to yield his duties as principal conductor to his assistant Adolf Čech, and to resign his post later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Maýr was reappointed to the conductorship;&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; he had no interest in the school, which subsequently closed.&lt;ref name= Large206/&gt; The Provisional Theatre continued as the main venue for Czech opera, several of [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s works being premiered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The historical development of Czech theatre|url= http://www.czech.cz/en/culture/czech-arts/theater/historical-development-of-czech-theater?i=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430142314/http://www.czech.cz/en/culture/czech-arts/theater/historical-development-of-czech-theater?i=|archivedate=30 April 2009|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic]]|accessdate= 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the theatre was incorporated into the [[National Theatre (Prague)|Czech National Theatre building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The National Theatre|url= http://www.narodni-divadlo.cz/Default.aspx?jz=en&amp;dk=text.aspx&amp;it=39&amp;sb=0|publisher= Narodni divaldo|accessdate= 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened on 11 June.&lt;ref&gt;Large, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter the new building was badly damaged by fire and remained closed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 702&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the Provisional Theatre continued to operate, using other theatre premises.

'''RedR''' (pronounced 'Red R') is an international [[NGO]] whose stated mission is to “rebuild lives in times of disaster by training, supporting and providing [[aid worker]]s to relief programmes across the world.” It was originally an acronym for Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief, although it is no longer used as such.

RedR delivers training to [[Humanitarian organization|relief organisations]] and their staff, enabling them to respond to the needs of disaster hit communities, efficiently and safely. In order to improve future response, RedR focuses on [[capacity building]] and [[disaster risk reduction]] for communities affected by natural and man-made disasters.

They further help to ensure that skilled professionals are always available to respond to major global emergencies through an aid worker recruitment service and by advising and training potential new relief workers.

RedR provides a free Technical Support Service to all [[Humanitarian organization|relief organisations]] and aid workers around the world. The Technical Support Service consists of a panel of over 150 experts in a range of fields who aim to respond to any query within 24–48 hours.

RedR UK is part of a federation of national accredited RedR organisations who all share a common vision and mission. As well as RedR UK, there are currently RedR organisations in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/RedR_International.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1980s===

RedR was founded in [[London]] in 1980 by engineer Peter Guthrie following time spent delivering aid during the [[Vietnamese Boat People Crisis]]. Mr. Guthrie said: “When I returned [from the refugee crisis in Malaysia] I saw the pressing need for engineers to help in this sort of work and compiled a register of engineers who could be called upon at short notice to work with frontline relief agencies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm Our History], RedR&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of [[Oxfam]]’s chief engineer Jim Howard, Oxfam provided seed funding and RedR was formally registered as a [[charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm Our History], RedR&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, RedR faced its first major challenge with the onset of the [[Ethiopian Famine]]. A significant number of RedR Members were required to work on relief programmes in [[Ethiopia]] and neighbouring [[Sudan]]. In 1988 [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] became President of RedR, a position she still holds today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://event.concepglobal.com/accounts/register123/concep/clientaccounts/ice/events/x2010cec01/NCE_post_event.pdf ICE News], New Civil Engineer&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===

In 1991 RedR UK’s training programme began.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.redr.org.au/ RedR Australia] was founded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.au/about-us/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the [[Rwanda Civil War|Rwanda crisis]] erupted and over 100 RedR Members were deployed to the Great Lakes region,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; while [http://www.redr.org.nz/ RedR New Zealand] was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redr.org.nz/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519154109/http://www.redr.org.nz/history.html |archivedate=2014-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the first ever edition of ‘Engineering in Emergencies: A Practical Guide for Relief Workers’ by RedR Members Jan Davis and Robert Lambert was published.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineering-Emergencies-Practical-Relief-Workers/dp/1853392227/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317988539&amp;sr=1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 RedR launched its Technical Support Service for relief workers in the field&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year their first regional training – Security Management - in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2003 RedR merged with International Health Exchange (IHE), an organisation that improved the preparation and recruitment of health professionals for overseas emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;http://fex.ennonline.net/19/merger.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; RedR set up a programme office for the first time in East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], RedR launched a ‘Learning Support and Capacity Building Programme’ in [[Sri Lanka]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/recent-programmes/sri-lanka.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced a similar programme in [[Pakistan]] following the [[Pakistan earthquake of 2005|2005 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/pakistan-programme/index.cfm#activecontainer&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year RedR established a programme in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]], in response to the country’s [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] and trained 4,000 national and international aid workers over the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/sudan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

RedR became involved in the UN Cluster approach in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/history.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; RedR leads the training of aid workers within a number of cluster groups, including WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), Emergency Shelter, Health and Nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/humanitarian-coordination/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 RedR linked with [[Oxford Brookes University]] to offer credit-rated courses in six of its training courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/news/redr&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], RedR established a programme and trained 1,000 relief workers to support the response. 91% of trainees were Haitian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/Newsroom/Latest_News.cfm/develop-local-skills-to-cushion-impact-of-global-disasters-says-redr&lt;/ref&gt; RedR Lanka was also established in its own right to help assist in long term capacity building in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/recent-programmes/sri-lanka.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 RedR set up a country programme in [[South Sudan]] to assist with ongoing insecurity in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/Newsroom/Latest_News.cfm/train-national-aid-workers-to-improve-humanitarian-situation-in-south-sudan-says-redr&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting late 2014 Redr took over training of UK NHS staff being deployed to Sierra Leone to respond to the Ebola Crisis in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Press Release | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/second-cohort-of-nhs-volunteers-gear-up-to-fight-ebola-in-west-africa | title=Second cohort of NHS volunteers gear up to fight Ebola in West Africa | publisher=gov.uk | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=gov.uk/government/news}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Redr | url=http://www.redr.org.uk/en/where-we-work/west-africa-ebola-virus.cfm | title=WEST AFRICA: EBOLA VIRUS | publisher=RedR UK | accessdate=26 January 2015 | website=redr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RedR’s Work==

===Training===

Though RedR started as a register of engineers for disaster relief, it now focuses on training [[Humanitarian organization|relief organisations]] and their staff worldwide. In 2010/2011 RedR trained 6,124 aid workers.&lt;ref&gt;RedR Annual Review 2010/2011, RedR, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====UK Programme====

RedR’s UK programme delivers a range of training courses, from a basic introduction to the sector to specialist courses for professional [[aid worker]]s.  RedR offers credit rated courses in partnership with [[Oxford Brookes University]] in an effort to further professionalise the [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian sector]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brookes.ac.uk/about/news/redr&lt;/ref&gt;

RedR’s Australia programme delivers a range of training courses, from the Essentials of Humanitarian Practice to courses in Personal Safety, Security and Communications, Humanitarian Logistics and Water and Sanitation in Emergencies as well as tailor made courses for professional [[aid worker]]s.  RedR offers credit rated courses in partnership with [[RMIT University, the University of Melbourne and Charles Darwin University]] in an effort to further professionalise the [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian sector]].

RedR Australia is also a Standby Partner to nine United Nations agencies including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, World Food Programme and UN Women. They recruit and maintain a roster of international experts who can deploy to work with these UN agencies and international non-government organisations following natural disasters and complex emergencies.

====Country Programmes====

RedR has country programmes in [[Sudan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/sudan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trust.org/alertnet/jobs/2011-05-05-1815&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/Newsroom/Latest_News.cfm/aid-worker-training-in-east-africa-expands-as-redr-uk-opens-in-kenya&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/pakistan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt; These programmes have been set up in response to the ongoing humanitarian crises in these regions and the needs of the various [[humanitarian organisation]]s operating there. With high levels of insecurity, there is a focus on security training for aid agencies working in the field.

=====Pakistan=====

RedR set up a new training programme in [[Islamabad]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/pakistan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt; to support the humanitarian community within the country following the ongoing internal conflict in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internal-displacement.org/countries/pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a previous programme set up in response to the [[Pakistan earthquake of 2005|2005 earthquake]], which ran until June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/pakistan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses currently delivered focus on security management, humanitarian training and humanitarian practice and principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/pakistan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sudan=====

RedR established its [[Sudan]] Programme in 2005, specialising in safety and security training for aid workers due to the ongoing conflict in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trust.org/alertnet/crisis-centre/crisis/darfur-conflict&lt;/ref&gt; It provides Staff Welfare and Critical Incident Training to humanitarian staff to help workers move on from traumatic experiences faced in insecure environments. As well as security training, RedR delivers a range of courses aimed at improving the capacity of both local and international aid agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/sudan-programme/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====South Sudan=====

RedR set up a new operation in [[South Sudan]] in preparation for the country’s separation from [[Sudan]] in July 2011. The training programme is based in the capital [[Juba]] and is unique to the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trust.org/alertnet/jobs/staff-welfare-training-team-leader-2011-06-09-1558/&lt;/ref&gt;

=====East Africa=====

RedR opened its humanitarian training centre in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] in September 2011. This was in response to the [[Horn of Africa]] [[2011 East Africa drought|Food Crisis]] in the summer of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/Newsroom/Latest_News.cfm/aid-worker-training-in-east-africa-expands-as-redr-uk-opens-in-kenya&lt;/ref&gt; Funds for the project were raised partly through RedR’s East Africa Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.trust.org/alertnet/news/redr-launches-east-africa-appeal-as-ten-million-face-severe-hunger/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bespoke Training====

RedR provides an international bespoke training and consultancy service, covering all major aspects of humanitarian work. Disciplines include: Security Management, Personal Security, Training of Trainers for the Humanitarian Sector, Project Management in Emergencies, and Logistics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/training/Bespoke_training_and_consultancy/&lt;/ref&gt;

RedR tailor their existing modules or devise new courses to meet the needs of an [[organisation]] they are training. RedR trainers go to these [[organisations]] wherever they around the [[world]], as opposed to RedR Country Programmes.

In 2010/2011 RedR delivered 51 [[bespoke]] courses in 21 countries worldwide; training 1,417 people.&lt;ref&gt;RedR Annual Review 2010/2011, RedR UK&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment Service===

RedR provides a recruitment service for [[aid agencies]], [[governments]] and [[private sector]] companies responding to major [[disasters]] through its Member’s register, which currently has a pool of about 1,700 specialists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelordmayorsappeal.org.uk/news/readmore/48&lt;/ref&gt;  RedR’s recruitment register focuses on all areas of the [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian sector]], but specialises in [[engineering]], [[health]], [[logistics]], [[security]], and management consultants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/Recruitment/&lt;/ref&gt;

*Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], RedR provided 79 people within the first three months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/Recruitment/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]], RedR provided 80 people within the first three months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/Recruitment/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Following [[Cyclone Nargis]], [[Myanmar]] 2008, 140 RedR members were waiting to be deployed as and when they were needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/What_We_Do/Recruitment/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical Support Service===

RedR provides free [[online]] technical advice to [[Humanitarian organization|humanitarian agencies]] and [[aid workers]] worldwide. This service gives access to 150 technical experts – including [[aid workers]], [[academics]] and specialists from the [[corporate]] sector - who aim to reply to any query within 24–48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://reliefweb.int/node/444959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision, Mission and Values==

RedR states its [[Goal|vision]] is a ‘world in which sufficient competent and committed personnel are available and responding to humanitarian needs.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/vision_mission_and_values.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

RedR believes in the provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] to people wherever it is needed to relieve [[suffering]] and sickness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/vision_mission_and_values.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

A key idea they integrate when responding to disasters is that [[people]] and [[communities]] affected by [[disasters]] themselves should be empowered to develop skills for immediate and future [[disaster response]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redr.org.uk/en/About_us/who-we-are/vision_mission_and_values.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolling coal''' is the practice of modifying a [[diesel engine]] to increase the amount of fuel entering the engine in order to emit large amounts of black or grey [[soot]]y [[Diesel exhaust|exhaust fumes]] into the air.&lt;ref name="July8"&gt;{{cite news|title=Political Protest Or Just Blowing Smoke?

Rolling coal is a form of conspicuous [[air pollution]], for entertainment or for protest.&lt;ref name="dahl"&gt;{{cite news|date=July 24, 2014|title=Why Pickup Truck Drivers Are Paying $5,000 to Pollute More|first=Melissa|last=Dahl |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|location=New York City|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/07/why-people-are-paying-5000-to-pollute-more.html |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some drivers intentionally trigger coal rolling in the presence of [[hybrid vehicle]]s (when it is nicknamed "[[Toyota Prius|Prius]] repellent") to cause their drivers to lose sight of the road and inhale harmful air pollution.  Coal rolling may also be directed at bicyclists, protesters, and pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecowatch.com/2014/07/18/colbert-rolling-coal/ |title=Colbert Pokes Fun at ‘Rolling Coal,’ the Insecure Trucker Driver’s Response to Environmentalists |work=EcoWatch |date=July 18, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/b-c-coal-rollers-say-they-re-not-out-to-get-environmentalists-1.1916039 |title=Rolling coal: Canadian diesel truck lovers insist they're not like U.S. counterparts |work=[[CTV News]] |date=July 16, 2014 |accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oberg |first=Jamie |url=http://www.kctv5.com/story/26057923/police-warn-drivers-against-rolling-coal |title=Police warn drivers against 'rolling coal' |work=[[KCTV]]|date=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/06/rolling-coal-photos-video_n_5561477.html |title=Political Protest Or Just Blowing Smoke?

Health risks associated with rolling coal include respiratory issues.  The [[American Cancer Society]] has linked exposure to diesel exhaust to [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name=July8/&gt;  A more [[cause of action|actionable]] concern is road traffic safety violations, as the black smoke can impair visibility, risking motor vehicle crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyd|first1=Shaun|title=Lawmaker Wants To Stop 'Coal Rollers' From Intentionally Blasting Black Smoke|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/04/04/coal-rollers-rolling-coal-colorado-joann-ginal/ |date=April 4, 2016|work=[[KCNC-TV|CBS Denver]]|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and violation of clean air laws.

==Legality==
===United States===
In July 2014, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] stated that the practice was illegal, as it violated the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] which prohibits the manufacturing, sale, and installation "of a part for a motor vehicle that bypasses, defeats, or renders inoperative any emission control device [and] prohibits anyone from tampering with an emission control device on a motor vehicle by removing it or making it inoperable prior to or after the sale or delivery to the buyer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington: 'Rolling Coal' by Anti-Environmentalists Dubbed Illegal by EPA|work=US Official News|date=July 9, 2014|via=[[InfoTrac]]|accessdate=September 7, 2016|subscription=yes |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A374565692/STND?sid=wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, [[Illinois General Assembly]] representative [[Will Guzzardi]] published a bill proposing to impose a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters their vehicle's EPA emissions equipment. Guzzardi has made it clear that "The fine would come on top of any penalties enforced by the current law that prohibits emissions tampering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illinois bill would make 'rolling coal' illegal|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/03/27/illinois-bill-rolling-coal-illegal/|first=Jonathon|last=Ramsey|work=[[AOL#Content|Autoblog]]|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2015, New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] signed a bill into law prohibiting the retrofitting of diesel-powered vehicles to increase particulate emissions for the purpose of coal rolling. Those found in violation are subject to a fine by the state's [[Department of Environmental Protection]]. The bill was introduced by state Assemblyman [[Tim Eustace]] after a pickup truck blasted smoke at Eustace's [[Nissan Leaf]] while driving on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/05/13/rolling-coal-now-illegal-in-new-jersey/ |title=Rolling coal now illegal in New Jersey |last=Bruce|first=Chris|work=[[AOL#Content|Autoblog]]|date=May 13, 2015 |accessdate=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legiscan.com/NJ/bill/S2418/2014|title=New Jersey Senate Bill 2418|work=LegiScan|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colorado and Maryland, proposed bans failed in 2016&lt;ref name="nyt2016" /&gt; but were passed in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaver|first1=Katherine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/05/26/no-more-rolling-coal-on-maryland-roads/?tid=hybrid_collaborative_2_na|title=No more ‘rolling coal’ on Maryland roads|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 26, 2017|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomasic|first1=John|title=Colorado to outlaw 'rolling coal' nuisance exhaust|url=https://www.coloradostatesman.com/colorado-to-outlaw-rolling-coal-nuisance-exhaust/|accessdate=May 3, 2017|work=The Colorado Statesman|date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sally Regenhard''' is an American [[activist]] who has become one of the leading voices for the families of the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].  A  former long-time resident of [[Co-op City]] in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]] who has degrees in behaviorial sciences and [[gerontology]] and has worked in the [[nursing home]] industry for over 20 years, Regenhard became an advocate for skyscraper safety after the death of her 28-year-old son, Christian, a probationary firefighter with the [[New York City Fire Department]], who perished in the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001.

==Activism==
Along with her husband Al, her daughter Christina, and Monica Gabrielle, a [[widow]] who lost her husband Richard as a result of the collapse of the towers, they founded the Skyscraper Safety Campaign, a national [[non-profit]] organization that has four main goals:

*  Demand a  federal investigation (via the use of [[subpoena]]s) into the collapse of the World Trade Center, including information on its design, evacuation procedures, and "firefighting techniques".
* To promote improved compliance of  building and fire codes in New York City and nationwide, and assuring the safety of firefighters and residents (and workers) who reside and work in such structures.
* To educate "codes groups" in allowing fire departments in having a say in the building of new skyscrapers. The "code groups" will be assembled by a mixed group of fire services officials and engineers, replacing the present "code groups" who are composed mainly of [[bureaucrats]], builders, and others who have little or no knowledge of fire safety.
* To have say and voice in the construction of the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]] and all other structures built at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], thus assuring that newly revised fire safety codes are enforced.

Regenhard has also worked to honor her son's legacy. On July 18, 2006, Sally and her family, with the assistance of then-Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], dedicated the ''Christian Regenhard Center for Emergency Response Studies'' at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] located in [[Manhattan]]. Currently it is a research center offering seminars, lectures, and doing research and contracts with emergency response organizations.  The College dedicated its own 9/11 Memorial in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6450422/John-Jay-2008-Archive "Emergency-Response Center Honors the Spirit of 9/11 Hero Firefighter"] from ''[[Scribd]]'' retrieved August 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The credits page of [[Robert Greenwald]]'s viral videos series, ''The REAL RUDY,'' offer "very special thanks to Regenhard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealrudy.org/credits The REAL Rudy Credits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views about Rudolph Giuliani==

In recent years, Regenhard has become one of the most vocal and visible critics of [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who was [[Mayor of New York City]] at the time of the attacks. Riding on a wave of popularity for his handling of the crisis, Giuliani became a household name throughout the world. With plenty of media coverage and high public approval ratings, he became a [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|major candidate to win the Republican nomination for the 2008 presidential race]].

She made national headlines in May 2004, when during a televised public hearing on the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks]], she interrupted Giuliani while he was giving a speech. She has made appearances on various news-related programs on such networks as [[CNN]] and [[C-SPAN]].&lt;ref&gt;Kyra Phillips, CNN Anchor (March 10, 2002) [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/10/sm.04.html Interview with Christine Papasso, Sally Regenhard, Richard Saracelli"]. ''[[CNN Sunday Morning]]'', [[CNN]]. Retrieved March 10, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article  published by ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in September 2006, Regenhard was quoted saying, "There's a large and growing number of both FDNY families, FDNY members, former and current, and civilian families who want to expose the true failures of the Giuliani administration when it comes to 9/11," and that she intends to "[[Swiftboating|Swift Boat]]" Giuliani and his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Ben Smith| title=Rudy's Black Cloud: WTC Health Risks may hurt Prez Bid |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rudy-black-cloud-wtc-health-risks-hurt-prez-bid-article-1.618126 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=September 18, 2006 |page=14 | accessdate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post 9/11==
Regenhard has voiced her opposition to the construction of the controversial [[Park51]] project that will be located in a building near [[Ground Zero]]. The proposed Park51 (named after the building's street address of ''51 Park Place'') project, which will include both a [[mosque]] and an Islamic cultural center, has been the target of many opponents who claim that it may attract [[Islamic extremists]] and who consider it an insult to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Regenhard, who was interviewed by the [[New York Times]] claims that the construction of the center would be "sacrilege on sacred ground." In response to accusations that opponents to the project were anti-Muslim, Regenhard replied "People are being accused of being anti-Muslim and racist, but this is simply a matter of sensitivity. It’s hard enough to go down to that pit of hell and death."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/nyregion/14center.html ''Planned Sign of Tolerance Bringing Division Instead''] from ''the [[New York Times]]'' July 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Regenhard resides in [[Yonkers, New York]] with her husband.

'''Sandra Cabrera''' (27 October 1970 – 27 January 2004) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] street-based sex worker, trade unionist, and campaigner for sex worker rights. She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.

Her first contact with [[Association of Women Sex Workers in Argentina in Action for Our Rights|AMMAR]] (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001.

{{ quote | text= I was working in a corner of the Terminal area and a group of pimps and bouncers from a bar in the area beat me up pretty badly.

During Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of  union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night.

{{ quote | text= "There were many women who had nothing to eat, so we started to manage food boxes and work plans... At 10:30 pm my daughter and I fell asleep and when I woke up the other day I worried because we had not celebrated Christmas, but she (her daughter Macarena, 7 years old) told me not to worry about it, because thanks to what we had done the day before, many of our companions had something to celebrate.
| author= Sandra Cabrera&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; 
}}

Cabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called "Maca". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Cabrera's work to stop the spread of [[AIDS]] and other STDs began in October, 2001.

{{ quote | text= The word of someone unknown is not the same as one of us talking to our colleagues, with our language, explaining how to take care of ourselves through our experience.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;


There are women who did not know how to protect themselves when they [clients] ask for a ''francesa'' [oral sex]... We have a manual with pictures of healthy vaginas next to diseased vaginas, healthy penises next to diseased penises, because for us things also enter our eyes.&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt;

Lacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as "the Sanjua gang", after Cabrera's place of origin.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as "explosive".&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did, 
&lt;ref name="frente"&gt;

but she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness:

{{ quote 
| text= She cared about the others, the injustices spurred her on, she got what she wanted.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;
| author= Elena Reynaga 
}}

Organizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way.

{{ quote 
| text= She was very lacking in [i.e. hadn't received] affection, like so many of us. In the organization she began to find something we all seek, to be recognized for something and to be important.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

And in Rosario, she found that recognition.

{{ quote
| text= We admire her strength, how she achieves things for us. It makes us think that if we unite we can aspire to a retirement, to a more dignified life.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;
| author= Rosario sex worker

She was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in [[Rosario]] where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt; She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message.

}}

Perhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over.

{{ quote 
| text= When she proposed it, I did not want to know anything. I told her it was crazy, that it could not be that we had a union, because we had never had anything. Society always had us as the lowest, for me it was like we did not exist. When the crisis came in late 2001, Sandra got social plans. There I started to go to the headquarters of the Central of Argentine Workers (CTA), but still thought that we could not get to where we arrived today. When I started to go, I met all the union guys who treated us differently, they said 'how are you, girls.' There I began to realize that we were not what they had made us believe. Because we suffered so much repression, the police made us believe that we were nobody. There I realized that it was not so.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero
}}

Other street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

| author= testimony of Rosa Maria Teresa Signorelli }}
During Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.

By way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included
{{ quote
| text= drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels }}
Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.

As part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.

Another complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.

{{ quote
| text= Our colleagues, who are human beings and have feelings, fall in love with the police and pimps.&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt;
| author= Elena Reynaga }}

From 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

On March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with "a humiliating treatment". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want "male or female prostitutes" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

As leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.

{{ quote
| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.

We know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.

These things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections. When we are stopped we do not refuse to show the latest test results for HIV, despite the fact that the National AIDS Act, 23,798, guarantees the confidentiality of those results.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt; 
| author= Sandra Cabrera}}

On September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.

Following the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; 

On October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said "Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow." The girl was Cabrera's eight year old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

A few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that "Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school." A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

On October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

At some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.&lt;ref name="aUnAno"/&gt;

The last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

During her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

I believe that the case would have had another course with more protection.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

=== Evidence ===
Testimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

She was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck.&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired.

Her body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; one block from the stop where she worked.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm,&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers ([[Bersa Thunder 9]]), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.)

Her pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt;
The police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities.&lt;ref name="marcha"/&gt; Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

Analysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

The forensic report concluded:

{{ quote
| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; }}

=== Reaction ===
Her murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.

The investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.

Everyone else assumed it was the police. The police in [[Argentina]] have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in [[Mar del Plata]] had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers,

The [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] police killed the social activist [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted "We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police."&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Among political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

The previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

To show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt;

After several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as ""people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary".&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who "have an activity that can not be described as good morals," according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt; He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;

Among the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. "If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs," they told each other, and "She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues."&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, "Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra."&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.

{{ quote
| text= Fear is present. When I tell you, let's get together, come, they're afraid. I can not tell them we are going to a march or when we are going to do some research work as well. To myself they say "How do you keep going"?&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero}}

As for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Influence ===
==== Public Morality police unit ====
If the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:

{{ quote
| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder
}}

But he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Misdemeanor Code ====
On the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:

{{ quote
| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi&lt;ref name="noticia"/&gt;
}}

As the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.

{{ quote
| text= "The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

For AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.

{{ quote
| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice. But it was not in vain, because we followed the path she left us. The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

Finally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.
&lt;ref name="despenalizo"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.

==== Rosario ====
Walter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that "There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police." AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.
&lt;ref name="abusos"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.

{{ quote
| text= "I had to go and talk to the commissioner of the 7th precinct, after a worker was detained in the terminal area and extorted by the police.

Shortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.
&lt;ref name="prostíbulo"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whiskerías'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.
&lt;ref name="sombra"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that "It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place."&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

For the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.

{{ quote
| text=  We suffer more searches, more humiliation, more payment of fines and the difficulty of making use of the street. Lately, there are reports that the police drive the girls away, beat them, do not let them work, ask them for sexual favors and ask for money.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;
| author= Georgina Orellano
}}

Orellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

The legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as "scandalous" and an "offense to modesty"&lt;ref name="proyecto"/&gt; now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:

{{ quote
| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero
}}

=== Recognition ===
Nine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] march was described as "multitudinous" and included a cross section of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.

'''Scott S. Reuben''' (born 1958) is an American anesthesiologist who was Professor of [[Anesthesiology]] and [[Pain Medicine]] at [[Tufts University]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts and chief of [[acute pain]] at [[Baystate Medical Center]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] from February 1991&lt;ref name="anesthesiologynews_2009"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/ViewArticle.aspx?d_id=21&amp;a_id=12868 | title=Fraud Case Stuns Anesthesiologists Post-op Pain Expert Fabricated Years of Data | work=Anesthesiology News | date=April 2009 | accessdate=27 December 2015 |volume=35 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2009 when he was sentenced to prison for healthcare [[fraud]]. Reuben was considered to be a prolific and influential researcher in [[pain management]], and his purported findings altered the way millions of patients are treated for [[pain]] during and after [[orthopedic]] surgeries.&lt;ref name="sciam0310"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-medical-madoff-anesthestesiologist-faked-data |title=A Medical Madoff: Anesthesiologist Faked Data in 21 Studies |work=[[Scientific American]] |date= March 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuben has now admitted that he never conducted any of the clinical trials on which his conclusions were based "in what may be considered the longest-running and widest-ranging cases of academic fraud."&lt;ref name="nyt0311"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html?ref=us |title=Doctor Admits Pain Studies Were Frauds, Hospital Says |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= March 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 27, 2015 |last1=Harris |first1=Gardiner }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scientific American]]'' has called Reuben the medical equivalent of [[Bernard Madoff|Bernie Madoff]], the former [[NASDAQ]] chairman who was convicted of orchestrating a $65-billion [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref name="sciam0310"/&gt;

== Background ==

Reuben was educated at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="jl"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?section_id=3&amp;show=dept&amp;ses=ogst&amp;issue_id=494&amp;article_id=12634 |title=Fraud Case Rocks Anesthesiology Community |work=Anesthesiology News |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from medical school at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] in 1985 and undertook his anesthesiology residency at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in [[New York City]].

Reuben fell under suspicion when Baystate conducted a routine audit in May 2008 which revealed that Reuben had not been given approval for two studies that he intended to present during the hospital's research week. On March 10, 2009 a Baystate spokeswoman announced that Reuben admitted to fabricating many of the data underlying his research. Reuben never conducted the clinical trials that he wrote about in 21 journal articles dating from at least 1996.&lt;ref name="sciam0310"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt0311"/&gt; In some cases, he even invented the patients.&lt;ref name="boston0311"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090315085725/http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/03/11/doctor_accused_of_faking_studies/ Doctor accused of faking studies; His work dealt with pain drugs], [[Boston Globe]], March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although Reuben often co-wrote papers with other researchers, Baystate found that the other researchers did not know about or participate in Reuben's studies,&lt;ref name="boston0311"/&gt; and their names were forged on documents.&lt;ref name="sciam0310"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jl"/&gt; The hospital asked the journals to retract the studies, which reported favorable results from painkillers including [[Pfizer Inc.]]'s [[Bextra]], [[Celebrex]] and [[Lyrica]] and [[Merck &amp; Co. Inc.]]'s [[Vioxx]]. His studies also claimed [[Wyeth]]'s [[antidepressant]] [[Effexor]] could be used as a painkiller. Pfizer gave Reuben five research grants between 2002 and 2007. He was a paid member of the company's speakers bureau, giving talks about Pfizer drugs to colleagues.&lt;ref name="ap0311"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jjpBsTFN9SEtQu-xyDltivC2GJ8AD96RT2NO0 Mass. doctor accused of fabricating pain studies], [[Associated Press]], March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj0311"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123672510903888207?mod=googlenews_wsj Top Pain Scientist Fabricated Data in Studies, Hospital Says], [[Wall Street Journal]], March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Reuben also wrote to the [[Food and Drug Administration]], urging the agency not to restrict the use of many of the painkillers he studied, citing his own data on their safety and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="wsj0311"/&gt;

"Doctors have been using (his) findings very widely," said [[Steven Shafer]], editor of ''[[Anesthesia and Analgesia]]'', a [[scientific journal]] that published ten articles identified as containing fraudulent data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaeditor.org/HWP/Retraction.Notice.pdf "Retraction Notice"], Steven L. Shafer, ''[[Anesthesia and Analgesia]]'', 20 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; "His findings had a huge impact on the field."&lt;ref name="ap0311"/&gt;  He also described Reuben's actions as the biggest case of fraud in the history of anesthesiology.&lt;ref name="boston0311"/&gt; Paul White, "another editor at the journal, estimates that Reuben's studies led to the sale of billions of dollars' worth of drugs which may have actually slowed down recovery times for patients."&lt;ref name="sciam0310"/&gt;

Reuben's work had actually come under scrutiny as early as 2007, when several anesthesiologists noticed his studies never showed negative results.&lt;ref name="jl"/&gt; Greg Koski, former director of the [[Office for Human Research Protections]], said the fraud was unusual because Reuben was able to carry it on for almost 13 years without being caught by the [[peer review]] process.&lt;ref name="boston0311"/&gt;

All of Reuben's 21 fraudulent articles, as well as the article abstracts, are documented in Healthcare Ledger Magazine.

Tufts has since cut ties with Reuben,&lt;ref name="wsj0311"/&gt;and his Massachusetts medical license was permanently revoked after a period in which he voluntarily agreed not to practice.

== Sentencing ==

On January 7, 2010 Reuben agreed to plead guilty to one count of [[health care fraud]].  Prosecutors alleged that Reuben obtained thousands of dollars in grants for research that he never performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/dr_scott_reuben_former_chief_o.html Dr. Scott Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, pleads guilty to health-care fraud]. [[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]], January 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He formally pleaded guilty on February 21, 2010 before Judge [[Michael Ponsor]].  On May 24, Ponsor sentenced him to six months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  He was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine, forfeit $50,000 to the government and make $360,000 in restitution to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref name="ml0624"&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/06/scott_reuben_a_former_baystate.html?ref=us Scott Reuben, a former Baystate doctor who faked research, sentenced to 6 months for health care fraud], [[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]], June 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2010/June/Reuben%20Scott%20Sentencing%20PR.html Anesthesiologist sentenced on health care fraud charge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531021732/http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/news/2010/June/Reuben%20Scott%20Sentencing%20PR.html |date=2011-05-31 }}. [[United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts]], June 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The plea deal effectively ended his career as a doctor; most states will not grant medical licenses to convicted felons.

On November 16, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued an order permanently [[debarment|debarring]] Reuben from assisting in drug applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/16/2011-29538/scott-s-reuben-debarment-order Scott S. Reuben: Debarment Order (FDA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
A 2009 review of [[systematic review]] articles used in [[evidence-based medicine]] found that while some reviews were no longer valid when the Reuben studies were removed, the conclusions in the majority of them remained unchanged.&lt;ref name=Marret&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marret  ''et al.'' | date = Dec 2009 | title = lessons from the Reuben case | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 111 | issue = 6| pages = 1279–89 | doi = 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c14c3d | pmid = 19934873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The review found that the key Reuben claims that needed to be re-examined were "the absence of detrimental effects of coxibs on bone healing after spine surgery, the beneficial long-term outcome after preemptive administration of coxibs including an allegedly decreased incidence of chronic pain after surgery, and the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac or clonidine when added to local anesthetics for intravenous regional anesthesia."&lt;ref name=Marret/&gt;

In 2010 the editorial in ''Anaesthesia'' argued that,&lt;ref name="Wiley_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fraud or flawed: adverse impact of fabricated or poor quality research | journal=Anaesthesia | date=17 March 2010 | author=Editor |volume=65 |number= 4 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2010.06295.x |pmid = 20402871| pages=327–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Reuben’s fabricated data may have had impact beyond systematic review conclusions because they addressed topical questions for which anaesthetists, surgeons, and patients seek answers, such as the utility of multimodal anaesthesia, or whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) influence bone healing... Millions of people have had NSAIDs after fractures, trauma or orthopaedic surgery without problems of bone healing. The plausibility of a sizeable negative effect of NSAIDs on bone healing has to be questioned.}}

==Pfizer==
Although Pfizer "underwrote much of Dr. Reuben’s research from 2002 to 2007" and "many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain" Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data.&lt;ref name="nyt0311" /&gt;

'''Sestos''' ({{lang-el|Σηστός}}) or '''Sestus''' was an [[ancient Greek]] town of the [[Thracian Chersonese]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/shipley/pseudo-skylax Pseudo-Skylax, The 'Periplous' (Circumnavigation): a provisional translation, paragraphs 66, 67]&lt;/ref&gt; the modern [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in European [[Turkey]]. Situated on the [[Hellespont]] opposite [[Abydos (Hellespont)|Abydos]], it was the home of Hero in the legend of [[Hero and Leander]], where according to legend she lived in a tower overlooking the sea. Sestos was an [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] colony, as it was founded by settlers from [[Lesbos]]. The ruins of the town are near to the modern settlement of [[Eceabat]].

During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule, Sestos alongside [[Byzantium]] were the two Achaemenid ports of utmost importance on the European coasts of the [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Hellespont]].{{sfn|Balcer|1990|pages=599-600}} In 480 BC, [[Xerxes I|Xerxes']] army crossed at this point on two temporary [[pontoon bridge]]s later known as [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges]], and most of [[Alexander the Great]]'s forces went the other way here by boat in 334 BC.

In 1810 [[Lord Byron]] swam from Sestos to Abydos in one hour 10 minutes, recreating Leander's feat, and wrote a poem thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Works of Lord Byron (ed. Coleridge, Prothero)/Poetry/Volume 3/Written after swimming from Sestos to Abydos]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This event is commemorated every year with an annual swim event that recreates the crossing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

Little now remains of the ancient town of Sestos.

[[File:Sestusdecree-BM.JPG|250px|left|thumb| Marble decree from Sestos in the [[British Museum]]]]

==Hero and Leander==

Sestos is central to [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', and is referred to in its opening lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
''On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,
''In view and opposite two cities stood,
''Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might:
''The one Abydos, the other Sestos [[:wikt:hight|hight]].
''At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,
''Whom young Apollo courted for her hair.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The poem's two parts are called "Sestiads".

==Siege of Sestos==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars}}

In 479-478 BC, after the Greek victories (against Persia) at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]], Greek forces under the command of [[Xanthippus]] besieged the Persian forces. The Athenians attacked the Persian forces, and defeated the Persians.  Since the Persians were defeated, the Persian garrison at Sestos allowed the Greeks to conquer the city. As a result, Persian influence along the [[Hellespont]] was significantly reduced. This served the dual goal of denying Persian land forces access to the Greek mainland, while restoring Athenian trade to [[Black Sea]] ports such as [[Byzantium]].

{{Political campaigning}}
A '''smear campaign''', also referred to as a '''smear tactic''' or simply a '''smear''', is an effort to damage or call into question someone's [[reputation]], by propounding negative [[propaganda]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} It can be applied to individuals or groups.

Common targets are public officials, [[politicians]], [[political candidate]]s, [[Activism|activists]] and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts such as the workplace.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Jay C. Thomas, Michel Hersen (2002) Handbook of Mental Health in the Workplace&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''smear campaign'' became popular around 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Smear+campaign&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4;,Smear+campaign;,c0;,s0;;smear+campaign;,c0;;Smear+Campaign;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
A smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual's or group's reputation, credibility, and [[Character assassination|character]]. Like [[negative campaigning]], most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, private persons or groups may also become targets of smear campaigns perpetrated in  companies, institutions, the legal system, and other formal groups.

Smear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility.

Smears often consist of [[ad hominem]] attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and [[cognitive distortion|distortions]], [[half-truth]]s, or even outright [[lie]]s; smear campaigns are often propagated by [[gossip magazine]]s. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation is tarnished before the truth is known.

Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the [[False accusation|false information]] rather than on the original issue.

Deflection has been described as a ''wrap-up smear'': "You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Pelosi, Nancy | date=2017-03-05 | title=State of the Union | medium=Television production | publisher=CNN | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1703/05/sotu.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smear tactics are considered by many to be a low, disingenuous form of discourse; they are nevertheless very common.

==Cluster B==
Smear campaigns have been identified as a common weapon of [[psychopaths]]&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junie Moon (2012) Surviving the Predators Among Us&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderlines]] and [[narcissists]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Nightshade (2016) ''A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the Narcissist''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Burgo (2016). ''The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
In many countries, the law recognizes the value of reputation and credibility. Both [[Slander and libel|libel]] (a false and damaging publication) and slander (a false and damaging oral statement) are often punishable by law and may result in imprisonment or compensation or fees for damages done.

==Targets==
Smear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques.

===John C. Frémont – 1856 US presidential election candidate===
{{Main article|John C. Frémont#Republican presidential candidate}}

During the 1856 presidential election, [[John C. Frémont]] was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic.  The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics.

[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|"The Great Republican Reform Party Calling on their Candidate", an 1856 print which is a political cartoon about [[John C. Frémont]], the first Republican party candidate for president of the United States. There was a political campaign smear rumor current in 1856 that Fremont was a Catholic (the purpose of which was to prevent Fremont from gaining support from those who were suspicious of Catholics).]]

===General Motors against Ralph Nader===
[[Ralph Nader]] was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''The New Republic'' and ''The New York Times'', reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to [[telephone tapping|tap his phones]] and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longhine |first=Laura |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits—if it ever gets built |date = December 2005|work=Legal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005-05-07 |work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.htm |title=President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Federal Role in Highway Safety: Epilogue&amp;nbsp;— The Changing Federal Role}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader sued the company for [[invasion of privacy]] and settled the case for $284,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the [[New York Court of Appeals]], whose opinion in the case expanded [[tort law]] to cover "overzealous surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v. General Motors Corp.'', 307 N.Y.S.2d 647 (N.Y. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.

===Gary Hart – 1988 US presidential candidate===
{{Main|Gary Hart#1988 presidential campaign}}

[[Gary Hart]] was the target of a smear campaign during the 1988 US presidential campaign.  Smear campaigns are a [[political strategy|campaign tactic]] associated with [[yellow journalism]] which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism.  For example, during [[Gary Hart]]'s 1988 presidential campaign, the ''New York Post'' reported on its front page big, black block letters: "GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER."&lt;ref name=SafireVamping&gt;William Safire.

===China against Apple Inc.===
Countries have used smear campaigns to attempt to discredit Western companies. In 2011, China launched a smear campaign against [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], including TV and radio advertisements and articles in state-run papers.

Countries, particularly those outside the Western hemisphere, have accused Western powers of smear campaigns to bring down their governments. [[Gambia]] accused the United States and Britain of backing "so-called Gambians to set up organisations and media facilities to spread nothing but lies against The Gambia by making false, outrageous and unfounded statements about the state of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/gambia-accuses-enemies-britain-us-smear-campaign-181728761.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a [[Deutsche Welle]] journalist, Nemanja Rujević, published a text accusing [[Saša Radulović]] leader of the [[Enough is Enough (party)|Enough is Enough]] party, of a tax debt of a few million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/sr/dosta-je-milion/a-19449115|title=Dosta je milion {{!}} Politika {{!}} DW {{!}} 05.08.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=sr|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since released (titled "A milion is enough"), it has been used in political campaigning against him by the [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]] ruling party. He claimed that it was all fabricated and that he will sue its author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nedeljnik.rs/nedeljnik/portalnews/sasa-radulovic-ekskluzivno-za-nedeljnik-stigao-je-dokaz-da-americi-ne-dugujem-ni-dolar-za-porez/|title=Saša Radulović ekskluzivno za Nedeljnik: Stigao je dokaz da Americi ne dugujem ni dolar za porez|work=Nedeljnik|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Saša Radulović]] was never charged of avoiding to pay tax, and no warrant has been issued for his arrest, this article has been used often against his political engagement mostly by the president of the [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]] party, [[Aleksandar Vučić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rs.n1info.com/a204353/Vesti/Vesti/Rasprava-Radulovica-i-Vucica-u-Skupstini.html|title=Vučić o "marifetlucima" Radulovića, DJB o farsi u parlamentu|work=N1 Srbija|access-date=2018-02-18|language=sr-Latn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Snoopy: The Musical''''' is the 31st [[prime-time]] [[animated]] [[TV special]]s, based on characters from the Charles M. Schulz [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]''. It is an adaptation of the [[musical theatre|musical]] [[Snoopy!!! The Musical|of the same name]], and originally aired on the [[CBS]] network in 1988.

This is one of the two musicals in the ''Peanuts'' franchise where Snoopy actually has a voice (although the other kids can still not hear him).

==Plot==
A series of vignettes are strung together regarding the ''Peanuts'' gang. Each vignette has a song that involves various members of the gang.
* "Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be" - Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Sally and Linus sing about being the best that you can be, as Snoopy observes.
* "Snoopy’s Song" - Snoopy decides to obey his owner more after Lucy almost convinces Charlie to trade him in for a cat.
* "Woodstock's Theme" - More of a musical interlude than a vignette. A small musical selection plays as Woodstock wakes up and flies, with Snoopy commenting on his technique.
* "Edgar Allan Poe" - Peppermint Patty, Lucy, Sally, Linus, Charlie Brown agonize over the teacher calling on them, figuring that no matter what, the teacher will ask them something having to do with [[Edgar Allan Poe]].
* "I Know Now" - Sally, Peppermint Patty and Lucy sing about what they have learned as they have grown up.
* "The Vigil" - Linus once again holds vigil in the pumpkin patch on Halloween night, in hopes that the [[Great Pumpkin]] will appear. Snoopy accompanies him, but wears dark glasses so as to prevent anyone from recognizing him.
* "Clouds" - The Peanuts gang lay about in a grassy meadow, talking about what they see in the clouds. (Basically a musical take on the opening scene from ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.)
* "The Great Writer" - Snoopy attempts to compose his written masterpiece: "It Was a Dark and Stormy Night".
* "Poor Sweet Baby" - Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown discuss understanding what love is.
* "The Big Bow-Wow" - Snoopy is selected as Head Beagle, and celebrates by going out on the town, and performing at a stage show.
* "Just One Person" - The Peanuts gang sing an ensemble piece about believing in yourself

==Notes==
* Having adapted the [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'' three years prior, Charles Schulz once again opted to adapt the other musical with the ''Peanuts'' gang. Schulz had recently utilized many comic strips for ''[[The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show]]''.
* The song "Poor Sweet Baby" was based on the comic strip on 4/8/73 and the Broadway version song "Hurry up Face" was based on the comic strip on 9/17/72.
* The idea of Lucy mistaking a potato chip for a butterfly was borrowed from 1969's ''[[It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown]]''.
* Stock animation of the kids leaving the school in ''[[You're Not Elected Charlie Brown]]'' and ''[[Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown]]'' was used in the "Just One Person" number.
* Stock animation of Sally leaving the school in ''[[You're Not Elected Charlie Brown]]'' was used for her entrance in the "Just One Person" number.
* Stock animations of Charlie Brown kissing The Little Red-Haired Girl, flying and landing in his bed in ''[[It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown]]'' and Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown talking under the tree in ''[[There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown]]'' and ''[[It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown]]'' were used for the "Poor Sweet Baby" segment. Plus the "Heather" version of The Little Red-Haired Girl makes a final cameo appearance.
*Rerun makes a brief cameo in the song "I Know Now" after Linus upsets him and is confronted by their parents.
*The Cat Next Door appears on screen for the first time. Here, it resembles Brutus from the 1977 film ''[[Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown]]''.
*Constantly in the special, [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] and [[Patricia "Peppermint Patty" Reichardt|Peppermint Patty]] switch voices.
*This is the first time Snoopy was voiced by [[Cam Clarke|Cameron Clarke]], the second time was [[This is America, Charlie Brown]].

==Cast==
* Tiffany Billings as [[Lucy van Pelt]] (speaking/singing)
* Kristie Baker as [[Peppermint Patty]] (speaking/singing) (credited as Kristi Baker)
* [[Cam Clarke|Cameron Clarke]] as [[Snoopy]] (speaking/singing)

The '''State Fair of Texas''' is an annual [[state fair]] held in [[Dallas]] at historic [[Fair Park]].  The fair has taken place every year since 1886 except for varying periods during World War I and World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigtex.com/sft/AboutUs/StateFair.asp Bigtex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213232103/http://www.bigtex.com/sft/AboutUs/StateFair.asp |date=2014-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually begins the last Friday in September and ends 24 days later.

The State Fair of Texas opening day ceremonies are highlighted by the annual Friday parade rolling through [[downtown Dallas, Texas|downtown Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedallassocials.com/events/state-fair-of-texas-opening-day-parade-2/|title=State Fair of Texas: Opening Day Parade - Dallas Socials|date=25 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the centerpiece of the fair has been the annual [[college football]] game between [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] and [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], nicknamed the [[Red River Showdown|Red River Rivalry]] (historically known as both the "OU-Texas Game" or "Texas-OU Game") and played in the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] at Fair Park. Also, the [[State Fair Classic]], featuring [[Grambling State Tigers football|Grambling State University]] and [[Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers football|Prairie View A&amp;M University]], is played at the Cotton Bowl during the fair. In 2010, [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] played their game during the fair for the first time. During the opening weekend of the 2013 fair, [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] and [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] played in the only [[Heart of Dallas Classic]] at the Cotton Bowl; it was abandoned thereafter. The new Texas State Fair Football Showdown is scheduled to take place on the third weekend of the 2018 and 2019 fair and will feature [[Southern Jaguars football|Southern]] and [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luke Johnson|date=October 8, 2016|title='This is a major deal:' Southern to play Texas Southern in 2018–19 Texas State Fair Football Showdown|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/southern/article_fc706b0a-8db6-11e6-8d6a-af44e428f623.html|work=theadvocate.com|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Fair of Texas is the only fair in the US to include a full auto show, dating back to 1913.&lt;ref name="unique"/&gt;

The State Fair used to feature "Birds of the World" where several birds flew overhead. It was removed from the Fair lineup in 2014. The Texas Skyway is a gondola ride which only operates 24 days a year transports visitors around the fairgrounds. Its construction cost 5 million dollars. There is also a BMX bike show as well as dog and pig races. For children, puppet shows, Children's Medical Center Barnyard, and Story Time also take place inside the fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website of The State Fair of Texas|url=http://www.bigtex.com/sft/Entertainment/Attractions.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the fair has emphasized its reputation as an event featuring unique, albeit high-fat foods. It has been known for years for Fletcher's brand [[corny dog]]s.  Recent years have seen the introduction of new unusual deep-fried items, including deep-fried [[Oreo]]s, deep-fried [[Twinkie]]s, deep-fried [[s'more]]s, deep-fried pork ribs, fried cheesecake; deep-fried butter, fried avocados, deep-fried [[peanut butter]], [[fruit preserves|jelly]], and banana sandwiches, and most recently a batter-based [[fried Coke]].  New foods in 2008 included [[chicken fried bacon]] and fried banana splits. For the 2012 fair, the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas added the deep-fried Samoa cookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/11/deep-fried-samoa-girl-scout-cookies_n_1664965.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Rachel | last=Tepper | title=Deep-Fried Samoa Girl Scout Cookies Hit The State Fair Circuit | date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally what was known as the State Fair of Texas was held in [[Houston]] from 1870 through 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chron.com/heights/news/article/Few-traces-remain-of-state-fair-site-4392244.php |title=Few traces remain of state fair site |author=Meeks, Flori |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=March 28, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its modern incarnation, the State Fair of Texas was charted as a private corporation by local businessmen. It was an immediate success and attracted thousands of people. However, in 1904 a series of events led to a financial crisis and not enough income was available to keep the fair running. Therefore, the businessmen sold it to the city of Dallas with the agreement that 24 days during the fall would be set aside annually for the fair and exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Wiley, "State Fair of Texas", Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lks02), accessed August 16, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Big Tex]], a {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[cowboy]] statue, has been its symbol since his introduction in 1952. In 1953, Big Tex's jaw was hinged, so that he appears to "speak" the announcements that promote fair events.&lt;ref name="fptimeline4"&gt;Steven Butler. [http://www.watermelon-kid.com/places/FairPark/fp-history/fp-timeline4.htm Fair Park Timeline, part 4: The Post-Exposition Years (1938-1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; After a fire on October 19, 2012 destroyed the original Big Tex, he was rebuilt and reintroduced for the 2013 fair. Big Tex is claimed to be the world's tallest cowboy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rove.me/to/texas/state-fair-of-texas State Fair of Texas] rove.me&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
In 1955, [[Juanita Craft#Biography|Juanita Craft]] organized a protest of the State Fair of Texas against its policy of admitting blacks only on "Negro Achievement Day." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.womenintexashistory.org/audio/craft/ Women In Texas History - Juanita Craft]&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Fair in 1966 commissioned a report on the redevelopment of the fair, which concluded that the land around Fair Park should be `bought up and turned into a paved, lighted, fenced parking lot" that would `eliminate the problem from sight'. "If the poor Negroes in their shacks cannot be seen, all the guilt feelings…will disappear, or at least be removed from primary consideration".

The State Fair came under fire in October 2014 for spending over $5,000,000 on attorneys fees to two insiders.&lt;ref name="dfw.cbslocal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/10/01/state-fair-of-texas-pays-above-average-legal-bills/|title=State Fair Of Texas Pays 'Above Average' Legal Bills|first=L.

Despite a $30,000,000 investment in Summer Adventures, the event was shuttered after just one season.&lt;ref name="dallasnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/white-rock-east-dallas/headlines/20140218-there-wont-be-summer-adventures-in-fair-park-this-year.ece|title=There won’t be Summer Adventures in Fair Park this year|date=18 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, the State Fair was sanctioned more than $75,000 for filing a SLAPP suit[34] against a lawyer who had requested financial documents from the State Fair. On August 2, 2016, the Dallas Court of Appeals reversed in its entirety the judgment against the State Fair of Texas, holding that the trial court erred in, among other things, finding that the State Fair's lawsuit was a SLAPP suit.&lt;ref name="Dallas Court of Appeals Opinion"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID=2d5dc8b9-6395-4bb7-9dc6-943ff76b575e&amp;MediaID=3c72e1b0-c254-4346-b1cf-ce29adb1a72c&amp;coa=%22%20+%20this.CurrentWebState.CurrentCourt%20+%20@%22&amp;DT=Opinion|title=Dallas Court of Appeals Opinion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
[[File:Texas State Fair at night.jpg|thumb|A glimpse of the State Fair of Texas at night in 2006]]
* The State Fair of Texas opened its gates for the first time on October 26, 1886. Approximately 14,000 people attend the opening day.
* On November 7, 1886, the fair closes and attracted over 100,000 people for the very first year.
* The State Fair of Texas has a history of racial discrimination dating back to the 1880s. The first designated day for African-Americans to attend the fair was held in 1889 and was called "Colored People's Day." Educator Norman Washington Harllee organized exhibits and planned events and speakers including Booker T. Washington in 1900. In 1910, "Colored People's Day" was discontinued and reappeared in 1936 as "Negro Achievement Day" set to coincide with the Texas Centennial Exposition. Contrary to the fact that African-Americans weren’t allowed to participate in entertainment or eat at restaurants and concession stands on other days during the run, fair officials touted "Negro Achievement Day" as a way to recognize the accomplishments and progress of the Negro race in Texas and the United States. The Hall of Negro Life was the only building demolished after the Texas Centennial ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dallaslibrary2.org/mbutts/assets/lessons/L12-civil+rights/Marion+Butts+-+State+Fair(PPT).pdf|title=Dallas Public Library - Site Map|website=dallaslibrary2.org|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics, finances and management==

The economics, finances and management of the State Fair of Texas is a matter of public concern and study. The five main areas of concern are:

* What is the annual attendance of the fair?
* What economic impact does the fair have on people and businesses in the surrounding area?
* How much money does the State Fair provide for the benefit of improvements at [[Fair Park]] and elsewhere
* State fair staff compensation levels
* Audits

===Attendance===

Staff of the State Fair have traditionally reported that attendance at the fair runs in the vicinity each year of between 3 and 3.5 million people. These figures were disputed in an April 2016 study published by Tom Kelly, Ph.D, a professor of Economics at [[Baylor University]] and the Director of Baylor University Center for Business and Economic Research, along with Bennet Hickok, an Economics student at Baylor. The Kelly/Hickok report argues that the attendance at the fair is about 1.5-1.7 million visitors a year, or about half of what state fair staff reported it to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Tom|last2=Hickok|first2=Bennet|title=Reassessing the Economic Impact of Fair Park and the State Fair|url=http://www.baylor.edu/business/economic_research/doc.php/262623.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=Baylor University|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report,&lt;ref&gt;[https://bigtex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/9910_AnnualReport_2017_Reduced.pdf 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report] Retrieved Jul 15, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; the Fair attracted a total of 2,250,433 attendees during the 2017 event with roughly 93,000 daily guests.

===Economic impact on surrounding businesses===

The 2016 Kelly/Hickok study found that the State Fair generates around $50 million for the area economy. This is in contrast to the figure of $600 million in impact that the State Fair itself has traditionally reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shipp|first1=Brett|title=Economist's study raises eyebrows about State Fair's future in Fair Park|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/dallas-county/economists-study-raises-eyebrows-about-state-fairs-future-in-fair-park/171813101|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=WFAA|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Steve|title=How valuable is Big Tex to Dallas?

===How excess revenue is spent===

The State Fair has a lease with [[Fair Park]], the terms of which require that any profit or excess revenue it generates be spent "for the development and enhancement of Fair Park and the Fair". In May 2016, the State Fair released a list of capital projects for the past 10 years, detailing how the fair had spent their excess revenue. According to media reports, 90% of excess revenue was spent on projects that solely benefited the State Fair. A survey of [[Fair Park]] revealed out of the 277 acres available, 200 are covered in asphalt or concrete, compared to 10 acres of green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilonsky|first1=Robert|title=Dallas isn’t keeping a close eye on Big Tex and city's other Fair Park partners, says audit|url=http://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/2016/05/dallas-isnt-keeping-a-close-eye-on-big-tex-and-citys-other-fair-park-partners-says-audit.html/|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff compensation===

In 2014, Errol McKoy, the former President of the State Fair of Texas, received $1.425 million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Steve|title=Big Tex tries to be more transparent about State Fair spending|url=http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/04/big-tex-tries-to-be-more-transparent-about-state-fair-spending.html/|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassidy|first1=Jon|title=State Fair's expenses help explain Fair Park's blight|url=http://watchdog.org/263984/fair-expenses-park/|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=Watchdog.org|date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE FAIR OF TEXAS|url=http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/?FuseAction=NPO.Summary&amp;EIN=756002511&amp;BMF=1&amp;Cobrandid=0&amp;Syndicate=No|publisher=Economic Research Institute|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audits===

On May 13, 2016, the City of Dallas Auditor, Craig Kinton, released an audit regarding Fair Park Business Partners, which included the State Fair of Texas. The audit concluded the City of Dallas had no way to ensure the State Fair was adequately investing in [[Fair Park]], per the terms of the contract between the City of Dallas and State Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinton|first1=Craig|title=AUDIT OF FAIR PARK BUSINESS PARTNERS  OVERSIGHT|url=http://dallascityhall.com/departments/auditor/DCH%20Documents/Audit%20and%20Attestation%20Reports%20FY%202016%20(10-01-2015%20to%2009-30-2016)/A16-009%20-%20Audit%20of%20Fair%20Park%20Business%20Partners%20Oversight%2005-13-2016.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=Office of the Dallas, Texas City Auditor|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tailteann Games''' or '''Aonach Tailteann''' was an Irish sporting and cultural festival held in the [[Irish Free State]] in 1924, 1928, and 1932. It was intended as a modern revival of the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Tailteann Games]] held from legendary times until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]; as such it drew inspiration from the [[Modern Olympics]] revival of the [[Ancient Olympics]].  [[Croke Park]], the Dublin headquarters of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], was the venue for the opening ceremony and many of the sports events, which were open to people of [[Irish people|Irish]] birth or ancestry. The Tailteann Games were held shortly after the Summer Olympics, such that athletes participating in [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris 1924]] and [[1928 Summer Olympics|Amsterdam 1928]] came to compete. Participants coming from England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, the USA, South Africa and Australia as well as Ireland.&lt;ref name="HoganstandCPHist"&gt;[http://www.hoganstand.com/general/ground/articles/0328033.htm History of Croke Park - Hogan Stand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221041915/http://www.hoganstand.com/general/ground/articles/0328033.htm |date=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chess]] competitions were held in conjunction with the [[Irish Chess Union]] as part of the Tailteann Games. There were also artistic competitions and industrial displays. The games became regarded as a [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] project, and when that party lost power to [[Fianna Fáil]] after the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 election]] there was no financial backing for further games.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin 2005, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
This revival "meeting of the Irish race" was announced by [[Éamon de Valera]] in Dáil Éireann in 1921. The [[1922 Irish Race Convention]] supported the plan for an "Irish Race Olympic".&lt;ref&gt;Dean 2014 p.91&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[Anglo-Irish War]] and [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]] it was not held until 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goireland.about.com/od/historyculture/qt/gg_tailteann.htm The Tailteann Games - An Olympic Event for the "Celtic Race"], by Bernd Biege, About.com&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was launched to celebrate the independence of Ireland. The [[Hogan Stand]] was built and opened for the 1924 games.&lt;ref name="HoganstandCPHist" /&gt;

A report to revive the games was debated in the Dáil in June 1922. Modern sports such as [[motorcycle racing|motorcycling]] and [[shooting sport|shooting]] were to be included, along with a parade of massed choirs. The possibility of out-doing the [[Olympic Games]] was mentioned: "We have got representations from America to the effect that it would be advisable to depart from the idea of confining the Tailteann games to the Irish race and seeing that they predated the Greek Olympic by a thousand years we should be justified in entering upon a more varied programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.S.192206080008.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031123831/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/DT/D.S.192206080008.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-31|title=Dil ireann - Volume 2 - 08 June, 1922 - IOMATHOIRI IASACHTA.|work=oireachtas.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were delayed by the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922–23.

==Symbols==
[[Commemorative medal]]s were struck for all three games, in gold, silver, silver gilt, and bronze. They depict [[Tailtiu]], the patron deity of the ancient Tailteann Games, with inscription "An Bhainrioghan Tailte" ("Queen Tailte").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Went|first=Arthur E. J.|date=June 1978|title=Medallic Illustrations of Dublin History|journal=Dublin Historical Record|publisher=Old Dublin Society|volume=31|issue=3|pages=97–104 : 103 |jstor=30104073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1924==
The games opened with the "Tailteann choir" singing the "Tailteann ode", with words by [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and music by Louis O'Brien.&lt;ref name="McAsey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAsey|first=Carmel C.  |jstor=30087165|date=December 1969|title=Dubliners and Opera|journal=Dublin Historical Record|publisher=Old Dublin Society|volume=23|issue=2/3|pages=45–55 : 53}} ; {{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000513987 |title=Aonach tailteann 1924 prize ode |last1=Gogarty |first1=Oliver St. John |last2=O'Brien |first2=Louis |year=1924 |work=Holdings |publisher=Piggott |accessdate=1 August 2017 |location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ode won Gogarty a bronze medal in the literature section of the [[Art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympic art competition]]. The [[Irish flag]] was carried by [[Tom Kiely]], winner of the [[Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics – Men's all-around|1904 Olympic all-around (decathlon)]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zarnowski|first=Frank|date=August 2006|title=Thomas F.

To increase the quality of the competition, some Olympic stars without Irish heritage were invited to compete as guests.&lt;ref name="Rouse2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/columnists/paul-rouse/when-irelands-tailteann-games-eclipsed-the-olympics-431134.html|title=When Ireland’s Tailteann Games eclipsed the Olympics|last=Rouse|first=Paul|date=18 November 2016|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish republican legitimism|dissident Irish republican government]] which had lost the Civil War urged a boycott of the games "falsely described as Aonach Tailteann", because it rejected the legitimacy of the Free State government which sponsored the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000507179|title=To the people of Ireland and to every member of the Irish race|last=Ruttledge|first=P. J. |authorlink=P. J. Ruttledge |year=1924|work=Holdings|publisher=National Library of Ireland|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rugby union]] was excluded from the program because the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] was seen as "undemocratic and almost un-Irish".&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 2015 p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chess===
Run in conjunction with the [[Irish Chess Union]], there were three competitions, the overall competition was won by the reigning Irish Champion [[Philip Baker (chess player)|Philip Baker]], the Major Competition was won by [[Lord Dunsany]], with Aaron Sayers as runner-up.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/columnists/paul-rouse/when-irelands-tailteann-games-eclipsed-the-olympics-431134.html When Irelands Tailteann Games eclipsed the Olympics] by Paul Rouse, Irish Examiner, November 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Dublin Chess Club provided its premises and equipment for use for the Competitions.&lt;ref&gt;'A History of Dublin Chess Club' by A. A. Luce, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurling===
In [[hurling]], teams from England, Wales, the United States, Scotland, and Ireland played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leeworthy|first=Daryl|year=2012|title=The Forgotten Hurlers of South Wales: Sport, Society and the Irish, 1910–1925|journal=Journal of Welsh People's History|publisher=[[Llafur]]|volume=11|issue=2|issn=0306-0837|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/18278/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[shinty–hurling]] match was played between Scotland team organised by the [[Camanachd Association]] and an Ireland team organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA).

The [[Camogie Association]] planned national and international [[camogie]] competitions, but withdrew after a dispute with the organisers, reflecting the anti-Free State bias of the association's leadership. An exhibition match was played without the association's sanction,&lt;ref name="NicCongail2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nic Congáil|first=Ríona|date=Spring–Summer 2013|title="Looking on for Centuries from the Sideline": Gaelic Feminism and the Rise of Camogie|journal=Éire-Ireland :|volume=48|issue=1 &amp; 2|pages=168–190 : 184|url=http://doras.dcu.ie/21567/1/117_SCAN.pdf#page=17 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an association "Ireland" team played in London.

===Swimming===
Swimming events were held in the pond at [[Dublin Zoo]].&lt;ref name="Rouse2017" /&gt; American [[Johnny Weissmuller]] and Australian [[Boy Charlton|Andrew "Boy" Charleton]] took part.&lt;ref name="Rouse2017" /&gt;

===Athletics===
The American [[Harold Osborn]], the [[Athletics at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's high jump|1924 Olympic high jump]] champion, won the same event in the Tailteann Games

===Sailing===

[[W. B. Yeats]] persuaded the [[Royal Irish Academy]] to award prizes. The gold medal went to [[Stephen MacKenna]] for his translation of [[Plotinus]]; other winners were Oliver Gogarty, [[Francis Stuart]], and [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]]. A banquet presided over by [[T. M. Healy]], the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], had an "oddly assorted" group of guests invited by Yeats, including  [[Augustus John]], Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], writers [[Compton Mackenzie]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Lennox Robinson]], and [[Carlos Magalhães de Azeredo]]; cricketers [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[C. B. Fry]]; and diplomats [[Willem Hubert Nolens]] and [[Erik Palmstierna]].

A Symposium'', ed. by Aloys Fleischmann (Cork: Cork University Press, 1952), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[genre painting]] competition, Charles Lamb won a silver medal for ''Dancing at a Northern Crossroads'', depicting a traditional [[crossroads dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourke|first=Marie|date=Spring 2000|title=A Growing Sense of National Identity|journal=History Ireland|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/a-growing-sense-of-national-identity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1932==
With the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] begin held in Los Angeles, the Tailteann Games was originally scheduled for 1931 to avoid a clash, but postponed to 1932, which meant Olympic athletes from Ireland or abroad could not be present. The Games' main backer, minister [[J. J. Walsh]], lost office when [[Government of the 7th Dáil|Fianna Fáil took power]] after the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 election]], and public funding was cut. Against a background of the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]], the Games cut from two weeks to one; they made a £12 profit.

===Chess===
The third games was won again by [[John O'Hanlon (chess player)|John O'Hanlon]] who was also Irish Champion in 1932.

===Sailing===
The sailing events were hosted by the [[National Yacht Club]], Dun Laoghaire in July 1932.&lt;ref name="it19320711"&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=11 July 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1937==
In 1937 [[Éamon de Valera]] organised an inter-[[Department of State (Ireland)|departmental]] committee into the feasibility of staging another games, which reported in June that it would be possible to stage one in 1939. De Valera used the [[National Athletic and Cycling Association#Splits and isolation|split in Irish athletics governance]] as an excuse to defer consideration, to the chagrin of J. J. Walsh. The onset of the [[Second World War]] deferred any progress and nothing further happened after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 2015 p.255&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomo-Dachi''' was an [[anime convention]] based in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="ulster2005"&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2005/1976.html | title = Magee To Host Japanese Animation Convention | date = 2005-12-07 | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | publisher = [[University of Ulster]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015035202/http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2005/1976.html | archivedate = 2006-10-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the summer of 2005, Tomo-Dachi was the first [[anime]] convention to run in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="irishsf"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slovobooks.com/irishsfnews/news.php?postid=235 | title=Anime Con for Northern Ireland | date = 2005-08-22 | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | publisher = Irish Sci-Fi News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original venue was [[Nerve Centre|The Nerve Centre]], on Magazine Street in the city centre of [[Derry]]. Tomo-Dachi, also known as TDXX (the "XX" is replaced by the year - such as TD05, TD06, etc.) is now held annually at the [[Magee College]] of the [[University of Ulster]].&lt;ref name="ulster2005"/&gt;
 
The name of the event comes from the word {{nihongo|''tomodachi''|友達|}}, which means "friends"&lt;!---since it's a conference, I'm assuming the plural version is implied---&gt; in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

==History==
In 2004 when the original Tomo-dachi committee was formed there had never been an anime convention held anywhere in Ireland, north or south of the border. The announcement and run up to the first outing of the anime convention was reported in multiple local and national based papers including the [[Belfast Telegraph]], [[The News Letter]] and the [[Daily Ireland]].

==Tomo-Dachi 2005==
Tomo-Dachi 2005 (or TD05 for short) was held in August 2005.&lt;ref name="AC2005"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/events/info/962/tomo-dachi-2005 | title = Tomo-Dachi 2005 Information | work = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first anime convention to be held on the Island of Ireland, and was operated and run by DAMA, the Derry Anime and Manga Association. The one-day event attracted 83 people.

===Location &amp; Details===
TD05 took place at the [[Nerve Centre]], a public entertainment venue in Derry based in the city centre, and the convention made use of its unique facilities. This was venue where the Derry Anime and Manga Association held their meetings.

The one-day convention was made up of multiple areas. One screening room, that being an actual [[movie theatre|cinema]].

The event also held Northern Ireland's first Anime Convention Cosplay Contest, which was won by Ryan McDermott.

==Tomo-Dachi 2006==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:tomo06.jpg|right|thumb|TOMO-DACHI 2006]]  --&gt;The plans for the following year's event included a change of venue and lengthening Tomo-Dachi into a three days event.

The convention took place on the weekend of July 7, 2006.&lt;ref name="AC2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://animecons.com/events/info/968/tomo-dachi-2006 | title = Tomo-Dachi 2006 Information | work = AnimeCons.com | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Una | last = Bradley | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article1849041.ece | title = Manga from heaven | work = Belfast Telegraph | publisher = Independent News &amp; Media | date = 2006-07-07 | accessdate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Guests===
The convention was attended by several guests, most notably Ms [[Tiffany Grant]] and Mr [[Matt Greenfield]] in their first ever convention visit in Europe. They were joined by [[Hugh David ADV|Hugh David]] of [[ADV Films|ADV]] films UK, [[Sonia Leong]] and [[Emma Vieceli]] both of [[Sweatdrop Studios|Sweatdrop Manga Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.anime-ni.co.uk/?p=402 | title = TOMO-DACHI: The Final Press Release | publisher = Tomo-Dachi | date = 2006-06-30 | accessdate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location &amp; Details===
TD06 was held at [[Magee College]], part of the [[University of Ulster]]. The campus was fully renovated prior to the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://news.ulster.ac.uk/releases/2000/189.html | title = University details £10m Magee College campus expansion | publisher = University of Ulster | date = 2000-03-03 | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With classrooms converted into gaming rooms, screening rooms, an artists alley and a Manga library.

TD06 was a three-day convention and offered special events, panels, industry information, dealers and more. Over the weekend it was attended by just over 200 people from Ireland and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="TD06_nums"&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.animeuknews.net/viewpress.php?showarticle=109 | title = Tomo-Dachi committee announces TD07 | date = 2005-09-26 | accessdate = 2007-02-23 | publisher = AnimeUKnews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triplemanía X''' was the tenth [[Triplemanía]] [[professional wrestling]] show promoted by [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]]. The show took place on July 5, 2002 in Madero, Mexico. The Main event featured a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' match where each wrestler defended the hair of a referee. The participants in this match were [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]], [[Sangre Chicana]], [[El Oriental]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electroshock]], May Flowers and [[El Brazo]].

==Production==
===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]], later known simply as "AAA" or Triple A. After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 Triplemanía was the 10th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the fifteenth overall show under the Triplemanía banner.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía show featured eight [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

'''USS ''Pueblo'' (AGER-2)''' is a {{sclass-|Banner|environmental research ship}}, attached to Navy intelligence as a [[spy ship]], which was attacked and captured by [[North Korea]]n forces on 23 January 1968, in what is known today as the "'''''Pueblo'' incident'''" or alternatively, as the "'''''Pueblo'' crisis'''".

The seizure of the U.S. Navy ship and her 83 crew members, one of whom was killed in the attack, came less than a week after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[State of the Union address]] to the [[United States Congress]], a week before the start of the [[Tet Offensive]] in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and three days after 31 men of [[North Korea]]'s [[Unit 124|KPA Unit 124]] had crossed the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to [[Blue House Raid|attack the South Korean Blue House]] (executive mansion) in the capital [[Seoul]]. The taking of ''Pueblo'' and the abuse and torture of her crew during the subsequent 11-month prisoner drama became a major [[Cold War]] incident, raising tensions between the western powers, and the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]].

North Korea stated that ''Pueblo'' deliberately entered their territorial waters {{convert|7.6|nmi|km|0}} away from [[Wonsan|Ryo Island]], and that the [[logbook]] shows that they intruded several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/news/news_view.php?14+3492 |title=Pueblo Incident |work="Naenara" News from South Korea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527000751/http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/news/news_view.php?14+3492  |archivedate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/coldwar/dangerous_business.pdf|first=John R. |last=Schindler|title=A Dangerous Business: The U.S. Navy and National Reconnaissance During the Cold War|page=9|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Army Cargo Vessel FP-344.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Cargo Vessel ''FP-344'' (1944). Transferred to the Navy in 1966, she became USS ''Pueblo'' (AGER-2)]]

The ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin]], on 16 April 1944, as the [[United States Army]] Freight and Passenger (FP) ''FP-344''. The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to ''FS-344''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/us-people/b/brogan-h-c/nh-74688.html |work=Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images |title=U.S. Army cargo ship ''FP-344'' (1944–1966), later renamed ''FS-344''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guard–manned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/FS_Vessels.asp |title=World War II Coast Guard Manned U.S. Army Freight and Supply Ship Histories: ''FS-344'' |work=U.S. Coast Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''FS-344'' was placed out of service in 1954.

''FS-344'' was transferred to the [[United States Navy]] on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS ''Pueblo'' (AKL-44) after [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] and [[Pueblo County, Colorado]] on 18 June of the same year.

Initially, she served as a light cargo ship, but shortly after resuming service was converted to an intelligence gathering ship, or what is colloquially known as a "[[spy ship]]", and redesignated ''AGER-2'' on 13 May 1967. {{anchor|Activity and conflict near the DPRK}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[USS Liberty incident]] --&gt;

==''Pueblo'' incident==
On 5 January 1968, ''Pueblo'' left U.S. Navy base [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]], in transit to the U.S. naval base at [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the [[Tsushima Strait]] into the [[Sea of Japan]]. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of [[Soviet Navy]] activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usspueblo.org/v2f/attack/attacked.htm |title=Attacked by North Koreans |work=USS Pueblo Veteran's Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828001626/http://www.usspueblo.org/v2f/attack/attacked.htm |archivedate=28 August 2008 |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[declassified]] [[SIGAD]] for the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the [[Naval Security Group]] (NSG) on ''Pueblo'' during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y.&lt;ref name="nsa_AGER2_bkgnd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_pueblo/USS_Pueblo_AGER-2_Background_Information.pdf |title=USS Pueblo AGER 2: Background Information |work=National Security Agency |page=10 |accessdate=13 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918031529/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_pueblo/USS_Pueblo_AGER-2_Background_Information.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/p/pueblo-iii.html |title=USS Pueblo |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style [[submarine chaser]] passed within {{convert|4000|yd|km}} of ''Pueblo'', which was about {{convert|15.4|nmi|km}} southeast of Mayang-do at a position 39°47'N and 128°28.5'E.&lt;ref name="USCryptHist"/&gt;

In the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]] ''Rice Paddy 1'' and ''Rice Paddy 2'' passed within {{convert|30|yd|m}} of ''Pueblo''. That day, a North Korean unit made an [[Blue House Raid|assassination attempt in the "Blue House" executive mansion]] against the South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]], but the crew of ''Pueblo'' were not informed.&lt;ref name="USCryptHist"/&gt;

According to the American account, the following day, 23 January, ''Pueblo'' was approached by a submarine chaser and her nationality was challenged; ''Pueblo'' responded by raising the U.S. flag. The North Korean vessel then ordered ''Pueblo'' to stand down or be fired upon. ''Pueblo'' attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three [[torpedo boat]]s appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.&lt;ref name="USCryptHist"/&gt;

The attackers were soon joined by two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on ''Pueblo'' was stored belowdecks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:

{{quote|( ... ) Defensive armament (machine guns) should be stowed or covered in such manner so that it does not cause unusual interest by surveyed units. It should be used only in the event of a threat to survival ( ... )}}

and notes

{{quote|In practice, it was discovered that, because of the temperamental adjustments of the firing mechanisms, the .50-caliber machine guns took at least ten minutes to activate. Only one crew member, with former army experience, had ever had any experience with such weapons, although members of the crew had received rudimentary instructions on the weapons immediately prior to the ship's deployment.&lt;ref name="USCryptHist"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:USSPueblo positions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Positions of ''Pueblo'' reported by the US Navy]]

U.S. Navy authorities and the crew of ''Pueblo'' insist that before the capture, ''Pueblo'' was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea says the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852&amp;nbsp;m) of that limit. North Korea, however, describes a {{convert|50|nmi|km|0|adj=on}} [[Territorial waters|sea boundary]] even though international standards were {{convert|12|nmi|km|0}} at the time.&lt;ref&gt;"Questions of international law raised by the seizure of the U.S.S. ''Pueblo", ''Proceedings of the American Society of International Law: at its sixty third annual meeting held at Washington, D.C.'', 24–26 April 1969. American Society of International Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Korean vessels attempted to board ''Pueblo'', but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. A submarine chaser then opened fire with a 57&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, killing one member of the crew. The smaller vessels fired machine guns into ''Pueblo'', which then signaled compliance and began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of ''Pueblo''{{'}}s [[Naval Security Group|Naval Security Group Command]] detachment:

{{quote|( ... ) we had retained on board the obsolete publications and had all good intentions of getting rid of these things but had not done so at the time we had started the mission. I wanted to get the place organized eventually and we had excessive numbers of copies on board ( ... )}}

and concludes

{{quote|Only a small percentage of the total classified material aboard the ship was destroyed.}}

Radio contact between ''Pueblo'' and the Naval Security Group in [[Naval Support Facility Kamiseya|Kamiseya]], Japan, had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] command was fully aware of ''Pueblo''{{'}}s situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two to three-hour delay in launching aircraft. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} was located {{convert|510|nmi|km}} south of ''Pueblo'', yet her four [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4B]] aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. ''Enterprise''{{'}}s captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.&lt;ref name="USCryptHist"/&gt;

''Pueblo'' followed the North Korean vessels as ordered, but then stopped immediately outside North Korean waters. She was again fired upon, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed. The ship was finally boarded at 05:55 UTC (2:55 pm local)&lt;ref name="NSA_NK_Transmissions"&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korean Transmissions from January 1968: Chronology|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_pueblo/North_Korean_Transmissions_from_Jan_68.pdf|year=1968|publisher=[[National Security Agency]] (NSA)|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918031655/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/uss_pueblo/North_Korean_Transmissions_from_Jan_68.pdf|archivedate=18 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by men from a torpedo boat and a submarine chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once ''Pueblo'' was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier a flight by a CIA [[Lockheed A-12|A-12 Oxcart]] aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa flown by pilot Ronald Layton made three high altitude high speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft's films were processed in the United States they showed ''Pueblo'' to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mobley |first=Richard A. |title=Flash Point North Korea |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55750-403-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was dissent among government officials in the United States, regarding how to handle the situation. [[Members of the United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Mendel Rivers]] suggested that President Johnson issue an ultimatum for the return of ''Pueblo'' on penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator [[Gale McGee]] said the United States should wait for more information and not make "spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=1968 |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/N.-Korea-Seize-U.S.-Ship/12303153093431-9/ |title=N. Korea Seize U.S. Ship, 1968 Year in Review |work=UPI.com |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Horace Busby]], Special Assistant to President Johnson, the president's "reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans", worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-fa3035-interview-with-horace-w-busby-1981 |date=24 April 1981 |title=Interview with Horace W.

The day following the incident on Wednesday 24 January 1968, following extensive cabinet meetings Washington decided upon that their initial response should be to:

a) Deploy air and naval forces to the immediate area.

b) Make reconnaissance flights over the location of the Pueblo.

c) Call up military reserves and extending terms of military service.

d) Protest the incident within framework of the United Nations

e) President Johnson should personally cable Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p1/d217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p1/d218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p1/d220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v29p1/d221&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johnson administration also considered a blockade of North Korean ports, air strikes on military targets, and 
an attack across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USS Pueblo: LBJ Considered Nuclear Weapons, Naval Blockade, Ground Attacks in Response to 1968 North Korean Seizure of Navy Vessel, Documents Show|editor=John Prados and Jack Cheevers|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB453/|accessdate=August 10, 2018|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although American officials at the time assumed the seizure of ''Pueblo'' had been directed by the Soviet Union, it has emerged in recent years that North Korea acted alone and the incident actually harmed North Korea's relations with most of the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/nkidp-e-dossier-no-5-new-romanian-evidence-the-blue-house-raid-and-the-uss-pueblo |last1=Lerner |first1=Mitchell |last2=Shin |first2=Jong-Dae |title=New Romanian Evidence on the Blue House Raid and the USS Pueblo Incident.

Commander [[Lloyd M. Bucher]] was psychologically tortured, such as being put through a [[Mock execution|mock firing squad]] in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to "confess to his and the crew's transgression." Bucher wrote the confession since a "confession" by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said "We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader [[Kim Il Sung]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22978 |title=Bush lauded for handling of EP-3 incident |work=WorldNetDaily |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201031154/http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22978 |archivedate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thepalmbeachtimes.com/Pages/Korea.html |title=End of North Korea? |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bucher pronounced "''[[wikt:paean|paean]]''" as "''[[Urination|pee on]]''.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheevers |first=Jack |title=Act of War: Lyndon Johnson, North Korea, and the Capture of the Spy Ship Pueblo |publisher=Penguin |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-45146-619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations for the release of the crew took place at [[Panmunjom]]. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the ''Pueblo'' negotiations, notes in his oral history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the [[Blue House Raid]] and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Ericson, Jr."&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Charles S.|title=The USS Pueblo Incident – Assassins in Seoul, A Spy Ship Captured|url=http://adst.org/2013/01/the-uss-pueblo-incident-assassins-in-seoul-a-spy-ship-captured/|work=The Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training: Foreign Affairs Oral History Project|accessdate=20 February 2013|date=27 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive, due to the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog ... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Ericson, Jr."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The North Koreans for months photographed them without knowing the real meaning of flipping the middle finger, while the sailors explained that the sign meant good luck in Hawaii.]]
Ericson and George Newman, the [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Ericson, Jr."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that ''Pueblo'' had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release.&lt;ref name="probst"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Probst |first=Reed R. |title=Negotiating With the North Koreans: The U.S. Experience at Panmunjom |publisher=U.S. Army War College |location=Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania |date=16 May 1977 |url=http://www.nautilus.org/foia/NegotiatingwithNK.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725032339/http://www.nautilus.org/foia/NegotiatingwithNK.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) border with South Korea and ordered to walk south one by one across the "[[Bridge of No Return]]". Exactly eleven months after being taken prisoner, the Captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the Executive Officer, Lieutenant [[Edward R. Murphy (military officer)|Ed Murphy]], the last man across the bridge.&lt;ref name="schumacher"&gt;FC Schumacher and GC Wilson (1971) ''Bridge of No Return: The Ordeal of the USS Pueblo'', [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature which read: "and this hereby receipts for eighty two crewmen and one corpse".{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

Bucher and all the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy [[Naval Board of Inquiry|Court of Inquiry]]. A [[court-martial]] was recommended for Bucher and the Officer in Charge of the Research Department, Lieutenant Steve Harris for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but the [[Secretary of the navy|Secretary of the Navy]], [[John Chafee]], rejected the recommendation, stating, "They have suffered enough." Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.&lt;ref name="utsandiego"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/dec/19/remembering-the-pueblo-and-north-korea/|title=Remembering the Pueblo and North Korea |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS ''Pueblo'' incident entitled ''Bucher: My Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bucher |first= Lloyd M. |author2=Mark Rascovich  |title= Bucher: My Story |publisher= [[Doubleday &amp; Company]] |year= 1970 |isbn= 0385072449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76.

USS ''Pueblo'' is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of [[Nampo]] on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy [[James A. Kelly|James Kelly]] to the capital [[Pyongyang]]. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard ''Pueblo'' was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the [[Taedong River]] near the spot that the [[General Sherman incident]] is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 ''Pueblo'' was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the [[Fatherland Liberation War Museum]].&lt;ref name="usspueblo.org"/&gt;

Today, ''Pueblo'' remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind {{USS|Constitution}} ("Old Ironsides"). ''Pueblo'' is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in [[First Barbary War|Tripoli]].

=== Breach of US Navy communications security ===
Reverse engineering of communications devices on ''Pueblo'' allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the late 1980s when the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of ''Pueblo'' followed soon after US Navy [[warrant officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]] introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of ''Pueblo'' was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usspueblo.org/Aftermath/John_Walker_KW7.html |title=Crypto gear, John Walker and the History Channel |website=USS Pueblo Veteran's Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Laura J. [https://fas.org/irp/eprint/heath.pdf Analysis of the Systemic Security Weaknesses of the U.S. Navy Fleet Broadcasting System, 1967–1974, as Exploited by CWO John Walker] (PDF) U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Master's Thesis. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prados, John.

=== In the communist camp ===

Documents released from [[National Archives of Romania]] suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter"/&gt; Together with Blue House Raid, the ''Pueblo'' incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter"/&gt; In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the ''Pueblo'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130|title=China and North Korea: Strategic and Policy Perspectives from a Changing China|first=C.|last=Freeman|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the ''Pueblo'' incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a [[DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty of 1961|1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html&lt;/ref&gt; in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the [[Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty|similar treaty they had with China]], the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.&lt;ref name="Radchenko"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/CWIHP_WP_47.pdf |first=Sergey S. |last=Radchenko |title=The Soviet Union and the North Korean Seizure of the USS Pueblo: Evidence from Russian Archives |work=Cold War International History Project |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–15}}

Given that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to [[Alexei Kosygin]] on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was personally invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to "increased defense preparations" he had to personally attend to, sending instead his defense minister, [[Kim Ch'ang-bong]], who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Radchenko"/&gt;{{rp|15–18}}

==Tourist attraction==
''Pueblo'' is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea, since being moved to the [[Taedong River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Caroline |last=Gluck |title=North Korea drags its feet |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1626579.stm |accessdate=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pueblo'' used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the [[General Sherman incident|''General Sherman'' incident]] took place in 1866. In late November 2012 ''Pueblo'' was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Botong river next to the new Fatherland War of Liberation Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaryugyong.com.kp/data/video/en/11.flv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317143448/http://mediaryugyong.com.kp/data/video/en/11.flv |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-03-17 |work=Ryugyong Programming Center, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's media website |title=North Korean DPRK Liberation War Museum Video: Pueblo, U.S. Armed Spy Ship }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013.

==Offer to repatriate==
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea [[Donald Gregg]] received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate ''Pueblo'' to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shippingtimes.co.uk/item479_uss_pueblo.htm |title=Saturday feature: Old flag for an old spy ship |website=Shipping Times |accessdate=11 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201025544/http://www.shippingtimes.co.uk/item479_uss_pueblo.htm |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been no indication that the matter was brought up by U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] on his April 2018 visit.

==Lawsuit==
Former ''Pueblo'' crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]], in Washington, D.C., awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as "extensive and shocking."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Post]]'', "Damages Awarded in USS ''Pueblo'' Case", 31 December 2008, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wilber |first=Del Quentin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/07/AR2009100703890.html |title=Hell Hath a Jury: North Korea Tortured the Crew of USS ''Pueblo'' in 1968. 4 Victims Fought for Solace in the Courts |newspaper=Washington Post |date=8 October 2009 |page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

As for the crew members, they did not receive full recognition for their involvement in the incident until decades later. In 1988, the military announced it would award [[Prisoner of War medal]]s to those captured in the nation's conflicts. While thousands of American prisoners of war were awarded medals, the crew members of ''Pueblo'' did not receive them. Instead, they were classified as "detainees". It was not until Congress passed a law overturning this decision that the medals were awarded; the crew finally received the medals at San Diego in May 1990.&lt;ref name="utsandiego"/&gt;

==Representation in popular culture==
*The ''Pueblo'' incident was dramatically depicted in the critically acclaimed 1973 ''[[ABC Theater]]'' televised production ''Pueblo''. [[Hal Holbrook]] starred as Captain Lloyd Bucher. The two-hour drama was nominated for three [[Emmy Awards]], winning two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070573/|title=Pueblo|date=29 March 1973|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/128338/Pueblo/overview | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Pueblo – Trailer – Cast – Showtimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An earlier British dramatization for the 1970 season of ''[[ITV Playhouse]]'' starred [[Ray McAnally]] as Bucher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1267350/fullcredits#cast|title=The Pueblo Affair|date=19 January 1970 |website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2014, satirical military news site ''[[Duffel Blog]]'' ran a story suggesting President Obama would trade Seoul for the return of ''Pueblo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duffelblog.com/2014/06/uss-pueblo-north-korea-obama/ |title=Obama Trades Seoul To North Korea For Return Of USS Pueblo |author=Jay-B |website=[[Duffel Blog]] |date=7 June 2014 |accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Valletta International Baroque Festival''' is one of the biggest music festivals of [[Malta]]. The programmatic focus is on [[baroque music]].

== History ==
Since its establishment in 2013, the ''Valletta International Baroque Festival'' is held every year in January and organized by the direction of [[Manoel Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170828012231/http://www.visitmalta.com/de/event-details/2017-01/valletta-international-baroque-festival-9484 Valletta International Baroque Festival.] Information on the website Visitmalta.com. (English).&lt;/ref&gt; The concerts and opera performances are presented in several Baroque buildings in the city of [[Valletta]].

Among the famous artists who have performed at the festival are [[Mahan Esfahani]], [[Philippe Herreweghe]], [[Christophe Rousset]] and [[Jordi Savall]]. 

On 26 January 2017 [[Reuben Pace]]'s [[Concertino (composition)|Concertino]] for guitar, [[harpsichord]] and orchestra was premiered at Manoel Theatre under the slogan ''Inspired by Baroque'' with the [[Malta Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Michelle Castelletti]] as well as the soloists [[Johanna Beisteiner]] (guitar) and [[Joanne Camilleri]] (harpsichord).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170122/arts-entertainment/a-baroque-world-premiere.637264 A baroque world premiere.] Article by Iggy Fenech, [[Times of Malta]], 22 January 2017. (English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://operalounge.de/features/musikszene-festivals/malta-is-more Malta is more.] Article by Bernd Hoppe on the website of the magazine Opera Lounge, January 2017. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[world premiere]] during the ''Valletta International Baroque Festival'' and signaled an artistic expansion of the festival's programme to contemporary works inspired by baroque music.

[[Image:Ethel Smyth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Ethel Smyth]], who is played in the opera by a [[baritone]]]]'''''Violet''''' is a 2005 [[opera]] by [[Roger Scruton]] to a [[libretto]]  by the composer, based on the biography of [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] by her great-niece, Jessica Douglas-Home. The composer has said that "it tells the remarkable story of this woman who lived with four men – it was a story about the history of music, the history of England, about sex, and the difference between the old culture of sex and the new one, and how it all came together in the life of this peculiar woman".&lt;ref&gt;Dehn (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The two-act opera was given the first of two performances on 30 November 2005 at [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] in London, directed by Tess Gibbs and conducted by Clive Timms.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt;

==Background==
Scruton is better known as a writer and philosopher, and is largely self-taught as a composer.&lt;ref name="Sir Roger Scruton website"&gt;Sir Roger Scruton website&lt;/ref&gt; ''Violet'' is the second of Scruton's two operas – it was preceded by the one-act ''The Minister'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Review by Hilary West in ''[[The Times]]'', 6 May 1998, cited in Roger Scruton website (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Times]]' critic Hilary Finch, Scruton's first opera was influenced by [[Benjamin Britten]],&lt;ref name="Sir Roger Scruton website"/&gt; whereas according to a review by [[David Conway (music historian)|David Conway]], ''Violet'' is influenced by [[Janáček]], a composer Scruton is known to admire.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt; The score includes a number of references to music of other composers (including [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Wagner]]), as well as to [[folk music|folksong]].&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

The opera is based on the life of the [[harpsichord|harpsichordist]] Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, who is described in [[Grove Music Online]] as follows: "A woman of wealth and social standing (somewhat imperilled by her irregular private life), she did not lead a very active public professional life, but made a considerable impression on the intellectual and artistic circles of the day".&lt;ref&gt;Salter (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; The composer has written "In Violet’s world high culture, eccentric life-style, and aristocratic manners achieved a never-to-be-repeated synthesis. And when that world was swept away by the First World War, a part of the English soul was lost".&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the programme note of the premiere performance, ''Violet'' epitomises "the sad magnificence of human folly".&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;Conway (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast of the opera includes Violet, her husband Gordon (with whom she had a ''[[mariage blanc]]'') and a circle of relatives and friends including the [[lesbian]] composer [[Ethel Smyth]] (whose role is sung by a [[baritone]]) and three of Violet's male admirers.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The opera is set in the Gloucestershire home of the Woodhouses, [[Nether Lypiatt Manor]]. Jessica (in the present day), reading her great-aunt's papers, recreates the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] world of Violet and her 'husbands' – Gordon, Max Labouchere, Bill Barrington (later 10th [[Viscount Barrington]]), Dennis Tollemache and Ethel. The characters extol Violet and dine together. In the second act we learn that Max has died in the trenches in [[World War I]]. 

The ''ménage'' appears not to have been sexless, but acording to the composer/librettist, Violet had a dream in which "love means purity and passion stops at the garden gate".&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt; 
Jessica, mourning what she sees as the loss of an innocent world, decides to sell the house.&lt;ref name=Conway/&gt;

The '''Wonder Dream Concert''' was an historic [[concert]] held on October 4, 1975, at the [[Independence Park (Jamaica)|National Stadium]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. The concert was headlined by [[Stevie Wonder]] who was joined on the bill by [[Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers]] and his former bandmates [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]]. The concert is sometimes known as the '''Wailers Reunion Show''', as it was the first time the original Wailers had performed together since 1973 and the last time they ever would.

The concert was a [[benefit concert]] for the [[Jamaican Institute for the Blind]] and was opened by Third World. [[Harold Melvin &amp; The Bluenotes]] were scheduled to play but did not show &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iration.com/wailers The Wailers News]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Stevie Wonder's encore, Stevie called for Bob to join him on stage and they played "[[I Shot The Sheriff]]" and "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" together. Another notable moment was the last performance of the original Wailers' first hit "[[Simmer Down]]", originally from 1964.

The tracks the Wailers played were (in this order):

* [[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Rastaman Chant]]
* Nice Time

* [[Talkin' Blues|You Can't Blame The Youth]]
* [[Legalize It|Whatcha Gonna Do?]]
* [[Natty Dread|So Jah Seh]]
* [[No Woman, No Cry]]
* [[Rastaman Vibration|Jah Live]]

Stevie Wonder then sang with his band:

* Golden Lady / Too High
* You And I
* Too Shy To Say / As
* All In Love Is Fair
* [[Don't You Worry 'bout A Thing]]
* Drum Solo
* [[Boogie On Reggae Woman]]
* [[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]
* Earth Angel
* [[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]] / [[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]] / [[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]] / [[Respect (song)|Respect]] / [[What'd I Say (song)|What'd I Say]]
* [[My Cherie Amour (song)|My Cherie Amour]]
* [[Fingertips (song)|Fingertips]]
* [[You Haven't Done Nothin']]
* [[Living for the City]]
* [[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]

Then the aforementioned "[[I Shot The Sheriff]]" and "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" were performed as Wonder's encore.

[[File:WNBR Brighton 2011 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Brighton]] edition of the 2011 World Naked Bike Ride.]]

The '''World Naked Bike Ride''' ('''WNBR''') is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] in which participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dress code]] [[motto]] is "bare as you dare".&lt;ref name="BareDare"&gt;Artists for Peace/Artists Against War, a non-profit group in [[Vancouver]] popularized the motto "Bare as you Dare" and "Naked Bicycle people power" during their [http://www.worklessparty.org/ninemonkeys/past.htm Naked Bike Rides] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031025605/http://www.worklessparty.org/ninemonkeys/past.htm |date=2005-10-31 }} in 2003 that led up to and became early models for WNBR.&lt;/ref&gt; Full or partial [[nudity]] is encouraged, but not mandatory. There is no mandate to cover [[intimate part]]s; this is a distinguishing feature of the WNBR against other cycling events.

Creative expression is also encouraged to generate a fun and immersive atmosphere during the ride, capture the attention and imagination of the public and media, and make the experience more personalized and fulfilling for the riders. [[Body art]], such as [[body painting]], are common forms of creative expression, as well as costumes, [[art bike]]s, portable [[sound reinforcement system]]s (such as public address systems, [[Megaphone|bullhorns]] and [[boombox]]es) and musical instruments or other types of noisemaker.

Pre- and post-ride parties for WNBRs have become events unto themselves, often featuring musical bands, DJs, body painting, temporary structures/[[installation art]], political tabling, and catering. In addition to simply being able to ride clothes-free on community streets, some rides have established precedent by having body-painting parties, often involving numbers of naked riders and artists in high-visibility [[Urban park|municipal parks]].

This distinctive form of [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]], occasionally called ''Critical Ass'' in a WNBR context, is often described or categorised as a form of political protest, [[street theatre]], party-on-wheels, [[streaking]], [[public nudity]] and [[Nude recreation|clothing-optional recreation]], and thus attracts a wide range of participants.

==History==

[[File:World Naked Bike Ride - Zaragoza.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Zaragoza]] and [[Vancouver]] hosted the first NBR. Pictured are participants in the 2009 WNBR in the Spanish city.]]

In 2003 [[Conrad Schmidt]] conceived the World Naked Bike Ride after organising the Naked Bike Rides of the group Artists for Peace/Artists Against War (AFP/AAW)&lt;ref name="AAW"&gt;Artists for Peace/Artists Against War's archived [http://www.artistsagainstwar.org web page] is currently hosted by The [[Work Less Party of British Columbia]]&lt;/ref&gt; which had taken place in [[Vancouver]], Canada starting in 2002; this and other high-profile political and media events led to the creation of the [[Work Less Party of British Columbia]].

WNBR rapidly started to come to life through collaborations with activist groups and individuals around the world. The first WNBR event in 2004 was a collaboration between the WNBR group riding on 12 June and ''Manifestación Ciclonudista'' in Spain riding on 19 June, establishing a precedent as a  [[Solstice|solstitial]] Saturday observance. Since that time rides have also taken place in February and March (mainly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]). A smaller number of rides have taken place at other times of the year.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Before June 2004, two independent organizations — AFP/AAW and ''Manifestación Ciclonudista'' — had been organising very similar political events with virtually identical messages of protesting [[Energy security|oil dependency]]. Despite having similar political messages neither of these groups knew of the existence of the other until collaboration began many months before the first WNBR event.

Initially the message of the WNBR was protesting against oil dependency and celebrating the power and individuality of the human body. In 2006, there was a shift towards simplifying the message and focusing on cycling advocacy. While the ride does include and appeal to participants from social nudity circles, the ride is not focused on promoting social nudity directly as much as cycling.

The 2004 WNBR saw events in 28 cities, in ten countries on four continents.&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite" /&gt; By 2010, WNBR had expanded to stage rides in 74 cities, in 17 countries, from the United States to the United Kingdom and [[Hungary]] to [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite" /&gt;

Prior to the World Naked Bike ride in 2004 there were many organizations organizing naked bike rides. In Germany naked bike rides were regularly organized by FKK organizations ([[Freikörperkultur]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In Seattle naked bike rides were organized by the Fremont riders.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In Spain rides were organized by the Ciclonudista. In Canada naked rides were regularly organized by Artists Against War.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Issues==
[[File:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demonstrators gathered outside a courthouse on 17 February 2005 to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), [[Auckland]]'s 2005 WNBR organiser]]

===Sharing the road===

Opposition to large [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]-type events may argue that they induce [[traffic congestion]]. To counter, supporters may suggest: "We are not ''stopping'' traffic, we ''are'' traffic." Critical Mass and other "biketivist" groups promote awareness of cyclists; many cyclists are seriously injured or killed on the highways. Participants advocate "[[living street]]s" and [[bicycle-friendly]] communities.

===Health, efficiency and sustainability===
Participants believe that many communities were not designed to take advantage of bicycles, which can be considered the most efficient means of personal transport. Instead, they believe, society has subordinated community values to the requirements of expensive, dangerous, loud and polluting vehicles. Oil has become a treasured commodity &amp;mdash; associated by some with the costs of war and [[climate change]].

Like Critical Mass, WNBR aims to promote bicycle transportation, [[renewable energy]], recreation, walkable communities, and [[Environmental movement|environmentally responsible]], [[Sustainability|sustainable]] solutions to living in the 21st century. Participants celebrate the many benefits of a [[Car-free movement|car-free]] lifestyle: reduced [[Pollution|emissions]], free parking, and overall a greater feeling of [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]].

===WNBR approach===
[[File:London WNBR 2011 3.jpg|thumb|right|Cycling is not the only method of travel at the WNBR: an [[Inline skating|in-line skater]] is pictured at the London ride in 2011]]
Some cycling activists{{Who|date=June 2012}} have criticised WNBR for trivialising the issues of oil dependency, cyclists' access to roads, and car culture. Organisers may counter that the concepts of having fun and public outreach are not mutually exclusive. Creative advocacy stimulates people to contemplate the issues. They argue that by occupying lanes intended for cars and not for bicycles, by tossing their clothes and rejecting body shame, they are protesting a way of life which should be abandoned.

===Body-positive values, body image and offense===

The ride has been criticized by some because WNBR largely involves participants who are [[Nudity|naked]] or [[Topfree equality|topfree]]. Some who are offended by nudity or topfreedom believe that it should take place in designated areas or times only, and that WNBR participants seek to engage in [[exhibitionism]] or even express [[Paraphilia|sexually deviant]] intent.

Participants claim that non-sexualized, colorful and creative nakedness in repressed societies is a refreshing way to remind people of some fundamental freedoms of life that people have collectively handed over without really thinking of the consequences. They claim that the WNBR is about body-positive values: living a healthy life in tune with, not against, the environment; respecting the natural beauty and diversity of human bodies; establishing and projecting a positive [[self-image]]; and rejecting shame. Organizers feel that WNBR is not just a ride against oil dependency; it is a ride for self-empowerment.

===Legality of public nudity===

The policing of the ride varies according to local laws, local police policy, and local cultural expectations.  At some events, police support and facilitate the event.  Police have provided traffic control at road junctions for the [[London]] (until 2009), [[Brighton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Helsinki, Finland|Helsinki,]] and [[Brussels, Belgium|Brussels]] rides.  At other events police take a more neutral stance, simply monitoring proceedings. In other cases, such as in [[Ottawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/travel/Ottawa+bike+ride+naked/4932584/story.html|title=Ottawa bike ride not-so naked|author=|date=|work=Ottawa Citizen|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615054837/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/travel/Ottawa+bike+ride+naked/4932584/story.html|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; police have attempted to stop the ride or have attempted to encourage riders to wear some level of clothing.

====Arrests and charges====

Arrests during WNBR events are rare. Two male riders were arrested during the 2005 WNBR in [[North Conway, New Hampshire|North Conway]], New Hampshire, and charged with "indecent exposure and lewdness". The two riders agreed to having the charges reduced to "disorderly conduct" and paid a $300 fine, the majority of which was paid for by the WNBR Legal Defense Fund.&lt;ref name="NorthConway1"&gt;More information about the case can be found at [http://www.worldnakedbikeride.org/nh/ WNBR North Conway website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218161418/http://worldnakedbikeride.org/nh/ |date=2005-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six male riders were charged with [[public indecency]] during the 2005 WNBR [[Chicago]] ride and later prosecuted with sentences ranging from fines and non-expungeable conviction to three months of court supervision.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  In 2007 during the first World Naked Bike ride in Denver, Colorado police surrounded the bike riders and wrote several people tickets.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/world-naked-bike-ride-denver-5847480|title=World Naked Bike Ride - Denver|first=Crystal|last=Preston-Watson|date=11 June 2007|work=westword.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the WNBR held on June 12, 2010, two males were arrested by campus police at [[Western Washington University]] in [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2010/06/14/1479718/whatcom-county-jail-report-for.html|title=Whatcom County Jail Report|author=|date=|work=Bellingham Herald|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two riders were arrested in New York City in 2014 for "lewdness and indecent exposure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benjaminheimshepard.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-hard-rains-gonna-fall-vision-zero.html|title=play and ideas: A Hard Rains Gonna Fall: Vision zero clothing ride 2014|first=Benjamin|last=Shepard|date=13 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====WNBR's successful cultural and legal precedent====
{{quote|''I have had many fun encounters with police officers; one of the most interesting was when this grumpy police officer came up to me and told me that he thought that what I was wearing was indecent. I looked him straight in the eye and told him that I thought his opinion was indecent. I was right; and no, I was not arrested.''|[[Conrad Schmidt]], speaking in [[Vancouver]].}}

The majority of WNBR events have encountered few cultural and legal problems.

Laws on nudity are often vague and difficult to enforce. As WNBR is clothing-optional, organizers urge those who are uncomfortable going naked or who fear legal scuffles simply not to go fully nude. Participants have used body paint, [[liquid latex]], strategically placed items, underwear and duct tape to cover [[intimate part]]s. For example, flesh-colored bodysuits with exaggerated body parts were used in [[Seattle]] in 1999 by Fremont Arts Council members to spoof the [[Solstice Cyclists]] in the [[Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant|Summer Solstice Parade]]. Organizers encourage creativity and imagination, whether the participants go fully nude or not.

Some cities have restrictions on nudity in public areas, and some cultures have harsh restrictions on [[public nudity]]. However, the laws of most [[Progressivism|progressive]] societies are written to discourage activities which are intended to shock or offend. Many laws on nudity hinge on a concept of [[indecent exposure]]. Participants may argue that there is nothing indecent about the naked human body and counter that the only thing that is indecent are laws on nudity.

[[Simon Oosterman]], the organizer of the 2005 WNBR in [[Auckland]], and the first to be arrested during a WNBR event, is credited with going further and refocusing the issue on oil-dependency. He urged: "Stop the indecent exposure to vehicle emissions."&lt;ref name="Oosterman1"&gt;Simon Oosterman printed this on a protest banner as documented on [http://www.wnbr.enzyme.org.nz/auckland.html Enzyme's WNBR web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214030535/http://www.wnbr.enzyme.org.nz/auckland.html |date=2005-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oosterman later defended against a charge of indecent exposure in the Auckland district court in 2006; after hearing evidence, the judge dismissed the charge.

Riders are encouraged to "ride loud and be proud". Organizers only allow rides to be organized in public areas for maximum outreach, not in established or ghettoized areas. Events are promoted at the grassroots level, often using Internet resources such as discussion groups, web sites, blogs and online journals and also by placing advertisements in local, non-mainstream newspapers and progressive journals.
